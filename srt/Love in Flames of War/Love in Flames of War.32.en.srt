[Episode 32]

21
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:50,010
Third Brother has locked himself inside and won't see anybody.

22
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,990
Now, Wei Zhenliang's troops are attacking us.

23
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,720
I'm not sure how much longer our soldiers, along with two Infantry Regiments, can hold out.

24
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,810
Let's give Third Brother some more time to recover.

25
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:04,140
Who do you think it could be? Someone that has to separate Third Brother from his wife and baby?

26
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,540
Do you have any clues?

27
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,410
Look. We're already in a bad mood.

28
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,700
Plus, the bad weather, it makes me even more upset.

29
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,160
Advisor Mo. Regiment Commander Xu. It's time for lunch.

30
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,690
What's the need for lunch? Didn't I tell you

31
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,590
- I'm not eating? Take them away!
- Yes, Sir.

32
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,980
Seriously?

33
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,920
I was about to leave.

34
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,050
But it suddenly started raining heavily.

35
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,010
So I waited for a while. When the rain stopped,

36
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:49,330
I left the Xiao Residence.

37
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,410
I think I have a clue.

38
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:56,240
Do you recall Doctor Sun's testimonies?

39
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,300
Yes.

40
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:04,000
Then do you recall what the maid, Xiu'er, said?

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,610
Xiu'er?

42
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,130
That day, I was making Osmanthus Jelly in the kitchen for Third Young Madam.

43
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,120
Nanny Liu and Nanny Jiang can be my alibi.

44
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,100
That's right. I can confirm that.

45
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,200
The three of us were in the kitchen that day.

46
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,020
She delivered the Osmanthus Jelly right after 3:30 p.m.

47
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,520
I don't recall her saying anything suspicious.

48
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,380
If she sent over the cake at 3:30,

49
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,060
then based on Doctor Sun's testimonies,

50
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,350
it was raining heavily at that moment.

51
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,600
But if it was raining heavily,

52
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,960
she could not be walking outside with both her hands carrying the cake.

53
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,110
She would definitely get wet.

54
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,360
But the two nannies said she only left the kitchen after 3:30 p.m.

55
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,310
The clock showed it was 3:30 p.m.

56
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,560
But it wasn't raining at that moment.

57
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,920
So there's only one possibility.

58
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,240
Are you sure it was after 3:30 p.m. when Xiu'er left the kitchen?

59
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,010
- Yes, we're sure.
- Xiu'er reminded us

60
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,970
that it was time. So I took a look at the clock in particular.

61
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,280
Yes, we looked at the clock in particular.

62
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,360
- This clock?
- Yes.

63
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,230
As you expected.

64
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,430
Looks like Xiu'er did advance the clock for half an hour.

65
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,940
- What did you say? Xiu'er?
- Yes.

66
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,710
How's that possible?

67
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,250
She appears to be respectful and thoughtful.

68
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,940
But Xiu'er and Lin Hangjing are not at odds.

69
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,720
Why would she do that?

70
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,120
Looks like we have to get Xiu'er here and ask her in person.

71
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,380
Yunyi, get Xiu'er here.

72
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,750
Yes.

73
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:02,470
Something bad happened! Xiu'er just hung herself!

74
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,730
Don't be afraid.

75
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,330
Seventh Aunt, this is a letter we found in Xiu'er's room.

76
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,270
Do you want to take a look first?

77
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,920
Read it.

78
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,190
"Xiu'er has committed unforgivable sins and is aware that the truth has been discovered.

79
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,190
I can't free myself of the crime even if I die ten thousand times.

80
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:59,090
But my conscience would be disturbed if I didn't tell this to Third Master and Seventh Madam.

81
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:03,260
Me putting abortifacient in Third Young Madam's antiabortifacient

82
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,180
was..."

83
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,170
Read it.

84
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,850
"The order from Fourth Lady."

85
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,860
- Nonsense!
- It was you!

86
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,520
- You killed my lady!
- It was not me!

87
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,960
You never liked our lady from the beginning!

88
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,140
And it was you who spread the rumor in order to set her up!

89
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,060
Now my lady is gone!

90
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,610
- I'll fight you with my life!
- How rude of you! Stop your nonsense!

91
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,140
- Let go of me!
- Shuyi!

92
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,930
I want to hear it from you now. What the hell happened?

93
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:42,040
Seventh Aunt, it really wasn't me who killed Hangjing's baby. You have to trust me.

94
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,780
Seventh Aunt, I trust Shuyi. It can't be her.

95
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,820
What happened?

96
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,010
- What happened?
- Sister Fengqi, help me.

97
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,240
I really didn't do it.

98
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:03,070
What exactly happened?

99
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,590
Reporting!

100
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,390
We also found this underneath Xiu'er's bed.

101
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,610
That ruby bracelet...

102
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,970
isn't that Fourth Lady's?

103
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,710
Now the evidence is there.

104
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,020
- What else do you have to explain?
- Okay, okay.

105
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,900
I didn't pay her that! I lost that bracelet a long time ago! I really have no idea what happened!

106
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,290
It's okay. Shuyi, stop.

107
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,930
Seventh Aunt, I think

108
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,300
- even if it were Shuyi who did this...
- It's not me!

109
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,420
- It's really not...
- She must have been acting on impulse.

110
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,270
Don't be angry. Just forgive her.

111
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,350
No. If you forgive her,

112
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,430
- My Lady will never rest in peace!
- Jin Xiang!

113
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,230
- Seventh Madam!
- Everyone shut up!

114
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,840
Yunyi, bring her down now.

115
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,160
- Don't touch me!
- Jin Xiang, come with me.

116
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,590
- My Lady...
- Xiao Shuyi, stop messing around.

117
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,950
I understand if you are haughty and spoiled in your daily life.

118
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,390
But how could you do something so callous as that?

119
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,590
How can you not feel bad about what you've done to Hangjing and your brother?

120
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,950
Seventh Aunt! I really didn't do it! Why don't you believe me?

121
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,230
How can I believe you? How do you explain all these?

122
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,830
I can't make you listen to me.

123
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,910
Let your father decide when he comes back!

124
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,260
- Seventh Madam!
- It's fine, Shuyi.

125
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,540
It's okay.

126
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,190
Fengqi, what happened to Lin Hangjing,

127
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,140
are you involved in it?

128
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,200
Father.

129
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,080
What are you talking about?

130
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,920
How can I be involved?

131
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,520
How much longer are you going to hide the truth from me?

132
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,050
I know you were not happy.

133
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,940
But I never thought you'd...

134
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,580
It was one life after another!

135
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,390
Fengqi, based on Xiao Beichen's personality,

136
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:53,350
he will investigate until he finds out the truth. How will you protect yourself by then?

137
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,460
Father,

138
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,350
it has nothing to do with me.

139
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,480
Why would I be scared? Why do I need to protect myself?

140
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,390
You have to come with me today.

141
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,050
To apologize to the Xiao family.

142
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,290
- Come with me!
- I'm not going!

143
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,010
You can shoot me to death, but I'll never kneel down and ask for forgiveness!

144
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,680
Fengqi!

145
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,010
Father, I'm telling you.

146
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,540
I've filmed so many movies.

147
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,140
I've worn wedding dresses so many times.

148
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,330
For just once, I want to wear the wedding dress for myself

149
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,150
and get married to the one I love. Am I wrong?

150
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:37,070
And that Lin Hangjing. She was pregnant with Mu Zizheng's illegitimate child.

151
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:41,200
My getting rid of it for Third Brother, was I wrong?

152
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,040
Tell me! Was I wrong? How could I be wrong?

153
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,080
If Lin Hangjing was pregnant with an illegitimate child,

154
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,340
why would you be so anxious to let the baby die?

155
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:57,450
If the baby didn't die, then Lin Hangjing would not have died either!

156
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:03,000
Fengqi, come with me to the Xiao family.

157
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,060
Our whole family will apologize to them.

158
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,990
It's still in time. We still have a chance. Do you know?

159
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,450
- No. Father! Father!
- Come with me!

160
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,480
Father! I can't go.

161
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,580
I-If I admit it, there will be no chance for Third Brother and me.

162
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,230
- My life will be ruined!
- Come with me!

163
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,100
I'm not going!

164
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,430
Father! Father!

165
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:33,300
Father!

166
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,610
Father, wake up! Father!

167
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,060
Father!

168
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,720
Won't you stop? You're almost tearing the house apart.

169
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,890
I still don't believe that Shuyi did it!

170
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:09,530
That's pointless. Do you have any evidence that she is innocent?

171
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,440
No. I have to talk to Third Brother.

172
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,660
Don't you know how Third Brother is right now? And you're creating more trouble for him?

173
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,660
No, but Shuyi definitely didn't do this.

174
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,920
I'm so pissed off.

175
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,290
It's true that Shuyi is haughty and mischievous.

176
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:27,400
But she wouldn't do anything as vicious as that.

177
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,010
I don't care. She definitely didn't do it.

178
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,970
I can guarantee with my life.

179
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,910
How much longer are you going to lock yourself in here?

180
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,690
Wei Zhenliang's Power Army is pushing towards Jinyang.

181
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,670
Although our Infantry Regiment

182
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:29,060
has been defending against them for over half a month outside of Jinyang,

183
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,400
they're expecting their commander-in-chief.

184
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,330
Once the Power Army breaks our line of defense,

185
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:39,960
not only Jinyang, but also Qinguan and Xinping

186
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,260
and even Beixin will be at risk.

187
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,870
You stand up. Stand up!

188
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,020
Stand here! Look at me!

189
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,130
Look at me!

190
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:00,970
Xiao Beichen, have you already forgotten what you said

191
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,110
when you were at the battleground for the first time at military school?

192
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,220
You said you also wanted to be

193
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,840
someone who could defend others from being slaughtered.

194
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,590
Have you forgotten your vows? Look at you now.

195
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:20,730
You're just hiding here, without eating, drinking, or sleeping.

196
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,380
I think you've given up on your life.

197
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,930
That's not bad. Less pain for you.

198
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,130
But once the Power Army starts attacking,

199
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,130
what happens to the people in your territory?

200
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:38,650
What happens to the soldiers of the Ying Army?

201
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:42,310
I can't just watch them shed their blood for nothing

202
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,680
just because you're drowned in pain!

203
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:50,080
You're a soldier, and you have responsibility on your shoulders that matter more than anything.

204
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:54,470
Instructor Du, please don't force me.

205
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,810
I have to force you!

206
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,410
You have to give me an answer!

207
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,430
The soldiers sacrifice their lives and shed their blood on the battlefield,

208
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,190
and not one of them has ever suffered from the pain of losing their families!

209
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:10,420
They're all fathers, husbands, and sons!

210
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:14,220
When a bird's nest is overturned, no egg can stay unbroken.

211
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:19,100
When a country is about to be shattered, not one family can live in peace.

212
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,850
Xiao Beichen, I've told you before.

213
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,740
You're the commander of an army.

214
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,810
If you keep drowning yourself in your own sorrow,

215
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,190
then just take my advice

216
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,450
and dismiss all of the soldiers.

217
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,170
It's better than keeping them here to wait for death.

218
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,300
Old Zheng, what happened?

219
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,550
You were all right a few days ago, able to speak and move.

220
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,720
Why have you suddenly become like this?

221
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,380
Mother, don’t worry too much.

222
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,580
The doctor said that Father should be all right.

223
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:04,470
And father loves me so much since I was a child.

224
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,120
He won’t leave us behind.

225
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,260
Old Zheng, did you hear that?

226
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,480
Our daughter said that you won’t leave us behind.

227
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,370
Say something!

228
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,090
What happened?

229
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:18,570
- Miss Fengqi.
- Move!

230
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,000
Old Zheng, talk to me!

231
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,210
How can you just lie down like that? Talk to me!

232
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,640
- What is it?
- The Fourth Lady of the Xiao family sent someone to ask

233
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,480
if you have time to dine with her tomorrow.

234
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,960
She said she is very upset and wants to take a breather.

235
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,250
Old Zheng, talk to me!

236
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,800
Talk to me!

237
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,590
Tell her that I do have time.

238
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,090
Yes.

239
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,760
[Huaxing Hotel]

240
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,620
Shuyi, sorry I’m late.

241
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,460
It’s okay.

242
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,660
How’s it going with you?

243
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,610
I’ve been quite upset lately.

244
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,870
I just don’t understand it.

245
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:10,750
I’ve never had any connection with that Xiu’er.

246
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,700
Why would she frame me?

247
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,010
Don’t worry about it. Didn’t Seventh Aunt say?

248
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,620
We’ll wait for Uncle Xiao to come back and make a decision.

249
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,450
It will be fine.

250
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:24,920
It’s just that I don’t understand.

251
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:29,610
Who exactly in the family has such a vicious heart?

252
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,920
In order to kill Hangjing’s baby,

253
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,660
that person even asked Xiu’er to blame it all on me!

254
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:41,040
That's right. Who could it be?

255
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,110
I also couldn't understand.

256
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:50,770
Until I found this in Xiu'er's room.

257
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:59,690
I remember that this earring belongs to you, Sister Fengqi.

258
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,130
But why would it show up in Xiu’er’s room?

259
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:06,950
As far as I know, you never go to the servants’ room.

260
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,980
Right.

261
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,230
Why would it show up in Xiu’er’s room?

262
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,920
I was looking for this earring for quite some time.

263
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:22,940
Shuyi, do you think Xiu’er might have stolen this from me?

264
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,680
Really?

265
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:30,860
Then, how do you explain my ruby bracelet?

266
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,760
Shuyi.

267
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,310
You're not suspecting me, are you?

268
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,850
I thought about it again.

269
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:45,680
Besides Xiaozhuo, you're the only one who has access to my room.

270
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,690
Xiaozhuo has been my maid for so many years.

271
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,370
She would never do anything to hurt me.

272
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:53,430
She wouldn’t hurt you, would I?

273
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:01,240
For so many years, we've been like sisters.

274
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:06,620
Does this mean nothing to you at all?

275
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,600
Right.

276
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,900
We’ve been sisters for so many years.

277
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,230
Hangjing and I are such close friends.

278
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,020
Is there any reason that I'd want to hurt her?

279
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,170
Of course, you have a reason to do so.

280
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:43,230
Zheng Fengqi, we’ve figured out everything you’ve done.

281
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,200
Stop acting.

282
00:19:55,310 --> 00:20:02,070
So, this was a trap to set me up.

283
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:09,430
Are you trying to declare me guilty just for an earring?

284
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:13,140
Talking about setting people up, we’re far from being as good as you, Lady Zheng.

285
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:17,980
One plot fails, comes another one. Every time, you’ve tried to take her life.

286
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,360
What do you mean?

287
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,640
Why are you showing me a photo of Qiao Jiang?

288
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,550
Qiao Jiang? Isn’t his name Jiang Zhiqi?

289
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,980
Do you know whose earring this is?

290
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,410
Isn’t this Sister Fengqi’s?

291
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,330
What?

292
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,710
Are you sure?

293
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:53,320
Yes, I’ve seen her wearing it quite a few times. Why do you have it?

294
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,130
We found this in Xiu’er’s room.

295
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,870
What?

296
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:02,590
I’m suspecting what Xiu’er did might be related to Zheng Fengqi.

297
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,200
Yeah.

298
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,930
How’s that possible? Sister Fengqi

299
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,310
has always been close to Hangjing.

300
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,180
And she was always trying to make things work between Hangjing and Third Brother.

301
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,200
Why would she hurt Hangjing?

302
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,260
But she’s a lady of privilege. Why would she show up in a maid’s room?

303
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,500
And they have nothing to do with each other.

304
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:29,010
Shuyi, I need you to do me a favor.

305
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:35,120
Is this the girl you mentioned that Jiang Zhiqi was pursuing?

306
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,140
Yes.

307
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,740
She’s the girl that Jiang Zhiqi was pursuing.

308
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,060
No matter it’s Qiao Jiang, or Mu Zizheng,

309
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,870
or forcing Third Sister-in-law to leave,

310
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:56,350
you plotted everything by yourself.

311
00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:01,200
Do you think you can hide it from everybody after you’ve done all these?

312
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,790
Do you have anything else to explain?

313
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:10,230
Judging from Third Brother’s tone, I’m condemned to death already.

314
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,010
What else can I say?

315
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,770
It’s true.

316
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,150
I know this man called Qiao Jiang.

317
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,800
No.

318
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,350
His real name is Jiang Zhiqi.

319
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:29,590
Unfortunately, he’s a useless man

320
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:33,950
who achieved nothing and ruined my plan.

321
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,990
So it really is you.

322
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,720
Why would you do that?

323
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:51,190
I've been treating you like my real sister all these years.

324
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:57,620
And for you? You deceived me, you used me.

325
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,600
You even ordered Xiu'er to frame me.

326
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:05,290
Xiao Shuyi, can you blame me?

327
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:10,310
You can only blame yourself for being too innocent.

328
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,030
We grew up together.

329
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:20,580
Our family treated you like a real family. What are you asking for?

330
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,540
What am I asking for?

331
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,680
We were childhood sweethearts.

332
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,130
In order to be your match,

333
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:35,870
I worked very hard to make myself become an outstanding person.

334
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,630
In the end,

335
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,270
you betrayed me.

336
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:46,430
You chose to marry another person.

337
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,220
Third Brother. Come.

338
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:57,850
Look at all my scars.

339
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,320
Whenever I think of...

340
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,870
you being married to another person,

341
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:11,310
my heart is in so much pain that it's hard to breathe.

342
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:16,480
I don't understand. I love you so much,

343
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,780
why would you pick her instead?

344
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,340
How am I worse than her?

345
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:32,090
Do you think you said all these, I won't dare to kill you?

346
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:35,230
I really think that I loved the wrong person.

347
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,600
You kill me.

348
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:48,380
I'm willing to die in your hand.

349
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,060
Deputy Chief Commander Xiao! Deputy Chief Commander Xiao!

350
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,970
Please have mercy on me!

351
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,040
Deputy Chief Commander Xiao!

352
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:00,420
Deputy Chief Commander Xiao! Deputy Chief Commander Xiao!

353
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:04,180
I know my daughter has committed an unforgivable mistake.

354
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,200
But she is my blood-related child, she is my only daughter.

355
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,900
Third Master, I'm begging you!

356
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,460
I'm begging you! I'm begging you! Please forgive her.

357
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,190
I'm begging you to let her live.

358
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,730
Please! I'm begging you!

359
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,220
She committed an unforgivable sin!

360
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,930
Father. Mother. Please get up.

361
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,520
You don't need to beg him.

362
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,290
He can now taste this kind of feeling.

363
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:32,450
He deserves it! It's karma!

364
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,180
You...

365
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:36,920
Old Zheng.

366
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,080
Beichen, based on my brotherhood

367
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,440
with your father for 40 odd years,

368
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:49,170
please forgive my Fengqi.

369
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,200
I'm willing to surrender my life, my ten thousand troops

370
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,930
to your Xiao family.

371
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,780
Uncle Zheng.

372
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:01,840
Hangjing was everything to me.

373
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,690
It cannot be replaced by more soldiers and horses.

374
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:09,020
But Fengqi is everything to me.

375
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,650
Beichen, if she's dead,

376
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:14,520
I've no will to live.

377
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,110
She has to repay with her life. She must compensate Hangjing with her life.

378
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,780
Wait!

379
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,610
Hurry up!

380
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,700
Commander Xiao.

381
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,170
- Old Xiao.
- Commander Xiao. Commander Xiao.

382
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,290
Old Xiao!

383
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:40,520
Beichen, I heard everything about this.

384
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,530
Hangjing and the child...

385
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,180
were...

386
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:55,530
Zheng Fengqi deserves to die.

387
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:05,150
But, Beichen, please let her live.

388
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,970
I can't do that.

389
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:13,680
Zheng Fengqi is Uncle Zheng's only child.

390
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:18,140
If it wasn't him pulling me out from the mountain of bodies,

391
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,640
I wouldn't be me today.

392
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:26,670
That's why, with my life, I need to pay him back.

393
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,340
You're forcing me.

394
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,400
I'm pressuring you.

395
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:41,340
If you still consider me as your father.

396
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,210
You made your own decision.

397
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,770
Fengqi! Fengqi! How are you doing?

398
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:18,420
Fengqi! How's your ear? Fengqi!

399
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,200
Fengqi! Your ear!

400
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,420
Don't cry.

401
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:35,740
Take your daughter out of Beixin City and never come back again.

402
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:47,240
Fengqi! Fengqi!

403
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,490
Fire!

404
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,590
Fire!

405
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,360
Fire again!

406
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,000
Hide!

407
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,010
Hide quickly!

408
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:40,100
[Pinggu Kou]

409
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,520
32th Regiment Deputy Captain Xu Zijun is here to report our current battle status.

410
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,670
Go ahead.

411
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:55,700
After Weizhen Regiment's sudden attack to Jinyang, they were blocked by our troop at Qinguan Town, between Jinyang and Beixin.

412
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:01,190
Our troop has been holding the fort for three days and nights. The enemy cannot break through, but we also cannot fight back.

413
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,640
How much manpower do we have?

414
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,890
Approximately 2,000.

415
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:06,690
Instructor Du, take 5,000 top soldiers

416
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,750
and lay low in the forest around Pinggu Kou.

417
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:11,690
We need to do it in the night, and keep it low key.

418
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:12,920
Got it.

419
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,110
Commander, what do you mean by that?

420
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,500
Our troops will continue to defend against the enemy's attack.

421
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:23,330
If we play the war of attrition, Wei Zhenliang will be more anxious than us. They won't waste time

422
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:27,970
hanging on with us at Qin Gate. Pinggu Kou is famous for its natural barrier,

423
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:30,580
historically, generals will not send troops to defend that area.

424
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:34,730
I believe Wei Zhenliang will not think of that.

425
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:39,800
That's right.

426
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,240
So, Wei Zhenliang will definitely attack Pinggu Kou.

427
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,240
For this Qin Gate attack, I think they're trying to distract our attention.

428
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,030
Pinggu Kou is their ultimate target.

429
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:54,390
That's why we need to do the opposite.

430
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,400
Let's go!

431
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:02,690
Retreat! Retreat!

432
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:18,450
Oh no! We're trapped!

433
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,630
Retreat! Retreat!Quick!

434
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,200
Don't move! Don't move! Put your guns down.

435
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,760
Don't move! Put your guns down.

436
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,390
Quick! Squat down.

437
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:45,070
Squat down.

438
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:57,360
From here to here...

439
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,740
Report to Commander! Wei Zhenliang is retreating the Weizhen Regiment urgently back to Jinyang.

440
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,080
At this spot...

441
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,320
Pass on the order.

442
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,240
Set up emergency tents, then station ten miles away from Jinyang. Do not rush in.

443
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,770
Yes, Sir!

444
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,460
Third Brother.

445
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,830
We just kicked the Weizhen troops out, why don't we take this opportunity and move forward?

446
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:25,350
We won this time because of speed.

447
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:29,070
We might attack Wei Zhenliang unexpectedly.

448
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:33,850
However, they're doing this to preserve their power, that's why they urgently retreated 20 miles away.

449
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,320
If we move forward now,

450
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,730
I've the responsibility to tell you that

451
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:45,050
between Weizhen Regiment and us, the chance is only 50/50.

452
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,660
We've been waiting for so long

453
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:55,000
and finally, we received good news.

454
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,920
That's right. This Wei Zhenliang is an

455
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:04,070
outstanding young general.

456
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:07,740
He has support from the Japanese. He has lots of strong military supplies.

457
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,190
Our Beichen managing to take Jinyang back from their hands

458
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:13,470
is not easy.

459
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:16,450
Beichen is amazing, he has gone through so much.

460
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:19,270
He also brought the troops and won the battle.

461
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:24,430
You have also been busy inside and outside the family, thanks for your hard work.

462
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:27,340
I wonder if it's because I'm getting older,

463
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,800
lately, I've been thinking of Hangjing.

464
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,800
When I think of her, I can't sleep soundly.

465
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,690
I keep thinking about when she first came into our home.

466
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:39,380
At that time, I thought

467
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:42,380
the heavens gave us a daughter.

468
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,360
Such a good lady.

469
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,000
At the end, it didn't last.

470
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:53,660
We owe it to Hangjing. And even more to Tangsheng.

471
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,400
Commander.

472
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,220
Commander!

473
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,130
What’s the rush?

474
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:06,630
Chief Commander, Division Commander Zheng... is gone.

475
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:16,710
[Sound of sadness cannot make the clouds stay]
[Cries fly to the sky along with the wild cranes]

476
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:21,420
[Rest in Peace]

477
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:34,910
[Rest in Peace]

478
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:55,430
Old Zheng, all along our way, we’ve been through moments of life and death.

479
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:58,030
You never left me.

480
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,510
But now you’re gone.

481
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:05,580
And I didn’t even get a chance to speak to you.

482
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,270
Sister-in-law, please accept my condolences.

483
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:28,050
If there’s anything you need, please let me know.

484
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:03,000
Old Mo and Old Zheng,

485
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:06,220
you’re now both gone.

486
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:11,730
You’ve been following me

487
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,730
since you left Northeastern China.

488
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:20,470
We’ve been through freezing weather and starved together.

489
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:24,760
We’ve blocked bullets for each other.

490
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,620
Now you’re both gone.

491
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,430
Brothers, today we’ve taken Jinyang back from the enemy.

492
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,520
Deputy Chief Commander specifically said

493
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,190
that you can enjoy the meat as much as you want in this victory banquet!

494
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:19,160
We’ve got the number of casualties.

495
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:27,650
Instructor Du, sometimes I feel that the world is surreal.

496
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:33,370
I can still hear the roars of soldiers fighting,

497
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,310
but what I see is such a scene of serenity.

498
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:40,630
Legitimacy belongs to the victor. This has never changed since ancient times.

499
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:45,000
The place is covered all over with wounds and scars, and people are suffering from their lives.

500
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,930
Then, what exactly is the purpose of winning?

501
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:51,430
If peace can solve the problem,

502
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,760
nobody would choose to fight a war.

503
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:58,180
If we give up on wars,

504
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:02,320
then some problems will never get resolved.

505
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,570
Now our country is falling apart, and we’re facing domestic turmoil and foreign aggression at the same time.

506
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:11,430
If we want to end this, we have to unite the whole country.

507
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,060
Wars are inevitable.

508
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:19,020
We have to sweep away all obstacles in the way,

509
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,600
in order to create a new world.

510
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:26,250
A new world?

511
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,350
Yes.

512
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:33,910
It’s like the heavy snow falling before our eyes, covered with bloodstains.

513
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:37,990
New life can only be born after that.

514
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:53,250
Each of us has our own duty.

515
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:58,080
Your duty is to fight every war well and defend every city.

516
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,380
It will be the biggest help to these children.

517
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:13,100
- Third Brother.
- Zijun.

518
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:02,140
Mother, what do you mean?

519
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:05,440
I’ve packed your luggage in this suitcase.

520
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:11,480
Please leave. From now on,

521
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,270
the Zheng family will have nothing to do with you.

522
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:17,420
You’re asking me to leave?

523
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:21,440
Your father...

524
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:27,380
died with regret. The ten thousand soldiers and horses

525
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:30,360
have been the pride of his lifetime.

526
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,030
The glory of his lifetime.

527
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:36,420
But for you, in the end,

528
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:39,610
he kept not even one soldier.

529
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:45,700
You’re too selfish. You don’t know how much

530
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:49,080
it hurt your father.

531
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,960
It’s not my fault. My father was muddled.

532
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,590
He traded the troops of the Zheng family for Lin Hangjing’s life.

533
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:59,150
He was not doing this for anyone else!

534
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:04,330
He was doing this just for you. All his life, he's treated you like his treasure.

535
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:06,600
And in the end, he sacrificed his life for you.

536
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,160
Your jealousy is burning.

537
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,150
Look at you! You’ve lost your humanity because your jealousy has burned you.

538
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:18,830
Now the Zheng family can’t offer you anything else.

539
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,890
Leave now!

540
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:26,480
Let me quietly

541
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,150
guard your father here.

542
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:40,790
Father, I’ve lost something that belongs to the Zheng family.

543
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:43,650
I’ll definitely return it.

544
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,720
Madam, why are you doing this?

545
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,900
How can Lady survive on her own after she leaves?

546
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,910
She’s committed such a terrible crime.

547
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:20,410
She’ll die here sooner or later if she stays.

548
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:25,930
She can survive anywhere. Anywhere but

549
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:28,120
Beixin City.

550
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,830
Madam!

551
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:50,430
♫ Who is looking forward to the spring breeze? ♫

552
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:55,550
♫ Who is staring at the moving flowers? ♫

553
00:43:55,550 --> 00:44:00,740
♫ Who is watching the galaxy in the summer night ♫

554
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:07,290
♫ Who remembers a shooting star going by in a moment? ♫

555
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:13,080
♫ Who is afraid of heartbreak, denies the heartbeat? ♫

556
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:18,050
♫ Allow loneliness to smear the other’s protective coloration ♫

557
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:23,370
♫ Who would be willing to pass the other like this ♫

558
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:30,080
♫ I also want to be a shooting star to make you warm ♫

559
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:37,460
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

560
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:43,030
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

561
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:48,670
♫ At least the flight will be smooth ♫

562
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:54,310
♫ Waiting for a promise my whole life ♫

563
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:59,940
♫ I cherish even the short-lived happiness ♫

564
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:05,460
♫ Leave some tenderness to the years ♫

565
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:11,200
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

566
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:16,810
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫

567
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:22,400
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

568
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,960
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

569
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:37,960
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

570
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:48,520
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫
