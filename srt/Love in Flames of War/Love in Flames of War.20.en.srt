One!

22
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,130
Two!

23
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,390
Go!

24
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,150
Go!

25
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,350
It’s Third Master’s troops!

26
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,120
Father!

27
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,010
Commander!

28
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,280
Young Master.

29
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,130
- Father!
- Commander got shot!

30
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,050
I’m fine, I'm fine. Why are you here?

31
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,280
I heard they bombed this area, that’s why we’re here to assist.

32
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,910
You’re here at the perfect time.

33
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,180
Father, let us take care of the rest.

34
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,990
Weiyi!

35
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,890
- Take Commander back to Suiling.
- Yes!

36
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,400
Zijun, prepare for a counterattack.

37
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,940
Yes!

38
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,510
You’ve to be very careful.

39
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,590
Let’s go.

40
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,040
Commander.

41
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,310
Go!

42
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,280
Third Brother, it’s all finished.

43
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,950
Third Brother!

44
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,640
Third Brother! Third Brother!

45
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,960
It’s dangerous, Brigade Commander!

46
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,140
Brigade Commander!

47
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,720
Third Brother! Third Brother!

48
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,780
Lady!

49
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,810
Lady! What’s the matter?

50
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,440
Are you having a nightmare?

51
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,420
Look at you! Even your dream is all about life and death.

52
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,120
I wonder what you dreamed of.

53
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,050
Lady, have some water and calm down.

54
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,550
Jin Xiang!

55
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,690
Young Madam!

56
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,360
Something happened! Open the door! Something happened!

57
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,780
- Young Madam!
- Xiao Rongzi.

58
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:00,010
Who are you trying to scare to death in the middle of the night?

59
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:03,980
Young Master—Young Master’s car was ambushed and exploded.

60
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,390
What? Tell me again?

61
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,150
- Young Madam!
- My Lady!

62
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,890
My Lady!

63
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,720
My Lady.

64
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,790
My Lady.

65
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,770
You said Xiao Beichen is dead?

66
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,410
We just received the news. When they were returning to the base camp, their car suddenly exploded.

67
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:40,000
I guess it was an ambush set up by Suiling’s army.

68
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,710
He just died like that?

69
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:49,780
The old one didn’t die, but his son did?

70
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,650
He lost his son before his own death.

71
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,930
Commander, now the pain of losing your son

72
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,060
is returned to Xiao Haishan, even more than what you suffered.

73
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,600
Now that Xiao Beichen is dead and he's injured himself,

74
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,900
I'm afraid he won't live long.

75
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:09,290
Why did Xiao Beichen go to the battleground?

76
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,030
Did Mo Xibai give himself away?

77
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,500
We can't relax our vigilance before it's confirmed.

78
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,750
Send an order to Bozi. Ask him to be ready at any time.

79
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,290
Yes, Sir.

80
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,300
Seventh Aunt, what should we do?

81
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,570
Is Third Brother really dead?

82
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:50,640
Don't say nonsense. We're not sure.

83
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,430
Seventh Aunt.

84
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,520
I believe... Third Brother will be all right.

85
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,780
I'll be waiting for him to come back.

88
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:56,810
One day, I'll make you fall in love with me for real.

89
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,200
If I rub it like this, it will help with your blood circulation.

90
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,100
How do you feel now? Does it still hurt?

91
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,790
Not anymore.

♫ The transient memory wipes out my hopes ♫

95
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:32,240
♫ And buries my heart in the abyss ♫

96
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,320
How do you explain this to us?

97
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,760
I forced Hangjing to do it. Please don't blame her.

98
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,230
Let's not fight.

99
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,850
As long as you're willing to stay by my side,

100
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,220
nothing else matters.

101
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:05,120
♫ The transient memory wipes out my hopes ♫

102
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:12,070
♫ And buries my heart in the abyss ♫

103
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,000
Commander, you haven't slept for a whole night.

104
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,030
You haven't recovered from your injury yet. Please don't stay up any longer.

105
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:29,490
Third Master... Is he really gone?

106
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:38,010
Third Brother... He...

107
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,440
What are you doing?

108
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,180
Father, what's happening?

109
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,060
You can stay outside.

110
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,800
- Father.
- I told you.

111
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,500
Stay outside.

112
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:06,200
Beichen is dead. The commander is injured.

113
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,290
I have to at least pay a visit.

114
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,140
Commander.

115
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:27,810
Up till now, you've been charging ahead of your troops.

116
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,760
Old Zheng and I are in awe.

117
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,540
Thank you for your hard work all these years.

118
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:43,470
Thank you both for thinking of me.

119
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,850
This time, we've won the fight.

120
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:53,060
I'd like to go back to Beixin City and reward all army with a banquet.

121
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,260
It's such a pity that you won't make it.

122
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,650
Father, what are you talking about?

123
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,150
It's been thirty years.

124
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,220
We've gone through moments of life and death together.

125
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,430
I never expected that it would be you two brothers

126
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,980
that were stabbing me from my back.

127
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,730
Brothers?

128
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,420
Have you ever treated me like your brother?

129
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,630
Have you ever treated Old Zheng as your brother?

130
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,750
You took back Fengqi and Third Master's marriage so easily.

131
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:29,000
Did you think of him as your brother, then?

132
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,150
Father!

133
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,680
Father! This is betrayal!

134
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,030
I've been through moments of life and death with you for so many years.

135
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,170
What are you now?

136
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:51,010
The prominent Commander of the Ying Army.

137
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,900
What about me?

138
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,150
I'm still a small regiment commander. In our territory,

139
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:03,640
Kang Jingxiong is pretty confident that he can get the Xiao family under his control.

140
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,390
What about outside of our territory?

141
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,190
The North and the South are in complete chaos.

142
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,010
Everyone wants to live.

143
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,020
But what did you do, Xiao Haishan?

144
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,400
You're excessively cautious

145
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,700
and unwilling to take any actions.

146
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,250
You just want peace for yourself.

147
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,450
But you never thought about the future of your brothers.

148
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:38,040
Xibai, we've come out of piles of dead bodies.

149
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,480
We both know it clearly.

150
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,730
When there is a war, it will be ordinary people who are suffering.

151
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:49,610
All these years, I've never fought for anything or taken anything from others.

152
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,770
I just wanted to make sure this place was in peace.

153
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,080
I thought...

154
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:02,950
you'd understand me the most regarding that.

155
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:07,120
Forget it. Stop your cliché act.

156
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,650
Now is different from the past.

157
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:14,710
I won't achieve anything else in my life.

158
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:20,500
But my son. In terms of wisdom, education level, and abilities,

159
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:25,140
he's definitely at the top in the army. I won't let my son end up like me.

160
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,410
Working under someone all his life.

161
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,920
Father.

162
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,400
But have you ever asked what I really want?

163
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,490
I don't want that!

164
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,860
Don't be fooled by Xiao Beichen's false display of brotherhood.

165
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,430
Do you want to be his minion all your life?

166
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,480
But I‘m willing to...

167
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,180
Bastard!

168
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,300
Take him down!

169
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,820
Father! Please don't do this! Father!

170
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,750
Father!

171
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:17,440
Beichen is gone. You don't have a successor now.

172
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,900
Why should you hang in like this?

173
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:30,460
Sign your name on this document and I'll ensure the safety of your family.

174
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:36,020
I'll tell them that you died on the battlefield and give you a decent funeral.

175
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:47,180
[I, Chief Commander Xiao Haishan, will hand over my role to Mo Xibai due to my injury.]

176
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:54,800
I won't hand over my troops to you.

177
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,480
Do you have to make it end so badly?

178
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:10,160
I wanted to keep the last bit of brotherhood between us.

179
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,420
Fine.

180
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,880
Soldiers!

181
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,590
Who says Xiao Beichen is dead?

182
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,210
Third Master!

183
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,520
- Father.
- Third Master, you're still alive.

184
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,410
Your son is back.

185
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:48,330
You've hidden your agenda really well.

186
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,470
Uncle Mo, you've been...

187
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,580
my father's right hand man.

188
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:02,670
Of course, it'll take some effort to trick you.

189
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,320
You've been suspecting me a lot earlier?

190
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,480
You've done so many things under my father's eyes.

191
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,780
Do you really think you can hide it from everyone?

192
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:21,130
You've been hiding for such a long time. Now what?

193
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,270
Are you too impatient to hide anymore?

194
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:29,590
You're treacherous.

195
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,890
Have you ever thought of Mo Weiyi when you did this?

196
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:35,150
I'm doing this exactly for him.

197
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:38,830
That's why I don't want to be a servant of the Xiao family for a lifetime.

198
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:43,120
But it's too late that you know about it now. We're surrounded by my soldiers outside.

199
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,780
If your father doesn't sign it, you can sign it instead.

200
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:55,480
If I sign this,

201
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,300
the Ying Army will be listening to your orders?

202
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,230
As long as they cherish their own lives,

203
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:03,310
they'll understand that it makes no difference who they take orders from.

204
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,760
Third Master!

205
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,900
Father.

206
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,650
[Xiao Beichen]

207
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,040
Okay.

208
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:37,400
I'll send you and your father on your way to death today.

209
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,230
Soldiers!

210
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:04,000
Old Zheng, what do you mean?

211
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,430
Old Mo, to tell you the truth,

212
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:12,610
Third Master knew what we were doing

213
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,980
before he set off.

214
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,210
Is this Regiment Commander Mo?

215
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:34,390
Yes. When I was arresting the traitors, I found that he was a left-hander.

216
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:48,860
And I also discovered that Zheng and Mo are moving the military forces away from the East Main Camp.

217
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,810
I think they're trying to weaken the forces of the commander.

218
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,600
Third Brother! Third Brother!

219
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:01,310
Division Commander Zheng, please.

220
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,170
Third Master?

221
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,710
Uncle Zheng, there's no need for us to beat around the bush.

222
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:26,760
You joined forces with Mo Xibai to revolt against us.

223
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,250
It's not that you can't attack Eagle Beak Hill,

224
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,220
it's because you're not planning to send any troops there.

225
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,430
- But...
- Not only that.

226
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,830
You two are trying to divert the military forces away from the East Main Camp in secret.

227
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:40,280
No matter if my father

228
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,430
fails or not,

229
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:45,350
you don't want him to come back alive.

230
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,770
- Third Master, I...
- What a pity, Uncle Zheng.

231
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,920
I stopped the troops...

232
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,760
before they were able to exit the East Main Camp.

233
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,870
Tomorrow, you know what you should do.

234
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,100
You said you wanted to send me and my father on our way to death.

235
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,860
You're looking down upon the Xiao family.

236
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:21,160
Brigade Commander Zheng has been through hundreds of wars. He can see the situation clearly

237
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,860
and would naturally work with us.

238
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,150
For my daughter.

239
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:35,020
For the ten thousand soldiers under my command.

240
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:40,780
For the thirty years of brotherhood...

241
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,920
between me and the Commander.

242
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,950
I can only disappoint you.

243
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,600
According to Third Master's order, nobody can approach here.

244
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,470
I'm here to ask him to identify this document according to Third Master's order.

245
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,580
Open the door. Open the door!

246
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,130
Yes, Sir.

247
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,600
Give me the key!

248
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,560
On the ground!

249
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,940
Weiyi, what are you doing? Who asked you to come here?

250
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,960
Let's get out of here first.

251
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,250
Weiyi, we can talk later.

252
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,610
Now come with me.

253
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,590
Father,

254
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,740
have you never thought about the consequences?

255
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,370
I do not regret it.

256
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:23,340
If I was given another chance, I'd do the same.

257
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,150
Why?

258
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,850
Because of you. Your father has been

259
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,890
a servant of the Xiao family all his life.

260
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:38,970
I don't want my son to end up like me. Do you understand?

261
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,920
Even if there's just a slight chance,

262
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:45,270
I'd pave the way for you and help you become the leader.

263
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,930
The army is not about father and son.

264
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,730
I've decided to be loyal to Third Brother since I was a child.

265
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:58,360
I'll never betray him in my life.

266
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:03,770
I lost my reputation because of you.

267
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:06,290
I can even lose my life.

268
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:10,540
How are you still willing to follow Xiao Beichen?

269
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,080
You're my son. You're my biological son.

270
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,600
Will he take you in now?

271
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,340
Obviously, I'll give him an explanation.

272
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,100
Explanation?

273
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,790
If you shoot me now,

274
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:33,440
that's the best explanation for him.

275
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,860
Fire.

276
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,480
Kill me!

277
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,410
Fire!

278
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,720
You better go.

279
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,520
From now on,

280
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:07,100
you're no longer my father.

281
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,280
Weiyi.

282
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,150
Regiment Commander Mo, Commander Kang asked me to pick you up.

283
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,370
Everything is prepared.

284
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:06,140
You will meet with Advisor Zhang first. Please get in the car.

285
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:26,220
Army Chief, I let the traitor go.

286
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,770
It's unforgivable.

287
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:46,080
- Weiyi!
- Army Chief.

288
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:51,400
Please carry out your punishment.

289
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,670
Third Brother!

290
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:18,250
Third Brother!

291
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,830
Third Brother!

292
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:48,380
In order to manage the army, you need to follow the military order.

293
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,260
You did this...

294
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:56,960
My gunshot is not for you,

295
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,450
it's for Mo Weiyi who committed military misconduct.

296
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,420
After this shot,

297
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,000
out relationship will not be changed.

298
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,340
I'm your third brother.

299
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,190
In your lifetime,

300
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,130
I'm still your brother.

301
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:39,130
Third Brother.

302
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:43,900
I only have one request.

303
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,850
Can you let go of my father?

304
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:29,260
Regiment Commander Mo, no one will pick you up tonight.

305
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:36,970
It looks like Kang Jingxiong wants my life.

306
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:39,440
You've done so much for Commander Kang,

307
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,100
you've known a lot of secrets, he wouldn't just let you go.

308
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,000
Weiyi.

309
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:35,800
The body was found in the town of Suiling.

310
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,160
Do you want to bury your father here,

311
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,710
or do you want to bring him back to Beixin?

312
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:53,370
It's up to you. You can stay here.

313
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:55,910
Did my father have to die?

314
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,640
You promised me.

315
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:06,430
You promised me.

316
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:09,090
- You promised me!
- Weiyi! Let go!

317
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:12,050
Why can't you keep your promise?

318
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,780
I've never promised you anything.

319
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:19,740
For traitors, the Ying Army

320
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,140
will never be kind to their traitors.

321
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,960
- Xiao Beichen!
- Weiyi!

322
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,380
- Weiyi!
- Why did you kill my father?

323
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,020
I didn't kill your father.

324
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,890
Mo Weiyi, you listen to me!

325
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:36,140
I know you're heartbroken, but think carefully.

326
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:39,460
If Third Brother really wanted to kill your father, he could have executed him right here.

327
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,540
Why would he bother to lock him up?

328
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:45,060
Then you tell me. Other than him,

329
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,190
who else?

330
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:00,580
I didn't kill your father, whether you believe me or not.

331
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,450
Father!

332
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,570
Father.

333
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:09,080
Thank goodness. You're finally home.

334
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,220
You're injured, are you okay?

335
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,610
I'm fine. No need to make a fuss.

336
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,880
They've taken out the bullet, he is fine.

337
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,600
- Let's go in.
- Let's go.

338
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,390
Be careful, Father.

339
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,630
Deputy Officer Guo, please bring in my father's luggage.

340
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,890
Yes.

341
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,910
Third Brother.

342
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,550
I'm back.

343
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,800
I heard about Brigade Captain Mo's situation.

344
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,200
I know you two are like brothers.

345
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,800
After this incident, it must be difficult for you to face him.

346
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,400
But, Third Brother, you didn't do anything wrong.

347
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,600
Don't blame yourself.

348
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,700
Do you feel sorry for me?

349
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,000
My heart aches for you.

350
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,600
While you were gone,

351
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I was thinking about you every day. I couldn't sleep

352
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,600
and I couldn't eat. The day they told us you went missing,

353
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,100
that kind of fear I had...

354
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:15,560
made me realize...

355
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,800
how much I care about you.

356
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,400
I don't know since when.

357
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,900
Perhaps,

358
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,000
when you came to see me at the prison,

359
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,400
or when you saved me at court,

360
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,900
perhaps when you had the whipping punishment because of my Father,

361
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,200
or in confinement,

362
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,460
or when you carefully applied medications on my wounds,

363
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:01,200
or when I was sick, you took care of me.

364
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,000
Whenever I need you, you're always there for me.

365
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,350
Do you know...

366
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,600
I've been waiting for you to tell me that?

367
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,300
Xiao Beichen...

368
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,400
I'm willing to be with you forever,

369
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,100
for better or worse.

370
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,560
People say, "A beautiful flower and lady are a perfect pair."

371
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:19,300
I would say it should followed by...

372
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,800
"Pearl and Hangjing are an amazing fit."

373
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,000
Stop the nonsense.

374
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:48,600
Lin Hangjing, I only realized it today

375
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:54,000
the true meaning of husband and wife stay together until death do us apart.

376
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,210
Since you left, my heart

377
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:21,600
will not stay.

378
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,230
Will not stay.

379
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,800
- Father.
- Fengqi.

380
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,600
Can you listen to your father.

381
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:41,200
Just let go of Third Master Xiao.

382
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,500
Even your father can do nothing about it now.

383
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:54,400
Father, you still have a say in the army.

384
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,100
Didn't you also help them take out the traitor Mo Xibai?

385
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:06,300
Fengqi, Xiao Beichen had already set up this trap for a while.

386
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,400
Everything is under his control.

387
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:13,790
Your father barely made it out alive.

388
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,200
Otherwise, Mo Xibai's ending

389
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,600
would be my fate.

390
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,050
Father, don't you forget,

391
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:25,000
you still have 10,000 soldiers and horses under you.

392
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,800
I'm sure Uncle Xiao is well aware of that.

393
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,600
Also, these 10,000 soldiers and horses will be my dowry. Don't you forget.

394
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,400
It looks like you're determined to marry Xiao Beichen.

395
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,800
That's right.

396
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,200
I, Zheng Fengqi, will marry Xiao Beichen.

397
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,700
You've decided to leave?

398
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,300
Yes.

399
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:00,210
I'm determined.

400
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,800
My most respected, trusted Third Brother.

401
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,800
I've been suspecting you as the murderer of my father.

402
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:17,250
How do you think I can still be by your side?

403
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:20,200
Why can't you believe me?

404
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,500
What I cannot believe...

405
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,200
is this messy world.

406
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:32,700
Only if I leave here, I can avoid all the bloody mess

407
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,200
and all the calculated schemes.

408
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,800
I don't want to wait till one day,

409
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:45,100
we both want each other's lives.

410
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,100
If Third Brother can let me go today,

411
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:54,300
that's doing me a huge favor.

412
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,000
Weiyi!

413
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,000
Can we still be brothers?

414
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,190
We were born in military families.

415
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,200
Perhaps we shouldn't have been brothers from the very beginning.

416
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:51,000
[Frontier Army Command for Zhibei Region]

417
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,600
Weiyi!

418
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,000
Weiyi!

419
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,400
Third Brother just recuperated, and you want to leave now?

420
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,000
Didn't you see it yourself? Why would you bother to ask?

421
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,400
Didn't we agree

422
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,400
in the military, our fathers and we are all separated.

423
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,000
What they do doesn't mean we're associated with it.

424
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,780
I just wanted to leave here.

425
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,600
If I leave here, we won't have any conflicts.

426
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,200
We won't have any betrayals.

427
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,600
We won't have brothers killing each other.

428
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,000
We won't have this kind of tragedy.

429
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,700
Our brotherhood...

430
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:03,600
started when we were 13 years old. We went to the temple and became brother under God's witness.

431
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,000
What we said was...

432
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,200
our lives are one.

433
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,200
Three of us will not be separated.

434
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,600
You don't take that into consideration anymore?

435
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:23,560
We can no longer be brothers.

436
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,600
Mo Weiyi!

437
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,400
You're a bastard, a coward!
