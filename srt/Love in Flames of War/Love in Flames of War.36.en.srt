One of the shareholders is the Yamato Chamber of Commerce.

165
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,420
I'm pretty certain it was done by the Japanese.

166
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,220
Professor Gu is regarded highly in the geological world.

167
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,280
He trained a group of up-and-coming professors.

168
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,400
I can't believe he ended up like this!

169
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,350
This Director Sato is a bastard, by using this kind of cheap tactic.

170
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,560
He has no bottom line.

171
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,380
Third Brother, what should we do next?

172
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,420
Submit this to the jury.

173
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,420
Let the board members use it as a reference.

174
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,700
When you think about it, it was really dangerous.

175
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,620
I almost lost this report.

176
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,500
We need to thank the person who secretly saved the professor.

177
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,550
Third Brother, who do you think the person is?

178
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,840
Perhaps?

179
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:47,350
Do you mean the comrade who works with Ms. Sheng?

180
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,570
If it was done by them,

181
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:54,060
their target is the Japanese.

182
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,650
But what are they representing?

183
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:00,140
I'm still not sure. And it is a critical time now.

184
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,440
We've to be careful.

185
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,580
Extra! Extra! Important news!

186
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,200
Associate Director of the Police Tactic Team,

187
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,550
He Zhongyi, was murdered!

188
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,560
- Stop.
- Extra! Extra!

189
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,810
Kiddo, give me a copy.

190
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,710
Thanks.

191
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,060
Extra! Extra! Important news!

192
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:38,720
Who's that?

193
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,200
Who's it?

194
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,190
Who are you looking for?

195
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,010
I-I'm looking for...

196
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,380
Mr. Ding.

197
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,820
Zizheng?

198
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,100
Brother Yong!

199
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,510
You're back!

200
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,900
Come on in.

201
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:43,640
Zizheng, thanks for your hard work to kill the traitor He Zhongyi.

202
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,140
You did well. You must get some rest.

203
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,000
Thank you.

204
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,990
Zizheng.

205
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,310
There's something I need to tell you.

206
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,160
What is it?

207
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,810
- But don't get too emotional after you hear this.
- Okay.

208
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,700
It's about the bidding of the Beixin Harbor.

209
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:11,350
The attitude of Shen Yanqing, Chief Editor of Eastern Times.

210
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:17,130
[Huaxing Hotel]

211
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,580
Newspaper! Newspaper!

212
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:32,470
The official list of bidders for Beixin Harbor's final round of bidding

213
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,550
has been released!

214
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:45,160
Eight companies have been selected for the final competition today. After another round of deliberation,

215
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,240
our panel of judges will review the results and make the final decision.

216
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,810
Great. Actually, it doesn’t matter who wins the bid.

217
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:57,640
It's fine as long as it helps promote the economy.

218
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,980
The principle is to benefit Beixin.

219
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,150
But I’ve heard that recently the fractions have teamed up

220
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:09,380
and requested to negotiate with the Nanjing Government, planning to boycott the disarmament together.

221
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:14,150
If they really want to eliminate our power and disarm us,

222
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,930
then autonomy is actually non-existent.

223
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,770
Think about it. The commanders of different regions, no matter how much power they have,

224
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:22,560
who is willing to accept it?

225
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,220
What if the Central Government plays hardball?

226
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:30,160
We previously switched our sides and chose to believe in the governor. The purpose is to make Beixin safe.

227
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,780
If they fight again, the so-called unifying of the country will be a joke.

228
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:38,860
Don’t be too drastic. As long as there is an opportunity to sit down and negotiate with each other,

229
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,190
there’s always hope for peace.

230
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:45,780
I do hope so.

231
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,100
Commander.

232
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,920
Commander, it’s quite windy out here. If you're going to stay here long,

233
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,130
you need to put on a coat.

234
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:55,680
I’m fine. I’m just chatting with Beichen for a bit.

235
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,600
- Okay, okay.
- Third Master just got back, and you won’t give him a break about military affairs.

236
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,980
Here, Third Master. You haven’t been home for half a month.

237
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,990
I’m sure you didn’t get a chance to eat some nice food. Eat the Fish Maw Chicken Soup.

238
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:09,490
- Thank you, Seventh Aunt.
- Commander, here's one for you too.

239
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:10,690
- Hey, I just remembered.
- I'll do it.

240
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:13,540
Aren’t you going to visit Madam… Madam…

241
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,420
Madam Xue to play Mahjong? Why are you still here?

242
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:19,070
Forget about it. Madam Xue invited me,

243
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:23,100
but she just called me and said she’s going to a social occasion with her husband.

244
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,920
Who is it? Must be a big name to make her give up on Mahjong.

245
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,690
She said it was someone from a group of European travel writers.

246
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:33,850
Oh, I heard that the leader of that group is a teacher at St Paul's Girls' School.

247
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:38,400
- She’s taught many girls from noble families.
- Oh.

248
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,740
Here, eat it while it’s still hot.

249
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,230
It’s delicious.

250
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,030
Director.

251
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,460
Director, as you expected, our design was not selected.

252
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,360
After what happened with Gu Qiwen,

253
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,150
Xiao Beichen's attitude towards us has become very clear.

254
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:25,740
From the start, he wasn't going to let the Japanese win the bid.

255
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:34,380
Director Sato, that was a great move.

256
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,110
Make one move, but think about the next three moves.

257
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:42,400
Looks like you have other plans with Xiao Beichen.

258
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,450
Xiao Beichen thinks he's clever,

259
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:49,010
but he doesn't know that he had fallen into Director's trap from the start.

260
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,930
Here, it's on the second floor.

261
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:04,500
It seems that the Xiao family and the Japanese aren't working together.

262
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,090
And they didn't grant the Japanese the right to build the harbor in private.

263
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,260
I will report this to my superiors.

264
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:15,190
Judging from Beichen's behaviors recently, I think in his heart

265
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:19,630
he's hostile to the Japanese. But because of his role,

266
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:23,900
and the constraints of his family background, he doesn't have any revolutionary thoughts.

267
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:28,020
It's the same as what Comrade Du Heng reported to us.

268
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:36,070
Then... does this mean that we can try to win him over?

269
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:40,740
Yes. Our superiors asked us to help the Han

270
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,510
win the bid for the harbor.

271
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:45,330
If war does erupt, having control over the harbor

272
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,430
means we will have a great advantage.

273
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:52,400
This is a difficult task. We must succeed. We can't fail.

274
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:58,590
I will publish an article in Eastern Times that the Han will be cooperating with the Port of Vladivostok and Vostochny,

275
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:03,210
these are the two biggest ports in Russia.

276
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:07,130
In terms of technology, money, and experience,

277
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:11,550
the Han has an absolute advantage. If in the end...

278
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:14,530
they still don't win the bid,

279
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:17,220
then it would be very strange.

280
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,310
But judging from the fact that Sato went to such extremes to get rid of Professor Gu,

281
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:23,290
he's very confident that he will win the bid.

282
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:27,060
I'm worried that he won't give up until the very last moment.

283
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,820
So we can't relax our efforts yet.

284
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:36,800
No worries. I'll ask Mr. Ding to watch Sato's every move.

285
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:48,930
Big Brother, this time, we're planning to cooperate with Nanjing to negotiate with the Central Government.

286
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:52,570
We have nothing but our troops and equipment as our

287
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:57,920
bargaining chips. We used the loan last time to expand our armament,

288
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,110
but it's still far from enough.

289
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:02,630
Now, Sato is out of the game.

290
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:07,310
I'm afraid it will be difficult if we still want financial aid from them.

291
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:12,350
I understand your point. If our negotiation with Nanjing fails,

292
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,380
war will break out at any moment.

293
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,870
We'll need money for everything. Right?

294
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:30,040
Sign the Co-prosperity Treaty with the Japanese directly?

295
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:34,320
Yes. They've shown their sincerity already.

296
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,310
As long as we can establish long-term cooperation,

297
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:44,200
the Japanese side promises to make regular remittances to ensure that you have no worries

298
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,320
whether you are expanding the army or purchasing armaments.

299
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,050
But, Jingxiong, this is...

300
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:53,210
Big Brother, this is a very critical issue to our survival.

301
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:57,070
You really don't have to worry that much about this matter.

302
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:14,520
So? Are you going to go home alone?

303
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,480
The weather's nice today, so I wanted to take a walk outside.

304
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,670
Let me give you a lift.

305
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,650
Stop.

306
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:58,110
The ointment for bruises from Meng's Pharmacy is very effective. Give it a try.

307
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,590
Deputy Commander, it's fine.

308
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,550
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

309
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,710
I want to eat this.

310
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,600
- Okay, let's go.
- Come back next time.

311
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,330
Ms. Sheng, why did you get out of the car?

312
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:04,990
I saw someone selling sugar figurines.

313
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,890
I wanted to bring one home for Ke'er.

314
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,280
Boss, one sugar figurine, please.

315
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,760
Okay.

316
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:44,820
Deputy Commander Xiao, what a surprise.

317
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:49,690
I didn't expect to see you here, Mr. Mu.

318
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:55,090
Deputy Commander, why don't you introduce us? This is...

319
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:59,360
Let me introduce you.

00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:04,240
This is the heiress of the Sheng Tian Group, Miss Sheng Hanjun.

321
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,940
Mr. Mu...

322
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,850
is someone that my wife used to know before she died.

323
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,160
Hello, Mr. Mu.

324
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:33,440
Mr. Mu, it looks like you're not too surprised to see Miss Sheng.

325
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:37,750
Ms. Sheng, you look very similar

326
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,720
to a friend of mine.

327
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:46,300
This is my exclusive greeting line after I arrived in Beixin.

328
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:50,690
But it's fine. I'm used to it.

329
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:55,640
It's getting late. Let me drive you home.

330
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,840
Hanjun, I found it out.

331
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,060
Look.

332
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,070
Five years ago, Mu Zizheng fell into the water.

333
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:48,330
Everybody thought he had died.

334
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:51,030
But it turns out that someone saved him.

335
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:53,460
After he got back to Beixin,

336
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,360
he heard the news that you died in a fire accident.

337
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,360
He was depressed for quite some time.

338
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,550
He's now in charge of spying and secret investigations for the Youth Union.

339
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:09,710
Anyway, I’m relieved to know

340
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:12,380
that he’s still alive.

341
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,400
Do you want to tell him your real identity?

342
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,060
These are stories of the past. Let the past be the past.

343
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:26,490
I'll just create a lot of chaos if I bring it up again.

344
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:28,430
Zizheng still needs to take care of his mother.

345
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:31,810
I simply hope he'll be safe in the future.

346
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,710
I can't hide this from you.

347
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:04,520
It's true that Hangjing got away from the Xiao Residence.

348
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:09,240
But she died in the fire at the hostel.

349
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:41,290
It's you.

350
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:44,860
Xiao Beichen, aren't you surprised that I'm still alive?

351
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:48,470
Mu Zizheng, you won't be able to kill me with just yourself.

352
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:50,720
If I can't kill you this time, I'll do it next time.

353
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,750
I will definitely take revenge for Lin Hangjing!

354
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,690
Kill me now.

355
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:59,620
Or I'll cut you into pieces sooner or later!

356
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,980
I won't kill you.

357
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,860
Your life was saved by Lin Hangjing.

358
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,000
Live on.

359
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,550
Or you won't get a chance to get revenge on me again.

[Yu De Teahouse]

361
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:38,460
Hangjing, how I wish you were still alive.

362
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,060
You died because of Xiao Beichen.

363
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:48,200
And he found someone else to substitute you.

364
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,680
He doesn’t deserve your love at all.

365
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:56,510
I will definitely get revenge for you!

366
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:10,320
Deputy Commander Xiao, where are we going?

367
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,670
- To a communication event.
- A communication event?

368
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,720
I've never heard you bring this up.

369
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,570
It's a last-minute decision.

370
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:24,740
Think of it as a surprise for you.

Tomorrow, they will hold a literature communication event at Huaxing Hotel.

375
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:43,240
A group of travel writers from the U.K. are visiting.

376
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:47,830
Your writing teacher back when you were in the U.K., Ms. Evan,

377
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:50,180
is one of them.

378
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,270
What do you think, Ms. Sheng?

379
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:57,700
Are you satisfied with the arrangement?

380
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,650
What's wrong, Ms. Sheng? Judging from your facial expression,

381
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:06,070
it looks like you’re not so satisfied.

382
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,540
Of course I am.

383
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:13,590
It’s just that the surprise is too sudden.

384
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,900
After Yanqing and I returned to Shanghai to start our own business,

385
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,690
we rarely return to London.

386
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:20,810
I haven’t met Ms. Evan for many years.

387
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:23,550
I never expected

388
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:26,030
to see her in Beixin.

389
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:30,180
There is an old saying in China.

390
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:33,810
"A teacher for a day is a father for a life."

391
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:38,870
I’m sure Ms. Sheng’s affection towards Ms. Evan must be the same.

392
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:42,610
You can catch up when you meet each other.

393
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:50,900
Stop.

394
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,980
What are you doing?

395
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:00,370
I’m meeting up with Ms. Evan, but I didn’t prepare anything.

396
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:03,950
It would be rude if I see her without bringing any gifts.

397
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:06,990
So I’d like to buy her a gift.

398
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:09,890
Rest assured, Ms. Sheng.

399

Ms. Sheng, please take a look.

00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:28,590
I heard that Ms. Evan has a lot of knowledge about ancient Chinese literature.

403
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:31,110
I’m sure she’ll be very happy
