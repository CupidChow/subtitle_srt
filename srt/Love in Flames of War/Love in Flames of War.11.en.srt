Do you really think Commander was able to convince him?

162
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,980
If it's something Third Brother doesn't want to do, then in the whole of Beixin City,

163
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,830
no one can force him.

164
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:55,830
The reason he went there was that you said he was useless.

165
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,310
That he was living under the protection of Commander.

166
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,620
So he went without hesitation.

167
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,460
He wanted to prove to you that he was a real man.

168
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,130
He wants to be the hero in your heart.

169
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,510
When he was at the military school, he trained day and night.

170
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,670
He was wounded everywhere on his body.

171
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:17,050
Do you know how he managed to get through it?

172
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,650
I don't know how many times,

173
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:24,350
when I woke up in the dormitory at night,

174
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:27,830
I saw him holding the book you gave him,

175
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:32,260
just as if it was the best comfort in the world.

176
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:37,360
For the Feng City war, others only know that he won an admirable victory, despite having fewer soldiers.

177
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,950
But he was hit by a bullet on his left shoulder and was bleeding heavily.

178
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,770
He almost died.

179
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,770
He needed surgery to get the bullet out.

180
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,720
But there were no anesthetics.

181
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,420
He just bore with the whole process with clenched teeth.

182
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,120
Because he knew you were waiting for him at home.

183
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,570
He couldn't just die.

184
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:01,120
He wanted to finish the war as soon as possible and come back home to see you.

185
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,980
Miss Lin, do you still remember the Russian Doll he gave you?

186
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,370
It wasn't some item at a stall.

187
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,300
It was something that he crafted for you by hand.

188
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,430
He saw that a lot of girls in Russia liked them.

189
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,920
So he wanted to make one for you.

190
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,420
Do you know how many times he had failed?

191
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:23,540
And how many cuts he had on his hands? He's even got scars on his hands now.

192
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,230
Miss Lin.

193
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,800
You have a right to not like him.

194
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,320
But once people fall in love, it's hard to take it back.

195
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,770
Third Brother's affection for you has grown day by day.

196
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:43,170
So he can't just let it go easily.

197
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:47,330
And now, you're the only one

198
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:50,040
that can untie the knot for him.

199
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,900
We've told you everything you need to know.

200
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,280
It's up to you whether you will go or not.

201
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,670
I...

202
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,180
Tell me about it now.

203
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,730
Third Master has not been back for quite a few days!

204
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,970
He's been staying at Ming Yu Yue, right?

205
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:30,740
How old is he? It's normal that he would go out and have a drink.

206
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,460
And... maybe he has some serious topics to discuss.

207
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,910
You're just helping him hide the truth!

208
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,940
He hasn't shown up in East Camp for quite a few days! What would his subordinates think?

209
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,650
It's okay, it's okay. Don't be angry.

210

Third Master has been at East Camp ever since he came back. Let him rest.

211
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,580
They have their own ideas. We as elders

212
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,900
should give them some freedom.

213
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,410
I'll just have him come back.

214
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,820

Stop drinking, Third Brother. Come home with me.

Third Brother, who is she?

How dare she stop you from drinking?

235

Isn't this Lin Hangjing, Eldest Miss Lin?

I can drink whenever I want.

Why do you care? What right do you have...

258

Yes. I indeed don't have the right to care.

259

But you're ruining yourself. It only makes Uncle Xiao and Seventh Aunt worry about you more.

You don't need to be here.

481
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,920
Third Brother.

482
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,950
Little brother, what are you doing here?

483
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:35,130
I can't sleep. Can you read a story for me?

484
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:38,290
It's late, you cheeky boy.

485
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:39,770
Come on. Go back to your room and sleep.

486
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:43,980
Third Brother, can we go horse riding tomorrow?

487
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,600
Well,

488
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,330
I'm busy tomorrow.

489
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:58,330
Then let's go to Huaxin Hotel to have seafood.

490
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:00,960
I heard they have a new cook.

491
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,260
You cheeky boy.

492
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,220
How did you know about that?

493
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,220
But I have been really busy lately.

494
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:12,010
I will take you out when I have time.

495
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:14,990
Have you...

496
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:18,890
had a fight with Sister Hangjing?

497
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:28,330
A child shouldn't interfere with adult matters.

498
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:31,440
It's been a long time since we last slept together.

499
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,450
Can I sleep here today?

500
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,920
Hey!

501
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:43,810
You cheeky boy. You are quick to get into my bed.

502
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:49,090
Come on. Which story do you want to listen to?

503
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,730
This one.

504
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:54,000
There is a man called Pang Tong.

505
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,090
He came to Feng Wei Hills one day.

506
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:57,780
Then...

507
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:04,970
Commander Kang, I have an urgent matter for that I may need your help with.

508
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:08,680
Mr. Sato, there's no need for such formality.

509
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:12,480
We've been in partnership for three years.

510
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,770
If you're in trouble,

511
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:18,270
I'll be honored to be at your service.

512
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:20,660
I'm very grateful.

513
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,860
I have a batch of opium to be shipped

514
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:27,600
to Beiling. Beixin is an unavoidable transit stop.

515
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,750
I have tested the water with Xiao Haishan.

516
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:34,770
I figured that he won't do me the favor.

517
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:38,730
But Beiling is one of my major clients.

518
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:43,630
It's an urgent matter. I hope you can help me.

519
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:50,600
Beixin is the transit stop.

520
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:56,940
Opium is the thing Xiao Haishan hates the most.

521
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:59,380
It's impossible to

522
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,520
get an approval from him.

523
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,060
Commander Kang, you're a very valued figure for Governor Jin.

524
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:11,350
I'm sure you have the power to command Xiao Haishan.

525
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:15,270
I'm very flattered.

526
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:17,480
We're just colleagues.

527
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,250
We're of the same rank.

528
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:22,450
Commander, you're being too humble.

529
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:25,350
To be honest, the command office and I both think

530
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:30,490
you are the best designee for the chief executive for Zhibei.

531
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:36,470
If that's what you have in mind, we'll do our best to support you.

532
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,860
I thank you for your trust and confidence in me

533
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,840
but it's an honor I dare not take.

534
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:50,760
Have some tea.

535
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:06,530
Since we discovered Kang Jingxiong took the workers out of the area

536
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:08,400
and exploited them,

537
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,060
he has been on our elimination list of corrupted officers.

538
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,700
On his visit to Beixin,

539
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,260
he hasn't brought many escorts.

540
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,770
That's a great opportunity for us to act.

541
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:25,760
Brother Yong, is Zizheng with us this time?

542
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:32,790
Zizheng will take care of the preparations for the action.

543
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:37,480
Brother Yong, why don't you send me on the mission?

544
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,750
The main purpose of Kang Jingxiong's visit to Beixin this time

545
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:43,900
is to attend the birthday party of Xiao Haishan's wife.

546
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:57,030
Zizheng, I know Miss Lin who lives with the Xiao family is your friend.

547
00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:00,170
I'm worried that...

548
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,380
Brother Yong,

549
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:07,480
you don't need to worry. I'll make sure she won't recognize me.

550
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,860
Fine.

551
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:18,150
I will send people to assist you at that time.

552
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:38,050
♫ Who is looking forward to the spring breeze? ♫

553
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:43,240
♫ Who is staring at the moving flowers? ♫

554
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:48,360
♫ Who is watching the galaxy in the summer night ♫

555
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:54,850
♫ Who remembers a shooting star going by in a moment? ♫

556
00:43:54,850 --> 00:44:00,610
♫ Who is afraid of heartbreak, denies the heartbeat? ♫

557
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:05,750
♫ Allow loneliness to smear the other’s protective coloration ♫

558
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:10,970
♫ Who would be willing to pass the other like this ♫

559
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:17,970
♫ I also want to be a shooting star to make you warm ♫

560
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:24,900
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

561
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:30,660
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

562
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:36,260
♫ At least the flight will be smooth ♫

563
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:41,870
♫ Waiting for a promise my whole life ♫

564
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:47,450
♫ I cherish even the short-lived happiness ♫

565
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:53,070
♫ Leave some tenderness to the years ♫

566
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:58,760
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

567
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:04,460
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫

568
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:09,960
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

569
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:15,460
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

570
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:25,580
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

571
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:35,910
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫
