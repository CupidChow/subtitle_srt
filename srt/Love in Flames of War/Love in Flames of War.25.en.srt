21
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,850
Young Master Mu.

22
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,770
- Why is Deputy Commander Xiao here?
- I specially waited for you here.

23
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,810
Is there something wrong?

24
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,180
The person that you found, his acting was not bad.

25
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,050
I don't understand what Third Young Master is saying.

26
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,040
No harm if you don't understand.

27
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,180
I'm telling you today that

28
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,710
I, Xiao Beichen, have always liked an open and upright opponent.

29
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:25,600
With regard to those vile people who stab others behind their back,

30
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,060
they don't deserve to be my opponent.

31
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,040
Drive.

32
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,750
I need you to help me do something.

33
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,590
But this is a very dangerous thing, you can even lose your life.

34
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,890
As long as it can save my child,

35
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,210
I'll do anything you tell me to do.

36
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,040
You take these.

37
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,710
These should be enough for your child's medical treatment.

38
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,790
It can also guarantee that you and your family do not need to worry about clothing and food for the rest of your life.

39
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,250
What do I need to do?

40
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,860
I heard you studied art at Liyuan since young. You do Chinese opera well.

41
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,400
I want you to act as him.

42
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:33,010
So long as you act similar enough to him and people cannot see any flaws, it'll do.

43
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,700
Yes.

44
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:42,260
Sorry. I really didn't mean to.

45
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,580
Third Brother, when did you find out that special envoy was fake?

46
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,160
At the start, it was only suspicion.

47
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,670
Because when he drinks wine, he accidentally did an action of covering his sleeve.

48
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,510
Until Mu Zizheng gave me that note, then I was certain.

49
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,510
He wants to divide me and Governor.

50
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:18,320
Then it looks like this Mu Zizheng is really meticulous.

51
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,520
He knows that it's the safest if he finds someone who can act.

52
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,090
But he doesn't know that you are an expert in this aspect.

53
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,100
It backfired instead.

54
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,380
But he can set up such a big circumstance,

55
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,780
dragging you, Governor, and the people of the Beiyang Government in.

56
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,950
It's evident that this person is very adept at scheming.

57
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,270
We have to watch out and be careful.

58
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,420
Sister Rouke.

59
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:03,130
You used the fake special envoy to frame Xiao Beichen, didn't you?

60
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,030
It was really you.

61
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,560
Mu Zizheng, why did you do it?

62
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,210
Sorry, Sister, I've disappointed you.

63
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,110
But I didn't mean to.

64
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,030
Didn't mean to?

65
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,470
But this is a human's life.

66
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,870
In order to get rid of Xiao Beichen,

67
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,840
you were actually so unscrupulous.

68
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,430
Are you still the Mu Zizheng I knew originally?

69
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,880
No. It's not like that.

70
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,950
I really didn't think that it'd be like this.

71
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,340
I never thought that he'd die.

72
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,000
My target was only Xiao Beichen.

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,290
So you could use my father.

74
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,100
Don't be blinded by hatred anymore.

75
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,190
Like this, it'll make you go astray and sink deeper and deeper.

76
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
Sorry, Sister.

77
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,790
I hope that it will not happen again.

78
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:08,210
If you commit it again, I will not condone it.

79

Jin Xiang.

80
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,890
What is in your hands?

81
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,290
Well...

82
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,680
Young Madam is injured.

83
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,150
When Miss came back yesterday, her leg was already injured.

84
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,170
But she won't let me tell anybody.

85
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,010
Let me see.

86
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,080
You... What are you doing?

87
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,190
Does it hurt?

88
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:13,670
Last night, you went to the hot spring villa.

89
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,290
You still asked Jin Xiang not to tell me.

90
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,650
You were afraid that I would worry, right?

91
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,760
I don't want to talk about all these.

92
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:35,250
Lin Hangjing, you obviously care about me.

93
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,740
But why do you refuse to admit it?

94
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,360
Can we not continue to give each other the silent treatment?

95
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:49,260
Third Brother, do you really understand?

96
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,480
Do you really know what I care about the most?

97
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,380
It's the basic trust between a married couple.

98
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:04,520
I hope my husband won't hide anything from me.

99
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:09,150
We have been married for so long. The thing that I hope for the most is

100
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,270
we don't have any cheating or hidden things between us. Be honest with each other

101
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,710
I know that the Mu Zizheng transfer matter,

102
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,760
I was wrong.

103
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:37,990
I apologize to you here. Can you forgive me?

104
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,160
Third Brother, let's not mention this matter anymore in the future.

105
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:48,530
Third Brother, can you promise me

106
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:51,580
from now on, you won't deceive me any more?

107
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,310
I, Xiao Beichen, vow

108
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:04,250
from now on, to never to lie to my wife, Lin Hangjing.

109
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,990
You smiled.

110
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,730
Then are we...

111
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,920
considered to have reconciled?

112
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,440
Yes.

113
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:34,780
Even so, I still don't like you going out and meeting that Mu Zizheng.

114
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:42,490
Third Brother, I've already told him clearly.

115
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:46,990
Actually, all this time, I've only treated him as a normal friend.

116
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:50,360
But, Third Brother, if not for us,

117
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,850
he wouldn't have needed to suffer hardship at the labor camp.

118
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,640
We are still indebted to him.

119
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,540
Even so, I still don't want you to go and meet him.

120
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,890
Not only him.

121
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:10,110
All men strangers, you should not meet them.

122
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,790
Xiao Beichen, you are really a jealous man.

123
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,240
You say I, Xiao Beichen, am jealous easily?

124
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,110
Jealous... Who...

125
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,110
- I let you say I'm jealous easily again.
- You get jealous easily.

126
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:26,140
You still dare to say I'm jealous easily?

127
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,020
[Hot Spring Villa]

128
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,590
Governor, someone took Yakov away.

129
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,690
Scoundrel! Who did it?

130
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,330
We still don't know at the moment.

131
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:54,510
Besides, that person has already gone back to the Soviet Union territory.

132
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,300
Already entered the Soviet Union territory?

133
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,240
Does it mean that it is too late to find him?

134
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,460
And the premier...

135
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:17,280
Then I can only call him myself and explain.

136
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,670
- Report.
- Come in.

137
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,760
Commander Kang called that he will arrive the day after tomorrow.

138
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,350
He is coming to report the garrison situation.

139
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:35,330
Deputy Officer Zhou, arrange Kang Jingxiong to stay with us,

140
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,240
so that it's easy for me to talk to him.

141
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,860
Yes.

142
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:45,070
Seventh Aunt, your hands are so agile.

143
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,660
You never thought I'd be an expert at knitting mittens, right?

144
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,660
The kiddos and Commander will be returning from the United States very soon.

145
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:56,530
The weather is getting cold as well. I was thinking of knitting them a new pair of mittens.

146
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,840
I would knit one for Third Master every year.

147
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,070
This year, my daughter-in-law will have to do it.

148
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,740
But, Seventh Aunt, I don't know how to do it.

149
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,650
I can teach you.

150
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:13,670
Knitted mittens are much warmer than those you buy outside.

151
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,860
Come. Try it.

152
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:20,820
This goes this way and then this goes through here. You try it.

153
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,570
Right.

154
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:28,410
Third Brother, I'll come with you.

155
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:31,430
No need. You just stay at East Main Camp.

156
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:34,090
Third Brother, I know what you are worried about.

157
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:36,280
If Kang Jingxiong dies at my hands now,

158
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,950
Governor Jin will blame us.

159
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,780
Don't worry. I won't act rashly.

160
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:47,320
Someday, Kang Jingxiong will die at my hands.

161
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,480

Jingxiong, you've worked hard today.

Three army joint forces are a big deal.

167

I'm also the leading troop, I should be the one who reports to the governor in person.

You achieved great military exploits at this young age.

Zizheng has had a cold since last night. He is getting an IV drip in the hospital now.

182

Is Young Master Zizheng your adopted son?

184

We will meet another day since he is not well.

187

Uncle Kang, I am truly sorry.

188
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,810
Zizheng is sick at the wrong time. To show my apology,

189

I will toast you on behalf of Zizheng.

190

From my perspective, a man

191
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,660
getting a cold shouldn't be a big deal.

192

It's not an illness that doesn't allow you to walk.

- Here.

Commander Kang is here. Governor wants you to go to Hot Spring Villa to meet him.

200

I still need some time to finish this IV.

202
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:41,350
Young Master Mu, Commander Kang is Governor's right-hand man and he thinks very highly of him.

203
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:45,560
You're also Governor's adopted son. If you don't go and greet him in person,

204
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,760
I believe Governor would consider that inappropriate.

Okay. I got it.

- I will wait for you in the car.
- Okay.

Is that so? But it's my first time meeting you.

Look! Once you meet in person,

you can tell Young Master Zizheng is a young talent.

00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:47,080
The illegal salt was confiscated and destroyed.

486
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,480
Commander,

487
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:54,900
we’ve suffered a great loss this time.

488
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:59,780
What did Mr. Sato say?

489
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:04,250
He said you’ve nothing to do with this incident, it was Yoshida’s incompetence.

490
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:08,830
That damn Japanese, we cannot underestimate him.

491
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:13,320
Mu Zizheng was at the scene as well?

492
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,400
For that, I cannot confirm.

493
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,390
It’s because their faces were all covered up.

494
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:25,950
What’s the background of this Mu Zizheng?

495
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:42,950
♫ Who is looking forward to the spring breeze? ♫

496
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:48,090
♫ Who is staring at the moving flowers? ♫

497
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:53,270
♫ Who is watching the galaxy in the summer night ♫

498
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:59,760
♫ Who remembers a shooting star going by in a moment? ♫

499
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:05,550
♫ Who is afraid of heartbreak, denies the heartbeat? ♫

500
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:10,580
♫ Allow loneliness to smear the other’s protective coloration ♫

501
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:15,880
♫ Who would be willing to pass the other like this ♫

502
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:22,980
♫ I also want to be a shooting star to make you warm ♫

503
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:29,940
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

504
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:35,510
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

505
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:41,170
♫ At least the flight will be smooth ♫

506
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:46,800
♫ Waiting for a promise my whole life ♫

507
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,430
♫ I cherish even the short-lived happiness ♫

508
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:57,920
♫ Leave some tenderness to the years ♫

509
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:03,690
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

510
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:09,300
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫

511
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:14,960
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

512
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,440
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

513
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:30,450
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

514
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:40,560
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫
