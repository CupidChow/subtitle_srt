22
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,220
Mu Zizheng!

23
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,120
You have no conscience!

24
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:53,700
How have I been treating you? I was the one who took you in when you were in trouble.

25
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,280
I even adopted you as my son. And you?

26
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,980
You're the spy planted by the Youth Union.

27
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,790
When you were in Xiao Mansion, you attempted to kill me.

28
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:13,350
Do you think you can quietly

29
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,190
get out of it in front of my face?

30
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:21,880
Foster-Father, Commander Kang helped the Japanese import opium and ruined our people.

31
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,790
He has been colluding with the Japanese!

32
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,920
He set up an arsenal and started a firearm business, and tricked innocent individuals to work as manual labor.

33
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,150
They are bullied and tortured.

34
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,630
What he did was work for the Japanese.

35
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:43,460
If you are associated with him, you will be a sinner, slandered for eternity!

36
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,060
You already knew about it?

37
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,230
All I know now is you being a traitor and you betrayed me.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,170
For someone like you, I should send someone to tie you up,

39
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,730
hang you up, and cut you into pieces.

40
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:11,440
But now that everybody knows that you’re my adopted son...

41
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,980
I’ll let you keep your whole body.

42
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,980
Execute yourself.

43
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,820
Father! Father!

44
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,940
Why did you come?

45
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,150
Please spare Zizheng. He saved our lives!

46
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,080
That's not enough reason to let a spy get away.

47
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,680
But...

48
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,400
I love him.

49
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,180
You—

50
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,380
Child, what are you doing?

51
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,200
Father!

52
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:36,210
Is it only if you kill every man I love in this world, then you’ll be satisfied?

53
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,510
I’m your only daughter, and I know about it.

54
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,400
I’m the image of Governor Jin.

55
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,240
I’ve been trying to work on this image.

56
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,560
Today, if you are really

57
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,920
going to kill Zizheng…

58
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,920
Let me tell you…

59
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,920
I promise you that you will also lose your daughter.

60
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,230
- You…
- Sister Rouke!

61
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,230
I don’t deserve you to do this for me.

62
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,080
Foster-Father.

63
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,730
Sister.

64
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,360
Your kindness to me,

65
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,200
I, Mu Zizheng,

66
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,110
can only repay in my next life.

67
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,460
Zizheng! What are you doing? Zizheng!

68
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,850
Zizheng!

69
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,320
No! No!

70
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,320
Father! Let go of me!

71
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:45,300
That shot was your punishment for betraying me.

72
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,690
But you're still alive, that's your reward for once saving me.

73
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:56,300
Brat, remember that from now on, you have absolutely nothing to do with the Jin Family.

74
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,660
You'll never have the Jin Family as your sanctuary again.

75
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,680
- Father!
- If you say one more word, I'll take his life!

76
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,260
Leave!

77
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,590
Father.

78
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,790
Father, are you okay?

79
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,930
I heard you coughing so badly before I entered your room.

80
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,280
Father is fine.

81
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,450
- Father.
- I'm old.

82
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,490
Inevitably, I'll have some minor health issues.

83
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,130
I'm fine.

84
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,550
Father, you don't look well.

85
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,860
Shall I get a doctor for you?

86
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:09,830
It's fine. I just moved in.

87
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,000
Let's not make such big actions.

88
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,370
Father had been staying in prison all these years.

89
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,690
It's natural that my body is weaker.

90
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,010
When I get a chance,

91
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:25,660
I'll nurse my condition, and it will be fine.

92
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,610
Oh, right. Father, I just remembered

93
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,560
that I made stewed pear with rock sugar for you. I'll bring it to you now.

94
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,240
Go ahead.

95
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,410
Have you been coughing up blood again?

96
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,440
Are you not going to tell Hangjing the truth?

97
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,700
Beichen.

98
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,700
We've spoken on this already.

99
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:11,520
I'm only here to see her for the last time.

100
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,660
I don't have much time left.

101
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,830
Now,

102
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,090
with you being by her side,

103
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,440
I'm relieved.

104
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,850
Father, don't worry.

105
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,300
I'll definitely take care of her and love her

106
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,280
for the rest of my life.

107
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,520
I believe in you.

108
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,550
I know it all.

109
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:56,080
Beichen, I'm a bit tired.

110
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,010
I'd like to take some rest here on my own for a while.

111
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:05,570
Okay. We'll be back when you wake up.

112
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,340
Okay.

113
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:23,460
Father, the doctor says that this disease can be cured.

114
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,600
Come to Haidu with me.

115
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,660
There's no need for that.

116
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:36,970
I know what's going on with my body.

117
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,810
You can't just give up like that.

118
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:43,750
Even if it's just for Hangjing, you should at least try.

119
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,780
She's been waiting for you.

120
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,010
Okay.

121
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,410
I'll go.

122
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,320
But you have to promise me one thing.

123
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,490
What is it?

124
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:10,650
Don't tell Hangjing

125
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,430
about my health conditions.

126
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,740
This child has deep thoughts.

127
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,010
If she knows,

128
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,110
she will be very upset.

129
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,390
Wasn't he in a stable condition when we got back from Haidu?

130
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,220
His... his tumor developed too fast.

131
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,990
I'm sorry. We've already tried our best.

132
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,520
What do you mean that you already tried your best?

133
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,410
Beichen.

134
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,660
Beichen.

135
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,260
Don't blame him.

136
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,630
Doctor Li.

137
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,590
You can get back to your work.

138
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,900
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

139
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,750
Beichen, these days...

140
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,830
you've put so much effort...

141
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,150
into taking care of me.

142
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,650
I know it's been tough.

143
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,320
Father.

144
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,050
If Haidu doesn't work, we can still go to Beixin.

145
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,110
We can visit every hospital out there.

146
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,460
We'll find a good doctor.

147
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,920
It won't work.

148
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,190
This time,

149
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:47,250
it's really hopeless.

150
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,580
The doctor has already...

151
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,620
condemned me to death.

152
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,230
Let me take you back home and meet with Hangjing.

153
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,670
Father, she's been waiting for you for six years.

154
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,560
She's been missing you day and night,

155
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,590
hoping she could reunite with you one day.

156
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,230
You said...

157
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,830
that you wish Hangjing could be happy all her life.

158
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,930
If she can't see you again,

159
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,990
it will be the biggest regret of her life.

160
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,550
Father, come home with me.

161
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,150
Okay.

162
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,390
I'll do as you say.

163
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,200
Brother Yong. Brother Yong, you're here.

164
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,500
Brother Yong, believe me. I definitely didn't betray the organization.

165
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,400
I believe that you are innocent.

166
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,800
I know clearly about your conduct.

167
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,000
But even though your identity is exposed,

168
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,200
Jin Cheng didn't kill you.

169
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,800
How are you going to explain this to the organization?

170
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,800
Ultimately, you don't believe me.

171
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,300
How about this?

172
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,000
You shoot me to death. I'm willing to use my life to prove my innocence.

173
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,500
Zizheng, you calm down.

174
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,200
Before the matter is made clear,

175
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,400
you stop your work temporarily first.

176
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,200
Stop temporarily?

177
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,400
Then Brother Yong,

178
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,200
when can I return back to normal?

179
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,800
You settle yourself down first. Don't appear for now.

180
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,000
Ensure your own safety.

181
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,400
I did the best I can. I put in so much.

182
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,400
I even used my life over and over again to fight.

183
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,200
In the end, I cannot even get your trust.

184
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,200
Say, isn't this laughable?

185
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,300
Third Brother.

186
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,600
Governor Jin and Commander Kang already departed back.

187
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,800
Get in touch more with Instructor Du about the garrison matters.

188
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,400
Yes.

189
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,900
Additionally, Mu Zizheng's identity has been exposed.

190
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,000
Governor let him off.

191
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,200
I heard it was Miss Jin who pleaded for him.

192
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,580
This Miss Jin is a sentimentalist.

193
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,610
Except that she chose the wrong person.

194
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,570
A'Qin, come with me. I will treat you well.

195
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:08,900
A—

196
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,200
She eats and drinks well when she follows me.

197
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,000
Follow you? Don't tell me she'll be a beggar woman?

198
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,200
- Young Master, don't say it like that.
- A'Qin,

199
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,800
I know you like me.

200
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,000
- Come with me.
- No.

201
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,200
Who do you think you are?

202
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,400
Take from me? I have had everything since the day I was born.

203
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,800
And you, strive for a lifetime, and you still can't compare to my little finger.

204
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,000
Why is this?

205
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,300
This is fate. Humans need to believe in fate.

206
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,600
A dog being bullied by people can bite back.

207
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,000
What can you do?

208
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,200
You can only lick the mud under my foot!

209
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,800
Lick.

210
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,400
Lick!

211
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,800
- You're great if you have money?
- Who are you? Lunatic.

212
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,300
Fight him! Fight!

213
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,500
Beat!

214
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,600
Wipe the tears.

215
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,580
It's no use when you resent the heavens and people.

216
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,600
Sometimes, the heavens are just this unfair.

217
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,000
And you were alone.

218
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
How can you compete with Xiao Beichen for Lin Hangjing?

219
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,000
You need a helping hand.

220
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,200
Who are you?

221
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,000
You don't need to worry about who I am.

222
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,800
But Mu Zizheng,

223
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,300
Sir Mu, I've heard much about you.

224
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,460
Why did you look for me?

225
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,700
There's a person who wants to meet you.

226
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,400
Perhaps when you meet him, you'll become a new person.

227
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,800
What?

228
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,000
Going back tomorrow? Why in such a hurry?

229
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,800
Yes, Father. Why did you suddenly have this intention?

230
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,400
Yes, I didn't have time to tell you.

231
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,800
The school already knows I was released from prison.

232
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,400
They called and renewed my contract,

233
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,000
asking me to continue to teach.

234
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:00,000
This Principal Zhang is eager to meet me.

235
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:04,220
I agreed.

236
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,200
These two days

237
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,800
that I stayed here, I see that you are doing pretty well.

238
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,000
I'm assured.

239
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,790
But, Father, this...

240
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,000
Father has his own arrangements.

241
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,100
In the future, we can still go and see Father, isn't that so?

242
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,000
In-law, Commander is coming back soon.

243
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,400
You need to at least wait for him to come back and then talk again. Right?

244
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,400
Yes.

245
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,000
It's okay. There will be ample time in the future.

246
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,560
When Haishan is back,

247
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,700
we two old brothers will get together again.

248
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,200
All right. Then, it's a deal.

249
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,000
After you are done with your matters, I will send a car to fetch you back.

250
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:58,200
Thank you for the trouble, Seventh Madam.

251
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,300
But, Father, this is too sudden.

252
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,000
You didn't tell me prior.

253
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,400
How about this? You stay for one more day tomorrow.

254
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,800
I'll bring you around the whole of Beixin City, okay?

255
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,400
In-law, it's filial piety gesture from Hangjing. Say yes to her.

256
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,700
Yes.

257
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:22,600
The two of you just reunited. Keep her company for a few more days.

258
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,000
Father, I can't bear for you to leave so quickly.

259
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,200
Keep me company for one more day, okay?

260
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,400
- Father, you...
- Hangjing,

261
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,200
I'll keep you company for one more day.

262
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
That's great.

263
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:02,000
You're the person Zheng Fengqi says wants to meet me?

264
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,800
We met before at the pier.

265
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,600
Please take a seat.

266
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,200
Sir Mu, congratulations.

267
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,000
What are you congratulating me for?

268
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,800
Sir Mu, you're now no longer the adopted son of Governor Jin,

269
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,800
also, you're not part of the Youth Union.

270
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:36,500
You're free to show off your talent in this brand-new world.

271
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,900
Isn't it a great, joyous matter?

272
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
What exactly do you want?

273
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,400
Collaboration.

274
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,600
We have reciprocity needs and mutual benefits.

275
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,800
I think you found the wrong person.

276
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,000
I'm nothing at all and a nobody now.

277
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,400
I'm totally worthless.

278
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,900
No.

279
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,200
What we're looking for

280
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,800
is your ambition and hatred.

281
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,400
That's the power of motivation.

282
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,800
Sir Mu,

283
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:18,000
in a chaotic world, how can you stand out and

284
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,200
be on top of everyone?

285
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,000
Without any strong backbone support,

286
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,200
you'll forever be the weed on the ground, stepped over by everybody else.

287
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,800
As long as you agree,

288
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:37,900
we will be the biggest assistant behind you.

289
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,300
What exactly are you trying to do?

290
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,200
Aren't you simply doing business in Beixin?

291
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,900
I'm sorry, I've no interest in business.

292
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,340
I'm leaving.

293
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,800
Sir, as you heard it yourself,

294
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:25,000
this person is down to nothing and yet, he still refused to work with us.

295
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:30,100
Everybody has a combination of fears and desires.

296
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,700
As long as we find his missing piece,

297
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,000
we'll able to control everything.

298
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,800
Mu Zizheng has no exception.

299
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,200
Look at Zheng Fengqi.

300
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,500
She is the best example.

301
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,800
We need Chinese people to work for us.

302
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,500
And Mu Zizheng needs an opportunity to come back.

303
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,100
That's why he'll definitely...

304
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,000
agree to work with us.

305
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,400
Little windmills!

306
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,710
Little windmills!

307
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,800
[Yunni Fabric Store]

308
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,600
[Yunni Fabric Store]
 Do you want to buy a windmill?

309
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,600
Father.

310
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,300
Why are we at the tailor shop?

311
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,900
You'll know when you go in.

312
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,700
Come.

313
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Third Young Madam.

314
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,500
I heard you and your father were coming, we've already set up everything for you.

315
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,800
Look at these fabrics. They're top quality imported products.

316
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,200
Ninth Daughter, I'll be leaving tomorrow. Why are we ordering new clothes?

317
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,250
Father, these fabrics are from the Soviet Union.

318
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,800
We rarely have them in the south.

319
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,800
Not only are they soft but they keep warmth and absorb humidity.

320
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:49,200
The winter weather in the south is cold and humid. I will send them over when they're ready.

321
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,800
Father, do you like them?

322
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,400
As long as you like it, I'll like it too.

323
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,200
Please take the measurement.

324
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,200
Xiao Xin!

325
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:13,200
Tailor, my father is very active and sweats a lot.

326
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,200
Please make the collar and cuffs wider.

327
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,400
Got it.

328
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,800
Wider collar and cuffs.

329
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,800
Collar 50cm!

330
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,400
Sir, please.

331
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,200
Candied haw! Fragrant and sweet candied haw!

332
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,200
It's big and sweet. If it's not sweet, it is free.

333
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,000
Candied haw! If it's not sweet, it is free.

334
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,400
Wait here.

335
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,800
It's big and sweet.

336
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,600
Sir, you want one?

337
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,400
- I want one.
- Here you go.

338
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,600
This is the biggest one.

339
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,100
Take care.

340
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,300
Father, are you treating me like a child?

341
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,800
No matter when it is,

342
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,800
you're always a little girl in my eyes.

343
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,600
It's very sweet.

344
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,400
Get on.

345
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,800
Candied haw!

346
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,390
Father, I can't bear for you to leave.

347
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,200
I don't want to leave you either.

348
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,600
Okay, I promise you.

349
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,400
When I'm done with everything there,

350
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,600
I'll come back and see you.

351
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,000
Really?

352
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,810
Then, you must promise me.

353
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,800
You cannot lie to me.

354
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,400
Okay.

355
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,500
Father, I also...

356
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:16,000
want to hear you telling me story like you used to do when I was young.

357
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
Okay?

358
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,400
Sure.

359
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:38,400
I'll tell you a story about Katie's gift.

360
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,000
A long, long time ago,

361
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,800
there was a beautiful...

362
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,800
and kind girl

363
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:55,600
named Katie.

364
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:01,300
Katie's father loves her very much.

365
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,900
He might be a merchant, and he has to go on trips occasionally.

366
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:14,000
But every time when he returned from his trip,

367
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,800
he'd give Katie a different gift.

368
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,800
The first time,

369
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,940
Katie's father...

370
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,400
brought her a music box.

371
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:34,200
He said every time when he opens this music box,

372
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,810
he feels like he is listening...

373
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,600
to Katie's singing voice.

374
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,600
This music box was keeping him company on the journey.

375
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:51,000
Finally, it became his gift to Katie.

376
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,800
How about the second time?

377
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,800
The second time.

378
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:00,300
The second gift was a pair of dancing shoes.

379
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:07,000
Katie's father sees Katie growing up every day.

380
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,700
He thinks soon enough, Katie would be able to dance at the town ball.

381
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,980
He wants Katie...

382
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,800
to wear the most beautiful dancing shoes,

383
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,800
enjoy the happiness to her fullest.

384
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,800
And then?

385
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:32,000
Later on,

386
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,590
a friend of Katie's father...

387
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:41,040
brought back a gift from her father.

388
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,200
It was a tree brand.

389
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:54,000
Do you want to know the ending of this story?

390
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,200
It's because...

391
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,400
her father cannot come back anymore.

392
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,430
He wanted to plant this tree branch...

393
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,290
into the soil,

394
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,730
and let it grow slowly.

395
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,400
He wanted to use this way...

396
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,400
to keep his beloved daughter company.

397
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:22,930
Father. Father! Father!

398
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:27,350
Doctor! Doctor! Someone quickly come!

399
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,390
Doctor, what happened to my father?

400
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,890
Speak up. How is he?

401
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:56,650
Seventh Madam. Third Master.

402
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,510
Third Young Madam.

403
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,610
Sir Lin... is gone.

404
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,160
How could it be?

405
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,870
What did you say?

406
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:22,000
Sir Lin indeed has no pulse or breathing.

407
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,830
You're saying nonsense!

408
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:33,120
My father was just fine last night.

409
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:37,160
He was telling me stories. How is it possible?

410
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,190
How is it possible?

411
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:43,370
Sir Lin stayed in prison for many years. He was very weak already.

412
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,690
He got a very serious lung disease a long time ago.

413
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:51,590
It seems like he has been trying hard to hold on.

414
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:57,790
Now it's true that we can't bring him back. My condolences.

415
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,220
Father.

416
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:13,430
The doctor must have been wrong.

417
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,100
I'll go find a better doctor for my father!

418
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,120
- Hangjing!
- Let go of me!

419
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,730
I'll find a doctor for my father! Let go of me!

420
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:22,460
Hangjing!

421
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,160
Father is gone.

422
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,990
No.

423
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:34,110
My father just came back to me.

424
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,760
He wouldn't just be gone like this.

425
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:42,120
He wouldn't. He wouldn't just be gone.

426
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,070
No.

427
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,430
My father wouldn't be gone.

428
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,890
Father. Father.

429
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,170
Father.

430
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:05,610
I still have so many things to tell you.

431
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:12,060
I've been waiting for you for six years. I've been missing you day and night.

432
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,240
You just came back to my side.

433
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,450
You can't just leave like this.

434
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,430
Father...

435
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,150
Wake up, Father!

436
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,290
Father...

437
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,100
[Rest in Peace]

438
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,130
[Rest in Peace]

439
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,840
[In Memory of Father Lin Tangsheng]

440
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,200
[Place of the Late Sir Lin Tangsheng]

441
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,710
Father.

442
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,630
I will make sure...

443
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,660
to live up to my promise to you.

444
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,410
Miss Fengqi, it's all sorted out.

445
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,890
Lin Tangsheng was bailed out of jail half a year ago.

446
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:44,810
And he's been staying in a personal sanatorium ever since.

447
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:49,060
We also found that Third Master Xiao would go visit him every once in a while.

448
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:51,600
That means...

449
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,400
he knew it very early on?

450
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,570
Yes, I suppose so.

451
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:09,550
Well done. That small house in the east is yours now.

452
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:12,250
Really? Thank you, Miss Fengqi.

453
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,100
Miss Fengqi, the film has been shown 100 times consecutively. It broke three of our company's records.

454
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:26,640
The fans are flooding in to take a photo with you!

455
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:30,890
That means people do agree with the idea

456
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:34,780
that conspiracy and love are closely related.

457
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,430
Yes, yes.

458
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:56,770
Manager Wang, which line in the film do you think is my favorite?

459
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:05,560
My favorite is, "As long as...

460
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,960
your heart has been hurt,

461
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:13,360
every corner you see with your eyes

462
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,740
will be blurry."

463
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:14,510
My Lady, please eat something.

464
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:02,290
Why isn't anybody going in and out? Did something happen?

465
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:23,550
♫ Who is looking forward to the spring breeze? ♫

466
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:28,780
♫ Who is staring at the moving flowers? ♫

00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:33,890
♫ Who is watching the galaxy in the summer night ♫

468

♫ Who remembers a shooting star going by in a moment? ♫

469
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:46,140
♫ Who is afraid of heartbreak, denies the heartbeat? ♫

470
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:51,300
♫ Allow loneliness to smear the other’s protective coloration ♫

471
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:56,570
♫ Who would be willing to pass the other like this ♫

472
00:43:56,570 --> 00:44:03,730
♫ I also want to be a shooting star to make you warm ♫

♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

482
00:44:55,530 --> 00:45:00,990
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

484
