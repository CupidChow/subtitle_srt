Now you're trying to get a bunch of girls from poor families to school.

But they only care about how to make a living.

152
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:22,150
Going to school means nothing to them.

153
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,390
Not just them. Even girls from rich families

154

155
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,860
It's exactly because people think as you do

156
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,280
that for thousands of years, women have been the subordinates and slaves of men.

157

There's no need to mention masters and their maids. Even husbands and wives, how many of them are truly equal?

158
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,850
If we want to change that situation, we need to start by educating girls.

159
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:50,220
Okay. The equality you're talking about, what is it exactly?

160
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,280
It's independence.

161
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:58,690
When women are educated, they can find better jobs and become financially independent.

They can spend their own money and there's no need to feel inferior and seek others' approval.

163
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:08,770
And they don't need to worry about having nothing when they're abandoned.

164
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,670
And second, spiritual independence.

165
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,320
When girls are educated,

166
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,480
they'll know that they're not the property of men.

167
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,330
There's no need to feel inferior to men.

168
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:27,320
That way, they can move towards their goals in life.

169
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,630
According to what you just said, are there such women in the world?

170
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:36,320
Of course! In China, we had Tang Qunying and Qiu Jin.

171
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,150
They were equally able as men and were involved in overthrowing the monarchy and establishing the republic.

172
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:47,240
And in current times, Wang Minzhen from the Jinlin Girls College did an in-depth study on statistical physics.

173
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,790
Abroad, there's the female physicist Madame Curie,

174
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:55,510
She won the Nobel Prize twice when it was still the Qing Dynasty in our country.

175
00:13:55,510 --> 00:14:01,090
And Florence Nightingale, she established the foundations for the modern nursing industry.

176
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:05,500
She saved countless injured soldiers in the war just by herself.

177
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,710
These women are the best role models for women in the new era just like us.

178
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,020
So... you mean, if you teach them,

179
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,910
they'll be able to reach such a high achievement?

180
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,160
Of course, I'm not that amazing.

181
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,060
I can only teach them the basics.

182
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:28,490
But I hope that in our country, there can be more exceptional women like them.

183
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:34,490
This is the meaning of the girls school! Even if we only have one student, it will be worth it.

184
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:45,940
My Lady, do you want to keep shopping?

185
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:51,190
We can return. There's nothing new in the department store.

186
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,800
My Lady, are they shooting a film over there?

187
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,290
Let's go check it out. Looks like a lot of fun.

188
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:02,850
Fine. We're bored anyway.

189
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,020
Excuse me! Excuse me!

190
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,000
Miss Jiaman.

191
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,740
Director.

192
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,130
- Look, for this scene...
- My lady, look!

193
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:16,080
- She's so pretty!
- This shot is very important.

194
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,590
We can delete this line. And this.

195
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,190
Okay.

196
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:24,220
This act is mainly to show the ambiguous love between you and the male lead.

197
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,680
You need to create an atmosphere like that.

198
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,180
- Okay.
- Sister Fengqi?

199
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,740
According to the script...

200
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,360
Shuyi!

201
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,940
Hangjing!

202
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,260
You're here!

203
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,950
Hangjing!

204
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,750
Why did you ask us to come here so early in the morning?

205
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,110
The dark circles on your eyes are so heavy!

206
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:58,050
It's fine. I think our previous enrollment notice was a bit too rhetorical.

207
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:01,030
So I made some revisions last night.

208
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,630
So this is what kept you up all night!

209
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,140
- Here.
- If girls can learn to read,

210
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:13,230
they can understand loan receipts and title deeds,

211
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:17,660
and recruitment notices, so they won't be lied to.

212
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:22,460
If they learn math, when buying food, clothes, and shoes,

213
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,130
they can record and calculate the costs by themselves.

214
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:28,080
There's no need to beg people, and they won't suffer losses.

215
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,550
What do you think?

216
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,980
- It's quite good.
- It's great.

217
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,130
This is great. This is called “finding the right remedy to cure the disease".

218
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:37,870
These are things that girls from average families care about the most!

219
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,940
Then the students and their parents will understand the benefits of going to school!

220
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,740
- That's great!
- It will make things much easier!

221
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,100
Let's send them out!

222
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,460
Okay.

223
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,960
Please don't be anxious. Wait a moment.

224
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,680
Such a long queue!

225
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,480
Haven't they finished?

226
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,120
- Thank you, teacher.
- Next one.

227
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,670
We finally got you enrolled!

228
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:21,500
Young Third Madam... Miss Lin.

229
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,690
Last time, you asked us to think about it.

230
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,250
And now we've made our decision.

231
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,120
We want her to go to school!

232
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,600
As parents, we can't hold our daughter back.

233
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,080
Math, reading, physics, and chemistry, we want her to learn everything!

234
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,570
- Hurry up, please!
- Please be quiet!

235
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:43,950
- Hangjing, there are so many people. I'll get the enrollment forms.
- Please be quiet. I'll make sure everyone has a chance.

236
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:47,250
Okay? Please be quiet!

237
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:50,520
Done. Please put your fingerprint here.

238
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,620
We should have come earlier!

239
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,220
Here.

240
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,800
- Thank you, Teacher!
- Thank you!

241
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,830
- We're enrolled! Let's go back there.
- Let's go.

242
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,570
Let's go.

243
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,940
Keep it safe.

244
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,760
Teacher Wei, I've got something to do. Can you help me with this?

245
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,950
Okay. You can go do your things.

246
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:19,450
Please don't be anxious. Please queue here.

247
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,000
I’ll make sure every one of your daughters can be enrolled!

248
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,700
That's great!

249
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,130
[Walk on the right side]

250
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,490
What did I say?

251
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,920
I didn't expect so many people to enroll.

252
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,410
Isn't that right? What a long queue.

253
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,370
- It's just right there.
- Let's go.

254
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,640
[Ming Yu Yue]

255
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,670
Everyone, we'll do this one by one. There's no need to hurry. Third Master said

256
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:51,200
that as long as you enroll in Chengjing Girls School, we'll pay the tuition fee for you!

257
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,540
It's for free!

258
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,490
If you can attend classes for one month without missing any,

259
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,470
we'll reward you with one silver dollar each month!

260
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,220
Third Master also said, that from today on,

261
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,540
girls who graduate from Chengjing Girls School

262
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:10,490
will get a job with the help of the Beixin Chamber of Commerce.

263
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,430
So everyone can use the skills they've learned and support themselves.

264
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:16,330
Great!

265
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,590
Don't rush. Stand in the queue!

266
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,100
- Uncle Zhao.
- You're here.

267
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,170
- I'll go inside first.
- Please.

268
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,740
Third Master, is that true about what you said?

269
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,810
As long as our daughter attends Chengjing Girls School,

270
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,770
she'll be able to work in the hospital,

271
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:36,290
the bank, and shipping companies in the future?

272
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,390
To serve rich gentlemen

273
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,340
and ladies, is that true?

274
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:44,620
Of course. But she's going there to work.

275
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:48,260
Not to serve people. When she learns some skills,

276
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:53,230
she'll be providing service to the customers, not serving them. Do you understand?

277
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,960
Yes, yes. Third Master,

278
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,590
she's not going to be rejected by those places. Right?

279
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:02,750
Please be assured. The Tax Bureau is drafting up new policies.

280
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,410
Companies hiring graduates from Chengjing Girls School

281
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:08,840
will receive a 20% tax deduction each year.

282
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,140
As long as I am in Beixin,

283
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,550
the policy will not be changed!

284
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:17,430
That's great!

285
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:21,200
If we have more independent women in our times,

286
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,100
then we'll have less miserable mothers,

287
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,970
broken families, and unfortunate souls.

288
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:31,090
And all of that comes from education.

289
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:34,930
So today, I'm willing to stand out and sponsor girls for their education.

290
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:38,170
In the future, we'll build more schools for girls.

291
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,130
So girls can be just like boys,

292
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,250
and have a career of their own.

293
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,720
Well said!

294
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,110
Bravo!

295
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,980
Please queue here!

296
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,090
We'll do it one by one. No need to rush.

297
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,230
How come you have come?

298
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:20,440
Third Brother, thank you.

299
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,970
Are you all right?

300
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,520
I'm fine.

301
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,760
Hangjing.

302
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,710
Hangjing. Wake up.

303
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,850
Let's take the medicine.

304
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,710
Here, open your mouth.

305
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,380
- How is it?
- Third Brother, come take a look.

306
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:53,280
Instructor Du is amazing! He has decoded the passwords.

307
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,950
I did make some effort, thanks to Weiyi's detailed observation.

308
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:00,700
Weiyi said this confidential telegram was put together with a dictionary.

309
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,020
Each English letter and each number

310
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:07,630
correspond to the dictionary's volume, page number, and line.

311
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:10,130
That's how I found the associated Chinese letters.

312
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:14,850
After listing them in a sequence, this is the final result.

313
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:20,220
Even if we know the mole's codename, where should we start the investigation?

314
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,460
What we can confirm is

315
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:28,430
the bookstore is the meeting point between the mole and Commander Kang.

316
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:32,390
As for the intel list we got, we can no longer move any further.

317
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:35,650
Since we now know the mole's meeting point,

318
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:39,710
let's just wait until he shows up.

319
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:44,630
You mean to lure him out?

320
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,500
My Lady, what do you think?

321
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,000
Third Master asked someone to decorate this for days.

322
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,110
Who do you think he does this for?

323
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:07,920
Jin Xiang, I think you talk too much lately.

324
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:13,730
I'm not. I can see you and Third Master's relationship is getting better and better.

325
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,370
Young Third Madam.

326
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:25,280
there is a guest in the living room. Commander and Madam want you to be there.

327
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,780
Who is that?

328
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:30,030
Division Commander Zheng's daughter is back from France.

329
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:33,200
Isn't that the person Fourth Lady always mentioned...

330
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:43,520
- Uncle Xiao.
- Fengqi, you must have been in France for five or six years.

331
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,820
I haven't seen you guys for so long.

332
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,140
Father. Seventh Aunt.

333
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,110
Jiaman?

334
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,110
Hangjing?

335
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,420
How come you're here?

336
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,960
You two know each other?

337
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,620
That's great. Fengqi, you might not know,

338
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:06,130
Hangjing is now the wife of Beichen.

339
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,570
It turns out you are Third Brother's wife?

340
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,720
It's such an amazing coincidence.

341
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,220
Master, there is a phone call from East Main Camp.

342
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,680
Okay. Please take care of the guest.

343
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,870
- Okay.
- Let's go.

344
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,610
Come on in and take a seat.

345
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:28,510
Let's go. Sit down.

346
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:33,880
A few days ago, at Da Mei Department Store, it was thanks to Hangjing for taking down the thief.

347
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,670
Otherwise, my wallet would have been gone.

348
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:39,520
Our Hangjing has a passionate heart, she loves helping people.

349
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,000
Since you've known each other, that's great. I don't need to introduce you to each other.

350
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,920
Look at you two, you've grown so much.

351
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,470
Do you still remember Sister Fengqi?

352
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,160
I carried you two when you were young.

353
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,440
Sister Fengqi, you're very pretty.

354
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,320
Sister Fengqi, I've been longing for your return.

355
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,270
Now that you're here, you cannot leave again.

356
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,070
You need to stay here and be my company.

357
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:03,940
You haven't changed a bit, still like a child.

358
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,410
What's going on, sounding so happy?

359
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:08,050
Third Brother, see who is here?

360
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,360
Little Rice Dumpling?

361
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,530
Little Curly?

362
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,830
When did you get back?

363
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:15,440
I've been back for a few days already.

364
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,060
I can finally see you.

365
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,320
I can't believe you still remember my nickname.

366
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,010
How can I forget?

367
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,000
Though she looks like a proper lady now,

368
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,020
she used to wrap herself in so many layers.

369
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:32,590
Well, I see you are a military leader now but when you were a boy your hair was so curly

370
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:35,270
that you could barely comb it straight. And that made you cry.

371
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,420
No, I didn't.

372
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,090
Yes, you did.

373
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,480
Let's take a seat.

374
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,890
Come and sit down.

375
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,360
What is it?

376
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,730
Oh, I can't believe you're still drinking the strawberry-flavored soda.

377
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,850
It's been ages.

378
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:58,190
You liked soda when you were little, too.

379
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,850
What was the brand you liked?

380
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:03,510
Shanhai Pass, right?

381
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:07,480
Well, Sister Fengqi knows Third Brother the best!

382
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,410
I doubt it.

383
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:11,360
Of course, I do.

384
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,630
From a young age, you have been a germaphobe.

385
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:17,180
You couldn't bear any stains on your clothes or bedding.

386
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:21,950
I remember when we were at school, Seventh Aunt made so many trips to school to get you changed into clean clothes.

387
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:26,210
- Am I right, Seventh Aunt?
- You're right. Beichen was such a demanding kid.

388
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,830
I see what it is now. It's a get-together for criticizing me.

389
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:32,360
Yes, that's right!

390
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,760
- Fengqi.
- Father.

391
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,760
I thought you were happy living at home. Why are you moving to the Xiao residence?

392
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,300
And I thought...

393
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,790
you didn't tell them that you were back.

394
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,970
I met Shuyi when I was on the set today.

395
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,210
I couldn't argue with her.

396
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:05,600
Also, I visited Uncle Xiao and Seventh Aunt today.

397
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:11,550
So, you have met Third Master Xiao and Lin Hangjing, too?

398
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:15,940
You know, you don't have to if it upsets you.

399
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:19,800
Father, I know what you're worried about.

400
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,920
To be honest, he isn't the reason why I came back.

401
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,160
See, I didn't tell Third Brother about my return.

402
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,810
Actually, I came back for my career.

403
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:32,530
Does that mean you don't care about Xiao Beichen anymore?

404
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:36,410
When I was in France, the most important thing I learned was that

405
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,870
the freedom and carefree attitude of the French people.

406
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:43,340
Though I can't be together with the person I like, I still want to wish them happiness.

407
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,510
Environment indeed has its influence on people.

408
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:10,420
Look at Fengqi. She has changed so much.

409
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:14,940
But I think now she sees Beichen as a good friend.

410
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,870
I knew you were worried about it.

411
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:20,770
I didn't want to see the jokes told by us

412
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:23,610
to drive wedges between the children.

413
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:28,550
How is that possible? It may bring them closer. Who knows.

414
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,300
Also, now that you asked Fengqi to stay with us,

415
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:37,360
I hope Old Zheng won't be so angry with me.

416
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,780
He is such a stubborn man.

417
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,100
It's good that our families are seen more often together.

418
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:47,510
In case people with ill intentions get the opportunity to harm our relationship.

419
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:08,980
Are you scared? Hold my hand.

420
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:13,550
I'm not scared.

421
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:28,280
You're moving like a rabbit.

422
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,280
How am I supposed to fall asleep with you moving like that?

423
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,360
Father.

424
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,310
Third Master, good timing.

425
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:46,030
There's something you need to know.

426
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,590
There's a telegram from Wu Zhiping from the third brigade of the eastern area.

427
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:53,630
He wants to join the Ying Army.

428
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,160
Wu Zhiping?

429
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:59,710
He has an army of 3,000 soldiers. And he is a great general.

430
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:02,010
Are you planning to take him in

431
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:05,720
- or—
- Because he has a great force,

432
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:10,080
I heard Kang Jingxiong wants him, too.

433
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,340
If we take him in right now,

434
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:16,660
we will surely offend Kang Jingxiong.

435
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:20,700
No matter what, both Kang Jingxiong and I serve Governor Jin.

436
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:26,900
We're not yet to the point that we have to sever our relationship. That's why I want to know your opinion.

437
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:32,050
Father, there's something I need to tell you.

438
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:36,970
We suspect there is a mole among the high ranks inside the Ying Army.

439
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:40,260
This person has been in contact with Kang Jingxiong.

440
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:45,490
When I was on duty at Huyang Pass, I discovered something quite suspicious.

441
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:49,760
I asked Zijun and Weiyi to investigate it in secret. Then we found

442
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,500
it wasn't as simple as we thought.

443
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:56,480
I know the high-rank officers

444
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,040
are men that have been through fire and water with you.

445
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,570
If I didn't get solid evidence,

446
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:06,310
I wouldn't dare bring it up to you.

447
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,850
Please take a look.

448
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,650
[I, Wu Zhiping, would like to join your ranks. I hope you can take us in.]

449
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:38,380
Regarding this matter, I hope you can trust me.

450
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:41,500
Your uncles...

451
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,290
are all my right-hand men.

452
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,810
They’re also your team of support in the future.

453
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:53,350
You need to remember this motto, “The worst thing in the army is to be suspicious of each other.

454
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:57,720
The power of three armies can be defeated by suspicion."

455
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,000
What if after the investigation they are proven to be innocent?

456
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,130
Such procedures will damage their faith in us and the faith of the soldiers.

457
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:12,580
So, we have to stay put before we can pin it down.

458
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,330
Father,

459
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:20,130
I hope you can take some time and consider Wu Zhiping's request.

460
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,740
I hope you can stage a show with me.

461
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,320
I told my mother that...

462
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,060
Shuyi, look.

463
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:48,080
Is this for me?

464
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,750
It's so pretty.

465
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,620
Put it on and try it.

466
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,470
Here.

467
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,650
- Like this?
- Let me help you.

468
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:02,080
Tilt it a little.

469
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,230
- Like this?
- So pretty.

470
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,320
Thank you, Sister Fengqi.

471
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,640
It suits you.

472
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:13,990
Right, Sister Fengqi. The French you taught me yesterday

473
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:18,160
Je...

474
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,780
It's so hard. My tongue is twisted.

475
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:24,340
Practice makes perfect. If you like French, I can teach you every day.

476
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:28,220
That's great. But what does it mean?

477
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:32,070
It means "I love you."

478
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:36,570
You can say it to Eldest Young Master Shen when you see him.

479
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:39,050
Now even you are making fun of me.

480
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,740
You know, this is not only the first French phrase I taught you,

481
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,950
it's also my best wish to you.

482
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:49,210
I hope you can live happily together as a loving couple.

483
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:51,880
Then it will be your wish coming true.

484
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,940
Sister Fengqi, you are so good to me.

485
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:58,570
You are the only one who understands me.

486
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:00,870
I really wish you could marry my third brother

487
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:03,460
and become my sister-in-law. Compared to you,

488
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:07,090
Lin Hangjing is nothing. I don't get why Third Brother

489
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:09,540
is so into her.

490
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,940
I think Hangjing is a nice person.

491
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:21,020
She is pretty, elegant, educated, and intelligent.

492
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:24,690
And she is doing a lot for the poor.

493
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,710
She is the kind of person who makes you want to know her.

494
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:31,330
I don't understand why you dislike her so much.

495
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:33,780
You think she is elegant? You're so wrong.

496
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,690
She is a person who lives in disguise.

497
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:40,060
She doesn't like Third Brother at all. It's very unfair on him.

498
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,300
What do you mean?

499
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:46,280
Sister Fengqi, let me tell you a secret.

500
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,350
Lin Hangjing's first love lives in Beixin.

501
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,340
He sells kites.

502
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,400
- A kite seller?
- That's right.

503
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,070
She is a lady from an educated family after all.

504
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:02,520
Why is she close with someone who sells kites?

505
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,980
His name is Mu Zizheng.

506
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:11,240
But I heard that he has gone missing.

507
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,680
I guess he left her for the better.

508
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,730
That's why she changed her mind and decided to marry my brother.

509
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:19,860
Unbelievable, right? What makes me angrier is that

510
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,850
my brother agreed to marry her.

511
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:26,040
I dislike every bit of Lin Hangjing.

512
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,400
I think my brother has lost his mind.

513
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:30,490
I don't understand.

514
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:33,430
Right? But it's true!

515
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,980
Commander.

516
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:59,220
Am I pretty?

517
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,720
What is that thing on your head?

518
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:07,110
Je t’aime.

519
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:10,370
Mon coeur bat si vite.

520
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:14,490
Shuyi, what are you saying?

521
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:17,710
Mind you may bite your tongue.

522
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:21,780
Seventh Aunt, you know nothing. This is French.

523
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:26,330
Enough! It's too early for your nonsense.

524
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:30,140
Where are the pheasant feathers on your head from?

525
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,780
That is very improper.

526
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,990
They are not pheasant feathers!

527
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:38,370
Sister Fengqi was wrong about you. You're so ancient.

528
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:42,640
Look at your sister-in-law. You have a lot to learn from her.

529
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,430
Everything she does she does it well.

530
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:46,230
She has done a great job at running the school.

531
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,800
Everyone praises her out there.

532
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,000
Father, don't you remember you didn't agree with her school idea at the beginning?

533
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,750
Now that people are starting to praise her, you are losing your stand.

534
00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:00,930
Shuyi, you have been quite rude recently. Is it how you are supposed to talk to your father?

535
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:04,670
I think we should send you to Hangjing's school so that you can learn some manners.

536
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:09,340
I will never go to her school. Never.

537
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,780
Je t’aime.

538
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,650
Mon coeur bat si vite.

539
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:19,290
She's crazy.

540
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,960
It's 8:00. He hasn't shown up. I'm worried he won't come.

541
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,140
Wu Zhiping has spread the information.

542
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:38,600
He will come. Stay put.

543
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,990
Yes.

Boss, what's wrong with those people? They made such a scene.

You go there! Seal off the place!
