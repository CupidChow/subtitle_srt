33
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,700
My father had been worried about me for half of his life.

34
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,000
It was because of my mother that...

35
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,400
I hated him half of my life.

36
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:42,050
He wanted me to be good, be mature.

37
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,560
And me, I did the opposite.

38
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,620
I went out all the time and didn't do well academically.

39
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,350
Now that I think about it,

40
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
my relationship with my father

41
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,800
was actually shown through fighting against each other.

42
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,900
It's the same as my mother.

43
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,980
Now that he's gone,

44
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,000
I can no longer apologize to him.

45
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,340
I cannot apologize to him in person.

Third Brother,

47
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,020
I'm sure Father will not blame you.

48
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,430
People said that father and son are linked with each other.

49
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,600
These things you wanted to say to him,

50
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,400
I'm sure he was aware of it.

51
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,300
Do you know?

52
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,110
I once took an oath,

53
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,800
I would absolutely not become a man like him.

54
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,200
I hated his blind devotion,

55
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,600
his stubbornness.

56
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,100
What I hated the most was his refusal to change.

57
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,600
But when I joined the army,

58
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,800
leading hundreds and thousands of soldiers,

59
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,750
then I realized it on the battlefield...

60
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:24,740
that nothing can be accomplished without rules and regulations.

61
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,290
I couldn't share any of his burdens and concerns.

62
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,900
And yet, for our family,

63
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,900
he gave up too much.

64
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,130
I owe him...

65
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,270
too much.

66
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,960
Third Brother,

67
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,200
just like the way you show your respect for your father,

68
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,100
I'm sure he had been very proud of you.

69
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,400
He handed over the Ying Army to you

70
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,200
before he left to the United States for his medical treatment.

71
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,000
This proved that...

72
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,400
he trusted you and that he knew you would do better.

73
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,200
He knew he could count on you.

74
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,890
That's why...

75
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,800
you must pull yourself together.

76
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,400
You can't let him down.

77
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,680
I believe one day...

78
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,300
the Japanese will pay with their blood.

79
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:15,200
Director Sato, there is news from our Beiping intelligence unit.

80
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,700
Xiao Haishan had indeed returned home one day earlier.

81
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,400
He took the ride the next day back to Beixin.

82
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,200
But for some strange reason, Xiao Haishan's convoy

83
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,600
waited for a long time and part of the cars turned around to where they came from.

84
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,200
Any news from Xiao Beichen?

85
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,400
Xiao Beichen has done nothing unusual.

86
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,600
During that time, they even invited ambassadors from Germany and the United States for dinner.

87
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
Also, everybody at the Xiao residence

88
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,200
have been busy preparing for Xiao Haishan's 60th birthday celebration.

89
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,200
- Birthday party?
- That's right.

90
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,400
Xiao Beichen even notified all the Beixin elites to attend the event.

91
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:54,300
He also invited the most famous quadruple singing group in Beiping to perform.

92
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,000
Everything seems very organized, it doesn't look like last-minute planning.

If it's fake, it would have to have loopholes.

But based on the current situation, we don't see any flaws.

102
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,500
I was less anxious.

103
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,670

but other than praying for miracles,

109
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,600
I really don't know what else I can do.

110
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,830
Remember when you came to me for Zizheng?

111
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:59,800
I think you should understand how I feel at this moment.

and foreign ministers to push for you.

116

If that's the case, our winning chances will go up.

No matter how Jiang Zhaoyi and the group of Japanese reverse black and white,

118
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,090
it is also impossible for the committee to make hasty decisions despite the pressure of public opinion.

00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,290
You can hit or scold me.

178
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:32,060
I'm sorry.

179
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,640
Why would I resent you?

180
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,420
Resent you because of the big picture and the pressures you have undertaken?

And bearing the pain? Or resent you for hiding this news from me?

00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,640
Or resent you for letting the army fall into decline?

183
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,230
Tell me. Why should I resent you?

184

to explain something to you.

189
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:41,890
The Xiao family went through a great misfortune.

190
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:47,730
The splendor and prosperity of the past have vanished like smoke into thin air.

I know how everyone feels.

202
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,380
Third Master, you now know

203
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,470
how much your father had pondered over you.

204
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,140
As the eldest son of the Xiao family,

205
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,790
you should be like your father

206
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,760
and become an upstanding and dauntless person.

207
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,180
How can a country be a country without a country? What is family?

208
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,710
If you only live in this half of the world for your own selfishness

209
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:12,320
and don't take the vicious enemies seriously,

210
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,750
he will only seek his own death.

211
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:22,070
There's death and ruin in our Xiao family.

212
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,280
This is a lesson.

213
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,760
I'm making this decision for the Xiao family today.

214
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,640
All assets of the Xiao family will be sold off and turned into military expenses.

215
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:39,320
Xiao Beichen, this revenge for the country

216
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,790
must be undertaken.

217
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:44,910
Seventh Aunt, don't worry.

218
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,960
If I don't slaughter those Japanese people who harmed my country,

219
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,730
everything will be in vain for my father.

221
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,530
You and Third Master went through ups and downs for many years

00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,740
and have finally reunited.

223
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,500
You both must cherish this fate.

224
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,800
Especially you, Third Master.

225
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,410
You must take good care of Hangjing.

226
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,730
Never disappoint her.

227
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,850

229
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,540
you adopted Yanqing's child.

230
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,950
You are now a mother.

231
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:52,270
You have grown up and are sensible now.

232
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,590
You must raise Ke'er well.

233
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:59,660
His father was a great hero.

234
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,690
Take good care of him.

235
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:06,150
I know. Don't worry.

236
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,870
Ke'er is now my biological child.

237
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,080
Don't think of serving me again.

238
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,680
In a few days, I will go to America.

239
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,220
Cherish this time before the war

240
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,600
and go back to your hometown now.

241
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,150
It will be troublesome for you to remain in Beixin.

242
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,890
Don't hold up Third Master.

243
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,480
Seventh Aunt...

244
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,050
How can we feel at ease when you are going alone to such a distant place?

245
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,990
Being away from Fifth Master and Sixth Master for so many years,

246
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,350
I miss them too.

247
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:47,490
I want to take a look at their lives

248
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:50,110
where they were studying.

249
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,220
Let me fulfill my wish.

250
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,610

251
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,910
You understand what I said.

252
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,060
Just do it accordingly.

253
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,090
Seventh Madam,

254
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:08,870
we really don't want to leave.

255
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,330
Old Ye,

256
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,930
why are you looking for me urgently?

257
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,090
It's regarding Ding Ruoyong's death. There are clues.

258
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,620
Sir Shen was framed.

259
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,150
I dispatched someone to tail Mu Zizheng

260
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:46,380
and found out that he always went back to Jishi Medical Shop to get medicines for his mother.

261
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,170
But when the doctor in the shop

262
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:52,430
asked about how his mother was doing, he equivocated.

263
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:55,720
So the person I dispatched became suspicious and followed him to where he lives.

264
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,960
He never found the dregs of decoction.

265
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:03,110
He asked around, and also didn't see Old Madam living here.

266
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:06,990
Then it looks like Mu Zizheng's suspicion cannot be cleared.

267
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,050
Do we tell the commander-in-chief immediately?

268
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,880
Don't tell him first. Don't let Third Brother worry about it again.

269
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,690
If Mu Zizheng is the Youth Union's mole,

270
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,800
we must not let him off.

271
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,470
You say that the days passed really fast.

272
00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:00,970
In the blink of an eye, I've already been married to the Xiao family for 20 years.

273
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:05,440

274
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,090
flatter and please me on the outside,

275
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:13,070
but actually satirize me a lot, overtly and covertly.

276
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,490
Everybody thinks

277
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:19,630
I married you young

278
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:24,150
only to covet your power and assets.

279
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,590
Actually, you also don't know this.

280

I saw the mighty you on horseback.

That love at first sight

283

was to follow you for a lifetime.

284
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:46,390
These years I've followed you to the south and north.

285
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:49,060
In the end, we settled in Beixin.

286

330
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,570
Return to him?

331
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:50,790
We don't need her to be collateral any more?

332
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:53,270
He can never go back.

333
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:56,880
What he owes the Communist Party and the Youth Union,

334
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,780
is his biggest weakness.

335
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:03,880
Since we're evacuating soon, with a weak and fragile woman,

336
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,300
just let her be taken care of by her son.

337
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:11,410
But you still have to meet him first,

338
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:14,170

Remember to take all your medications.

You are coming back in a hurry,

and now you're leaving in a rush?

346

I offended someone in my business.

347
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,690
Zizheng, you have to tell me the truth.

348
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:05,530
Since I came back, you won't allow me to go back home

351

Mother, don't worry about me.

352
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:19,880
I got into a bit of trouble in a business deal, isn't it normal?

353
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:24,580
Let's leave here and hide for a while. Once the situation is settled, we will come back.

354

How about that Mr. Ding?

355
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:29,560
Haven't you been doing business with him?

356
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,480
He has been taking good care of me. He is a good person.

357
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,280
If you have any trouble, can you ask him for help?

358
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,230
I...

359
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,980
I can't always ask him for assistance,

360
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,850
can I?

361
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,120
Mother, have you not been feeling well lately?

362
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,700
You don't look good.

363
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,320
How about this? Go inside and get some rest.

364
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,460
I'll do the packing.

365

Okay.

366

What's going on Mother?

367
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,740
What kind of medication is this?

368
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,170
It's... It's pain killer.

369
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:22,640
I don't sleep well at night due to the pain.

370

Let me take a look.

371
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:38,440
I've never seen those medications before. Who gave them to you?

372
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,700
It's... I bought it on my own.

373
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:45,360
Mother, you haven't stepped foot outside the house,

374
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,900
how would you go out and get your own medications?

375
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,260
If this is a painkiller,

376
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,960
why did you take it behind my back?

377
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,130
