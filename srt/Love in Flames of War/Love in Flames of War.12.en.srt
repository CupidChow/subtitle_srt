Please.

24
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,850
- Help yourselves! These are all made by our cook.
- Very delicious.

25
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,370
So many people here.

26
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,140
Seventh Madam, congratulations.

27
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,590
- Happy Birthday! I wish you to be young and beautiful forever!
- Thank you!

28
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,810
Congratulations! Do you know? My daughter Fengqi knew it was your birthday,

29
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:16,040
so she brought this perfume all the way from France to you!

30
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,790
- Thank you! Thank you!
- I hope you'll like it. Open it!

31
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,670
It's so nice of Fengqi to always think of me.

32
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,070
Smell of roses! This is my favorite fragrance.

33
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:27,660
Really? That's wonderful! Fengqi said

34
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,440
this fragrance fits Seventh Madam's temperament the most.

35
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,020
Fengqi is just like you. She's so sweet.

36
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,710
What skincare have you been using lately? Tell us about it! You're looking even more pretty!

37
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:44,260
She's been using products from France! Very expensive!

38
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,850
You're seeing beauty.

39
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:50,410
We're seeing banknotes all over her face.

40
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,760
Nonsense! If we as women don't treat ourselves well,

41
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,260
do you expect men to treat you well?

42
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,240
You're seeing banknotes.

43
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,360
I'm telling you, this is not just banknotes.

44
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,240
It's my investment.

45
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,080

49

- Haishan!
- Commander Kang!

50
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,700
Brothers, I haven't seen you in a while.

51
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,440
Is everything going well with all of you?

52
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,680
Commander Kang, this is just a birthday party for my wife.

53
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,970
I have bothered you by making you come personally.

54
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,790
Thank you so much!

55
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,490
I was in Nanwan, just a step away from Beixin.

56
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,860
Of course, I should drop by and join the party. We're brothers, so there's no need to say thank you.

57
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,320
Commander Kang, you've been dedicated to studying Buddhism all these years.

58
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,160
You're a sage out of this mortal world.

59
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,920
Since you're here, please do share some of your wisdom with us.

60
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,240
That's right, Commander Kang. Don't be stingy.

61
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,560
With the little wisdom we brothers have, we can benefit from just a tiny bit of your wisdom.

62
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,980
You're just like before.

63
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,230
You're always frivolous when you start to joke.

64
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:42,310
It's Seventh Madam's birthday. I have prepared a simple gift.

65
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,420
I hope she will like it.

66
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,140
You really have put much effort, Brother Kang.

67
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,230
Say no more. Join us, please!

68
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,500
Please, everyone.

69
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,520
Put it over here.

70
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,980
- Here, have a drink.
- I'm going there.

71
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,910
Miss Shuyi, may I ask you for a dance?

72
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,700
There's a new movie recently, called "A Fool."

73
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,490
- Have you watched it?
- A Fool?

74
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,070
Oh... Oh!

75
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,530
Yes, yes. A Fool!

76
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,160
I haven't watched it either.

77
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,210
Don't try to comfort me. I'm used to it.

78
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,210
Third Brother, I'll help you invite Miss Lin for a dance.

79
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,160
Forget it. Just stay here.

80
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,240
Third Master, may I have the honor to dance with you?

81
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,250
Wait.

82
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,620
Did I say no?

83
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,040
Sorry.

84
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:15,950
Brother Kang, you're asking me to trade opium pipes for rifles?

85
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,900
As long as you agree to open up the border,

86
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,980
you can expand your troop with one batallion.

87
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,660
How's that?

88
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,910
That offer is very attractive indeed.

89
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,440
But, Brother Kang, you should know that crude opium

90
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,180
is a taboo for me.

91
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,350
I'm afraid I can't obey.

92
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,670
I knew you would say that.

93
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:47,060
Don't I know your temper?

94
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:53,500
So, this time, I came to you with enough sincerity.

95
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,320
What sincerity?

96
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,130
In the future, for the iron mine produced in Fenglin Town,

97
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,230
you will be the first to get it from me.

98
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,990
Brother Kang, you're being very generous.

99
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,450
As long as you agree, we can work together in the future.

100
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,340
If you open the gate for me, I promise that

101
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:22,150
no matter military forces or mineral resources, I will supply it to Beixin steadily.

102
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:26,040
Brother Kang, we can discuss anything.

103
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,840
But opium will corrode the health and soul of the people.

104
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,940
I cannot open up the port for you whatsoever.

105
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,820
Brother Kang, Haishan advises for you too.

106
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:44,640
Please stay away from the opium traders in the future.

107
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:52,840
Haishan, does that mean there's no chance

108
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,730
for this trade-off?

109
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:01,170
Is there really not any chance for negotiation?

110
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,060
I'm very sorry indeed, Brother Kang.

111
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,470
What a shame.

112
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:19,760
I was priding myself to be someone with few desires.

113
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,720
Haishan, your conduct has indeed made me

114
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,840
feel too far behind.

115
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,720
Brother Kang, please don't joke about me.

116
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,930
Let me show you my hospitality today. We shall enjoy the wine.

117
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,480
Here.

118
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,060
Cheers.

119
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,660
Okay.

120
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:16,260
Commander, how did it go?

121
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,170
As I expected.

122
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:23,390
Then, what do we do now? The Japanese have been waiting for the news.

123
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,340
I, Kang Jingxiong,

124
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,450
have never returned without getting what I want.

125
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,360
- I'm sorry, Commander.
- What are you doing?

126
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,090
What happened?

127
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,830
I'm so sorry, Commander Kang.

128
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:45,750
- Why are you so careless?
- I'm sorry, I was in a rush.

129
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,640
- I'm sorry, Commander Kang. May I wipe it for you?
- No need.

130
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,190
- Go down now!
- Yes, Ma'am.

131
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,230
- Uncle Gui.
- Yes.

132
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,330
Hurry. Take Commander Kang upstairs to get changed.

133
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,030
I apologize for his unruly behavior.

134
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,110
Commander Kang, this way, please.

135
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,140
Zizheng.

136
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,770
Speak. Who are you?

137
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,800
Who sent you?

138
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,680
Turn around.

139
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,790
Come with me.

140
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:44,490
- What's going on?
- I will go and check.

141
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,480
Commander, what happened? Are you okay?

142
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,210
I'm okay. Luckily, I was prepared.

143
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,630
He hasn't gone far. Lock down the place.

144
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,040
Yes.

145
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,350
He's in a white shirt and black vest.

146
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,730
Commander Kang, what happened?

147
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,990
Someone tried to assassinate me.

148
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,470
Unfortunately, he escaped.

149
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,900
You two, guard the exit. The rest all come with me.

150
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,810
Don't let the assassin run.

151
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,690
Zizheng, quickly, follow me!

152
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:28,440
Why did you try to assassinate Kang Jingxiong?

153
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,890
I...

154
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:32,270
What are you hiding from me?

155
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,950
I'm sorry, Hangjing.

156
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,100
I really can't tell you.

157
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,980
Have you searched there?

158
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,140
- Report. We found nothing.
- Continue the search.

159
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,720
- Have you searched this room?
- Not yet.

160
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,240
Wait.

161
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,200
- Have you searched every place over there?
- Yes, we have.

162
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,040
I heard noises over there. Go and check it out.

163
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,630
Come with me.

164
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,970
Where are you going?

165
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,860
- I don't want to get you involved.
- You may die!

166
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,150
You may die if you go out there. The whole place is surrounded.

167
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:37,280
You can't go anywhere in this outfit.

168
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:13,570
Commander Kang, I'm very sorry

169
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:17,440
for what happened to you at my wife's birthday party.

170
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,430
I truly, truly apologize.

171
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:24,400
Commander Xiao, Commander Kang attended the party out of goodwill

172
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,000
to wish Seventh Madam a great birthday.

173
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,390
We didn't expect such an incident would happen here.

174
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,850
Your residence is considered to be

175
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:37,300
the safest place in Beixin. I never thought an assassin could have come in here.

176
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,600
I don't quite think it's possible.

177
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,480
Adviser Zhang.

178
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,460
What kind of adviser are you? Are you implying we did it?

179
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,600
- Shuyi!
- Who would kill in their own house?

180
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,300
Father!

181
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:56,540
Brother Kang, I promise I will get to the bottom of this.

182
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:00,240
I'm sure I can entrust you with this matter.

183
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,120
We have searched everywhere in this building.

184
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,670
We locked down the entire place at once. Not even a fly can get out of here.

185
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:11,610
So, the assassin must still be with us.

186
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,410
Commander Xiao, I believe all the guests here are on the guest list.

187
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:29,060
The only chance one could get in is to be a server.

188
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,860
The assassin was indeed

189
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,610
a server.

190
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:38,750
Commander Xiao, would it be possible if...

191
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,770
Of course. Uncle Gui, call them here.

192
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,450
Servers, come here.

193
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,660
Stand in a line.

194
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:57,280
Where was the server

195
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,650
who spilled wine on me?

196
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,610
Where is he?

197
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:05,810
Butler, how many servers do you have here?

198
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:08,580
We have twelve servers in total.

199
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,630
There're only ten here.

200
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,160
Ten?

201
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,510
Then it's safe to say those two are definitely the assassins.

202
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,330
They must be in the crowd.

203
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,090
Haishan.

204
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,850
I'm sorry.

205
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:29,880
Could you provide me

206
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,500
with a full guest list?

207
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,440
It will help Advisor Zhang

208
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,680
identify the assassins.

209
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:43,730
Of course. Bring the guest book.

210
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,440
The guest book.

211
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,720
May I ask who this is?

212
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,320
I don't think I've seen him.

213
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,980
He doesn't know him.

214
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,440
This is the painter I invited to draw a portrait for Seventh Aunt.

215
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,970
A painter?

216
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,450
A painter?

217
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:44,900
Seventh Madam, do you recognize the painter?

218
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,270
Yes. He is the painter invited by Hangjing.

219
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,990
He is here to draw a portrait of me as a gift.

220
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,000
A painter? I...

221
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,820
Where is the drawing?

222
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,800
We haven’t had time to draw.

223
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,900
Let’s start the drawing now.

224
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,600
This...

225
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,600
It’s done.

226
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:15,570
I have to say, the portrait does look alike.

227
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,370
But...

228
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,150
Have we met before?

229
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,190
They’ve met before?

230
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,730
What’s going on?

231
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,950
- A painter?
- I don't know.

232
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,680
Haven’t we?

233
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,570
I remember now.

234
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:59,640
You draw under the Changsheng Street bridge.

235
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,750
Isn’t that you?

236
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,800
Isn’t that gunfire?

237
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,190
Commander!

238
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,650
Follow me!

239
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,360
Let’s go and take a look!

240
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,690
Xiao Mansion soldiers, follow me.

241
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,490
Brother Kang.

242
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:33,980
Let's go inside and wait for news.

243
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,580
- Okay.
- Please.

244
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,010
Quickly!

245
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,730
Later, follow me to the back door.

246
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,720
- You...?
- Third Brother asked me to help you.

247
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,820
Let’s go!

248
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,620
Let’s go.

249
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,260
Someone is coming, let’s go!

250
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,870
Brother Yong, hurry up.

251
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:09,310
Fire! Don’t let them run away.

252
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,880
Stop.

253
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,120
Standby.

254
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:44,580
Commander, we didn't catch them.

255
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:51,130
Brother Kang, I think the assassin has already left under the cover of his allies.

256
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:53,540
I will send people to go after them.

257
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:57,010
Go back and rest first.

258
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:00,760
If there's any news, I'll let you know right away.

259
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,930
There have been so many

260
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:12,930
surprises this evening.

261
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,010
I'll get going.

262
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:26,460
Seventh Madam, I'll be on my way.

263
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,830
Commander Kang, I'm so sorry for what happened today.

264
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,700
This way, please.

265
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:55,730
Miss Lin, how did you get that bloodstain on yourself?

266
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:01,180
There really is one!

267
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:12,020
Miss Lin, where is the painter from just now?

268
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,860
Adviser Zhang, are you asking me?

269
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,770
It was so chaotic just now.

270
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:20,890
I can hardly take care of myself. How would I notice that?

271
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:25,260
Can hardly take care of yourself? Didn't notice it?

272
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,180
The artist that you invited is missing.

273
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:32,730
There is also a bloodstain on your clothes.

274
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,260
Is this a coincidence?

275
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:40,710
Looks like you can't get off the hook with the assassin.

276
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,540
Please come back with us to cooperate with our investigation.

277
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,110
Wait!

278
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,400
Uncle Kang, forgive me if I'm being to direct.

279
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,580
This happened in the Xiao Mansion today.

280
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,630
The Xiao Mansion should be responsible for looking into it.

281
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:03,660
Brother Kang, I think this must be a misunderstanding.

282
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,360
I watched Hangjing grow up since she was a child.

283
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:12,020
And she's just a weak woman. How can she have anything to do with the assassin?

284
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,560
Everyone, the fact is here before your eyes.

285
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,570
Is the Xiao Family going to cover up for her?

286
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:28,690
Or... are you already aware of what happened tonight?

287
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:32,540
Adviser Zhang, you shouldn't be rude.

288
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:39,550
Haishan. We're close friends, of course I trust you.

289
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:43,090
But now the evidence is solid.

290
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,680
So many people are watching us.

291
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:49,250
I'm doing this to help you, too.

292
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:53,080
If Miss Lin is indeed not involved in this,

293
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,960
the Xiao Family will get rid of the suspicion once the investigation is done.

294
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:02,980
Otherwise, if Governor Jin hears about it,

295
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,620
you can't explain it either. Right?

296
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,790
Don't worry. I'll handle this matter objectively.

297
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,810
If Miss Lin is not guilty,

298
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:14,870
I naturally will release her immediately.

299
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,950
Okay. I guess we can only do that.

300
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:28,060
Please make sure to take care of Hangjing, Brother Kang.

301
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,170
Please be assured. I'm her uncle.

302
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,340
I will definitely do so.

303
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,720
Miss Lin.

304
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,830
Please.

305
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,240
Hangjing.

306
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,000
Seventh Aunt.

307
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,840
Commander.

308
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,820
Third Master.

309
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,520
Goodbye.

310
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,730
Lady! Lady!

311
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:54,610
Commander! Madam! Are they not going to do anything to Miss?

312
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,920
Commander, what do we do?

313
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,990
We're at a disadvantage right now.

314
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:03,190
It's worse for Hangjing if we do it the hard way.

315
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:05,380
Lin Hangjing is really something!

316
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,280
She's been mingling with those people outside, and I can't believe she's partnered with the rebels!

317
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,130
Shut your mouth up!

318
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,480
[Hua Xing Hotel]

319
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:30,370
Commander, who do you think is so outrageous

320
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:33,420
to try to assassinate you in the Xiao Family's banquet?

321
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,880
Who else could it be?

322
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:40,780
It can't be... the rebels from the Youth Society again?

323
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:44,690
What if Lin Hangjing is covering up for them indeed?

324
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:47,120
Does that prove...

325
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,460
that the Xiao Family is involved in the Youth Society?

326
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:57,180
If we can prove that Xiao Haishan is related to the Youth Society,

327
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,500
then everything will be easy.

328
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:05,700
It's a pity that these are just assumptions.

329
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,690
I'm glad you're lucky and have a sharp eye to see through the assassin's intention.

330
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:11,450
Otherwise...

331
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,720
I can't imagine the consequences.

332
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,260
No.

333
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:21,070
Maybe I should say thank you to that assassin.

334
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:26,240
Do you know who Lin Hangjing is?

335
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,810
Isn't she Xiao Haishan's adopted daughter?

336
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:33,090
She's also Lin Tangsheng's daughter.

337
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,490
Lin Tangsheng.

338
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,400
Lin Tangsheng, the one imprisoned by Governor Cheng?

339
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,210
That's right.

340
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:44,250
Xiao Haishan's sworn brother.

341
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:48,910
Think about it. If the daughter of his brother is in danger,

342
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:54,040
will Xiao Haishan just watch and not try to save her based on his personality?

343
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,250
Commander, you're finally back.

344
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:13,230
What's going on with Hangjing?

345
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:18,720
I've asked her. She refused to say anything.

346
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,250
Kang Jingxiong refuses to let the matter go either.

347
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:25,840
Then what should we do now? We can't leave Hangjing in danger.

348
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,970
She is a girl and she isn't strong enough to handle being locked in such a place.

349
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:34,160
Tomorrow, I need to go to Hua Xin Hotel.

350
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,090
Hua Xin Hotel?

351
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:38,840
Are you going to see Kang Jingxiong?

352
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,700
No matter what, I need to try.

353
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,450
Father, leave her be.

354
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:47,780
She asked for it herself. We're kind to take her in and that's how she treats us.

355
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,930
At such a sensitive time, we need to keep ourselves out of it.

356
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:53,560
Shuyi, I can't believe you said such a thing.

357
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:57,480
Seventh Aunt, it's not a good time to help her.

358
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,880
We all know you were covering for her.

359
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,810
There was no painter. She was with the assassin.

360
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:07,320
Because of her, our whole family is in trouble.

361
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,100
Enough!

362
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,940
No one thinks you are a mute if you don't talk.

363
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:17,090
No matter what, I trust Hangjing. Though she doesn't tell us the truth,

364
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,420
she has her reasons.

365
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,260
[Hua Xing Hotel]

366
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,900
Come.

367
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,580
Haishan, have a taste.

368
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:37,040
This is the aged white tea from my best collection that I've saved for a long time.

369
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,810
It's the best of the best.

370
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,410
It's indeed good.

371
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:46,560
Brother Kang, I'll get straight to the point.

372
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,440
I'm here to ask you...

373
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:55,090
if you can let Hangjing off this time.

374
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:58,990
Her father is my best friend. He is in prison now.

375
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,440
A few years ago, he asked me to look after her.

376
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,680
It's my responsibility to make sure of her safety.

377
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:09,440
I can't break my words, you know.

378
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:14,640
Haishan, I understand how you feel.

379
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,680
But it's hard for me to

380
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,000
make the decision.

381
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,150
Commander Xiao, to be honest, it's been three days

382
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,950
and Miss Lin hasn't said a word to us.

383
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:33,300
I don't think it's appropriate to ask Commander Kang

384
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,870
to take the matter as if it never happened.

385
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:41,040
Brother Kang, let's all be straight.

386
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,910
What do you want from me for letting her go?

387
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:48,280
Haishan, I'm sure...

388
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,800
you know clearly what I want.

389
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,210
I've told you this.

390
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,020
Apart from this, we can talk about anything.

391
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:05,100
Haishan, I know.

392
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,320
Miss Lin is just a girl.

393
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,770
We barely know each other. Of course, it isn't her who wanted to see me dead.

394
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:17,010
Don't worry. I promise.

395
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,550
As long as you help me this time,

396
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:24,800
I will let Miss Lin go and treat it as if it never happened.

397
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,390
That's my bottom line.

398
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:33,240
Things that harm the people and the nation,

399
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,670
I will never do.

400
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,730
Haishan.

401
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:48,780
It may be too early to make such a decision.

402
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:52,100
In my opinion,

403
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:55,280
you need to think carefully about the matter.

404
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,270
- Brother Yong.
- You're awake.

405
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,370
Lie down.

406
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:48,200
You're injured. You need to rest.

407
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,870
Lie down.

408
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,690
I'm sorry.

409
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,530
I failed.

410
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:04,160
It's not your fault. Hang Jingxiong is a cunning man.

411
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:18,310
A few days ago, Xiao Beichen searched your place.

412
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,810
How is my mother? Is she okay?

413
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:26,870
Don't worry. I have moved your mother to somewhere safe.

414
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,580
Don't worry.

415
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,840
Thank you, Brother Yong.

416
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,670
Right, Brother Yong.

417
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:39,710
Where is Hangjing? Is she okay?

418
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:43,070
If it weren't for her, I wouldn't have been able to escape.

419
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,800
About her.

420
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,370
What happened to her, Brother Yong?

421
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:51,190
What happened to her?

422
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:54,950
Kang Jingxiong arrested her.

423
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:59,010
No. That's impossible.

424
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,290
Zizheng!

425
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:02,510
Calm down! You're injured.

426
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:04,250
She was arrested because of me!

427
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,800
I have to save her even if I die!

428
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,110
Zizheng! Come back!

429
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:11,160
Zizheng!

430
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,450
Zizheng!

431
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:15,320
Do you think your life can save her?

432
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,780
I don't care. I have to save her.

433
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,870
She is protected by Xiao Haishan after all.

434
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:26,490
If even Xiao Haishan can't save her,

435
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:29,000
there is nothing we can do.

436
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,820
But...

437
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:36,610
Now we need to wait. We can't act recklessly.

438
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:43,610
If you try to save her like this,

439
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:45,810
you will die for nothing.

440
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,890
You know it.

441
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:07,370
As long as you tell us who the assassin is,

442
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:09,840
my father will be able to protect you.

443
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:17,320
Third Brother, I am the cause.

444
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,040
I should take all of the responsibility.

445
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:24,170
I don't want to get your family involved.

446
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:32,100
You don't want my family to get involved?

447
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,180
Do you really think my family isn't involved in the matter now?

448
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:37,640
I'm really sorry.

449
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:41,870
Don't you know how serious it is to kill an army officer?

450
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,320
I know.

451
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:50,310
You'd rather sacrifice yourself

452
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:53,050
than get him in danger, right?

453
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:59,030
Talk to me!

454
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:04,310
Third Brother, I have nothing to say.

455
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,860
I've told you.

456
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:12,430
I will take all of the responsibility for the matter.

457
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:25,270
Lin Hangjing.

458
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,830
Do you really think...

459
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:31,860
you can take responsibility?

460
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,860
Do you believe I would repeat that day

461
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:39,480
and put a bullet into his head?

462
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:42,890
You won't.

463
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:49,940
Or you would have killed him.

464
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:54,850
Do you think you really know me?

465
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:59,950
He is my enemy.

466
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:02,590
I will kill him.

467
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:06,130
No one in Beixin City can stop me.

468
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:08,400
No one can stop you.

469
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:14,330
But Third Brother, I trust you.
