he'd have been one year older than Ke'er.

He... probably would have been able to say a lot of words now.

♫ At least the flight will be smooth ♫

485
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:52,600
♫ Waiting for a promise my whole life ♫

486
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:58,240
♫ I cherish even the short-lived happiness ♫

487
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:03,780
♫ Leave some tenderness to the years ♫

488
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:09,500
♫ If you still remember, when the next time
a shooting star passes, ♫

489
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:15,070
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫

490
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:20,680
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

491
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:26,110
♫  Let me brighten your galaxy once again  ♫

492
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:34,980
♫  If you still remember, when the next time a shooting star passes,  ♫

493
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:46,050
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫
