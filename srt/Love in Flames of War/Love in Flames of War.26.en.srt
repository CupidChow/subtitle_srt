[Episode 26]

21
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,520
Third Brother, what are you doing now?

22
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,130
Are you planning to imprison Third Sister-in-law like that forever?

23
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,140
You don't get this.

24
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,340
Third Brother wants to personally protect his wife.

25
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,590
What do you mean?

26
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,660
Mu Zizheng is a member of the Youth Union, and he's hiding his identity and staying close to Jin Cheng.

27
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:07,060
He's also the one who tried to assassinate Kang Jingxiong back then. If his identity is revealed now,

28
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,420
how likely is it that Third Sister-in-law won't save him?

29
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,910
That's right! Third Brother,

30
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,390
in my opinion, Mu Zizheng has created so much trouble for you all these times.

31
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,920
Why don't we just reveal his identity as a member of the Youth Union?

32
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,070
Come on.

33
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,310
As I said,

34
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,750
we should not get involved in the matters of the Youth Union.

35
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,550
Also, if Mu Zizheng's identity is revealed,

36
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,820
Hangjing will be affected as well.

37
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,930
Hello.

38
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,250
Is Miss Lin Hangjing here?

39
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,740
Are you looking for Teacher Lin? Unfortunately,

40
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,920
she asked for a month's leave.

41
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,290
- A month?
- Yes.

42
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,450
Sorry. I'll come back next time.

43
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,890
No worries.

44
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,640
Third Young Madam, where are you going?

45
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,070
I'm going to take a walk in the garden.

46
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:26,200
Didn't Third Master say that it's fine as long as I don't leave the villa?

47
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,140
Where are you going?

48
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,830
Am I too kind to you

49
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,650
and spoiling you too much?

50
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,220
You're still trying to run away with me guarding you here in person?

51
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,680
You need to be disciplined.

52
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,770
Xiao Beichen! Put me down! Xiao Beichen!

53
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,230
I said, without my permission,

54
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,090
you'll just stay here.

55
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,170
Xiao Beichen, put me down!

56
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,470
Xiao Beichen, what are you doing? Put me down!

57
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,300
Xiao Beichen, I'm not your prisoner.

58
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,120
What are you doing?

59
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,210
You—

60
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,600
Xiao Beichen, what are you doing?

61
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,620
Looks like you're not going to behave well and stay in this room.

62
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,660
Fine. Then I have no other option.

63
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,290
Weren't you just crying and wanting to leave?

64
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,170
Just cry. Cry as much as you want.

65
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,410
When you're done crying, and your throat becomes dry,

66
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,760
do you see the water at the bedside?

67
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,460
It's the supply that I prepared for you.

68
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,440
- I...
- What would you like to eat?

69
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,140
Okay. Just don't eat.

70
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,540
Now go to sleep.

71
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,850
Enjoy your crucian carp soup in your dreams!

72
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,250
You...

73
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,550
Xiao Beichen!

74
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,690
Don't move.

75
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,690
Why are you still moving?

76
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:46,710
Keep moving and I'll wrap myself in there and become a spring roll with you.

77
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,540
Good. That's more like it.

78
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,340
Where are you going so late at night?

79
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,190
I...

80
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,900
I'm thirsty.

81
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,190
Have some water.

82
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,150
Go back to bed.

83
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,630
You—!

84
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,130
Move towards the other side.

85
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,760
Put your hands in the quilt.

86
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,320
It's cold here. You might catch a cold.

87
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,060
Third Brother, that night...

88
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,310
Can you listen to my explanation? Actually, Mu Zizheng...

89
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,920
I don't want to hear his name.

90
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:17,850
Actually, I...

91
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,840
Can you be a bit more romantic?

92
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,290
Is it appropriate to talk about this now?

93
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,750
I just want to hold you in my arms like this...

94
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,340
For the rest of my life.

95
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,150
- Governor.
- Let's go.

96
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:27,290
Deputy Commander Xiao, the new Regiment Commander of Ying Army's Independent Regiment, Du Heng.

97
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,590
I heard he was your instructor at the military school.

98
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:35,060
Yes. Instructor Du is my teacher who taught me everything about the military.

99
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:39,460
I've long heard your name. An accomplished disciple owes his accomplishments to his great teacher.

100
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,400
Commander Kang, that's too much of a compliment. I'm ashamed and dare not claim it.

101
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,770
Beichen.

102
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,470
Your East Main Camp has been very productive

103
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,460
in the military exercise this time.

104
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,940
Naturally, there's no problem with the garrison.

105
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,820
Regiment Commander Du, you're very experienced.

106
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,060
We're counting on you to put more effort into it.

107
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,420
It's my duty. I will dedicate all my effort.

108
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,690
Great. Let's keep going.

109
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,130
Please.

110
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,580
Xiao Beichen!

111
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,310
What on earth did you do to Lin Hangjing?

112
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:32,750
What a joke. She's my wife.

113
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,930
I respect her. I love her.

114
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,720
Why would Sir Mu say such a thing?

115
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,340
Xiao Beichen, stop pretending.

116
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:50,800
You're doing everything you can to prevent us from seeing each other because you feel guilty.

117
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,160
Because you know, for me,

118
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,750
she can even sacrifice her life.

119
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:01,660
Lin Hangjing saved you because she has a kind heart.

120
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,570
She did that because of your friendship from the old days.

121
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,300
You have nothing to do with her now.

122
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,900
And there's no chance you will have a future with her.

123
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:15,720
Then why don't you have the courage to let her see me?

124
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,570
Instead of chatting about these with me here,

125
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,950
you should worry about yourself.

126
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,750
What do you mean?

127
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:31,620
The governor always hates underground organizations.

128
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,400
If he learns one day that his adopted son

129
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,860
is a member of the Youth Union, what would he think?

130
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,280
You're going to report me now?

131
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,720
I’m too busy for that.

132
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,090
And I don't want to bother to do that.

133
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:55,620
But I'm telling you. If you want to compete with me,

134
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,130
you should think about what you're capable of first.

135
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,380
Xiaorong.

136
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,160
Xiaorong!

137
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,600
Dear Jinxiang, please will you just give me a break.

138
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,420
You've been following me the whole morning.

139
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,980
Tell me exactly how it's going between My Lady and Third Master!

140
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:28,530
Well, Third Master won't bite her.

141
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,030
Then, why are they staying at the villa without coming home?

142
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:35,150
Judging from Your Lady's temperament, if she really doesn't want to stay there,

143
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,660
is there anything Third Master can do to change her mind?

144
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,780
You don't get it. This is called passion.

145
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,540
You're full of nonsense!

146
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,180
Our Third Master values his wife more than his own life.

147
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,390
Don't you know that?

148
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,980
Anyway, I have to let Third Master know

149
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,290
what My Lady has been doing for him.

150
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,460
Father. Commander Kang.

151
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,840
How's it going with the garrison?

152
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,760
The three parties are all settled there, and they're cooperating well.

153
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,920
With Governor attending the garrison duty in person, naturally, all parties will do their best.

154
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,580
They won't neglect any detail.

155
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,390
Please.

156
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,110
Sister.

157
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,960
Zizheng, you look exhausted. Didn't you get enough rest?

158
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,550
No, Sister. I...

159
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:44,900
What is it? Feel free to tell me anything.

160
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,690
Hangjing angered Xiao Beichen off because she came to see me.

161
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:58,290
He locked her up. I’m so worried about her.

162
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:06,880
Zizheng, don't worry. I'll help you think of a way.

163
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,680
All right, thank you.

164
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,390
Master-in-law.

165
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:31,190
Jinxiang, what is it?

166
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,420
How is My Lady doing?

167
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,790
Please... don't be hard on her.

168
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:41,480
Or you'll be wasting her love.

169
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,260
What does that mean?

170
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,920
She made these by hand.

171
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,060
This was her anniversary gift for you.

172
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,470
What are you doing?

173
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,300
It's a secret.

174
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,120
You can try them on.

175
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,770
See, it fits you perfectly.

176
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,650
And it's your favorite color as well.

177
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,460
This is the first time My Lady has knitted mittens.

178
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,820
She accidentally injured her finger several times.

179
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,930
- Don't worry, she'll be back home in a few days.
- Okay.

180
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:03,970
Xiao Tao. Xiao Tao!

181
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,180
Help me wash my back.

182
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,700
Use some more strength.

183
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,370
I think you're enjoying your life alone quite a bit.

184
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,780
When did you get in here?

185
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,770
I've been here for quite a while.

186
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:27,980
What? I'm your husband. Can't I get in here?

187
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,500
Go out.

188
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:36,110
Have you... missed me these days?

189
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,010
No.

190
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,520
Okay.

191
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,790
Reporting to Deputy Commander!

192
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,620
Hot Spring Villa just called us.

193
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,230
Governor Jin and Commander Kang has invited you to go hunting tomorrow.

194
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,480
Hunting?

195
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,880
Tomorrow at 10:00 a.m, they'll be waiting for you at the villa.

196
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,140
Deputy Commander!

197
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,060
[Hua Ting Zhou]

198
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,290
Miss Jin.

199
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,100
Beichen, why are you here?

200
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,370
Governor and Commander Kang invited me to go hunting with them at 10:00 a.m.

201
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,040
What? Don't you know?

202
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,880
10:00 a.m? But they already departed at 9:00.

203
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:38,140
I'm so sorry about that. The messenger must have got the time wrong.

204
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,400
If that's the case, I'll join them next time.

205
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,720
They won't be back from hunting in a short while. You can still make it if you go now.

206
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,120
Hunting is not an important matter, and I've got military work to do. See you.

207
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,500
Wait.

208
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,740
I'm so sorry that you came here for nothing.

209
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:07,010
It's nearly lunchtime. Why don't you stay for lunch?

210
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,200
Miss Jin, you have tried again and again to convince me to stay.

211
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,650
I assume today's hunting invitation was not from the governor.

212
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:21,990
Tell me. What is it?

213
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,560
You're right. I'm the one who asked you to come here.

214
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,050
And who are you doing this for?

215
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,500
I'm not doing this for anyone.

216
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,880
Then I'm even more confused.

217
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,670
Miss Jin, you're determined to help Mu Zizheng,

218
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,590
even at the cost of separating a couple?

219
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:53,280
It's true that I came back here to help Mu Zizheng.

220
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,280
But after I arrived in Beixin,

221
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,280
I saw clearly that there are real feelings between you and Hangjing.

222
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,700
I tried to persuade Zizheng to give up before.

223
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:08,180
Then, why are you doing this today?

224
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:15,390
Although I've only met Hangjing a few times,

225
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:18,320
I admire her a lot.

226
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,200
What she needs is a husband that understands and trusts her.

227
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,970
If you can't even give her the most basic trust,

228
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,040
then I would have misjudged someone.

229
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,710
There's no need for you to worry about my wife and me.

230
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,270
Spending the rest of my life with Hangjing

231
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:45,260
is my only goal these years.

232
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:48,050
Please forward my message to your adopted brother.

233
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:51,450
Hangjing to me is as precious as my life.

234
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:54,510
If anyone dares to take my life,

235
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:57,930
what do you think I should do?

236
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,160
Hangjing!

237
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,960
Zizheng, how come you're here?

238
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,790
I heard Xiao Beichen had locked you up.

239
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,140
- How are you doing?
- I...

240
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,950
Don't say anything, just follow me.

241
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,680
Zizheng, I can't leave with you.

242
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,780
I thought I told you clearly last time we met.

243
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,450
I know.

244
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,500
You don't need to repeat your words.

245
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:56,050
I'm not forcing you to be with me, but I know

246
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:59,000
Xiao Beichen cannot provide you freedom and respect.

247
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,020
I cannot see you living in a cocoon.

248
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,920
Zizheng, no one is forcing me to stay here.

249
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,800
Hangjing, why are you...

250
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,490
Zizheng, please calm down and listen to me. There are guards everywhere!

251
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:11,990
If you don't want to cause me any trouble, please leave.

252
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,000
Hangjing, only if you leave Xiao Beichen,

253
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,700
you can live your life with freedom.

254
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,460
Don't you even want this basic desire?

255
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,540
Have we gotten any visitors?

256
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,770
Report to Third Young Master! No one!

257
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,610
[Hua Ting Zhou]

258
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,060
Third Brother.

259
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,520
[Hot Spring Villa]

260
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:55,500
I'm sorry, Zizheng, I'm not leaving with you.

261
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,090
Why?

262
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:08,470
Why are you bringing me here?

263
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:12,420
I was afraid you were bored inside the house. I wanted to bring you here to get some fresh air.

264
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,980
- It's not necessary.
- Hangjing.

265
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,900
Can you keep me company for a bit?

266
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:30,620
When I was young, my mother always brought me here.

267
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:35,350
She liked to hug me and looked up to the stars.

268
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,810
I was curious. So I asked her.

269
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:47,390
"Why are you looking at the stars?"

270
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,450
She didn't say a word.

271
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:58,790
Later, after she passed away, a German pastor came to visit my father.

272
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,700
He told me that...

273
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,400
it's because humans...

274
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,740
are always looking for eternity.

275
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,670
Then, I realized that...

276
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,360
after all these years...

277
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,050
my mother was an eternity to me.

278
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:27,580
She's like the stars overseeing me.

279
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,510
Always providing me safety and happiness.

280
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,840
Unfortunately, eternity is rare.

281
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:57,820
Hangjing, I want to apologize to you.

282
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,750
I admit...

283
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,980
when I saw you stand in front of me and protect him without any hesitation,

284
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:12,590
I was angry. I was jealous.

285
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:20,610
However, I got all those emotions because I'm afraid I will lose you.

286
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:25,140
I don't know when, whenever I'm facing you,

287
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:30,010
I will be captivated like an idiot.

288
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:34,920
Third Brother, I should be the one to apologize.

289
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:40,620
It was me who didn't consider your feelings.

290
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:46,390
I didn't think that no matter how strong you are,

291
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:49,110
you still have a delicate side to you.

292
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:54,060
Third Brother, I promise you.

293
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:58,390
I'll be with you all my life.

294
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:04,090
Things you don't want me to do, I won't do.

295
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,360
Thank you.

296
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,730
- Here we are! Welcome Third Brother.
- Deputy Commander.

297
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:42,590
- Third Brother, you're finally back to East Main Camp.
- Deputy Commander.

298
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,720
I can tell you've reconciled with Third Sister-in-law, haven't you?

299
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,460
Why would you say that?

300
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,990
Since when have both of us not been on good terms?

301
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:53,060
Why are you wearing gloves in such warm weather?

302
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,450
Let me take a look.

303
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,890
It was knitted by your Third Sister-in-law.

304
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:00,000
Third Sister-in-law.

305
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,420
Third Sister-in-law is pretty crafty.

306
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,860
Can you ask her to knit me one?

307
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,440
Take it off!

308

309
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,860
Something happened to Uncle Lin.

310
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,730
May I ask if Miss Jin is here?

311
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:24,240
Commander Kang wants to know the traveling arrangements back to the city.

312
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,370
If Miss has any requests, please let me know.

313
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:31,560
Thank you, Advisor Zhang. Our Lady went to Young Master Mu's room.

314
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,880
Okay. Thank you.

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,530
You're welcome.

318
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:55,870
Father came back with venison meat from the hunt. I prepared a soup with it.

319
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,480
Give it a try.

320
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:03,050
- Here.
- Sister, just leave it there.

321
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,630
Zizheng, you've done everything you can.

322
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,930
Hangjing is not willing to leave.

323
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:16,320
You know her intention, you should respect her choice.

324
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,870
Sister,

325
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:26,290
I finally understand the feeling of dead ashes.

326
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:28,520
But I'm not willing to accept the truth.

327
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,230
It's the fact that there are a lot of things that are destined.

328
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,750
Why would you insist?

329
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,550
Thank you, Sister, for your concerns for me.

330
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,670
Drink it while it's hot.

331
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:06,640
It turns out it's him?

332
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,650
[Hua Ting Zhou]

333
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:22,240
[The ninth year of Yonghe]

334
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,020
Lady! Lady! Lady!

335
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:29,180
You're not young anymore, how can you still behave so recklessly?

336
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:33,450
I want to tell you some great news! Master is back.

337
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:37,920
Are you talking about Commander Xiao?

338
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,020
No, it's your father!

339
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:43,030
Who is back?

340
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:46,500
Our master is back. Young Master has already picked him up from the prison.

341
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,980
He is now in the Xiao Mansion, they're waiting for you.

342
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:52,850
Lady! Lady! Slow down, be careful!

343
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,700
Hangjing has been waiting for you for a long time.

344
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,620
This is great. You're finally back.

345
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,460
Father! Father!

346
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,180
Father!

347
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,180
Father!

348
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:28,870
Ninth child, I thought I wouldn't see this day coming.

349
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:32,050
I thought I would never see you again.

350
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:36,470
Father.

351
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:42,270
Here.

352
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,680
What are you doing?

353
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,960
Seventh Madam.

354
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:54,880
Hangjing has been living with the Xiao family for many years.

355
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,170
Thanks to all the people here taking care of her.

356
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:03,270
Especially Commander and Madam who treated her as your own daughter.

357
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,620
I was in prison for six years.

358
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:10,500
I couldn't take care of her at all.

359
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,030
Do you know how much guilt I have?

360
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:17,210
That is the amount of gratitude I have for you and Commander.

361
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:22,340
This kneel in front of you as a father is to show my appreciation for you

362
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:25,240
for taking care of Hanging's daily meals

363
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:29,740
and educating her manners and behavior and giving her a home.

364
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:33,300
Please get up, Tangsheng.

365
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,610
Please get up.

366
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,690
I should thank you, instead.

367
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:41,160
It's you who gave us a wonderful daughter.

368
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,210
The entire Xiao family adores her.

369
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:46,070
Am I right Beichen?

370
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,710
Of course.

371
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,250
Now that Beichen and Hangjing are married,

372
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:56,360
people always say, "A son-in-law is like half of a son," Beichen will be your son from now on.

373
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:01,170
Just order him to do anything. If he upsets you, just reprimand him.

374
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,710
I've too much joy and I almost forgot.

375
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:13,100
Uncle Gui! Send a telegram to Commander.

376
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:17,170
In-law let's talk over the dinner table.

377
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:20,140
Sorry to trouble you, Seventh Madam.

378
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,600
Let's go.

379
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,270
Cheers! Congratulate Hangjing for reuniting with her father.

380
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:30,820
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

381
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:39,450
In-law, I asked the kitchen to prepare a few dishes from the South.

382
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,100
Please give it a try.

383
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,400
Seventh Madam, you're too kind.

384
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,510
This family is lucky to have you.

385
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:49,550
It's Haishan's fortune.

386
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,280
You just settle down here

387
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,240
and wait until Commander's return. Then you two can talk about good old days and have some drinks.

388
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:01,710
Wait until he's back. You can repeat everything you just said.

389
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:08,550
Come on, let's eat.

390
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,930
Here.

391
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:27,310
Fengqi, I want to give a toast to you.

392
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:30,090
Uncle Lin, how would I dare?

393
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:31,830
Please don't be courteous with me.

394
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:34,840
The reason why my book can be re-published,

395
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:39,640
it's all because of your hustle. I must thank you in person.

396
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:44,470
That's right, Fengqi. This glass of wine is from me and my father; both of us want to thank you.

397
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,730
We're in the same family, no need to be courteous.

398
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:50,580
The happiest occasion is that you two can be reunited.

399
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:54,700
I believe Third Brother must have made a lot of effort to make this happen.

400
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:59,380
That's right.

401
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:04,290
Thanks to your negotiation with Governor Cheng, I can now see the light of day.

402
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:08,330
That's what they should do. Have a drink with your father-in-law.

403
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:11,400
Here. Father, I salute you.

404
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:16,700
Let's have it together.

405
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,750
Father, how are you doing?

406
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,520
I'm fine.

407
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,500
Thanks to your negotiation with Governor Cheng,

408
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,930
I can now see the light of day.

409
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,540
I salute you.

410
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:14,020
How is it? You reached out to him?

411
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:17,630
Didn't Governor Cheng say no one can contact him?

412
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:21,870
I don't know much about the details.

413
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:36,470
Miss Fengqi, are you looking for me?

414
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:39,740
I want you to do something for me right now.

415
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,480
Father, be careful.

416
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,450
Father, this is where I used to stay.

417
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,440
Okay.

418
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,040
Father, we're walking with our arms crossed together,

419
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,180
I've been hoping to do it for many years.

420
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:02,280
At one point, I thought I wouldn't be able to see you anymore.

421
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:06,510
I also miss you.

422
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:08,240
If...

423
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,650
I still want to ask you one thing.

424
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:17,990
Are you truly willing to marry Beichen?

425
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:23,140
Father, I did fight a lot with Beichen earlier.

426
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:26,150
We are on good terms now. He is nice to me wholeheartedly.

427
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:28,630
He is also something I can rely on for the rest of my life.

428
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:32,370
Now that I can see both of you are truly in love with each other,

429
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:36,260
then I am very happy for you.

430
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:41,090
I can now finally rest assured.

- I've finished our investigation.
- Are you sure?

434
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:00,100
The incident at the pier was done by the Youth Union.

435
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:04,180
It's confirmed. They had planned everything ahead of time.

436
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,650
They're not afraid to die.

437
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:09,570
Commander Kang has been looking for them for a long time.

438
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:14,860
It's about time for them to pay back with their lives.

439

Brother Yong!

441
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:26,780
Kang Jingxiong is aware that the Youth Union was behind the pier incident.

442
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:30,490
- How could it be?
- I don't even know.

443
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,680
What we need to do now is to leave here immediately.

444
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,400
- What should we do?
- What should we do?

445

Don't move!

446

What are you doing here?

447
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:58,380
Young Master Mu, you do know what to do.

448
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:01,430
Thank you. It's great that you lured them out.

449
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:03,150
Thanks for your effort.

450
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,190
You want to alienate us from each other?

451
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:13,410
It's fine now. You don't need to act any longer.

452
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:16,180
You helped Governor Jin and Commander Kang got rid of this gang.

453
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:20,150
You're also Governor Jin's adopted son, your future is bright.

454
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:23,310
Are you afraid they will come after you?

455
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:27,280
Brother Yong! Brother Yong! I didn't betray the organization.

456
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,920
Mu Zizheng, you're a traitor!

457
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,050
You sold us out?

458

I'm going to kill you today!

459

Put your guns down!

Put the guns down!

461
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,740
Put down your guns.

462
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:52,110
Brother Yong.

463
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:54,610
- Leave here with the rest.
- Mu Zizheng!

464
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:56,600
Do you know what the consequence are if you do this?

465
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,400
Shut up! I'll kill you!

466
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,150

00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:55,470
♫ I cherish even the short-lived happiness ♫

484
00:44:55,470 --> 00:45:00,970
♫ Leave some tenderness to the years ♫

485
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:06,750
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

486
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:12,350
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫

487
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:17,980
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

488
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:23,490
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

489
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:33,500
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

490
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:44,200
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫
