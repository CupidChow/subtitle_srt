Do you know drinking during working hours

00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,980
is a crime?

32

I only had a little wine.

Also, I'm not away from my duty.

- There is indeed a batch of defected weapons in there,

Different?

52

But they look very similar.

53
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,880
Is it possible that Kang Jingxiong wickedly changed the numbers?

54
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,800
Don't rule out the possibility.

55

Then we'll find out by arresting Master Zheng's people and asking them.

No need to rush. Let's investigate based on the evidence we've gotten so far.

According to the current clues, I will investigate the person who met Master Zheng today.

He was on duty last night.

66
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,290
He had a few drinks and your son caught him.

Really?

68
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,600
Third Master even said he needs to be punished for violation of the military rules.

69

Eldest Brother, all he did was have a few drinks.

70
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,160
I think Third Master was making a fuss over a trifle.

71
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,690
Do you mean that being drunk on duty

72

No. That's not what I meant.

could you consider asking Third Master not to punish him?

To be honest, Third Master has only just started his military career.

00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,760
Then, where is Seventh Aunt?

166
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,790
Third Master. Miss Lin. Madam Xu was missing one person to play.

167
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,630
She couldn't leave so she wanted me to tell you two

168
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,360
to not wait for her.

169
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:36,500
Jin Xiang, I need to tell you something.

170
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,860
We'll be going back.

171
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,300
Good!

172
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,190
Thank you all for coming to watch the play.

173
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,890
I would like some guests to come and perform the next play.

174
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,530
Which guests would like to try it out?

175
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:15,280
Go try!

176
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,490
No.

177
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,720
The Young Master and Miss in the front,

178
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,690
you look very compatible.

179
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:28,470
I think you are most fit for this play.

180
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,420
What do you two think?

181
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,110
Go for it!

182
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,970
Do it!

183
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,870
Since you are inviting us,

184
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:41,080
we can't refuse your kindness.

185
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,630
Right?

186
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:02,220
I don't see the corridors, regardless of etiquette and rules.

187
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,580
In the mountains in late spring and April, flowers and trees are blooming.

188
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,440
Stirring a pool of blue.

189
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,380
It is very heartwarming.

190
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,880
After being away from home for many years,

191
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:19,120
the wish of wanting to protect his family and country has finally returned home.

192
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,960
Where did this man come from?

193
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,760
Where did this lady come from?

194
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,770
The autumn is full of happiness, she is elegant like an immortal.

195
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,750
Yet she talks nonsense.

196
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,090
This soldier, the horse brushed past me.

197
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:39,050
It dirtied the corner of my skirt,

198
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:42,130
but you put the blame on me?

199
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,640
My horse dirtied your skirt.

200
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,710
Your skirt is dyed with spring colors.

201
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,250
It's messing with my feelings.

202
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:55,030
The road ahead is hard. Why don't you sit on my horse

203
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,490
and I'll protect you forever,

204
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,090
accompanying you forever.

205
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,340
Act.

206
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,260
You are so arrogant,

207
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,510
how can you joke around with a lady you don't know?

208
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,110
You're making such nonsensical promises.

209
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:18,810
Your clear eyes are blooming in my heart.

210
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:23,750
I want you to know that I will not treat you wrongly.

211
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,400
I want to stay with you for a long time.

212
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:33,020
Every year and every month, I want to be with you,

213
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,070
every month and every year.

214
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,620
Third Brother, it's wrong.

215
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,300
It's wrong.

216
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,130
Miss...

217
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,000
Please come with me.

218
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,790
Third Brother.

219
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,930
Good!

220
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:08,300
Third Brother, the script didn't go this way.

221
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:12,070
That's the script. I think...

222
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:16,440
all the people that sing opera have feelings in them.

223
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:21,110
I think if a man...

224
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,790
likes a woman,

225
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,370
he can

226
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,440
do anything for the woman.

227
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,430
Harder.

228
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,100
Is this not hard enough?

229
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,430
You can't accept that you're old.

230
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,760
Just hand everything over to Third Master.

231
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,080
We just have to wait for our grandson.

232
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,280
Grandson? What grandson?

233
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,720
What are you trying to say?

234
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,950
I have something that I must say today.

235
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:10,040
Who dares to stop you if you want to talk?

236
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,570
Talk.

237
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:16,590
What do you think about Hangjing and Third Master?

238
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,400
What? What do you mean?

239
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,350
Third Master and Hangjing.

240
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,530
What's wrong?

241
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:28,710
You're so busy about the damn military affairs, you don't even care that your son is back.

242
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,240
Can't you see...

243
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,190
Third Master's thoughts towards Hangjing?

244
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:36,100
Third Master and Hangjing?

245
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,100
Impossible.

246
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,390
- What are you thinking? What a joke.
- Third Master

247
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:42,080
has already liked Hangjing for a long time. Your son is just hard-mouthed.

248
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,360
He won't say it.

249
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,740
Hangjing might have Third Master in her heart, too.

250
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:51,740
Probably not. Look at Hangjing; beautiful and smart.

251
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,280
How can she like Third Master?

252
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,930
Are you his biological father? Who talks about their son like that?

253
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,920
No, even if...

254
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,660
Third Master is with Hangjing,

255
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,950
what about Fengqi?

256
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,040
But then I have no way to explain to Old Zheng.

257
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,880
At that time, they weren't even the height of the table legs. It was just a joke made when they were younger.

258
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,220
Besides, you and Lin Tangsheng are good brothers.

259
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:22,840
If Third Master marries his daughter, you will become family. How nice is it?

260
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,920
Yes, yes. That makes sense.

261
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,930
But Tangsheng is still in prison.

262
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,930
Hangjing is only thinking about her father.

263
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:37,350
Would she be interested in discussing about marriage?

264
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:43,370
That's true. How about I ask Hangjing about her opinion?

265
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,910
Don't make it obvious.

266
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,140
Don't worry. I have my limits.

267
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,430
Be more serious.

268
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:06,490
Shuyu, it was hard for you to come, why are you leaving so soon?

269
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:09,340
Right, Second Sister. Why are you leaving so abruptly?

270
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,480
I've stayed for such a long time; the kids are missing me.

271
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,740
If I don't go back, they probably wouldn't recognize me.

272
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,890
Second Sister, I'm going to be bored after you leave.

273
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,110
Why are you always like a little kid?

274
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,620
It's time for you to find someone to marry.

275
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,530
See? I'm not the only one thinking that.

276
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,960
Tomorrow, come with me to those Madams' events

277
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,860
and you can meet some Young Masters.

278
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:37,000
Seventh Aunt, I've told you, I won't go to those events.

279
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,790
You're not the one to decide. Your father told me to do this.

280
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:42,710
But Third Brother isn't married yet, why aren't you pushing him?

281
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,320
Look how busy your third brother is. He is at the East Main Camp all day.

282
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,700
Where will he meet a girl with all those men around him?

283
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:53,880
That's true. I wonder what girl our third master would like.

284
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,720
I see it would be someone like Hangjing.

285
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,790
Gentle and intelligent.

286
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:04,290
If Hangjing could be my daughter-in-law,

287
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,600
that would be our Xiao Family's fortune.

288
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,000
Seventh Aunt, what nonsense are you saying now?

289
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,980
What nonsense am I saying?

290
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,220
Hangjing's father and your father are close brothers.

291
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,910
Besides, your father treats Hangjing like his own daughter.

292
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,070
It's adding to the closeness. How is that bad?

293
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:25,800
Look at you talking again. Would my father agree to this?

294
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,150
Seventh Aunt, it's so early in the morning,

295
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,230
just don't joke around with me.

296
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,570
I'm not joking.

297
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:35,900
All of you, I'm not joking around this matter.

298
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,510
I've already talked about you and your third brother to your Uncle Xiao.

299
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:42,470
He said he'll ask your father some time.

300
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:46,200
What is this? Where did you put Sister Fengqi?

301
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,030
Let me tell you! I'm not going to agree on this matter.

302
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,600
You don't agree?

303
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,910
You have no say in this matter.

304
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,600
You—

305
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,900
Seventh Aunt, is there a misunderstanding?

306
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,310
Misunderstanding?

307
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,880
But you said...

308
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,320
Third Brother is much more mature now.

309
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,370
Yes, I said that.

310
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,710
But for me,

311
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:17,070
Third Brother has always been my brother.

312
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:20,500
And you have been my family.

313
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:25,870
Aunt, I'm very grateful for everything you've done for me.

314
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:28,020
But all I want to do now is to wait until my dad comes back.

315
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,760
I don't want to think of any other matters.

316
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,730
But...

317
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,680
I'm done. I have to go now.

318
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,050
I told you it was your wishful thinking.

319
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,150
Now it's embarrassing.

320
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,400
Third Master.

321
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,290
You've said too much. Eat your bun.

322
00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:00,270
[Huaxing Hotel]

323
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:08,090
Drinking coffee with you? What's wrong with alcohol?

324
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,790
Shuyi.

325
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,330
Come here, you two.

326
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,020
Don't do what she says. Are you her dog?

It's you who told me that you can be shameless while pursuing the girl you like.

Shuyi, you want to talk to me?

331
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,350
I thought I wouldn't be able to call you over.

How is that possible?

333
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:45,410
Do you know Seventh Aunt asked Lin Hangjing to marry my third brother?

334
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:48,160
But Lin Hangjing refused the offer in front of everyone.

335
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,080
Lin Hangjing rejected Third Brother?

Yes!

Nothing.

My third brother has never said he would marry her. I don't know what's wrong with her.

- Shuyi.
- Patience.

How am I supposed to have patience? I can't just sit here and look at Seventh Aunt marry the wrong person to my brother.

I'm sure Seventh Aunt was just randomly speaking.

Hangjing and Third Brother haven't agreed to it.

I just can't take the initiative.
