00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,270
avoiding me even when you're asleep.

163
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:16,920
Are you awake? How do you feel?

164
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:21,720
The doctor said the anesthesia has worn off,

165
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,520
you'll feel a lot of pain.

166
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,660
Endure it, okay? I will call the doctor.

167
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,800
Doctor!

168
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,910
This is what you call surefire solution?

169
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:43,560
Commander, please don't be angry. I didn't do a good job on the Xiao Beichen matter.

170
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,510
Next time, the plan will be better.

171
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,470
Next time?

172
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:55,340
Once you fail once, the Xiao family will be on alert.

173
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,820
Don't do anything reckless right now.

174
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:03,690
Based on what I know, the Yang Gongchen who controls the West Lu regions,

175
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,480
lead the army

176
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,650
and successfully took over the border towns in the Southern Zhibei region:

177
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,600
Haitian and Donggu.

178
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,680
Also, they are using it as their stepping stones,

179
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,390
and sending their troops to Huyang Gate.

180
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:24,490
The governor is seriously talking about the tackling plan.

181
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:28,230
Chen's army also has its eye on the Qingshan Mine in the Zhibei region.

182
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:32,040
At the same time, Huyang Gate is also an important output for the Qingshan Mine.

183
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,000
Chen's army has been testing out the water many times in the past years.

184
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,840
They were just checking out the location, but not with a large-scale attack.

185
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,020
Based on their current attacks,

186
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,930
I'm afraid they're going to make the move this time.

187
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,530
Taking over Qingshan Mine is just the cover-up.

188
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:54,080
Yang Gongchen's desire

189
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,720
is the entire Zhibei region.

190
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:03,330
If the war is about to start, who do you think Governor will send over?

191
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,680
If he sends Xiao Haishan,

192
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:13,200
we can use Chen's army to eliminate the Xiao Family's power.

193
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,520
You're not dumb this time.

194
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:23,830
The governor likes Xiao Haishan a lot. Is he willing to send him over there?

195
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:28,890
Suspicion is like a seed.

196
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:33,150
We've planted it before.

197
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:38,740
Now, we just need it to grow from the governor's heart

198
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,820
take root, and sprout.

199
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,680
Be careful.

200
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:09,290
My legs are not injured. I can walk on my own.

201
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,070
Shut up. Just stay where you are.

202
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,320
Young Master, there is a wheelchair.

203
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,660
We won't use it. Follow me.

204
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,240
Hangjing, how are you doing?

205
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,440
Thank you.

206
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,660
Hangjing, how are you feeling?

207
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,760
Are you hungry? Do you want to eat something?

208
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,120
I've already asked the kitchen to prepare pigeon soup.

209
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,990
It's good for your injury.

210
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,270
Ruyi, go and check to see if it's ready.

211
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,840
Got it.

212
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,000
Thank you, Seventh Aunt.

213
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,530
Don't thank me.

214
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,810
Our whole family needs to thank you.

215
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,450
It's you who saved Beichen’s life.

216
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,830
People say, "If you don't die in a crisis, you will be blessed in the future."

217
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,270
Enjoy your blessing in the future.

218
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,230
Isn't that so, Beichen?

219
00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:01,080
I see Hangjing is doing well, but you're pretty sick.

220
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,940
Seventh Aunt, what're you talking about?

221
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,290
I said you should clean yourself up.

222
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:09,420
Once you're cleaned, come and take care of your sister.

223
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,880
Do I smell bad? I'll get going.

224
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,130
I'll be right back.

225
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:35,480
How's the investigation on Beichen's assassination attempt?

226
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,180
The traitor's family member we arrested committed suicide.

227
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:42,740
We also lost the tracking clues on the gun. Do you think it's Kang Jingxiong?

228
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,460
Even if it's him,

229
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,980
we don't have too much evidence.

230
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:55,020
Our Third Master almost lost his life, we can't just let it go.

231
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,920
Revenge?

232
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,790
It sounds so easy.

233
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:04,060
We can't only worry about what's in front of us.

234
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:10,140
If we make the wrong move, it may cause life and death and also affect the innocents.

235
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:14,470
Kang Jingxiong has an unusual relationship with the governor.

236
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,000
If we make the move now, it won't benefit us.

237
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,510
Do we simply stay put?

238
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,360
We need to endure.

239
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,450
How about this? From now on,

240
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:31,670
we need to reinforce our home security.

241
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,220
We can't make any mistakes.

242
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,770
Understood.

243
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,810
Third Master!

244
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,160
I heard Hangjing is home already.

245
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,530
I'm on my way to see her.

246
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,720
How are you doing?

247
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,250
I heard everything just now.

248
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,950
You said the suspect was a traitor's family member?

249
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,450
I asked you to stay at home and yet you didn't stay idle,

250
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:26,370
you wandered around on the streets and almost got killed.

251
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,700
That's right. That's what I did.

252
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,660
You asked me to stay home and I went out instead.

253
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,640
You've so much work and yet I'm letting you worry.

254
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,940
I deserve to die.

255
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:44,290
What's the point of telling me all this nonsense?

256
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:47,140
You almost lost your life, do you know that?

257
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:51,690
The one who is dead now is the one who is trying to kill me.

258
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,800
Why? You killed his family member.

259
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,610
His family was trying to get revenge, don't you think we deserve it?

260
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:04,830
I wish he simply shot me in one blow, then you'd feel relieved. Right?

261
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,550
Bastard!

262
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:14,000
They were traitors, they deserved to die.

263
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,070
What have they done wrong?

264
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
What have I done wrong?

265
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,430
Why am I an executioner now?

266
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,260
You're my son, you'll follow my steps sooner or later.

267
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,670
Just because I'm your son,

268
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:34,470
the almighty Xiao Haishan, Commander Xiao,

269
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:39,500
he has to become a heartless killing bastard.

270
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,840
It's because she's your wife, she deserved to die under gunfire?

271
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:50,450
Did my mom die with this disgraceful realization?

272
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,900
Why are you mentioning her right now?

273
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,990
It's nothing.

274
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:59,740
If I don't mention her, I'm afraid you might have forgotten about her.

275
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,540
It's none of your concern.

276
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,680
When my mom brought me

277
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,290
from Shengjing to Beixin,

278
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,920
according to my memory,

279
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,760
you hadn't seen her for about five years.

280
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,610
She was so happy and had been asking me on the road,

281
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:24,220
"You're about to see your dad, are you happy?"

282
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:31,300
I knew she was the happy one.

283
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,760
She was looking forward to seeing you.

284
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:40,530
As for me, I had no recollection of you.

285
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:45,650
I knew I had a father, and this father was the reason why...

286
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,990
mother had been crying for the last five years.

287
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:58,730
Ten years ago, I witnessed my mom

288
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:02,010
dying under gunfire. And why?

289
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:08,140
It's because she was the wife of Xiao Haishan.

290
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,790
Because of you,

291
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:13,570
she willingly sacrificed everything she had.

292
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,970
Her only wish...

293
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:19,610
was for you to see her last performance.

294
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,190
And in the end,

295
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,300
it wasn't her husband.

296
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,030
It was a bullet from the enemy.

297
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:38,190
Until her bitter death,

298
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,550
you didn't appear.

299
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,970
Third Master,

300
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:49,480
I feel guilty about your mother,

301
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,080
but I'd never forgotten her.

302
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,180
She's already gone.

303
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,590
So what if you haven't forgotten her?

304
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:03,290
You people are always fighting and killing, like tyrants.

305
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:07,300
But we're all living in this dangerous city.

306
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:12,610
They tried to kill me today because I'm your son.

307
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:18,880
The killing breaks apart other families,

308
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,440
but mine...

309
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,110
disappeared a long time ago.

310
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,460
A lowly soldier...

311
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,640
an officer, a general, even the prime minister or the president.

312
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,660
They're all swept in by the tide without an escape.

313
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:40,140
Even if they can escape, they'll be nothing.

314
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,570
A warrior...

315
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:45,830
who gets caught up in their emotions...

316
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:48,120
will accomplish nothing.

317
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,890
A person who doesn't value life and treasure emotions...

318
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:55,150
cannot be a general.

319
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,400
Okay.

320
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,780
I'll wait to see

321
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:17,350
what you learn at the military academy.

322
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:04,870
Third Master, I know there's a wall between you and your father

323
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,750
because of what happened to your mother.

324
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,570
Seventh Aunt,

325
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:11,910
if you came to talk about him, please don't.

326
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:14,370
Look at how stubborn you are.

327
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:18,680
You were young then, and the commander wouldn't let us speak of it.

328
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,820
I never told you, but your father did plan to go and see

329
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,860
your mother's last performance.

330
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:36,160
It hadn't been one year since your father and the military governor conquered Beixin.

331
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,910
He wanted to bring you all and reunite the family.

332
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:42,820
Unexpectedly, the original general was killed again.

333
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:46,190
Your father led soldiers to fight and stabilize the situation.

334
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:50,590
They were victorious, but on the way home, they were attacked.

335
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,890
Your father was injured then.

336
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:57,190
When he woke up in the hospital, your mother was...

337
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:01,050
Don't try to defend him.

338
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,850
If what you've said is true,

339
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:06,660
why hasn't he ever said anything all these years?

340
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:10,270
Because he's never forgiven himself over your mother's death.

341
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:14,620
He said that he didn't want to make excuses for himself.

342
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:19,450
He will regret losing Huilan for the rest of his life.

343
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,900
I understand that you're hurt.

344
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,590
But I believe that one day,

345
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,050
you'll be able to understand

346
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:33,840
how much your father suffers.

347
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:46,220
Seventh Aunt, perhaps one day I'll be in his position and understand him.

348
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:50,050
But right now, that's impossible.

349
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:00,670
I know you're sensitive.

350
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,190
She's the only one inside.

351
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:05,620
Just her. Have a good talk. I'll get going.

352
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,800
- Xu Zijun!
- Have a good talk.

353
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,290
- Xu Zijun!
- Go on.

354
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:11,100
Have a good talk with her.

355
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,960
Trust me.

356
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:28,050
Shuyi, do you need something?

357
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,360
I came to borrow a book.

358
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,230
This one?

359
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,840
Yes, this one.

360
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,560
I'm not unlocking it.

361
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,750
- Let me out!
- You didn't talk. Why did you borrow a book?

362
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,180
Hurry up and go.

363
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:53,420
Listen to me. Go.

364
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:03,820
Since you saved my brother, I have to tell you something.

365
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:08,750
I was the one who sent you to the people at the brothel, not my brother.

366
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,300
But I really didn't know that place was...

367
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,260
Forget it. I already did it, so what's the point of explaining.

368
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,820
Anyway, I'm the one who did something wrong,

369
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,240
so please don't blame my brother.

370
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,880
I'm sorry.

371
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:28,270
- Let me open the door.
- Happy?

372
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,790
Very. Our Shuyi is the best.

373
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:33,730
- Go die!
- Ow! That hurts.

374
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,590
Beichen, your dad sent a letter.

375
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,710
He wants to bring us to Beixin.

376
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:04,180
I've never seen him.

377
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:07,430
Your dad is very busy, but he loves you very much.

378
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:11,370
In the future, we'll be together every day.

379
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:15,570
Huilan, are you really giving up performing?

380
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:20,340
You've loved opera since you were young. If you'd been born a man,

381
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:24,330
you'd already be famous with your talent.

382
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:27,910
Senior, I've thought it through.

383
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:31,820
Ever since I married Haishan, what I've wanted most

384
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,050
was to live happily

385
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:36,980
with my family.

386
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,850
If not for your help

387
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:44,030
bringing our Chengyuan Opera Troupe to Beixin,

388
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,980
I don't know where we would have ended up.

389
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:50,760
But now, you won't sing anymore.

390
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:56,900
Senior, please help me prepare.

391
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,460
I would like to give one final performance.

392
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,700
Okay. I'll get going.

393
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,600
Sorry to trouble you.

394
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,350
Mom, you're so beautiful.

395
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:35,380
Beichen, your dad promised he would come watch my final performance.

396
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:38,060
He never keeps his promises.

397
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,750
He'll be here today.

398
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,120
Okay.

399
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,010
What a good boy.

400
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,570
Bravo!

401
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:02,150
Bravo!

402
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:04,490
Bravo!

403
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,550
Bravo!

404
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,220
Bravo!

405
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:17,310
Mother! You're great!

406
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,580
You're great!

407
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:27,160
You're great!

408
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,350
Mother!

409
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,920
You're great!

410
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,820
Mother!

411
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,550
Mother!

412
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,090
Mother!

413
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:03,550
Mother! Mother!

414
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:14,000
Mother! Mother!

415
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:19,620
Father, where are you?

416
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:23,570
Father, where are you?

417
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,970
Mother! Mother!

418
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,560
Hangjing, why are you standing here?

419
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,400
Seventh Aunt, what happened to Third Brother?

420
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,290
Him? He misses his deceased mother.

421
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:02,680
Seventh Aunt, how did she die?

422
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,250
It's a long story.

423
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:09,300
He and Commander don't like to mention it.

424
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,470
Hangjing, when you get to know someone, you cannot only see their outside.

425
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:16,410
If you understood Third Master a bit more,

426
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:19,540
he and you are very similar.

427
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,410
Two troops have been in a deadlock for a few days.

428
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:38,320
Grieving for our magnificent nation.

429
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,860
We're being attacked by foreign countries.

430
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:45,100
Who are truly suffering and tormenting

431
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,790
are the normal people and our families.

432
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:51,780
Great speech!

433
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,100
What's happening?

434
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:58,360
Sir, what's going on there? What are all those people doing there?

435
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,590
- There's a story-telling stand.
- What story?

436
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:04,530
It's a story about the Ying Army. Great story and performance.

437
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:06,880
- Xiao Haishan's Ying Army?
- Yeah.

438
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,660
Led by Commander Xiao, the Ying Army

439
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,700
defeats enemies and treats the common people fair and nicely.

440
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,110
The performer can probably write a book.

441
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:18,090
I have to go now before I miss out too much.

442
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,920
- Governor.
- Let's get off and have a look.

443
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,290
Governor, there are too many people. It may not be safe.

444
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:30,370
The Han Army was terribly defeated.

445
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:33,330
The soldiers were crying out the names of their parents.

446
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,700
- When the Han Army was retreating...
- Excuse me.

447
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,450
They burned down a village.

448
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:42,470
In order to save the locals,

449
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:47,030
more than 30 soldiers from Ying Army died.

450
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,650
The Ying Army is a teacher of benevolence and righteousness.

451
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:53,900
The army of justice!

452
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,810
Bravo!

453
00:35:55,810 --> 00:36:00,920
In the Zhibei Region, Commander Xiao Haishan is the only person

454
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,530
deserving the name of hero.

455
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,730
Agreed! Bravo!

456
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:09,410
Long live Ying Army! Long live Ying Army!

457
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:13,000
Love live Ying Army!

458
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,050
Love live Ying Army!

459
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:20,180
Xiao Haishan being loved by the people

460
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:24,460
has been written in a story. It's a good thing.

461
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,960
I feel honored.

462
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:52,000
[Harmony in Prosperity]

463
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,190
[Warm Southerly Breeze]

464
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,180
Young Master Xu. Young Master Mo.

465
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,660
He booked the whole theater again.

466
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,990
Come on.

467
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,420
Third Brother, what's up?

468
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:16,700
You alone? Did Commander ground you again?

469
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,610
Nonsense.

470
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:22,110
I just want some peace, so I kicked them out.

471
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,920
Usually, no matter how full the audience is, for you there can always be more.

472
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,430
And you want peace now?

473
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:30,690
Come on. We know you were scolded by Commander.

474
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:33,270
Have some tea. It's not a big deal.

475
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:44,500
Brother, what did Commander say about the military academy?

476
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,540
He said I must go.

477
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,830
Oh, great.

478
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,700
Brother, you should go. Don't worry.

479
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,790
Jade Pearl and all the girls in Beixin

480
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:55,200
will be safe in my hands.

481
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,460
- What?!
- I heard you have to enroll after the new year.

482
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,420
Though there's not much time left,

483
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:05,170
but Lingxi Lantern Festival to about to be here.

484
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:07,430
What's that expression of yours about?

485
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:10,310
What has it got to do with me going to the military academy?

486
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:13,220
Lingxi Lantern Festival is a festival where men and women confess their feelings to each other.

487
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:16,030
And it's a great opportunity for you to settle your engagement.

488
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:18,920
If you can invite her to go with you

489
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,690
and settle it between you,

490
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:23,500
then you can go to the military school worry-free.

491
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,360
Stop the fantasy.

492
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,330
She'll never come.

493
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:32,240
I'm not planning to invite her at all.

494
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,030
Fine. We all know

495
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:40,050
you have no feelings towards her.

496
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,050
But now in our opinion, what it is is that

497
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:45,630
she likes you.

498
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,530
Really?

499
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:53,320
You mean Lin Hangjing likes me?

500
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,830
Yeah.

501
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:58,610
As far as I'm concerned,

502
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:01,590
the more displeased a girl is with a guy, the more she likes him.

503
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:04,520
The person she cares about the most is the person she appears to dislike the most.

504
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,000
Then why did she take the bullet for you?

505
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,480
That makes sense.

506
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,360
As for why she isn't honest about her feelings...

507
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,590
One word.

508
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:21,190
Shy.

509
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,310
She is shy about it.

510
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:24,680
Well, if Miss Lin agrees to go with you,

511
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:29,800
that means she likes you. You two can just go with the flow.

512
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:33,720
Oh, come on.

513
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,230
You're just wasting your time.

514
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:39,450
I'm sure she won't go with me.

515
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,760
Well, that's when you need your friends.

516
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,420
You don't need to ask her in person.

517
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,920
We will do it for you.

518
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,080
Don't worry. Leave it to me and Big Fool Xu.

519
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,580
We'll make sure it's done.

520
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,240
Let's enjoy the show.

521
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,670
Let's enjoy the show.

522
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:06,610
Come. Here.

523
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:08,630
How is it?

524
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,980
Coming.
[Shengyi Girls School]

525
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,770
Hey, are you going to Lingxi Lantern Festival?

526
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:16,670
I want to go but it's boring to go on my own. I'm waiting for an invitation.

527
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,940
I want to go, too.

528
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,970
But unfortunately, I'm engaged already.

529
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,830
- Miss Lin.
- Miss Lin!

530
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,080
What can I do for you?

531
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:34,010
The thing is, Lingxi Lantern Festival is just a few days away.

532
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:36,900
It's a big event in Beixin City.

533
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,530
- A big event!
- The whole city will be decorated for the event.

534
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:41,380
It will be very beautiful.

535
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,590
The reason why we're here is to ask you

536
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:47,930
if you want to attend the event with Third Master.

537
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,960
Is it that what your Third Brother wants?

538
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,570
Oh no. It's us.

539
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:55,880
Yeah. It's us. Don't take it wrong.

540
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,130
I'm sorry. I can't make it.

541
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:03,800
Miss Lin, what happened between you and Third Master is all misunderstanding.

542
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:08,590
And he went a long way to get you medicine just to make sure you would be cured.

543
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:11,210
Could you out of some gratitude

544
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:14,250
- spend a festival with him?
- Yeah!

545
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,780
I'm very grateful.

546
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,810
It's just I just recovered. I don't want to go to a place full of people.

547
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:22,150
You don't need to worry about that. Our brother will make sure you're safe.

548
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:25,170
Yeah. Safety guaranteed.

549
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:28,220
Well, I'll go next time. I'm a little busy. I have to go now.

550
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,700
Sorry.

551
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,400
If Miss Lin is so busy,

552
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,690
I guess you won't have any time to

553
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:36,790
read this letter from the South.

554
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:38,450
[To Lin Hangjing from Jiangnan First Prison]

555
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,470
Why do you have my father's letter?

556
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,810
That's not important.

557
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:52,370
What's important is that we wanted to keep it safe for you.

558
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:54,300
As long as you spruce yourself up

559
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:58,040
and attend Lingxi Lantern Festival,

560
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:01,260
- we'll give the letter to you intact.
- Yeah.

561
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,960
Despicable!

562
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,150
We're just getting what we both want. It's called fairness.

563
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,850
Fairness.

564
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,440
Third Master is always surrounded by girls.

565
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,800
Why me?

566
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,500
Miss Lin, you took Third Master wrong again.

567
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:20,310
Our brother has never spent any time alone with girls.

568
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:23,260
You're the first one.

569
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:26,040
Being first matters.

570
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,960
Though there are many girls around him,

571
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,690
he is actually a very dedicated person.

572
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,660
Miss Lin, I'll take your silence as acquiescence.

573
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:45,590
We'll see you at the festival. It's a promise!

574
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:47,730
- Don't be late.
- Think about the letter.

575
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:50,070
- You two—
- Bye-bye.

576
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:53,010
You are great!
