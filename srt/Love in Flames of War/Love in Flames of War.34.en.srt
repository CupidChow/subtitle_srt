He bothered you and your wife.

Brother Shen, I came to get one word from you today.

You know my third brother has always respected you.

50
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:31,180
He's trusted you. So no matter what happens,

51
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,750
you won't forsake him or lie to him. Right?

52
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,590
Of course.

53
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,350
That's good.

Mr. Ding, it's my pleasure working with you.

My mission here

64
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,390
is to kick out the main competitive Japanese bidder for the port.

65
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:26,570
The port must not fall into Japanese hands.

66
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,590
I hope you can help me.

67
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:33,820
What do I need to do?

68
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,180
For a long time, you've been the leader of Beixin's underground patriotic groups.

69
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,360
You know the area well and have many connections.

70
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,320
So, during the bidding process,

71
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,830
I hope you can help me keep an eye on Sato and the Yamato Chamber of Commerce.

72
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:49,740
If they do anything strange, let me know immediately.

73
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,230
At the same time, investigate where Sato and his people usually go.

74
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:59,550
Their close contacts, and any change of personnel.

75
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,790
The Party is going through a very special period of time.

76
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,850
Our conversation will end here.

77
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,420
You must not tell a third person.

That's fine. Please don't worry.

79
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,600
I know that the Youth Union has been doing a great job in Beixin.

80
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,960
But things have changed.

81
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,160
Simply assassinating a few Japanese and traitors

82
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,840
isn't enough to unseat our enemy.

83
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,750
It will also put us in danger.

84
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,060
So, we need a long-term war plan.

85
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,960
We welcome all the youth who have the same beliefs

86
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,810
and the same goals as us.

87
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:41,920
I hope that one day, we can become true comrades.

88
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,820
Thank you. This is what I'm looking forward to as well.

89
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,770
I will consider your suggestion.

90
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:04,620
How time flies. It's been five years already since we were on our garrison duty at Suiling.

91
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,880
Isn't that right? Especially the Northern Expeditionary Army.

92
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,300
Within just two years, with just one hundred thousand soldiers,

93
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,560
they've shattered every obstacle along the way,

94
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,600
and defeated the Beiyang Armies which totaled hundreds of thousands of soldiers.

95
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,570
Why do you think the Northern Expeditionary Army can win with a smaller number of soldiers?

96
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,320
It must be because they don't mind using money.

97
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,720
Generous rewards will encourage soldiers to fight more bravely.

98
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,680
If the military funds are put into the commander's pockets,

99
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,350
which soldier would put their lives on the line? I would not.

100
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:36,330
Previously, the Northern Expedition Army won their victories because they were united as one and shared the same goal.

101
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:40,190
- Notify the three Battalions now. Go.
- The Beiyang fractions lost because they were the onlookers.

102
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,330
- Yes.
- They always want to benefit from others' conflict.

103
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:46,720
No matter who wins and who loses, almost all fractions now have changed their allegiance

104
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,830
and turned to believe in the Three Principles of the People.

105
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,000
Yes, everyone has a belief now.

106
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,720
But the belief has changed.

107
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,860
They want to get promoted and take money for themselves.

108
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,220
They believe in holding up their weapons for dictatorship.

Ms. Sheng,

121
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,030
I must apologize for my previous behavior.

122

In my emotional state,

There's no need.

126
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,390
I know why you did that.

127
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:28,590
Your sister, Miss Shuyi, came to find Yanqing.

128
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:32,490
To be honest, if I hadn't seen her photo for myself,

129
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,120
I would find it hard to believe that in this large world,

130
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,440
there could be someone who resembles me that much!

131
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,870
I thought you were my wife just because of your face.

132
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,400
If she found out,

133
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,770
she would be very unhappy.

134
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:52,330
Sir Xiao, don't blame yourself.

135
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,750
I think... if your wife knew that

136
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,790
after so many years, you still hadn't forgotten her,

137
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,200
she would be very happy in Heaven.

138
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:11,880
She hates me. I wrongfully blamed her.

139
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:17,220
Her death is my biggest punishment.

140
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,720
It is also my biggest regret.

141
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,500
I want to make up for it, but there's nothing I can do.

142
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,610
Ms. Sheng, if it were you,

143
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:37,080
would you give your husband a chance?

144
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,490
Since we don't think the same way,

145
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,600
then I don't need to limit my answer.

146
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,170
But... I wouldn't give my ex-boyfriends another chance to do something wrong.

147
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,970
Or else, I would've never met Yanqing.

148
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:00,510
So, Sir Xiao, I think you should look ahead.

149
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,280
Life has to continue, right?

150
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,560
Perhaps you and your wife had many unfortunate events.

151
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,580
But... I think you should start a new relationship

152
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:16,160
and get a new lover rather than hold onto the past.

153

When I was ten. St. Paul Girl's School still has my drawings.

You've come?

Why didn't you tell me when you came?

161
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,960
- You're back?
- I'm back.

162
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:58,040
Eldest Brother Shen, I came to apologize.

163
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,180
Last time, I was too rash.

164
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,220
There's no need, it's already in the past.

165
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:09,040
- I have some good red wine in the house. Tonight, let's drink—
- Mom!

166
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,090
Mom!

167
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,020
Xiao Ke!

168
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,640
Come, say hello.

169
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,280
Say hello to your uncle.

170
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,720
- Watch your manners.
- Uncle, Mom wants me to take medicine. I don't want to!

171
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,350
Look at you!

172
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:26,080
Aunt Zhang! This brat won't take his medicine!

173
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,160
Coming, Madam!

174
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,810
Mom, you must not pretend to be dumb when playing hide and seek.

175
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,030
Xiao Ke, say hello to Uncle Xiao.

176
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,730
Uncle!

177
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,070
Brother Shen,

178
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,670
I didn't know you two had a child.

179
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,340
I never got a chance to tell you.

180
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,480
His name is Shen Ke, he's three and a half.

181
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,020
Come, son!

182
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,260
Sing a song for Uncle! An English one!

183
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,220
♪ Dashing through the snow ♪

184
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,750
♪ In a one-horse open sleigh! ♪

185
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,090
♪ O'er the fields we go ♪

186
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,020
♪ Laughing all the way! ♪

187
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,450
Good job! Good boy!

188
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,290
Mom, Dad praised me!

189
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:12,820
You must let me eat ice cream! Ice cream!

190
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,690
You've already had a lot of ice cream!

191
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,910
You'll get bugs in your tummy!

192
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,650
- Let's have orange soda, okay?
- Okay!

193
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:22,790
You keep spoiling him! Orange soda will also give you bugs in your tummy!

194
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:27,250
Eldest Brother Shen, I'm sorry.

195
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,970
I still have things to do. Let's talk another day.

196
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,090
Didn't we agree to have dinner?

197
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,870
I still have military matters to take care of.

198
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,760
Thank you for your invitation. Next time.

199
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
- Beichen!
- Deputy Commander Xiao!

200
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,820
Ke'er, let's go drink orange soda.

201
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,920
Mom! Mom!

202
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:08,220
- Brother Shen.
- You're awake?

203
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:25,730
Frankly speaking, this is the first time I have seen Beichen's lonely expression.

204
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:30,070
I can tell he's very heartbroken.

205
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,350
If he's heartbroken,

206
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:40,640
no matter how heartbroken he is, that won't get my unborn child back.

207
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:46,230
Hangjing, we came prepared,

208
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:51,420
but now that we've arrived, I experienced

209
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,330
that what you experienced before is out of the ordinary.

210
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,910
You still haven't officially joined the organization.

211
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:03,900
If you find it hard, I can apply to the organization—

212
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,870
Brother Shen, ever since the bidding news came out,

213
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:11,300
I know you are trying to send people to infiltrate East Camp

214
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,290
to understand the Xiao family's attitude towards the Japanese.

215
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:17,050
However, East Camp has always been integrated and solid.

216
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,260
Du Heng is also at Suiling Garrison.

217
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:23,540
I know I am the best choice to get close to Xiao Beichen.

218
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:28,260
Don't worry. Since I agreed to return,

219
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:32,100
I won't let my personal emotions affect our mission.

220
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Third Brother, a telegram for you.

221
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:51,070
Codename "Migrate Bird," the leader of Zhibei Communist Party has arrived in Beixin. Ordered our troops to quickly clear traitors.

222
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,740
Tell them I got it.

223
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,380
"Codename "Migrate Bird,"

224
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,090
the leader of Zhibei Communist Party has arrived in Beixin.

225
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:14,840
Ordered our troops to quickly clear traitors."

226
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,420
That's right.

227
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:21,470
Our urgent task now is to focus on the port.

228
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:26,100
Besides, I can't conduct a manhunt for someone who I have a political disagreement with.

229
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,600
Besides, the massacre that happened in Shanghai

230
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,120
cannot happen in Beixin.

231
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,830
Just tell them we got it.

232
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,530
Okay.

233
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:48,550
Hey. Tomorrow,

234
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:51,120
send Old Li away for a bit.

235
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,330
Tell him it's a distribution of funds and provisions for the troops.

236
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,480
Okay...?

237
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:08,140
[Dong Quan Western Goods]

238
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,100
Uncle Xiao. Seventh Aunt.

239
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,060
We've been back for a while.

240
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:44,260
I was too busy with work and didn't have time to visit you. I apologize.

241
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,170
Don't say that. Young people...

242
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,250
should focus on work.

243
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,310
That's right.

244
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,710
Seventh Aunt. Uncle Xiao. Let me introduce her to you.

245
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,490
This is my wife, Sheng Hanjun.

246
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,080
Commander Xiao. Madam Xiao.

247
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,810
Seventh Aunt, this is a type of greeting from overseas.

248
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,300
That means Hanjun is very friendly.

249
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:15,680
I'm sorry, I forgot people aren't used to hugs in China.

250
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,600
Commander Xiao, it's a pleasure to meet you.

251
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,400
I am also very happy.

252
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,230
Yanqing sure is lucky.

253
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:27,300
Ms. Sheng is so beautiful.

254
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,960
If I didn't see you for myself, I wouldn't have believed

255
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,240
that you really look a bit like our Hangjing.

256
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:40,340
Deputy Commander Xiao has already emphasized this to me before.

257
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,210
Sister-in-law, don't use that to joke around with me.

258
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:48,010
Let's not stand here. Come and sit down.

259
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:50,040
All right, please!

260
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,430
Let's go.

261
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,120
Here, Hanjun.

262
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:10,400
Sister-in-law, I never imagined you grew up in Europe

263
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,540
but you use chopsticks so well.

264
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:18,050
Grandpa always told me that we are still Chinese in Europe.

265
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:20,890
So at home, we ate Chinese food.

266
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,670
Time sure passes quickly.

267
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:29,160
In the blink of an eye, Yanqing is already married.

268
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:33,780
I'm very curious. How did you two meet?

269
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,830
Seventh Aunt, Hanjun was in college at the time.

270
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:43,120
She and her schoolmates went to sketch near the garden where I lived.

271
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,570
I remember at that time, everyone was working hard to draw the scenery.

272
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:49,470
She was the only one drawing two dogs fighting.

273
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,230
She caught my eye then!

274
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,550
All right! Didn't you say you also loved oil paintings?

275
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:57,900
That's why you repeatedly brought oil paintings for me to admire?

276
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:01,280
You kept ignoring such a persistent pursuer!

277
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,210
I had to take a different approach.

278
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,640
Ms. Sheng, where in England did you live?

279
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,890
I was in London.

280
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:18,320
London? I heard London is a lot of fun.

281
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,180
There is some sort of... clock?

282
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:23,220
Seventh Madam, you are talking about Big Ben!

283
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,110
That is an iconic architecture of London!

284
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,530
It rings once an hour!

285
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,680
Every time it rings,

286
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,440
the sound will resonate all over the Thames River.

287
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,540
Also, my grandfather's company is also by the banks of the Thames River.

288
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,920
When I was little, I often went with Grandpa to watch them

289
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,700
seriously buy stocks. It was so boring.

290
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,860
I thought it'd be more fun to feed the pigeons in the plaza.

291
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,280
You two have compatible personalities.

292
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,340
He is a gentleman now.

293
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,390
When he was little, he and Beichen

294
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:05,540
would do all kinds of naughty misdeeds. Isn't that so?

295
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,040
Enough! The children have all grown up!

296
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,220
You are talking bad about him in front of his wife!

297
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,530
It's fine, Seventh Aunt. Hanjun

298
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:16,530
likes to hear about my embarrassing past!

299
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:38,480
Thank you for your warm welcome today. We had a good time.

300
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,440
Eldest Brother Shen, what are you saying? We were always family.

301
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,190
Oh, that's right.

302
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:49,330
There's something I hope you two can discuss.

303
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:51,920
What is it? Go ahead.

304
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,680
The Beixing port just started the bidding process.

305
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,400
We'll definitely have to talk with foreigners.

306
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,930
My secretary took an emergency vacation.

307
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:04,580
I heard Sister-in-law knows three languages.

308
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,510
I hope she can give me a hand.

309
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,790
This...

310
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:16,060
Brother Shen, you're not still thinking of what happened, are you?

311
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,970
Don't misunderstand. What happened before,

312
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:22,290
didn't we already explain it to each other?

313
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,750
I can totally understand how you felt then.

314
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:30,680
It's just... Hanjun likes her freedom more than rules.

315
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,470
A secretary needs to be careful and detailed.

316
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:36,870
I'm afraid she can't do your job.

317
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:41,220
If time wasn't running out, I wouldn't suddenly ask.

318
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:46,140
A person who knows foreign languages and someone I can trust,

319
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:50,600
besides Sister-in-law, I can't find anyone else.

320
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,730
- This...
- It's okay, Yanqing.

321
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,920
Since Deputy Commander Xiao has asked,

322
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:04,410
I have a lot of time on my hands anyway. I can help him.

323
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:07,190
If that's the case, that's great!

324
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:12,140
But before I start working, I have a few requests. I hope you can understand.

325
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,010
Of course, go ahead.

326
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:18,850
First, I need to do morning exercises every day and take care of Xiao Ke, too.

327
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:22,600
So I hope the starting time can be a bit more flexible.

328
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,690
Of course. Anything else?

329
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:29,580
Also, this is my first time going out to work, and I'm not familiar with East Main Camp.

330
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:35,000
If I do anything wrong, don't throw a fit and yell at me.

331
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,320
And don't tell Yanqing!

332
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,680
How could I dare? Anything else?

333
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,950
I can't work for free. I don't need money.

334
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:49,100
But you must give Yanqing insider news!

335
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:55,340
How about it? Work in exchange for exclusive news, that's not bad. Right?

336
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,730
Hanjun! Even if Beichen doesn't give me exclusive news,

337
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:01,390
I can use other methods to find it!

338
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:04,810
Are you suspecting your husband's abilities?

339
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:07,550
You know that's not what I mean!

340
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,230
All right.

341
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,790
I agree.

342
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,720
If any progress happens in the bidding process,

343
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,490
I will definitely give Brother Shen exclusive news.

344
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:20,120
Great! It's a promise!

345
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,790
Then, I look forward to working with you.

346
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:29,460
Fine. See you tomorrow, 8:00 a.m, at East Main Camp.

347
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,550
You forgot our promise already?

348
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:34,300
You said the starting time was flexible!

349
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:40,340
You are welcome anytime tomorrow at East Camp.

350
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,620
All right, Beichen, we'll leave first.

351
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,580
Let's go.

352
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,530
You saw it just now. She's completely different from Hangjing.

353
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:16,250
After that fire,

354
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:19,250
Hangjing can never come back again.

355
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:24,050
None of us want to see her go, but we

356
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:26,880
must face the truth.

357
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,800
If Hangjing saw you like this from Heaven,

358
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,530
she wouldn't want to see you so burdened. Right?

359
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,850
Listen to me.

360
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:40,400
It's time to let her go.

361
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,500
Seventh Aunt, I know.

362
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,610
I know what I should do.

363
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:50,670
Rest early.

364
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,780
Eldest Brother Shen, why are you still up?

365
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,570
I can't fall asleep.

366
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:18,300
Hanjun, this time

367
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:23,020
I discovered Beichen has deeper thoughts than I imagined.

368
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:28,120
Based on what I know about him, he wouldn't calm down about your appearance so quickly.

369
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,850
Nor would he easily believe your identity.

370
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:36,660
And now, he suddenly agreed he mistook you for someone else.

371
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,530
I think...

372
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,320
he is using retreat as a method of moving forward.

373
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:50,080
After you go there, he will use many methods to test you.

374
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,220
You must be very careful.

375
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:57,030
I understand. I definitely will not expose my identity.

376
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:02,500
You know. During these years,

377
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:06,340
how I spent that time.

378
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:11,410
Hanjun, you've suffered during these years.

379
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,480
However, this is a very difficult mission.

380
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,260
You must adjust immediately to any situation.

381
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,210
I remember. But, Eldest Brother Shen,

382
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:24,570
based on your evaluation, do you think

383
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:28,190
based on your judgment, would the Xiao family sign a co-prosperity agreement with the Japanese?

384
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:33,240
From my own perspective, I trust Beichen.

385
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,710
However, Uncle Xiao is the current commander of the troop.

386
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:40,510
His position represents the Xiao family's position.

387
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:45,440
I was at Xiao Manor for many years, I understand what he's like.

388
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,450
He definitely isn't someone to sell out the country for personal fortune.

389
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:53,050
However, he has always been following Jin Cheng blindly.

390
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:55,020
Yes.

391
00:30:56,930 --> 00:31:01,200
However, Jin Cheng instigated the international bidding

392
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,320
and gave the Japanese a chance to bid.

393
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,270
The Xiao family didn't oppose it.

394
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:10,370
Did the Xiao family participate in this exchange of benefits?

395
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,570
It's hard to say.

396
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:17,670
If Jin Cheng loses and the port falls into Japanese hands,

397
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:24,110
the consequences would be unthinkable! We cannot let that happen.

398
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:26,670
I understand.

399
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:29,170
Mr. Han is someone we trust.

400
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:33,210
Also, when he was helping the patriots, he has always been generous with money.

401
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:38,440
Only if the port falls into his hands, will it not be used by those with ulterior motives.

402
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,580
Brother Shen, don't worry. I will start working with the Youth Union as soon as possible.

403
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,860
Leave Xiao Beichen to me.

404
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:48,390
I will definitely find a way to clear up the Xiao family's position.

405
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,310
All right!

406

You've come? Come in.

408

Come. I've prepared this for you.

This is information on all the foreign companies interested in Beixin port.

I hope you can present it in Chinese and English.

And also, complete all the audits

416

and send them to Huaxing Hotel to a professional audit team for review.

417

I was wondering why you told Old Li to leave.

430

don't you suspect their motives?

I understand what you want to say.

00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,700
Recently, Xiao Beichen only had me translate some basic bidding information.

483
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,600
The bidding process is a blind process.

484
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,200
Right now, it seems to be fair.

485
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,000
That's right.

486
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I recently found some files on commerce agreements between East Main Camp and the Japanese.

487
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
But it's just some normal business information.

488
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I didn't find any important clues.

489
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:49,800
This isn't so simple. Take things slowly.

490
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,700
I will look for another chance.

491
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,800
- Come, have some meat.
- Thank you.

492
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,000
Master. Madam.

493
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,600
A woman came to me to ask about you two today.

494
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,600
Aunt Zhang, don't reject them right away.

495
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,000
You know what to say and do.

496
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,200
Yes, Madam.

497
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,200
Go on.

498
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,200
Could it be Xiao Beichen?

499
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,200
That's possible.

500
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,000
But besides him,

501
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,200
there are others who want to know your identity even more.

502
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,800
Then...

503
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:41,000
could it be... Zheng Fengqi?

504
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,600
She's a possibility.

505
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:49,800
As far as I know, this Zheng Fengqi has gotten very close with the Japanese recently.

Xu Zijun, what are you doing here?

512
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,200
Nothing. I just happened to be sending someone this way.

513
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,400
Shuyi, please don't treat me like this.

514
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,700
You really won't give me any chance at all?

515

I know you've been waiting for Brother Shen. That's fine, I'll wait with you!

But it's been five years! He's married with a child!
