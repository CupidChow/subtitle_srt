00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:46,560
She would never harm my reputation or the reputation of the Ying Troops.

168
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,270
We joined the army to go to war

169
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,770
to guard our home and defend our country.

170
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:57,380
If we cannot have full faith in our families,

171
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:02,950
if we cannot stand with them as others gossip,

172
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,970
then what meaning is there in winning our battles?

173
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,590
To those who slander my innocent wife,

174
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,860
I will find out the truth...

175
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,380
and exact severe punishment!

176
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,620
Aren't you bored staying in the house by yourself?

177
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:18,980
Of course not. I usually never get to see how you look in the army.

178
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,710
So? Was I impressive today?

179
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:30,380
My wife, you allowed me to earn some prestige today.

180
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,880
Let me give you a small reward.

181
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,550
What is it?

182
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,990
Come here.

183
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,020
Sit down.

184
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,430
The osmanthus candy that you like.

185
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,170
Thank you.

186
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,960
Let me open it for you.

187
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,570
Here.

188
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,480
Is it sweet?

189
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,760
Here.

190
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,300
What's the hurry to meet with me?

191
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,830
I've thought it over.

192
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:35,700
I decided to work with you and Commander Kang.

193
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,390
Right. After all, we are all fathers.

194
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:42,730
How can we sit by and watch our children suffer?

195
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,980
Old Mo,

196
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,220
tell me.

197
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,590
Commander Kang set a trap for the Xiao family.

198
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,340
What is the meaning?

199
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,790
You'll find out soon enough.

200
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:03,610
When the time comes, please cooperate.

201
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,260
Let's drink.

202
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,670
You're here.

203
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:36,370
Fengqi, you finally agreed to meet with me.

204
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,640
Xiao Beichen has put out an order for my arrest.

205
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,870
I have nowhere to run now.

206
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:45,850
You told me to approach Lin Hangjing, drug her, and take her to a hotel. I've done it all.

207
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,550
When will you be with me?

208
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,330
After all that,

209
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:55,310
what was it that you did?

210
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,540
Did you ruin Lin Hangjing's reputation?

211
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,260
You didn't.

212
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,820
I can't control what happens afterward!

213
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,400
You didn't expect things would reach this point either.

214
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:17,790
Fengqi, you know how much I love you.

215
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:21,700
Leave here and go back to France with me.

216
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,360
Do you really love me?

217
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:33,520
If you truly love me that much, do me one more favor.

218
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,860
Here.

219
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:53,210
What’s that?

220
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:57,850
What’s the rush? You will know shortly.

221
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:20,080
Zizheng!

222
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,170
- Governor.
- Governor.

223
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,420
Lay down. Don’t move.

224
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,490
Rest well.

225
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,630
It doesn’t bother me, Governor.

226
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:35,480
But why did that person want to kill you?

227
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,500
I’ve offended way too many people in my lifetime.

228
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,860
I guess it must have been done by some underground organization.

229
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,130
Those nobodies always hide in the dark.

230
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:52,140
There is nothing I can do. But if I capture one, I’ll kill one.

231
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,160
How’s your physical condition?

232
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,490
The bomb was pretty powerful,

233
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:05,550
but I was quite lucky. I didn’t get injured.

234
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,980
There is something I’m sure,

235
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,520
it’s that you were the one who saved me.

236
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:13,090
Why would you do that?

237
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,430
Miss Rouke saved my life,

238
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:21,490
I should do everything to protect her father’s life.

239
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,740
Otherwise, how can I face her?

240
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:30,020
Good. I don’t care what your intention was,

241
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,420
but you indeed saved me.

242
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,020
What is your wish.

243
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:39,050
Tell me and I’ll fulfill it.

244
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,350
Thank you, Governor.

245
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,740
I only want to pay back Miss Rouke’s rescue.

246
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,050
It’s fine. Take your time to recuperate.

247
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:50,980
Once you make up your mind, you can tell me then. I’m going to attend to business now.

248
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:57,370
Zizheng, if you need anything, please let me know.

249
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,640
Thank you, Miss Rouke.

250
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,960
Here.

251
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,790
You prepared this?

252
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:20,160
Then I must give it a try.

253
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,270
Do you have something on your mind?

254
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,620
Father, I’ve a suggestion.

255
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:39,350
Can Zizheng stay here and work for you?

256
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,830
Although this brat saved my life,

257
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:47,580
you have to understand one thing.

258
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:51,060
He has nothing to offer, he has no money.

259
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:54,820
Whether he has nothing or not is not based on your words.

260
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:02,060
Rouke, tell me the truth.

261
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,880
Are you falling for the kid?

262
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,530
Father, what are you talking about?

263
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:11,130
You can’t fool me.

264
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,930
Actually, I understand.

265
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:19,190
You have resented me in the last few years.

266
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:24,510
I didn’t do well in the past.

267
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:28,150
I was rude.

268
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,510
If I didn’t intervene in your business barbarically,

269
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:33,550
perhaps you might have been married.

270
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:37,270
Father, that’s all history and I totally understood.

271
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,870
What you did was in my best interests.

272
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:43,480
That’s the right attitude.

273
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,770
Which father on earth would not adore their daughters?

274
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:53,460
But, Father, I really admire Zizheng.

275
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,510
I think he is brave

276
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:58,850
also loyal; this kind of person is difficult to find,

277
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,110
If we invite an outsider to join our family,

278
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:10,090
it’s like a knife with two blades.

279
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:13,350
If we know how to use it, it’s a good knife.

280
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:17,630
If we fail to use the knife properly, we’ll hurt ourselves.

281
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:20,900
We’ve only known Zizheng for a short period of time.

282
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:25,260
We don’t know him well enough. Is he even on our side?

283
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,020
I believe that if I show my sincere heart, I’ll have the same in return.

284
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,270
Also, this incident happened so quickly.

285
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,220
Zizheng used his life to save us,

286
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,640
You don’t think he deserves to be groomed?

287
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,650
Those are all good reasons.

288
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:43,230
I’m not the kind of person who won’t return kindness.

289
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:48,570
Let’s do this. Once he is fully recovered,

290
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:51,110
let him stay at our home.

291
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,210
I’ll notify Deputy Officer Zhou.

292
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:56,400
We'll just prepare one more set of tableware when we have dinner.

293
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,250
Thank you, Father.

294
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:01,980
We found Qiao Jiang's dead body under the Anguang Bridge in Northern Town.

295
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,350
Looks like someone killed him to cover up the crime.

296
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:09,150
A few months ago, we found that Qiao Jiang donated some money to the charity fund of the Education Bureau.

297
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:12,180
And that's why he was recommended to Chengyu.

298
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:18,220
After investigation, we realized that the family background and the pharmaceutical factory he talked about are all fake.

299
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:21,450
His identity is completely fake.

300
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,750
Do you remember the stamp cachet we found on the back side of the photo?

301
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,510
I wanted to find a clue from there.

302
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:30,390
But there are so many similar stamps. It's like looking for a needle in the ocean.

303
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:33,370
Weiyi and I went to his place too and inquired to his servant.

304
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:36,140
We found that apart from Third Sister-in-law and the students,

305
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,130
he wasn't interacting with anyone else.

306
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:41,970
So now he's dead, and we've lost a clue.

307
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,210
There must be something complex going on behind him.

308
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:46,850
Reporting!

309
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:51,610
Army Chief, Commander has something urgent to discuss with you.

310
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,070
Wait for me here.

311
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:02,790
Father, what happened?

312
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,270
An uprising is happening at the 8th Brigade of Suiling.

313
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:10,520
They attacked Jingyuan during the night and took over most of it.

314
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,250
Now there are refugees everywhere,

315
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,720
and the governor ordered me to lead an army in person, exterminate their forces,

316
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,250
and get Jingyuan back.

317
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,320
- He ordered you to go?
- Yes.

318
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:23,050
I'll go instead of you.

319
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:26,120
Since the governor ordered my name,

320
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,750
it means it's a military order.

321
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:32,110
But what I want to tell you the most now, is that since you've chosen Hangjing to be your wife,

322
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,380
I hope you can cherish each other

323
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,840
and stay together.

324
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,540
Seventh Aunt and I both want to see the two of you happy.

325
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:43,860
All of your father's military power will be handed over to you in the future.

326
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,750
Father, I understand.

327
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:50,000
Hangjing and I will cherish each other.

328
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,430
- But for your safety, I'm still...
- It's fine.

329
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:55,750
Say no more. The military order has to be obeyed.

330
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:01,000
And your father wants to win one more war before he retires.

331
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,580
Okay.

332
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,490
Hey. Why are you packing these up?

333
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:21,220
This is your favorite.

334
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,660
Old aged white tea.

335
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:27,380
And this. Walnut cookies from Shun Fu Xiang.

336
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:31,410
And this is canned beef that I asked Madam Sun to buy from the Americans.

337
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:33,800
It can be preserved for a long time. I'll pack them all for you.

338
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:38,060
I'm going to fight a war, not taking a field trip. Why do I need to bring these?

339
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:41,670
I'm afraid that you'll have trouble eating and sleeping.

340
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:45,050
Oh, and this. A prescription from Doctor Liu.

341
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:49,220
You’re a light sleeper, and you always wake up when there's some noise. His prescription is the best.

342
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,560
I'll pack a few for you.

343
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:59,400
It's enough. Stop packing. Have a seat.

344
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:10,440
This, A'Zhen, do you think I'm really old?

345
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,920
What are you talking about?

346
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:17,180
In your eyes, I'm always invincible.

347
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:22,130
But why are you so worried this time?

348
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,290
Of course, you're invincible.

349
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:32,190
But I'm not worried about the invincible Commander Xiao.

350
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:38,590
I'm worried about my man, Xiao Haishan.

351
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:47,740
I met you when I was 17, and ever since, I've followed you in the army as your wife.

352
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,750
I'm used to being in the storms of bullets and shells.

353
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:55,820
Everyone thinks that I'm afraid of nothing.

354
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:00,770
But who knows that every time you were on the battleground,

355
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:06,760
my heart was wrenching, and there was not one moment that I was not afraid

356
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,700
or not anxious.

357
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:13,660
Haishan, promise me.

358
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,320
Come back safe.

359
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,350
I'll be waiting for you at home.

360
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,510
Look at you.

361
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:25,430
As long as you'll be waiting for me at home,

362
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,370
I'll definitely come back.

363
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,980
The 8th Brigade of Suiling is attacking us from three lanes.

364
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:12,220
They've taken advantage of their knowledge of topography and destroyed two of our lines of defense.

365
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:16,360
They've also united with the 9th Brigade of Ningchuan in the south lane,

366
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:20,020
and attacked us several times, from both directions.

367
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:23,410
They've gradually advanced towards us. Now,

368
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,600
we can only retreat to Eagle Beak Hill.

369
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,760
Commander, this is the border already.

370
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,190
We almost have no room for further retreat.

371
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:36,210
Give the order. I'll lead the troops myself.

372
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:38,770
Commander, we have lost many soldiers.

373
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:42,340
And our forces are weak now. You can't take that risk.

374
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:46,880
Our troops need the morale to win. I have to go.

375
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:50,900
You two take the backup army and protect the command center.

376
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,870
Wait for my order and send reinforcements at any time.

377
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,960
This is an order.

378
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,860
- Yes!
- Yes!

379
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,400
Let’s go!

380
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,950
[Be serious and cautious]

381
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,300
Third Brother!

382
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,040
Chief Commander is surrounded by the Suiling 8th Brigade and Ningchuan 9th Brigade.

383
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,890
They’re trapped.

384
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,840
Zijun. Weiyi.

385
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,640
You two go get ready and wait for my order.

386
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,640
- Yes!
- Yes!

387
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:52,000
Instructor Du, can you do me a favor?

388
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,220
We will make contact later.

389
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:03,170
When will the reinforcements from Division Commander Zheng and Regiment Commander Mo arrive?

390
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,100
Our reinforcements might not be able to make it.

391
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,750
Why?

392
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,780
We can't get through to the command center.

393
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:13,560
We haven't heard anything back from the messenger we sent. We don't know if he's still alive.

394
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,990
Send someone else. Send messages to the whole army.

395
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:19,260
This is our last line of defense. We have to hold on to it!

396
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,660
Yes, Sir!

397
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,220
Wait a moment.

398
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:28,300
Commander, the firing seems to have stopped.

399
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,220
Let's go out and see what's happening.

400
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:44,340
Old Mo, Commander has been holding on there for four days.

401
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,190
Are we really not sending any troops to support him?

402
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:52,510
Don't you remember our goal of coming here?

403
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:55,090
We don't want him to make it back.

404
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:58,980
But have you ever thought about it?

405
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,790
If the news spreads out and people learn about it,

406
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:05,780
we're at the risk of being beheaded.

407
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,560
We didn't receive any orders of sending support troops.

408
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:13,180
He'll be dead and nobody can prove it. It will be his problem

409
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:17,010
that he was reckless and died on the battlefield.

410
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:24,160
I didn't expect that the terrain of Eagle Beak Hill was quite precipitous

411
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,690
and it became a natural barrier for him.

412
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:31,220
But without support troops, let's see how much longer he can do.

413
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,220
Old Mo, I think we should still...

414
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,910
Army Commander!

415
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,690
Third Master?

416
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:45,060
Third Master, what brings you here?

417
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,250
How's it going with my father?

418
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:50,070
Commander is being besieged at the Eagle Beak Hill.

419
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,720
He couldn't break out of the siege.

420
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,900
We tried several times, but there's no way we can go in.

421
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,470
How could it be?

422
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:59,070
This time, the enemy has everything to their advantage.

423
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,690
They first bombarded the command center and messages couldn't get through.

424
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,800
And then they killed the messenger, Wu Tianbao.

425
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,260
We found his body. Otherwise, we could have taken the opportunity to send support.

426
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,080
We didn't manage to send support in time,

427
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,040
Division Commander Zheng and I should be responsible. Please punish us.

428
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:17,730
Uncle Zheng and Uncle Mo, it's not your fault.

429
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:20,000
Things change so fast on the battleground.

430
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,770
What about... I go there and defeat them.

431
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:27,680
- Third Master, I'll go with you.
- There's no need to.

432
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,760
Please stay here and guard the command center.

433
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,970
Our foundation has to be secured.

434
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,620
Third Master.

435
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:39,330
Are you sure? The enemy is quite aggressive this time.

436
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,100
Uncles, there's no need to hold me back.

437
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,290
I've made up my mind.

438
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:50,060
Okay. We'll strengthen the defense of the command center immediately.

439
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,230
Commander! Watch out!

440
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,410
Charge!

441
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,050
Protect Commander!

442
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,370
Go!

443
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:35,240
Commander!

444
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,850
Hide!

445
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,160
Go!

446
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,370
Let's get out of here!

447
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:20,200
Commander, how's your injury?

448
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,280
I'm fine.

449
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,660
Commander Xiao!

450
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:25,060
There's no way you can escape now!

451
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:28,260
Put down your gun and surrender!

452
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,030
If you surrender now,

453
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:32,470
we can still give you a chance to live.

454
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:18,470
Xiao Haishan! On the count of three!

455
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:23,140
If you still don't surrender, I'll shoot!

456
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,450
One!

457
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,000
Two!

458
