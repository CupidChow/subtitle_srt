You are...

22
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,200
Don't speak. Get some rest first.

Rou Ke.

24
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,100
Father.

25
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,000
Who is this?

26
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,800
You've been gone all day but you're not out hunting,

27
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,200
instead you're secretly feeding the wild cats and dogs?

28
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,800
- Father.
- Grab him and kick him out.

29
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,400
Wait!

30
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,800
What if I said you can't?

31
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,600
How can you associate with him?

32
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,800
I saved him, he belongs to me.

33
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,700
I want him alive.

34
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,400
Can you see it? I've seen way too many dead people.

35
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,200
It's all rotted and unsalvageable.

36
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,700
It's depressing to keep him here.

37
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,300
Come.

38
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,200
Father! He can...

39
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,250
This lady saved my life.

40
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:23,040
If she wants me to be alive, I'll be alive.

41
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,770
What a nice brat!

42
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,100
Are you here to show your attitude in front of me?

43
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,200
Father, I'm here to beg you for some medications.

44
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,700
Why would I give him any medications?

45
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,000
You! Come on!

46
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
What are you doing?

47
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,800
For someone who you've never met before? Is it worth it?

48
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,400
Father, if you want me to give up on him, it's the same as if I send him to death.

49
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,800
I can't do this kind of heartless act.

50
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,400
Also, he deserves my assistance.

51
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,600
How much do you know about him?

52
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,000
What's his identity? His background?

53
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Do you know anything?

54
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,000
I don't.

55
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
If you don't know anything, how can you say whether he deserves it or not?

56
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,600
Even if I knew his identity and background, it wouldn't mean anything to me.

57
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,800
My dear daughter, are you still holding a grudge against me?

58
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,600
Look who you were with before.

59
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,000
Father!

60
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,200
That is all history, don't mention it anymore.

61
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,400
He would lose his life for this one person in his heart, he can't be a bad person.

62
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,600
I'm a bad person? Am I a bad person?

63
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,200
You... You!

64
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,400
Fine! Fine!

65
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,890
Thank you, Father.

66
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,700
Hangjing.

67
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,400
Fengqi, you are...

68
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,600
Third Brother is going to discuss something with Weiyi later at the race track.

69
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,000
Why don't you come with us? We can also ride horses together.

70
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I still have two teaching proposals that need to be done; it will be late.

71
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's fine. You can do it some other day.

72
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Fengqi.

73
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,600
Sorry to keep you waiting. Let's go.

74
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,300
Let's go, Hangjing.

75
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,800
I don't know how to ride a horse.

76
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,200
That's right. Hangjing doesn't know how to ride a horse.

77
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,600
Don't force her to do so.

78
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,200
We're leaving.

79
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,400
You found this place that even rats refuse to come.

80
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,600
A run-down building is not important, life is more important.

81
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,200
Let's talk business.

82
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,400
Commander Kang sent a message.

83
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,000
He wants you to wrap up on Zheng Laocu's matter.

84
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,100
There is a big move after that.

85
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,700
He didn't hint to you about what it was about?

86
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
He only wants to know if

87
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,900
Zheng Laocu turns against the Xiao Family,

88
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,300
will you be confident about it?

89
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,810
Please tell Commander not to worry.

90
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,950
Zheng Laocu's weakness is his daughter.

91
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,600
Fengqi and Beichen have been too close lately. What will Hangjing be thinking?

92
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,200
That's too inappropriate.

93
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,100
Seventh Aunt, you are overthinking it.

94
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,000
They grew up together from a young age. They're close, so what?

95
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Also, Lin Hangjing has been neglecting Third Brother anyways.

96
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,800
I see Third Brother might be realizing the good in Sister Fengqi.

97
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,100
Look at Sister Fengqi.

98
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,800
She is beautiful, has great manners, and is also gentle.

99
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,000
She is also educated.

100
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,300
I say, Xiao Shuyi,

101
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,000
can you use your brain before you speak?

102
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,400
I don't think Fengqi is an insensitive child.

103
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,300
Right? You also know Beichen the best.

104
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,380
Didn't you say he loves Hangjing

105
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,100
wholeheartedly?

106
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,800
Regarding that play in the girl's school, I heard about it.

107
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,800
I'm sure there is some misunderstanding between them.

108
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,800
If there is any misunderstanding, then they should talk it out.

109
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,400
Everyone seems so stubborn, what are we going to do?

110
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,400
Don't worry.

111
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,600
Beichen is a sensible person.

112
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,200
You better not intervene.

113
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,700
- I...
- That's it.

114
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,500
Miss Zheng, please enjoy.

115
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,000
Our young master asked the kitchen to prepare it specifically for you.

116
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Look.

117
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,300
That's jade pearl meatballs.

118
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,400
You still remember?

119
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,300
This was your favorite when you were young.

120
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,600
You can't taste it anywhere else.

121
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,800
Only your family chef can prepare this.

122
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,600
When I was in France, I was craving it so much.

123
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,200
Try it and see if it tastes the same as when you were young?

124
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:45,450
Third Brother, how come only Sister Fengqi can eat it?

125
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,530
I want to try it, too.

126
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:50,290
How can kids be such gluttons?

127
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,020
That is a special dish your Third Brother prepared for Sister Fengqi.

128
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,900
None of you can have it.

129
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,820
This much food can't shut your mouth?

130
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,910
Father.

131
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:13,780
Seventh Aunt. I remembered that there's something I need to do at the East Main Camp. I need to go there now.

132
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,970
Third Master, it's already late. Can't you do it tomorrow?

133
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,750
I've got something else to do tomorrow.

134
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,820
Okay. You can go.

135
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,520
I‘ll head over there.

136
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,670
Third Brother! Third Brother!

137
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,470
Why are you coming out?

138
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,380
Are you going to sleep at the East Main Camp again tonight?

139
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:01,800
You asked me to cooperate and put up a show, and I did.

140
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,380
But then what? You made Hangjing feel bad.

141
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,710
It only pushes her away from you.

142
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,100
And she and I are good friends.

143
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,390
It's awkward for us. I can't even explain to her what happened.

144
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,500
You saw it, too.

145
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:20,390
No matter who I'm with or what I say, she doesn't care at all.

146
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:24,170
Can't you talk to each other?

147
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:27,240
It even makes me worried, too.

148
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,940
I'd love to have a talk with her. But how?

149
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,850
Talking to her is like hitting against a nail.

150
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,990
Eventually, it will be an unpleasant conversation that tears us apart.

151
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:39,230
Okay. You should go back. That's it.

152
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:02,620
Lin Hangjing, it was you who proposed the idea of a contract marriage.

153
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,990
Why are you feeling sad?

154
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:09,350
One day, you will have to leave him.

155
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:14,280
If he is in love with someone else, isn't that great?

156
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,500
Your coffee.

157
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,300
Teacher Lin, I'm sorry for

158
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,580
creating the misunderstanding between you and Third Master Xiao.

159
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:38,310
Sir Qiao, this has nothing to do with you. You don't need to feel sorry.

160
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:43,590
But I've been thinking. I can't just let it hurt your relationship.

161
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:49,410
Maybe you can arrange for me to meet with Third Master Xiao. I can apologize to him in person.

00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,540
But...

328
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:26,950
But, Father, do you know?

329
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:30,010
When I was in France alone,

330
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,470
I had no family around. Do you know how much suffering I've gone through?

331
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:40,440
But every time I thought of him,

332
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,690
I'd just kept holding on, no matter how hard it was.

333
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:51,240
Because I thought we were naturally going to be together.

334
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,670
Until I heard the news that he got married.

335
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,060
I came back regardless of everything.

336
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:03,930
But it was too late.

337
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:08,240
Silly child...

338
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:17,500
Why did you not tell me earlier?

339
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,790
What's the point of saying it?

340
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,700
For what Third Master Xiao has decided to do,

341
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,740
it's so hard to change his mind.

342
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:43,260
Now, Lin Hangjing is involved in such a big scandal.

343
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,470
It's a disgrace for the whole army.

344
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:49,430
There's no reason for the Xiao Family

345
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:52,030
to not divorce Lin Hangjing.

346
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:57,940
Don't worry. Father is here. You and Third Master...

347
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,270
will definitely be together by fate.

348
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,700
Sit.

349
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:32,170
Third Master, do you know?

350
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:35,370
The news about Hangjing has spread across the army.

351
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:39,940
Father, I shouldn't let you worry about us.

352
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:43,360
But please don't blame Hangjing for it. She...

353
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,520
There's no need to explain it to me.

354
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,270
I trust Hangjing for her moral standards.

355
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:53,450
Your Seventh Aunt and I have agreed.

356
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,470
Now that the issue with the governor has passed,

357
00:30:55,470 --> 00:31:00,500
if there's really no love between the two of you,

358
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,660
there's no need to keep the marriage with so much effort.

359

Father.

360
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,020
Hangjing is my wife.

361
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,480
She's the daughter-in-law of the Xiao Family.

362
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:16,410
I only have this one woman in my life.

363
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,340
And that's Lin Hangjing.

364
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,400
You're confusing me.

365
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,840
Is there love between you two, or is there not?

366
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,540
Your son has decided for his life that she's the one.

367
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:36,360
Son, it will be hard to keep a relationship like that.

368
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:45,450
Even if it's a mistake,

369
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:50,050
I’m willing to stay wrong till the end and never regret it.

370
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:57,140
Fine. Since you've made up your mind,

371
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,060
I won't bring this up again in the future.

372
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:05,450
But can you show us that you're going to live your life properly

373
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:08,390
and not mess around like that. Okay?

374
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,110
Yes.

375
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,380

our marriage contract lasts for two years.

I can save your reputation and your family's.

Do you really want to save my reputation...

386

Why do you twist my words?

If we don't have trust between us,

390

we'll just torture ourselves. What is the point of being together?

[Frontier Army Command of Zhibei Region]

401

Commander, are you still upset?

402
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,440
Why trouble yourself with

403
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,710
the matter between Third Master and his wife?

404

I...

405
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:02,990
Say the family affair becomes the talk of the town. I feel sorry for you all.

406

That is understandable.

407
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:10,520
But, Commander, if they don't love each other,

408

Doesn't Miss Lin want to go back to the South?

410
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,570
You can let Third Master divorce her.

411
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:30,430
I am still willing to marry my daughter to Third Master.

412

Besides, I still have a troop of more than 10,000 soldiers.

keep Third Master's reputation.

You want my son to divorce her

Even though Third Master Xiao's wife got into this big scandal,

Mo Xibai, I... might be rough on the edge

and I cannot compare myself to your sophisticated background,

You have always believed you would be the father-in-law of Xiao Beichen.

455
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:53,570
But look at the situation now.

456

we can split Xiao's fortune in the future.

460
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:30,610
Think about it. If Xiao Beichen has to obey us,

00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:33,940
then he will see Fengqi from a different angle.

A great opportunity is in front of you.

I bought it from the black market.

There are no German anti-inflammatory drugs on the black market.

♫ Who is afraid of heartbreak, denies the heartbeat? ♫

490
00:43:54,990 --> 00:44:00,020
♫ Allow loneliness to smear the other’s protective coloration ♫

491
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:05,460
♫ Who would be willing to pass the other like this ♫

492
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:11,380
♫ I also want to be a shooting star to make you warm ♫

493
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:19,360
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

494
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:24,990
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

495
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:30,590
♫ At least the flight will be smooth ♫

496
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:36,280
♫ Waiting for a promise my whole life ♫

497
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:41,860
♫ I cherish even the short-lived happiness ♫

498
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:47,440
♫ Leave some tenderness to the years ♫

499
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:53,200
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

500
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:58,780
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫

501
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:04,420
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

502
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:09,870
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

503
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:17,570
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

504
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:31,260
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫
