00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,470
The headquarters of the Japanese Kwantung Army officially issued a battle command to attack Rehe.

48
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,000
The Kwantung Army newly added the army strength of two brigades at the Beixin border.

49
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,760
Officially launching an attack towards the Ying Army separately from the two south and east routes.

50
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:24,180
With gunfire every day and ferocious attacks.

51
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:29,210
The Ying Army fought fiercely against the Japanese forces outside Beixin City in areas such as Yujiajie, Miodian, Sanwantang.

52
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:34,270
An indomitable confrontation with the Japanese invaders that lasted till March.

53
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,970
The battlefield was just thirty miles away from Beixin city.

54
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:52,060
To Beixin, this moment,

55
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,030
meant the soldiers were at the city's gate.

I moved in with Beichen into the control center at the front lines.

00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,690
Commander, news came from Beiping.

59
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,970
Huang Fu is already prepared to discuss the conditions of a truce with the Japanese side.

60
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,610
Discuss a truce?

61
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,530
Is the Nanjing Government telling us to hand over the land?

62
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,870
Have they lost their minds?

63
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,990
Can they still call themselves Chinese if they do that?!

64
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,420
- That's right!
- That's right!

65
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,430
After the Songhu battle, they signed an agreement to stop the battle at Shanghai.

66
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,600
National security is imperative.

67
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,640
Compromise appropriately, and put the overall interests above anything else.

68
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,470
This is the Nanjing Government's usual code of conduct.

69
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,340
Commander, we wait for your decision.

70
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,110
What's there to decide?

71
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,980
We will forever be at odds with the Japanese!

72
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,450
We must fight this war!

73
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,380
Even if we only have one soldier left,

74
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,680
we also need to protect my land.

Yes.

Amazing!

81
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,190
I only went out for a bit, and you managed to buy lotus seeds.

82
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,460
What season is it?

83
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,530
I went out with Assistant Commander Zhang

84
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,680
and happened to see an old lady selling lotus seeds.

85
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,360
Now that you've returned,

86
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,890
let's eat lotus seed congee today.

What times are we in?

88
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,480
How could there be an old lady selling lotus seeds on the road?

89
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:07,370
No matter what time it is, people have to live on.

90
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,940
You...!

91
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,120
You...! You're creating trouble for me!

92
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,330
Look at me. I was so busy listening to you speak

93
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,060
I wasn't paying attention.

94
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,430
All right. Then I'll have to bother my wife to

95
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,940
make me a bowl of lotus seed porridge.

96
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,430
All right, all right. I really can't

97
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,930
continue bothering the commander's hands.

98
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:47,560
I've been working all day, and you ruined half of it as soon as you arrived!

99
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,880
Get to work!

100
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,460
If you don't create trouble for me, that's helping me enough!

101
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,030
Why does it sound like

102
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,850
you're not praising me?

103
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,350
It was so hard to get half a day free.

104
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,470
I wanted to spend some time with you.

105
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,680
In the end, look at you.

106
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,620
You think I'm in your way?

107
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,030
- You think I'm in your way?
- Stop it!

108
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:13,370
All right, you have half a day off. Hurry and get to work.

109
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:16,260
I have things to do.

110
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,090
Thank you.

111
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:53,000
The commander-in-chief personally wrote to tell all troops and military officers

112
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,300
that the nation is not going to be a nation, how can the soldiers have the face to live in this world?

113
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,220
The war is right in front of us. We will definitely fight with the Japanese until the end!

114
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,730
We will live and die with Beixin!

115
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,040
You're done already?

116
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,060
Hurry and eat it before it gets cold.

117
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,760
Come.

118
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,530
Stop working on that.

119
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:21,110
You should just leave these to the attendants.

120
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,290
Don't mind me.

121
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,120
I'm willing to do it.

122
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,340
You don't say. Your lotus seed congee

123
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,460
can't be found anywhere else.

124
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,350
I only like this taste.

125
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:04,980
Hurry and try this on.

126
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:24,140
I wear this every day. Aren't you tired of seeing it?

127
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,140
Hangjing.

128
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,050
If that day really comes,

129
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,830
when Beixin City will be lost,

130
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,630
remember to kill me with one shot first.

131
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,750
Don't say that.

132
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:55,170
If you really can't do it,

133
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,710
I won't force you.

134
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,540
Isn't there a river in Beixin?

135
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,290
I'll just learn from Qu Yuan

136
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,440
and jump into the river.

137
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,870
Hangjing, did you know?

138
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:21,810
Sometimes... I really wish that you could be like the old you.

139
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,840
That you would hate me like you used to.

140
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,560
The past us?

141
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,890
You were arrogant. I was stubborn.

142
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:39,810
So the two of us were separated.

143
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,730
Now only when I turn around do I realize

144
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:49,600
the two of us missed so much!

145
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,900
Come, slowly.

146
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,250
Come.

147
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,190
Slowly, slowly.

148
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,870
Be good.

149
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,280
- Wait for me in the car.
- Okay!

150
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,770
Hurry, hurry. Come.

151
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,560
Be careful!

152
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,720
Come!

153
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,170
Shuyi, hurry and go.

154
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,270
You must take good care of my third brother.

155
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,070
And Fox Mo.

156
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:49,480
You must all take care of yourselves.

157
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,100
Yes, Ma'am!

158
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,360
If you say something,

159
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,270
I will never disobey it.

160
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,800
I'm sorry, Shuyi.

161
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,690
Sorry for what?

162
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,810
I once swore

00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:53,330

Nangui. Look.
