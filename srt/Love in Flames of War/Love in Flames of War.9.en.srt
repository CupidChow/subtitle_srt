00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,920
Hangjing.

22
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,150
I will escort you.

23
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,740
Fine.

24
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,350
Take a look. Buy one if you like it.

25
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,350
It's raining.

26
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,630
Let's take cover first.

27
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,710
It's raining.

28
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,080
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,410
Hangjing.

30
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,680
You didn't go to welcome your Third Brother today. Will this be okay?

31
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,630
There are many members in the family. It's fine if I go back later.

32
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,200
I should thank you for this time.

33
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,380
If you hadn't come and helped me, I wouldn't have been able to leave that soon.

34
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,180
You are really doing your best for the newspaper office.

35
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,710
My father will be out in six months.

36
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,830
I will go back to the South soon.

37
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,750
Hence, I should put the effort into whatever I can do for the newspaper company.

38
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,980
Congratulations.

39
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,430
It has been many years. You will finally be reunited with your father.

40
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,560
Thank you.

41
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,310
Hangjing.

42
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,700
You...

43
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,630
Do you have something to say to me?

44
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,160
Can you stay for me?

45
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,500
I'm saying, after you have helped your father to settle down,

46
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,630
you will be back again. Right?

47
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,220
Probably yes.

48
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,880
I see.

49
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,810
This rain won't stop for half an hour. I'm going to buy an umbrella for you.

50
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,860
Hey.

51
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,590
Zizheng!

52
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,000
- Buy an umbrella, Little Brother.
- Okay.

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,890
Boss, how much for two umbrellas?

54
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,160
Five copper coins each. Ten copper coins for two.

55
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,600
Okay.

56
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,310
I will buy one for now.

57
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,650
Fine.

58
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,160
Hold this properly.

59
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,870
Thank you, Boss.

60
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,710
Here, for you. Don't let your family be anxious.

61
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,730
What about you?

62
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,580
Take this. I'm fine.

63
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,690
I'm not in a hurry to go home. I will wait till the rain stops.

64
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,010
Just go.

65
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,400
Okay.

66
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,590
Go ahead.

67
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,540
Can you stay for me?

68
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,400
Third Brother.

69
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,450
You are back.

70
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,380
I'm back.

71
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,350
- You...
- Hangjing.

72
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,930
Why are you back so late?

73
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,090
I was held up by the rain.

74
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,770
You met your third brother?

75
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,310
Yes. He's more heroic than in the past.

76
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,750
Third Master, did you hear that? Hangjing praised you.

77
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,920
I heard that.

78
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,260
I have grown tanner from being out there every day.

79
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:49,120
Everyone is waiting. Let's chat while eating.

80
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,800
Third Master, go and change your clothes now.

81
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,940
Let's go.

82
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,190
Today, our third master

83
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,310
returned in triumph.

84
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:12,710
Shuyu also returned home.

85
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:16,190
It's not easy for the whole family to be reunited.

86
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,770
Let's drink.

87
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,590
Let's celebrate the return of Third Master.

88
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,520
Firstly, to congratulate him on coming back from the military academy.

89
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,320
Secondly, for his magnificent reputation on the battlefield and being invincible.

90
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,990
Thirdly, for the beautiful reunion of the entire family. Come, cheers.

91
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,830
- Well said.
- Cheers.

92
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,330
I want to clink glasses, too.

93
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,960
Third Master, you must try this carp.

94
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,590
In order to celebrate your return, your father dispatched someone to change the water along the way

95
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:48,050
and specially transported it back from Songhua River, just for the freshness.

96
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,990
It's just a fish and your words are so flowery.

97
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,710
Help yourselves.

98
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:57,580
Third Master, you definitely won't be able to eat this in your troop. Try it now.

99
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,540
Third Brother, I heard the discipline is very strict in the camp.

100
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,010
You need to report when you eat or drink.

101
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,540
You even need to report when you tie your shoelaces. Is this true?

102
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,540
Isn't that so? We need to report to sleep.

103
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,230
Why so many rules?

104
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,400
In the troop, other than orders, there's obedience too.

105
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,350
The army indeed toughens people. Third Master is definitely more mature than in the past.

106
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:23,690
Even me and your brother-in-law heard about your name as far as Chuanbei; his friends always mentioned your achievements.

107
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,980
Third Younger Brother is the rising upstart in the army; you're heading to a bright future.

108
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,650
Thank you, Second Sister.

109
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,290
When those madams heard Beichen was coming home this time,

110
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,960
they were more enthusiastic.

111
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,510
They want their daughters to marry Beichen.

112
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,910
Beichen is now a rising star in the army.

113
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:43,640
Perhaps you want to think about getting married.

114
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,420
What's the hurry? Sister Fengqi is still abroad.

115
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,610
Is the carp good, Shuyi?

116
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,970
It tastes good.

117
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:56,910
If it tastes good, eat more, watch out and be careful about the bones.

118
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:01,610
Fengqi and your brother's childhood engagement was just a joke when they were young.

119
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:06,020
People who want to marry your brother are now lining up from our home to East Main Camp.

120
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,540
Seventh Aunt,

121
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,830
there's no rush. I just got back.

122
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,560
How can we be in a hurry?

123
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,540
If you don't get married, your sister will not able to get married.

124
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,850
If she doesn't get married now, I'm afraid she won't able to when she's older.

125
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,180
Seventh Aunt, you can talk about my brother, don't talk about me.

126
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,430
Don't expect anything from her.

127
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,450
She is so fierce, who will want her?

128
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,740
That's right, Beiyi.

129
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,240
Eat your food, speaking nonsense.

130
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,020
Fine! Fine! Don't keep talking about the truth.

131
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,030
- Dad!
- Fine, fine!

132
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,320
Try this.

133
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,400
Brother Yong,

134
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,710
you asked me to be here today, is there some new mission?

135
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,270
Zizheng, since you joined the organization,

136
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,810
you were in charge of secret patriotic speech quite a few times.

137
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,890
The feedback was good.

138
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,710
If I can evoke more youngsters to love their country,

139
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,330
I think that's very meaningful.

140
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:05,490
Brother Yong, I really appreciate you letting me join the organization.

141
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,180
Since we founded the Youth Society,

142
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,020
our goal was to overthrow the warlord traits.

143
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,210
The new mission is to target

144
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,720
the local warlord who took over a 300-plus-worker firework factory without any reason.

145
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,030
They forced them to refurbish the barracks

146
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:22,430
and allowed the soldiers to torture the workers.

147
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:28,950
They're going too far. They're clearly sucking the blood from the innocents.

148
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:33,390
Our society will lead this strike,

149
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,940
and hopefully, the Youth Society from different locations will show their support,

150
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,730
using media to establish public pressure in order to release those workers.

151
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:46,430
That's why we need to use local newspapers

152
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,350
to start our campaign.

153
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,860
Our local newspaper First Society News is a democratic newspaper.

154
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,420
- I'm sure they're willing to post this kind of article.
- Great.

155
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,480
If that's the case, you'll be in charge of contacting the newspaper.

156
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,490
Okay.

157
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,700
But...

158
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,160
Brother Yong, don't worry. I'll hide my identity.

159
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,870
However, if Xiao Haishan sees this kind of article,

160
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,090
will he ignore it?

161
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,840
Xiao Haishan hasn't

162
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:29,150
initiated any attack all these years. When he goes to war, it is to defend.

163
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:33,490
Also, for our actions, he hasn't intervened.

164
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:38,540
Perhaps, compared to other warlords,

165
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,580
he is very different.

166
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,280
Commander.

167
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,790
Come in.

168
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,270
Have a seat.

169
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,520
Is there anything I can do for you?

170
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,890
Third Master.

171
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,840
I have a question for you.

172
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,140
What's your opinion about the current situation?

173
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,260
What opinion can I have?

174
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,910
The only thing I know is that the Ying Army today

175
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,260
is no longer what it used to be.

176
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,980
Do you think you can rest easy after winning a few battles?

177
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,870
Let me tell you. After the premier lost his power,

178
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,860
the new president has been trying to befriend the governor.

179
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,470
They used to be friends, so the governor didn't choose a side.

180
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:01,180
Instead, those in Shanxi, like Yan Laocu

181
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,620
have been courting the new president.

182
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:09,160
The governor didn't choose a side. Is it really due to their friendship in the past?

183
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,660
The situation is unstable now.

184
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,590
He's just taking this opportunity to see it clearly.

185
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,970
I don't know if I'm supposed to say this.

186
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,870
Speak up.

187
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:26,890
With our power right now, we can totally gain independence from Jin Cheng.

188
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,170
Do you have any idea what you're talking about?

189
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,230
I know.

190
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:40,050
Back in the day, when you were fighting wars with your brothers throughout the country and you had no supplies,

191
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,100
it was Jin Cheng that gave you troops and horses.

192
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,090
All these years, you've been thinking of him as your brother.

193
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,630
Then, why are you spitting nonsense if you know this?

194
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:54,040
You're treating him like your older brother, but he doesn't necessarily think of you as his brother.

195
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,300
All these years, you've been guarding the whole North for him. But in his mind,

196
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,730
the Xiao Family has become too strong that he feels insecure.

197
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,280
You're the biggest threat to him.

198
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,820
All these years, he's been instigated by Kang Jingxiong.

199
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:16,090
On the surface, he's calling you brother. But behind your back, he's suppressing you in every way.

200
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,110
The purpose is to leave no room for the Xiao Family to survive.

201
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,050
Enough! Stop it.

202
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:31,830
I'm telling you, Xiao Beichen. Without the governor, the Xiao Family would not have achieved what we have today.

203
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:36,080
I will never be ungrateful and do anything like that.

204
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,210
You're the commander. The decision is yours.

205
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,790
The urgent thing is to train our Ying Army,

206
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,960
make it united internally,

207
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,780
and an army of high caliber.

208
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,650
Internally united.

209
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,510
And high caliber. How can that be easily achieved?

210
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,250
Just say whatever you want.

211
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,480
Nothing.

212
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,160
Treat it as if I drank too much at dinner, and randomly spoke to you.

213
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,290
You should report to the Eastern Main Camp in a few days. Get prepared.

214
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,910
You can go.

215
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,260
Yes, Sir.

216
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,040
Wait.

217
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,560
I bought this for Beiyi and Beiwang.

218
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,540
I bought one more. You can have it.

219
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,910
Thank you, Commander.

220
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,300
How hard is it for you to call me father?

221
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,280
Bastard thing.

222

Third Master.

Seventh Aunt.

224
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,520
I'm sure your father said that he bought the walnut pastry for Beiyi and Beiwang.

225
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,470
And this one for you is the additional one. Right?

226
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,410
Yes.

227
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,060
Don't listen to him.

228
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,900
He had someone stand in a queue for two hours, just to buy this especially for you.

229
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,120
What are you drawing?

230
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,980
Did I scare you?

231
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,670
When did you become interested in drawing kites?

232
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,150
This is for you.

233
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,130
Thank you, Third Brother.

234
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:12,930
You were not in the living room this afternoon.

235
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:15,050
I got this for everyone.

236
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,920
It's true.

237
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:21,180
Aren't you going to open it and take a look?

238
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,790
Do you like it?

239
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,430
What is it?

240
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,600
It's a Russian doll.

241
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,880
Don't you know how to play with it?

242
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,260
This is how it works.

243
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,450
The secret of this doll

244
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:49,060
is that you'll never know

245
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,020
how many smaller ones there are inside.

246
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,130
Look!

247
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,400
Two.

248
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,220
Isn't that a surprise?

249
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,350
Is there more?

250
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,420
That's it.

251
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,990
Then... what else?

252
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,050
Then you just put them back inside.

253
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,280
Then they become one again.

254
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,100
Look! Exactly the same as before!

255
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,760
Yes, it's the same.

256
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,150
I knew it.

257
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:48,630
It's nothing special. Boring.

258
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,530
It's totally boring.

259
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,400
Not interesting at all.

260
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,690
Anyway, I just bought it from a random stall.

261
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:58,390
Just... take it or leave it.

262
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,930
I've got something else to do. I'm leaving now.

Are you going to hide this from me forever, Boss Jiu?

269
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,070
How did you know?

270
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:32,340
Only the opera troupe and my two brothers know it.

271
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:38,110
Third Brother, when I got to know that you were Boss JIu, you'd already gone to military school.

272
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:42,780
But no matter what, I should thank you on behalf of the children in the orphanage.

00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,570
Okay.

274

How do you want to thank me?

275
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,770
How about...

marrying me?

326
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:18,920
Uncles, I'm sorry for keeping you waiting.

327
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,040
Beichen, you're young and your heart is in the war zone.

328
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,980
Don't worry about trivial matters.

329
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,630
The important thing is you being here. We can totally understand.

330
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:34,270
In the fight in Feng City, Third Master terrorized the other countries, and he gained fame outside.

331
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:38,680
You're now the core of our Ying Army.

332
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,680
Xiao Beichen.

333
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:47,200
- Yes, Sir.
- You've been refining yourself the last few years.

334
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,600
You also cultivated some military experience.

335
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,530
Today, in front of all the uncles,

336
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,200
I'm appointing you as

337
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,890
the Northern Region border troop's First Army Regiment Commander.

338
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:07,680
Report to East Main Camp immediately.

339
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,130

00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:20,610
I'm not good enough yet. I was lucky to win two battles.

342
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:24,990
Compared to all the uncles here, I'm still very inexperienced.

343
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,890
From today onward, I'm planning

344
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:30,940
to work closely with all the uncles and reinforce the Ying Army

345
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,260
in order to establish a bright and better future.

346

We're one big family with the same goal.

347
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:39,210
You have the assistance from all the uncles here,

348
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,440
we'll obviously do that for you.

349
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,270
From now on, you must speak honestly to us; no need to be courteous.

350
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,000
That's correct.

351
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,740
Since you've started this conversation,

352
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:53,340
I'll say a few words.

353
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,200
Talking about the army.

354
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,970
I was lucky to win two battles.

355
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,990
It might look impressive,

356
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:06,550
but in fact, there are lots of existing flaws and bad habits.

357
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:10,160
No matter if it's the training level or weapon supplies,

358
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,470
there's nothing we can be proud of.

359
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:17,330
That's why my first mission at East Main Camp is to

360
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:21,340
rectify the existing personnel and strengthen the army.

361
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,440

What is he doing already...

363
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:36,990
What you mean is we're not our best for the Xiao Family?

364
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,810
I'm sure that's not what Beichen meant.

365
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:42,560
He's obviously doing this for our troops.

366
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:48,010
Rectifying our army has to happen.

If I offended any of you,

368
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,720
I hope all of you, the uncles,

369
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,600
bear with me.

He has just been here for a short time...

Third Master is young and up-and-coming,

372
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:10,350
we just need to hear the word of our eldest brother.

373
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:14,800
Rectifying the army is unavoidable.

374
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,060
But you cannot make them question your motive and cause unnecessary trouble.

375
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,430
The Ying Army is a whole.

376
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:25,870
The key is unification but not breaking up people's sense of purpose.

Third Brother, are you sure the mole is close to the commander?

433
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,920
Do you still remember when we were at the Huyang Battle,

434

we found lots of broken guns in our army.

435

Based on the serial numbers, we found out those broken guns

came from Kang Jingxiong's underground weapon factory.

437
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:07,600
For someone who is authorized to purchase weapons in the Ying Army, he must be someone important.

You're right. When we were trapped at Feng City,

00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:15,700
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫

650
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:21,290
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

651
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:26,800
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

652
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:35,350
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

653
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:46,620
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫
