00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,100
Come.

23
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,600
Hangjing, just put up with this place for a few days.

24
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,600
This location is remote and in a rural area. It’s relatively safe.

25
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,600
I borrowed this place from an old friend for a few days.

26
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,500
Let's see if we can get in touch with Miss Fengqi tomorrow.

Now that you see the real Xiao Beichen, you still can’t let go?

You knew about it?

30
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,200
I will never forgive him for my father.

31
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,500
Since you made up your mind,

32
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,300
you will know which path you will take.

33
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,600
Don't worry.

34
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,000
I will make sure you're safe. You don't need to worry about it.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Just take me as a normal friend. You said

Both are fine.

I'm going to find some firewood.

Third Brother, we have searched everywhere.

We set a checkpoint at every exit

on both land and water routes.

49
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,400
Until now, we've found nothing.

50
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,000
I don't understand how a person can disappear into nowhere.

51
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,600
There is another possibility.

It's okay. They are all washed.

Now I just need to dry it.

Hey.

65
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,900
Get back to the bank. It's cold there. Let me find it for you.

You're hurt.

Your shoes are wet. Get on my back. I will carry you back.

Oh, it's okay. I can walk.

Where did you get it?

73
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,500
I asked the villagers to give me some ginger and brown sugar.

74
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,600
It's cold in the mountains. Now that you're living here, it's good for you.

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,400
You were in the water, too. You should drink some, too.

Are you joking?

I will pay ten gold bars, and you're telling me no one will take the order.

88

Miss Fengqi, you pay very generously. Of course, there will be people who will risk their lives for you.

Besides, so many days have passed.

They still haven't found her. They can't seal off the routes forever.

The search naturally isn't as strict as before.

You have been deceiving me.

My father was clearly released six months ago.

You detained him at Nanyuan Nursing Home.

Hanjing, it's not what you think.

122

Your father was indeed released six months ago,

but he was critically ill then.

He feared you would worry. Hence, I hid this from you then.

But I didn't imagine that...

What's the point of saying this now?

130
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,300
Even if you give me a thousand or ten thousand reasons,

You swore that you would never lie to me again.

In reality,

you used my father's life to tell a big lie.

The boat is behind you. You know what to do.

Don't ever let me see you in Beixin again.

Don't.

The water on the pier is deep. I sent men to fish the whole day

156
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,190
and couldn't find anything.

157

I gave him the chance.

158
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:50,500
He didn't take my words seriously.

159
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,170
I only wanted to take you back.

160
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,240
I harmed him.

161
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,620
I harmed him.

162
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,570
This is calming soup for nerves.

163
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,260
Drink some

164
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,180
and sleep.

165
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,100
Drink some at least.

166
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,420
Xiao Beichen,

167
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,680
why did we have to meet?

168
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,700
If we had never met,

169
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,890
would we have not met so many misfortunes?

170
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,150
I have never thought like that.

171
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,970
Don't think too much.

172
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,540
Take it that I'm begging you.

173
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,500
Let me go.

174
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,960
I can't do it.

175
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,040
Must you let us torment each other?

176
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,590
Yes.

177
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,980
It's fine that you regard me as crazy too

178
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,230
and that I'm under influence of the devil.

179
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,310
On the first day since you came to Beixin,

180
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:49,730
I firmly believed that you were the one in this lifetime.

181
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,380
Even if I die, I won't let go of your hand.

182
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,690
Even if this is a mistake?

183
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,840
Even if this is a mistake.

184
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,830
Third Master, how's Hangjing?

185
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,910
She's awake.

186
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,210
This is good.

187
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,540
You, too. It's such a serious matter regarding your father-in-law

188
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,510
and you even hid this.

189
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,770
I know you have your difficulties

190
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:37,480
but once Hangjing learned of it, wouldn't she resent you?

191
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,160
Seventh Aunt, I was wrong in this.

192
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,420
Third Brother, don't worry.

193
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,720
It's good that Hangjing is back. Moreover,

194
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,150
with everyone here taking care of her, there won't be any mishaps.

195
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,570
Enough. You should go and rest, too.

196
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,240
No. There are still some matters at East Main Camp.

197
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,230
I will have to bother you to take care of Hangjing.

198
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,730
I'm here. Don't worry.

199
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,750
I'm going to check on her.

200
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,160
Sister Fengqi, what to do now?

201
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,710
Everything's fine. Don't worry.

202
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,620
Hangjing.

203
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:35,080
I know your heart is in pain.

204
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:40,600
Third Master brought out your father, yet hid it from you.

205
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,160
He was absolutely wrong in doing this.

206
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:53,480
However, your father was afraid that you would be upset by his illness.

207
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,580
Third Master was also entrusted by him

208
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,380
and respected his wishes.

209
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,390
Third Master had his difficulties, too.

210
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,340
My father passed away.

211
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,740
It's meaningless to say anything now.

212
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,930
- Hangjing, I—
- Seventh Aunt.

213
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:27,660
Since the moment I set my foot in Beixin,

214
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,100
all these years,

215
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:36,150
my only wish was to reunite with my father soon.

216
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:44,180
Even though he was very sick and my heart was in pain,

217
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,380
I'd want to take care of him personally.

218
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,440
Even just for one more day.

219
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,500
Good child.

220
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,400
Here.

221
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:04,570
Am I still considered half a mother to you?

222
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,630
The last thing I want

223
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,850
is to see you feeling sad for me.

224
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,960
Then please take my advice.

225
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,020
Sometimes, for loving a person too much,

226
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,230
people make mistakes.

227
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,660
Third Master made the wrong decision about this.

228
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:32,270
You can blame him. You can even beat him if you want.

229
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:35,160
But you can't let yourself suffer.

230
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,700
I'm sure you understand that for every bit of pain you suffer,

231
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,020
Third Master will suffer ten times more than you do.

232
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,570

Move faster!

Prepare!

239
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,330
Moves have to be steady!

00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:27,340
Grab your opponent's leg with accuracy! Swing your fist with power!

241

Start over!

242
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,290
Something's not right about Third Brother.

243
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,700
He's drilling the soldiers like crazy.

244
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,530
And working around the clock.

245
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:39,760
Hey, now Uncle Lin is gone,

246
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,800
and Mu Zizheng is dead too.

247
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,570
I hope Third Sister-in-law will eventually forgive him.

Two!

There are many loving couples who end up being happy together.

251
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,120
One!

252
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,280
Why is it so hard for the two of them?

253
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,940
Three... Four...

254
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,760
Where are you going?

255
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,570
Where do you think I can go?

256
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,130
Is it possible for me to leave?

257
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:48,790
If you feel upset, you can ask me to do anything you want.

258
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,760
But you need someone to take care of you now.

259
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,410
Don't worry.

260
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,040
I won't leave the Xiao family.

261
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,380
But I'm moving to the Tingxiang Yard.

262
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,490
Tingxiang Yard?

263
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:15,150
After everything that has happened,

264
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,330
there's no way I can live with you as a normal husband and wife would.

265
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:23,940
Instead of seeing each other every day, which makes us hurt more,

266
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,600
I think we should live separately instead.

267
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:36,910
Do you have to do this?

268
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:39,080
If you want me to stay,

269
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,620
please don't force me to do anything.

270
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,250
What is it?

271
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,850
I came here in such a hurry at your request.

272
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:10,800
Do you remember the stamp cachet on the backside of Qiao Jiang's photo?

273
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,240
I do. What's wrong with it?

274
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,880
I did some research. It's the cachet of a student society at the Art University of France.

275
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,410
How do you know?

276
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:21,810
It was a coincidence. A few days ago, I attended the birthday party of Director Wang of the Xiping Chamber of Commerce.

277
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:25,170
Coincidentally, his son just came back from the Art University of France.

278
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,990
I saw a cachet that looked exactly the same in their photo.

279
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:30,860
Good for you, Fox Mo! Well done, finding a clue like that.

280
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,680
He's in there?

281
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,500
Let's go.

282
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,050
Do you know this person?

283
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,180
Did he study at the Art University of France as well?

284
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,910
Isn't this Jiang Zhiqi?

285
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:46,200
Jiang Zhiqi?

286
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,310
- Isn't his name Qiao Jiang?
- He is Jiang Zhiqi.

287
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:54,150
There were only a few Chinese students at the Art University of France in our cohort. I can't be wrong.

288
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,810
Do you know him well?

289
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:58,390
He's kind of unsociable.

290
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:02,700
He didn't really fit in. He only liked to play with his camera when he was free.

291
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:07,270
Then, do you know if he has any friends or anyone close to him?

292
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,280
I remember that...

293
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,650
he had a girl he was pursuing.

294
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,870
A girl he was pursuing?

295
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,500
Do you know who she was?

296
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,930
I don't.

297
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,200
It was in a social gathering of Chinese students as well.

298
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,470
Back then, we were praising how beautiful French girls were.

299
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:28,800
He was usually uncommunicative, but to our surprise, he started arguing with us loudly.

300
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,110
He said that no matter how beautiful French girls are,

301
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:34,410
they are not even 0.01 percent of the girl he's pursuing.

302
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:39,670
Oh, and I think he came back to China because of this girl too.

303
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,890
Is Third Young Madam still refusing to eat?

304
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:53,190
Yes. She's been staying in Tingxiang Yard without coming out.

305
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,650
It's getting colder day by day.

306
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,660
We only have a few people eating together now.

307
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,830
It seems more lonely than ever.

308
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:02,880
When can Third Master and Third Young Madam

309
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,080
stop being stubborn with each other and get back together?

310
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,160
Tell Uncle Gui.

311
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,120
Ask him to keep an eye out,

312
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,830
if Third Young Master needs anything.

313
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:15,500
Hangjing won't speak up about it.

314
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,990
- Okay.
- Hey.

315
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:22,840
Hangjing only has Jin Xiang accompanying her. It's quite lonely.

316
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,520
Choose a well-mannered maid to go to Tingxiang Yard.

317
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,160
No problem, I will see to it, Madam.

318
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:43,090
Xiao Shuyi, don't you have a heart?

319
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:46,410
It's such a mess at home, and you still look so happy?

320
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:51,200
Seventh Aunt, do you know who's coming back home?

321
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,360
Your father and your two little brothers, of course.

322
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,100
No.

323
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,780
It's Eldest Brother Shen!

324
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,930
Eldest Brother Shen.

325
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,050
Shen Yanqing is coming back?

326
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,470
The eldest lady of the Shen family wrote a letter especially

327
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,470
to tell me about the news!

328
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,910
Do you know how great Eldest Brother Shen is?

329
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:12,550
He got his doctoral degree at the University of Pennsylvania.

330
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:16,150
And he also visited France

331
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,970
- and became...
- Enough! My head is blowing up.

332
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:21,540
I have no time to care about that business.

333
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,960
You, come here!

334
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,390
Fourth Lady.

335
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:34,470
- Did you hear what I said?
- You...

336
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:38,740
You said there is a Young Master Shen that's really great.

337
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,400
It's yours now.

338
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,500
Thank you, Fourth Lady.

339
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,890
You can go.

340
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,290
Third Brother.

341
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,810
Fengqi, what brings you here?

342
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:20,170
You've been standing here for such a long time. Don't catch a cold.

343
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,030
Put on this coat.

344
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,040
Thank you.

345
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,100
You and Hangjing have been at odds with each other.

346
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,790
It's heartbreaking for us to watch, even as outsiders.

347
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:34,300
But I think Hangjing's love for you is true.

348
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:36,960
There might be misunderstandings.

349
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,870
But as long as you're in love with each other, nobody can separate you.

350
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:43,950
Okay.

351
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,550
It's quite windy here.

352
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:47,090
You should go back to rest.

353
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,420
Okay.

354
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:52,250
But please don't hold everything in.

355
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:55,380
Have a good talk with Hangjing.

356
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,380
- Thank you.
- Okay. See you.

357
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,300
Lin Hangjing.

358
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,610
Why did you come back?

359
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,550
Lady.

360
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,590
Lady.

361
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:37,000
The scriptures you copied last time have been sent to Fahua Temple.

362
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,830
We've burned them for your father and Young Master Mu.

363
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:44,080
I'll send these over on the first day of this lunar month.

364
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,000
Please have a look.

365
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,910
- Young Madam.
- Lady, her name is Xiu'er.

366
00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:00,110
Seventh Madam sent her here especially to serve you.

367
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,190
Third Young Madam, nice to meet you.

368
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:09,210
Lady, what's wrong?

369
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,910
Are you okay?

370
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:13,690
- Take this away now.
- Yes.

371
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:16,330
Lady, was the wind too strong for the past two days?

372
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:18,270
Did you catch a cold?

373
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:22,250
Lady, I will help you in now.

374
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,320
Be careful.

375
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,620
Congratulations, Third Mistress. You are pregnant.

376
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:46,520
Lady, congratulations.

377
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:51,740
Get some good rest. I will prescribe miscarriage prevention medicine later.

378
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,550
I'm leaving.

379
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,290
Doctor Sun, this way, please.

380
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,970
Thank you.

381
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,920
Doctor Sun, how is it?

382
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,660
Congratulations, Seventh Aunt. Congratulations, Third Master.

383
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,860
Third Mistress is pregnant.

384
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:32,280
Pregnant?

385
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,470
Doctor Sun, one shouldn't be careless about this.

386
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:40,640
You must check carefully.

387
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:44,870
Don't worry. It's not a mistake. The child is more than two months old.

388
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:51,080
Thank you, Heaven and Earth. The Xiao family has a descendant now.

389
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,030
This is a great joy.

390
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,790
Thank you, Doctor Sun.

391
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:58,500
- It's my duty.
- Doctor Sun, this way, please.

392
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,810
Third Master, did you hear that?

393
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:02,660
Hangjing is pregnant.

394
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,450
Come, let's see her.

395
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:06,070
Seventh Aunt,

396
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:16,620
I would like to talk to Hangjing alone.

397
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,700
Look. Why don't...

398
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,820
Okay. Let's go out now.

399
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:27,590
Let's go out.

400
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:49,160
Why are you doing this to me?

401
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,610
What do you mean?

402
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,320
Don't you know what I mean?

403
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:06,550
Since your father passed away, you have been mourning.

404
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:10,360
We have never consummated. How could you be pregnant?

405
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,760
Are you saying that

406
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,360
you think this child is not yours?

407
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,250
If not, then?

408
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,770
Hangjing, I know you hate me

409
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,950
for hiding this matter about your father from you.

410
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:36,160
But how can you use this method to retaliate against me?

411
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:47,250
Fine. You are right.

412
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:51,860
This child is not yours.

413
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,090
Lin Hangjing,

414
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:24,060
don't even dream of having this child.

415
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:00,950
Seventh Aunt, after hearing about Hangjing's pregnancy,

416
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:03,210
Third Brother didn't look too happy.

417
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:06,320
I'm worried that something could have happened.

418
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,690
This is not right. Lin Hangjing is more than two months pregnant.

419
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:12,820
At that time, she and Mu Zizheng were always out there.

420
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:16,600
You are confused. How could you say this kind of nonsense?

421
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,730
- I...
- Shuyi, how could this be possible?

422
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,560
Am I wrong? Lin Hangjing

423
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,190
has always wanted to leave with Mu Zizheng. She doesn't have Third Brother in her heart at all.

424
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:28,250
She was out there with Mu Zizheng for a long period of time.

425
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:30,670
- Why is she pregnant now that she's back?
- Shut up.

426
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,880
You are not proper in your actions and words.

427
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,870
Of course, we should get to the bottom of this.

428
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:38,170
If this child doesn't belong to Third Brother, where will he hide his face?

429
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:41,280
I know Hangjing very well. She would never do something like this.

430
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,490
- Seventh Aunt, you don't understand—
- You... never mind if it's regarding other matters.

431
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:47,360
It's such a serious matter, and you are spouting nonsense.

432
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,790
If this blows out of proportion, let's see how your father will handle you when he gets back.

433
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,920
Enough, Seventh Aunt. Don't be angry with her.

434
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,820
Shuyi is just worried.

435
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:02,100
Everyone, listen carefully. Regarding the child,

436
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,570
no one is allowed to talk nonsense.

437
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,430
I...

438
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:11,000
Shuyi, why are you still like a kid?

439
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
You distinctly know that Hangjing is very important to this family

440
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,240
and you still say this.

441
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,760
Why are you here?

442
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:52,670
You are awake.

443
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:58,790
I found a good doctor.

444
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,900
He will be here tomorrow.

445
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,960
What do you mean?

446
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,130
I know you want this child.

447
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:27,270
We will still have many opportunities in the future.

448
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,870
We will have our own child.

449
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,300
I know that you wanted to retaliate against me

450
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,320
for a long time.

451
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:40,030
I can take it that this matter didn't happen

452
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:43,270
but I can't watch you give birth to this child.

453
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:45,210
I don't know how to face him in the future.

454
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,970
I don't know how to face you, either.

455
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:54,310
Xiao Beichen, let me tell you. The child in my stomach

456
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:58,120
is in me. If he dies, I will die too.

457
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,590
What do you want?

458
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,890
I want you to divorce me.

459
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,940
Starting from now,

460
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:18,870
the child in my stomach...

461
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:22,260
has nothing to do with you.

Troupe Leader, what happened?

464
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:53,220
I heard that Third Young Madam is pregnant.

465
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,790
Pregnancy is a joyous matter. Why is Third Master here drowning his sorrows with wine?

466
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:58,260
Stop it.

467
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:03,810
Don't talk about Third Master's matters out there.

468
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,490
Rest early.

489
00:44:57,090 --> 00:45:07,080
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

490
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:17,680
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫
