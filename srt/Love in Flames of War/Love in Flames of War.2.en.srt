I've seen your sample writings.

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,330
I cannot believe that, at such a young age, you have that kind of experience.

34
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:32,190
To be honest, we should be considered old acquaintances.

When I was with City Newspaper in the South, I'd read many of your articles.

Your pen name is Qing Yong, isn't it?

How did you know that?

to more people, especially women.

45

Since everywhere is advocating women's independence,

46
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,250
I think women should know what's happening around us.

We should be aware of the current politics, society, and things around the world.

and you're telling me the opposite?

Sister Hangjing, please don't be humble.

It's because you look down on this student here.

Third Master, you better promise me

116
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,620
if you ask Hangjing to help your studies, you need to attend sessions every day.

117
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,600
You need to be consistent.

118
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,500
I promise!

119
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,590
I'm also a student,

No, Sister Hangjing.

122
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:26,790
Tell me. Where can I find such a talented tutor like you?

123
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,220
Hangjing, can you accommodate him?

124
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,590
Just consider it as disciplining him on behalf of me and Uncle Xiao.

Is it fun doing this?

128
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,330
Why would you say it that way?

129
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:07,970
I'm telling you. When those old folks in our school start teaching,

130
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:10,020
they are all so boring.

131
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,850
It's so hard for us to get the information in.

132
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,330
Since we have such a good teacher staying with us,

133
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:19,480
I sincerely want to learn from you.

134
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,240
Come, sit down first.

135
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,160
Fine then.

136
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,250
Third Brother, what do you want to ask?

137
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,570
This is the situation.

138
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,130
A few days ago, our Chinese Literature teacher

139
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:46,700
wanted us to write a poem about late autumn.

140
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,060
But the deadline is tomorrow.

141
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,940
This homework is giving me a headache right now.

142
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,460
There are a lot of approaches to writing about late autumn.

143
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,400
For example, you can write about the scenery of late autumn.

144
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,540
The fruits or the festivals of late autumn.

145
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:10,500
How about this. Look at this poem collection and get some inspiration?

146
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,440
My memory is not great. I suddenly remember there are

147
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,830
notes on my bookshelf. Go and get them for me.

148
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,560
I'll look into these poems.

149
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,450
Third Brother, what are you doing with these?

150
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,470
It's my token of appreciation.

151
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:48,010
I hope you like them.

152
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,510
I'm sorry.

153
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,020
I'm not used to receiving such expensive gifts.

154
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,810
Why would you say that?

155
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:56,430
I startled you before,

156
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,490
this is compensation with my apology.

157
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,940
If you don't accept this, it means you're not forgiving me.

158
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,070
Since you're sincere, I'll accept them.

159
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,890
As long as you like them, I can give them to you every day.

160
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,790
Since you're having a headache due to writing this poem,

161
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:24,080
let me write one for you.

162
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,290
You're writing a poem for me?

163
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,100

00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:41,080
Hangjing, you are here finally. Third Young Master has been waiting for you.

489
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,490
That's right! Third Young Master never brought a female companion with him.

490
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:45,000
You are the first one.

491
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,770
Your dress is really pretty. The pearl necklace is big and round.

492
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:51,360
- It must be expensive!
- Of course, it is expensive.

493
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,860
Everything she's wearing is what my brother bought for her.

494
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,540
So you are Third Young Master's girlfriend.

495
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:00,540
It has to be. Third Master has been dropping you off and picking you up from school.

496
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,240
Using so much effort!

497
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,090
It’s nothing, it’s just a bet.

498
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:08,280
My Third Brother and Sister Fengqi are a couple.

499
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,400
You’re not aware? Big Fool Xu told me that.

500
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,180
They bet if you would listen to my brother within a month,

501
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,860
He and Mo Weiyi will lose and give him a convertible race car.

502
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:25,150
So, sometimes when people glorify themselves,

503
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:28,010
it's actually just a joke.

504
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:31,200
- She's right!
- You have to accept your fate.

505
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,900
- Younger Sister Hangjing!
- Third Brother!

506
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,460
Well...

507
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:40,580
Can I get my car...

508
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,760
Your car. Don't even think about it.

509
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,830
I'm impressed.

510
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:47,640
Younger Sister Lin, let me introduce you.

511
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,620
This is Xu Zijun or Big Fool Xu.

512
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:54,230
What is she doing?

513
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,170
Third Brother!

514
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,950
How can she do that?

515
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,460
Lin Hengjing!

516
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,910
Are you out of your mind?

517
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:17,070
Xiao Beichen, did you tell your friends that

518
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,570
you got me to like you,

519
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:22,900
that I had a crush on you, and would even listen to everything you say?

520
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:28,570
I'm making it clear in front of everyone.

521
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,090
You'd better apologize to me right away.

522
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:38,690
You get up very late every day,

523
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:42,710
and do nothing but look for fun and bully people.

524
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:47,310
In fact, without your family supporting you, you're worthless.

525
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:51,090
And you're possessive, rude, and supercilious.

526
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:54,160
You don't know what is equality or respect.

527
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,960
I, Lin Hengjing, have been looking down on you since the first day I met you.

528
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,550
- How can she say that?
- Right.

529
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:03,450
You were born into a family beyond the reach of so many people.

530
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:06,120
You're receiving the best education of our times.

531
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:11,570
If you want to, you can easily change the fate of so many people.

532
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,620
But let me ask you.

533
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,200
Do you even have a dream for your life,

534
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,280
for the society, for the country,

535
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,790
for your loved ones, or even just for yourself?

536
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:29,770
That's why I said, I look down on you.

537
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,970
Lin Hangjing.

538
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,900
This is the last chance I'm giving you.

539
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:41,170
Apologize now! Now!

540
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:42,380
Impossible.

541
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:46,210
Your life in Beixin will be turned upside down if you offend me!

542
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:51,790
Okay. I'll be waiting for it.

543
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,640
You—

544
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,730
Third Brother! Third Brother...

545
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:00,340
What's going on?

546
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,170
But let me ask you.

547
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,720
Do you even have a dream for your life,

548
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,860
for the society, for the country,

549
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:24,290
for your loved ones, or even just for yourself?

550
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:30,220
That's why I said, I look down on you.

551
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:41,330
Uncle Zhao.

552
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:44,080
What's happening?

553
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,200
What do you want to say?

554
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,640
Do you think I'm...

555
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,650
someone with no goals or ambitions?

556
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,410
Yes.

557
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,170
Fine. Fine.

558
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,540
Take it back.

559
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:05,760
Look at your bad temper. That's not like your mother.

560
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,260
- You're more like your father.
- Don't mention him.

561
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,720
He doesn't deserve to be with my mother.

562
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,270
Don't blame your father.

563
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:17,680
The more hatred you carry,

564
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,310
the more unsettled your mother will be in Heaven.

565
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:43,440
A good boy shouldn't be picky.

566
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,070
You can only grow up faster if you eat your food.

567
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:49,670
So you can be a general when you grow up, just like your father.

568
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:53,480
I don't want to be a general. I want to be a hero.

569
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,900
You still need to eat your food to be a hero.

570
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:04,060
Mom, stay here and sleep with me. I don't want to sleep.

571
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,810
I want to get up.

572
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:07,640
But it's really late.

573
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,310
Be good. Okay?

574
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:11,530
- No.
- Sleep well.

575
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:17,000
Mom will sing your favorite Peking opera to help you sleep, okay?

576
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,910
Okay.

577
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,440
Tuck in your quilt.

578
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:45,900
♪ The ice wheel of the island spins ♪

579
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:50,810
Hey, the new perfume that just arrived at the department store smells really good!

580
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:53,600
She's here. She's here.

581
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:08,440
It's okay. Leave her alone.

582
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,340
Look at her.

583
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,980
- It's so funny...
- I already heard about it.

584
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,680
She offended us. She deserves it.

585
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,930
Right, she's asking for it.

586
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,830
She deserves it.

587
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,950
Come on.

588
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,520
Let's see how she can eat her food.

589
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,000
- Hurry up!
- I'm still in here!

590
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,740
Don't lock the door!

591
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,660
Open the door! Don't go!

592
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:25,370
Someone help!

593
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,100
Help! Is anybody there?

594
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,860
Open the door!

595
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:06,420
