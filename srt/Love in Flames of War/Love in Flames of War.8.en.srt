- Sir, look at this.
- Thank you so much for today.

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,800
Why are you being courteous with me? I'm very happy as well.

24
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,200
It's great watching these carefree children.

25
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,200
Oh right! I actually wanted to tell you last time.

26
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,800
Are you interested in a part-time job at the newspaper?

27
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,600
- Part-time job?
- Yes.

28
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,800
Your photos are unique and communicate the perspective of the news in a vivid way.

29
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,600
That perspective is very rare.

30
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,400
I heard from the chief editor that apart from me, many other editors

31
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,200
have used the photos you took as well.

32
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,400
If you can take part in different topics we're working on, make use of your talent,

33
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,600
will be just like helping these kids.

34
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,200
You will be able to help more people.

- But I...
- I know you don't have much time.

36
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,600
I can make a request to the chief editor, so you don't need to come to the office on a regular basis.

37
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,300
As long as you take photos based on the ideas of the newspaper

38
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,200
and come to the office regularly for meetings.

39
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,900
How is it?

40
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,700
Okay. I'll agree.

41
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,800

Yes, Sir.

Instructor Du, when are we going?

47
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,600
In a few days. You should go back to get prepared.

48
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,400
Must we go?

49
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,400
What did you say?

50
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,600
The reason for me to attend military school is not to fight in a war.

51
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,800
I don't understand the meaning of wars at all.

52
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,100
It's even harder to understand those people who are fighting for power and benefits in the name of wars.

53
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,400
Then, why did you come to military school?

54
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,200
Just for the graduation certificate. I want to shut my father's mouth.

55
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,600
Xiao Beichen, you listen!

56
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,400
Nobody wants a war.

57
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,000
When there is a war, soldiers have the ability to defend themselves.

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,800
But what happens to the people who have no weapons at all?

59
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,400
You're right.

60
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,000
Wars to obtain power and benefits are meaningless indeed.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But if you ignore the cries of the people

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,600
and just let the enemy trample your homeland,

63
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,600
if you hide here to pity yourself, how's that meaningful?

64
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,400
Don't talk about meaning when it comes to war.

65
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,200
To live is the most important meaning!

66
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,100
If you don't want to get involved in the strife,

67
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,000
then take your responsibility

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,600

00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,100
Yes, Sir.

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,200
You haven't even left military school.

71
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,000
Have you already forgotten the rule that military orders require immediate action?

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,800
My words are orders!

00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,550
Brother.

165
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,040
Brother!

166
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,670
Semester 5, Class 3. Get a gun!

167
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,620
Let's fight!

168
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,570
Go! Let's go!

169
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,430
- What did Old Zheng say?
- The commander of the Third Regiment died in the battle.

170
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:17,660
Third Master led a group to the battlefield at Beikou.

171
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,980
I thought the students were

172
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,820
helping the kitchen in the back?

173
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,390
It's said that the regiment was raided, and Third Master took the lead and all the new recruits went into battle.

174
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,760
Bastard!

175
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,320
Who does he think he is!

176
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,170
He led the entire new recruits to the battlefield?

177
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,600
Yes, Sir.

178
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,970
We won!

179
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:17,200
We won!

180
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,480
Third Master, we won.

181
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,910
Back! Go back!

182
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,350
Go now. It's not a place to stay.

183

Go.

184
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,370

- Xiao Douzi!
- Third Brother.

190
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,460
Third Brother.

191
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:03,260
Third Brother, I want to go to Beixin with you.

192
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:07,520
I want to open a tailor's shop there.

193
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,820
Third Brother, then when you get married,

194
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,290
I'll make you and Sister-in-law

195
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:18,710
a lot of new clothes.

196
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,260
All right?

197
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,470
Salute!

198
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,380
Third Brother, how much longer are you going to kneel here?

199
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,800
You've been here for ages.

200
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,450
Third Brother, on battlefields, guns and bombs have no eyes.

201
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,120
You can't give yourself all the blame.

202
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,460
Never chase enemies in desperation.

203
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,600
When the enemy post has been taken over, what's important is

204
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,400
to look out for the second attack from them.

205
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,400
You're new recruits. You lack experience. That's understandable.

206
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:52,070
It's not your fault.

207
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:58,930
Xiao Beichen, get up.

208
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,850
Xiao Beichen, it's an order!

209
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,940
Do you know how many people die on the battlefield every day?

210
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,710
Are you going to kneel like that for every one of them?

211
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:17,440
There will be a next one, and a next, and next one!

212
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:24,820
Xiao Douzi was a child with a poor fate in this chaotic era.

213
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:29,230
The creation of a new world and the birth of new lives

214
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,760
all come from hardship.

215
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,470
All of you, remember what I'm about to say.

216
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:41,150
If you're lucky enough to see a day with freedom and peace,

217
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:44,660
today's battle was the foundation of that world.

218
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:49,050
Unless there's no war, the tragedies will never stop.

219
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:53,890
In addition to protecting the people we care about,

220
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,530
there's a greater meaning for what we do.

221
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:02,440
Stop wars with wars!

222
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:51,830
Excuse me. Is it the dorm for Semester 5, Class 3?

223
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,230
My name is Luo Dou. I'm 13 years old.

224
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,580
I'm here to study.

225
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:03,490
Xiao Douzi, you don't need to do this for them.

226
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,280
They should wash their own clothes.

227
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,610
It's okay. It's not a big deal. It keeps me occupied.

228
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,480
Would you like a bun?

229
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,290
Third Brother, when you get married,

230
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,120
I will make a wedding dress for Sister-in-law, too.

231
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,870

And today he is dead.

Where has he gone?

237
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,820
What's the meaning of us wearing the uniform?

238
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,370
What am I doing it for? I'm done here!

239
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,490
This is your first war experience.

240
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:39,720
Understand how it feels yourself.

241
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,470
I'm here to tell you that you're free to decide if you want to stay here or not.

242
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,720
You can chose to leave.

243
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:52,090
You're free to stay here. I won't force any of you.

244
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,880
Third Brother, aren't you leaving yet?

245
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,860
Third Brother, why don't you listen to us?

246
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:19,200
Crazy Du finally let us go. Let's leave before he changes his mind.

247
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,970
You may die for nothing, why bother?

248
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:26,830
Third Brother, I agree with Zijun.

249
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:30,750
I understand how you feel. But you only have one life.

250
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,570
Don't be stubborn.

251
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,520
You don't need to convince me.

252
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,230
I won't leave.

253
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:46,360
Since we went on the battlefield this time,

254
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,490
I realized we were like canaries locked inside a cage,

255
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:53,170
blindfolded, not being able to see the world outside.

256
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:57,310
I never understood my father.

257
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:01,210
I always thought he enjoyed wars for they could get him promoted.

258
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,720
But now,

259
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,360
I understand him.

260
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,160
If we don't fight wars,

261
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,920
there will never be peace and safety.

262
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,800
If we want to protect our side,

263
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,110
we need to fight for our people.

264
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,400

they can really trust in their hearts.

266

The news first came from Mainland Press,

saying that we were one of the victorious countries.

293

But on the Treaty of Versailles,

294
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:33,490
the jurisdiction rights of Shangdong have been transferred from Germany to Japan.

That's outrageous!

296
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:39,520
Weak countries have never had diplomatic rights in history. Amid such humiliations,

297
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,650
Morning Post and National Bulletin have published articles advocating

that losing Shangdong will be losing the nation.

we will be discriminated against.

Everyone, there were more than one thousand people who attended the Paris Peace Conference.

365
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,760
But later at the conference, three people were put in charge.

366
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,220
They are the President of the United States,

They are the most powerful people at the Paris Peace Conference.

369

They are the ones who make the final decision. They turned the Paris Peace Conference into

370

an opportunity to split the profits.

371

No one cared about fairness and justice.

is the Chinese people themselves.

Since Cheng’s troops got defeated, they’ve stopped moving forward.

They avoided the difficult Huyang gate,

Yongning doesn’t have the same natural barrier as the Huyang gate.

00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:17,450
He was more excited than anyone in the family.

489
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:20,720
- I was just in a hurry...
- Brother! Brother!

490
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,580
- Third Brother!
- Where's our gifts?

491
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:27,030
Fourth Sister said you must have brought gifts for us. Where's the gift?

492
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:28,390
You brats.

493
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:31,100
I do have gifts for you.

494
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:34,550
You should go out and play.

495
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:36,460
Let's go out.

496
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:39,740
- Let's go.
- Third Brother.

497
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:58,650
♫ Who is looking forward to the spring breeze? ♫

498
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:03,820
♫ Who is staring at the moving flowers? ♫

499
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:08,970
♫ Who is watching the galaxy in the summer night ♫

500
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:15,420
♫ Who remembers a shooting star going by in a moment? ♫

501
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:21,230
♫ Who is afraid of heartbreak, denies the heartbeat? ♫

502
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:26,330
♫ Allow loneliness to smear the other’s protective coloration ♫

503
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:31,620
♫ Who would be willing to pass the other like this ♫

504
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:38,440
♫ I also want to be a shooting star to make you warm ♫

505
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:45,680
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

506
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:51,220
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

507
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:56,930
♫ At least the flight will be smooth ♫

508
00:44:56,930 --> 00:45:02,490
♫ Waiting for a promise my whole life ♫

509
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:08,150
♫ I cherish even the short-lived happiness ♫

510
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:13,730
♫ Leave some tenderness to the years ♫

511
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:19,420
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

512
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:25,010
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫

513
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:30,600
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

514
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:36,200
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

515
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:46,200
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

516
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:56,590
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫
