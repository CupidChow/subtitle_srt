00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,650
Remember, we must keep him happy.

165
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,780
If he's happy, then all of us will be fine.

166
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,570
Understood?

167
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,960
- Wow, it's over there. Let's go take some photographs.
- Okay.

168
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,600
Uncle Gui, there are so many people, the car can't move.

169
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,540
I want to get off to get some air.

170
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,250
Go ahead.

171
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,180
Sir, I want to ask for a favor.

172
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,240
What can I do for you?

173
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,660
Not bad. It's made like the real thing.

174
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,600
It's a true one-to-one replica of a German gun.

175
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,690
Really?

176
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,560
If you like it, I'll give it to you. Take it.

177
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,140
Really? Thanks, Third Brother.

178
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,240
How does this one even count? I have even more impressive ones. Want to see?

179
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,740
Yes. What is it?

180
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,330
Bring it over.

181
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,770
What's this?

182
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,020
What is that?

183
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,370
A bug?

184
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:28,660
- It's just a lizard, Big Fool Xu. Are you serious?
- It scared me.

185
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,640
Third Master, some foreigner reporters are outside saying

186
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,280
that you're using personal punishment. They expressed strong condemnation.

187
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,820
Foreign reporters?

188
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,460
What?

189
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:43,510
[Theater]

190
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,520
-Third Master.
- Third Master.

191
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,160
Shut up!

192
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,260
Hey, isn't that my family's car?

193
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,020
Yeah.

194
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,450
What are those foreigners doing?

195
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,920
What are they getting involved for? Smash their cameras.

196
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,840
Third Brother, don't get worked up.

197
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,540
Those foreigners all have diplomatic immunity.

198
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,410
If they add their own spin to their report, then your father will surely find out about it by them.

199
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,610
Rest assured, I'll take care of it. Calm down.

200
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,440
- You got it?
- Rest assured. Leave it to me.

201
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,800
Third Brother, leave it to him. It'll be no problem.

202
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,070
Friends! Friends! Please stop taking pictures.

203
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,300
Friends, please stop taking pictures. We're just playing a game right now.

204
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,410
It's all a misunderstanding. A misunderstanding.

205
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,050
It's all right. Thank you.

206
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,800
Young Master! Young Master!

207
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,490
Uncle Guy already arrived at the station and picked up Miss Lin from the South.

208
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,920
How about you go back to the residence and take a look?

209
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,270
How does she look?

210
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,300
One word, ugly.

211
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,820
One word, scram.

212
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:50,090
Show your tile.

213
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,680
Seven circles.

214
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,070
Third Brother, tomorrow you're not planning on going?

215
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,990
- Go where?
- Your father's inauguration ceremony.

216
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,940
It's going to be a bunch of empty brained people, why go there?

217
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,310
Your entire family is going. It's not appropriate if the three of us don't go, right?

218
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,910
When did you become so sensible, Big Fool Xu?

219
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,650
Sensible. Sensible.

220
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:16,060
I don't even understand my card, what do you mean I'm sensible? Hurry and show your cards.

221
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:20,080
What kind of game is this? It's two dots, and you don't even feel bad showing it?

222
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,060
- Hi!
- Shuyi!

223
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,810
Shuyi, you're finally here!

224
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:32,250
Let's go. I'll take you girls to try our cook's new dessert.

225
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,720
- It's really good.
- I want some, too.

226
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:42,700
Elder Brother, congratulations on your promotion as the Defense Commander for the three Northern territories.

227
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,600
All right, thank you.

228
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,410
Commander, you dare to think and do it. You're very talented.

229
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:51,430
I, Old Zheng, will follow you for the rest of my life.

230
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,450
Enough. All of us are brothers.

231
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,740
We're all a family.

232
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,490
If you guys are well, that's when I, Xiao Haishen am truly well.

233
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,920
Elder Brother, why isn't Governor Jin here yet?

234
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,670
The governor has been continuously discussing with the prime minister's secret envoy and can't excuse himself.

235
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,450
The war in Europe is very intense.

236
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:13,470
What did the prime minister do? He asserted to declare war with Germany.

237
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,100
The president didn't agree.

238
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,400
Between the two of them, who will overtake who? I have no clue.

239
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,520
I, Old Xu, regardless of what happens with the superiors

240
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,450
or which side the Governor stands on, we live our own lives.

241
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,790
I'll still follow whatever Eldest Brother does.

242
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:29,370
Yes, yes, yes!

243
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,230
My goodness. Th-Third—

244
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:08,790
Third Brother!

245
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,540
Hurry! Hurry!

246
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,510
Hurry and get up! Look at what time it is. Hurry and wake up!

247
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:19,290
Third Brother, did you forget what I told you yesterday? The inaugural ceremony?

248
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,370
I said I'm not going. I'm not going!

249
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:25,150
Who's going to carry me there?

250
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,150
Third Brother. Third Broth—

251
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,420
Third Master, please return to the residence with us.

252
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,460
Big Fool Xu.

253
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,290
Take him away.

254
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,910
- Wait, no, no.
- Be gentle.

255
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:48,140
- Be more gentle.
- Big Fool Xu,

256
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,460
- Third Brother.
- Let me tell you. I'll find myself a good gun and shoot you!

257
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,220
This really has nothing to do with me! Listen to me explain.

258
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,780
Stop carrying me. I can walk myself.

259
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,280
Oh no! Oh no!

260
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,500
This is bad.

261
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,000
You did well.

262
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,120
- Third Brother!
- Mo Weiyi, it was all your idea!

263
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:12,630
Seventh Madam, ever since my daughter met Third Master,

264
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,000
she fawns over him all day.

265
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,370
There's no one else in her eyes.

266
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:20,890
When are you going to be a matchmaker?

267
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:24,790
Let me tell you. Between a man and a woman, there needs to be fate.

268
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,140
Our family's Fengqi and your third master

269
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,960
are so like-minded. They both like to watch foreign films

270
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,090
and dance.

271
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,730
Let me tell you. My Fengqi

272
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,610
and Third Master have a childhood engagement.

273
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:45,060
Looking at this fate, others can't compare.

274
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,560
Seventh Madam, you need to keep track of this. Right?

275
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,890
Don't you know children these days?

276
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,960
They talk of equality and freedom.

277
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,360
The parents' arrangement and matchmaker's words are no longer valued.

278
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,930
Let's just play Mahjong and see what happens.

279
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,840
Here, here, here. Have a drink.

280
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,040
Let me go!

281
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,890
Let me go!

282
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,530
This...

283
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,760
Third Brother?

284
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,390
There are so many people.

285
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,510
- So many people, and you didn't tell me?
- I didn't know either.

286
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,990
- Xu Zijun!
- I'll make you pay later.

287
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,180
- Dad!
- Weiyi.
- Father.

288
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,260
You brat.

289
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,980
You brat, you know to come home?

290
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:53,350
There's a lot of people today. How do you have the time to deal with me?

291
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:57,180
- You disgraceful bastard.
- Third Master came home?

292
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:01,480
Commander, no need to discipline Third Master in front of so many people. Right?

293
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:06,460
It's all right. Everyone, carry on.

294
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,650
Third Master, come with me. All the madams are waiting for you.

295
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,190
Come on.

296
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,040
Madams, our third master is here.

297
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,410
- Beichen.
- Beichen, you are getting more and more handsome.

298
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,870
My Daughter, Fengqi, is constantly calling us from France

299
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,670
and always mentions you.

300
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,560
Beichen, my daughter

301
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,830
talks about you all the time.

302
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:36,090
Our Myna bird at home calls "Third Brother" on repeat.

303
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,270
Your Myna bird at home is useless.

304
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:41,500
Beichen, let me tell you, you and Fengqi have so much in common.

305
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,230
You guys can dance.

306
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,850
You two can also watch foreign movie stars together.

307
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,620
- Beichen, if you want...
- Madam Zheng.

308
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:53,940
Madam Sun. I'm a bit busy right now, so please enjoy yourselves.

309
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,520
I'll pick a day to come and visit.

310
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,890
- You go ahead.
- Okay.

311
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,570
- Carry on your conversation.
- Come see us later.

312
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,940
- You have to come back!
- Let's go sit down.

313
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,470
- Third Brother.
- Xu Zijun!

314
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,710
- Calm down!
- Third Brother, let's talk business.

315
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,830
The thing you asked me to check, I found something.

316
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:15,580
- Those foreigners were not reporters after all. They were just normal tourists.
- What?

317
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:19,770
The person who instructed them was a woman who sat in a car that belonged to the Xiao family.

318
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:22,210
They just picked her up from the station.

319
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,620
Is that my new sister? It's her?

320
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,170
She just got here and is already causing trouble.

321
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:36,250
It looks like your ugly sister is also an instigator.

322
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,810
Shuyi, who is that?

323
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,890
Mo...

324
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,670
What?

325
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:18,180
I didn't understand back then...

326
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,040
why I would only notice the expression in his eyes in the crowd.

327
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,600
Hangjing, come down.

328
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,610
Let me bring you to see Uncle Xiao.

329
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:41,940
Let's go.

330
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,100
Commander, Hangjing is here.

331
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,210
Hello, Uncle Xiao.

332
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:56,530
Let me give you all a grand introduction.

333
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:00,620
This is my brother Lin Tangsheng's daughter, Lin Hangjing.

334
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,570
Now, she is my adopted daughter.

335
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:07,220
I greet all of my seniors.

336
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:11,300
Minister Lin's daughter is so lithe and elegant.

337
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,620
Yes.

338
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,860
Back then, your dad was the number one handsome man at Xuehai Hall.

339
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:19,490
He was good at everything from writing to military strategy.

340
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:22,640
Hangjing, at this house you can live without worry.

341
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,900
If anyone bullies you, tell me.

342
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,490
Thank you, Uncle Xiao.

343
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,800
Then I'll take her to see everyone.

344
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:36,140
Eldest Brother, why do I think I heard that Lin Tangsheng got into some trouble?

345
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,010
There is some gossip.

346
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,590
It's all rumors. Let's go.

347
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,560
Third Master, I was just looking for you.

348
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:48,300
- Seventh Aunt.
- This is your new younger sister, Lin Hangjing.

349
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,450
Younger Sister Lin?

350
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,220
Then isn't this like the script books?

351
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:55,380
"A Younger Sister Lin fell from the skies"
(T/N: Reference to Dream of the Red Chamber Opera)

352
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,730
- Be a little more proper.
- When was I improper?

353
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:03,610
Hangjing, you haven't met him yet. This is your third brother, Xiao Beichen.

354
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,210
Hello, Third Brother.

355
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,700
- Mo Weiyi.
- Xu Zijun.

356
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,810
Look at how beautiful her "Third Brother" sounds.

357
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,930
The two of you can go play.

358
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:16,240
- Seventh Aunt, we're going to the Xiaoxi Pavilion.
- See you later, Third Brother.
- Go ahead.

359
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,200
Third Master, why don't you take Hangjing to Xiaoxi Pavilion, too?

360
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,080
There's a ball there for the young people.

361
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,100
Hangjing, if you need anything, ask your Third Brother. If he can't do it, tell Uncle Xiao.

362
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,370
Rest assured, I'll take good care of Younger Sister Lin.

363
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:32,270
All right. Then I'll go take care of the madams.

364
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,160
Seventh Aunt, you go do your thing.

365
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,210
- Look after your younger sister.
- Don't worry.

366
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,790
Leave it to me.

367
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:49,060
Younger Sister Lin, you don't seem like a timid person.

368
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,370
The Xiaoxi Pavilion is over there, right?

369
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,310
Young Master. Hey! Young Master.

370
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,710
Miss, may I have a dance?

371
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,160
Our miss doesn't know how to dance.

372
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,560
- Sorry.
- Sorry to bother you.

373
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:21,260
See? She rejected everyone who asked her to dance.

374
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:26,510
- Xu Zijun? You try.
- What?

375
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,880
M-Me?

376
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,980
I'm not going.

377
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:37,420
If I were to dance, then I would dance with Younger Sister Shuyi. Right?

378
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:41,590
Then, looks like it's up to our Third Master Xiao

379
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:44,080
to make a personal appearance.

380
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,450
- They dance so well.
- Third Brother, I think

381
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:51,220
you shouldn't try to entertain yourself. It definitely won't work.

382
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,550
Right?

383
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:02,160
He's going?

384
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,520
Miss, may I have a dance?

385
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,600
My miss doesn't know how to dance.

386
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,220
Sorry, I don't know how to dance.

387
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:12,330
Third Brother, I've disturbed you guys.

388
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,970
What are you doing?

389
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:26,540
- Third Brother, I brought Jin Xiang. What are you doing?
- Miss!

390
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,450
Don't worry, it's okay.

391
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:33,420
It's just that we haven't greeted each other yet.

392
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,110
How could a servant interfere?

393
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,520
Sit.

394
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:44,320
Jin Xiang grew up with me. I've never thought of her as a servant.

395
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,040
I ask Third Brother not to embarrass her.

396
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,080
No problem.

397
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,070
Except for this next song,

398
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,130
you have to dance it with me.

399
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,140
Seventh Aunt entrusted me to Third Brother's care.

400
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:08,710
I don't think Third Brother will embarrass this younger sister who doesn't know how to dance, right?

401
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:11,180
Since you're putting it that way,

402
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,820
then I can't embarrass my younger sister.

403
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,520
Right?

404
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,780
But don't forget,

405
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,430
you're temporarily living under the Xiao family's roof.

406
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:26,710
There will be many more opportunities to train servants.

407
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:34,250
The next song is about to start.

408
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,000
Wow, he's pretty good.

409
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:02,450
Third Brother, I'm sorry. I really can't learn.

410
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:12,130
I think Younger Sister's steps are extremely agile.

411
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,480
Third Brother, you flatter me.

412
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,410
- Let me assist you.
- No need.

413
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,710
Sit, sit, sit.

414
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,180
No wonder you're Third Brother.

415
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:52,310
Although we've met a lot of pretty ladies at Ming Yu Yue,

416
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:54,190
you've never pursued any of them.

417
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,330
You're still a novice at that.

418
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:59,760
What? Do you think I won't be able to pursue her?

419
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,090
Fine, then let's make a bet.

420
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:07,460
Let's see if you can make her fall for you within a month.

421
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:11,040
Tell me. If I succeed...

422
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:15,960
If you succeed, then I'll give you my new convertible car.

423
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,790
Yes, I'll bet a car too.

424
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,990
If you succeed, I'll give you that car too.

425
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,150
But if you lose, what happens?

426
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,560
Third Brother is from a prestigious, rich family.

427
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:31,940
Your bet needs to be a little more extravagant, right?

428
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,220
Just a little.

429
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:38,910
Just a car?

430
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:41,460
I'll leave my words here.

431
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,770
If I lose,

432
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:48,790
I'll smash the entire Ming Yu Yue. Bet?

433
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:51,470
There is no if.

434
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,080
I made you some sobering soup, have it while it's hot.

435
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,970
Tonight, at the banquet,

436
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:06,140
Old Sun was inquiring about Tangsheng's matter.

437
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,520
What did you say?

438
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,790
I dodged the questions.

439
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,520
Can you hide it any longer?

440
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,680
Warlord Cheng is getting ready to handle

441
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,740
Tangsheng's matter secretly, that's why it won't go public.

442
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,270
As for me, I've managing it

443
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:23,210
to ensure Tangsheng is doing okay.

444
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:27,180
I feel so sorry for Hangjing.

445
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:31,340
Her mother died when she was young and now her dad is in trouble.

446
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,620
Hangjing's biological mother is a concubine.

447
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:38,990
The main wife despised her the most, that's why she committed suicide.

448
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:41,020
What's wrong about being a concubine?

449
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:45,030
If it's not because you stinky men fall in love with everyone you see, that's karma.

450
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:48,560
Look! I misspoke. It's not what I meant.

451
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,810
You totally mean that.

452
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:52,410
What I meant is that we must

453
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,200
make sure to treat Hangjing like our own child.

454
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,650
Hangjing is beautiful and has good education,

455
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,660
I like her a lot.

456
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,950
Her mother was a concubine, so what?

457
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:02,550
We're of similar background, I'll make sure she is the best.

458
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:05,450
Of course. Do as you wish.

459
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:08,410
Where is the soup? I'm going to have it now.

460
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:10,800
Drink it in one shot.

461
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,730
[Tingxiang Garden]

462
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,270
Younger Sister Hangjing.

463
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,850
Get in. I'll give you a lift.

464
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:53,390
Seventh Aunt already arranged a car for me, so I won't bother you.

465
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:57,360
Is that right? I just saw Old Huang drive away.

466
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:02,140
I assume Uncle Gui didn't arrange it properly

467
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,190
and didn't explain it clearly.

468
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,180
Coincidentally,

469
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,570
your Shengyi Girls School is not far from our all-boys school.

470
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,420
So it's on the way.

471
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,090
Don't just stand there. Hop in.

472
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,860
Third Master Xiao? Who is she?

473
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,550
Third Master Xiao personally drove her to school.

474
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,700
How come he drove her here?

475
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,220
So envious.

476
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,800
Third Master Xiao.

477
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:57,640
This is a girls' school, males are not allowed to enter.

478
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:03,110
So it's Third Master Xiao. I was unobservant.

479
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:07,320
