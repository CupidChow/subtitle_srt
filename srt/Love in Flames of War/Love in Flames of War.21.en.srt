Did you forget?

23
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,930
We played together since we were four or five.

24
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,120
We were boisterous together. We've never separated.

25
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,630
After that, we went to school, the military academy, and the battlefield together.

26
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,490
We bled and sweated together.

27
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,280
From the bottom of my heart, I identified you as my older brother.

Trust me.

29
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,420
Trust me that everything will get better, all right, Weiyi?

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,110
Trust me.

31

I'm not letting go. I'm not letting go!

I'll say it again, you let go.

Do you still remember back then,

44
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,500
how we, brothers, conquered this city?

45
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,960
Five days and four nights of a fierce battle.

46
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,810
- Watch out!
- How many brothers died?

47
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,530
At that time, I told you and Old Zhang to leave first.
- Charge!

48
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:40,370
But you said you'd also die if you went back home.

49
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,370
Might as well invade the city to feast.

50
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,610
Want to die, might as well be a full ghost.

51

In the end, we relied on this pride

Father, your skills are getting better.

67
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,310
I still remember when you cut my hair when I was young,

68
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:15,070
you cut my hair like a watermelon.

69
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,980
I tell you, I heard from the elders in the house

70
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,420
that when a father cuts his son's hair, it can get rid of bad luck.

71
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,900
It can make the son grow up healthily.

72
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:06,140
Madam, peeling this gingkos is mentally taxing and tiring.

73
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:10,190
You have been peeling them the whole morning. Rest a while.

74
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,800
It's okay.

75
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,700
Madam, I'll do it instead.

76
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,160
No need, no need. I'll do it myself.

Even though the bullet was taken out immediately,

79
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,850
his lung is seriously infected and he is coughing persistently.

80
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:32,670
This ginkgo can nourish the lung and relieve the cough.

81
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,120
But you don't need to peel them yourself.

82
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,590
Whoever peels it, isn't it the same?

83
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,390
How can it be the same?

84
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,810
It's more sincere if it's peeled personally.

85
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,570
I only hope that Commander can get better soon.

86
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,480
- Be careful.
- I'm fine.

87
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,950
Father, why did you look for me?

88
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,160
This time I was shot in the lung, and I have not regained my agility.

89
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,100
Whenever it's nighttime, I'll cough persistently.

90
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,370
This doctor recommends that I go to America to do a complete recovery treatment.

91
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,030
Such a serious injury, is the doctor over there trustworthy?

92
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:25,200
He already found the doctor-in-charge for me. Don't worry.

93
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,890
Then, how long will you be there?

94
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:30,920
It'll be around half a year.

95
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,200
How about I go with you?

96
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,100
You see, the security over there is not as good as in our country.

97
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,300
Besides, me going with you can also...

98
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,230
Your eldest sister has already arranged properly in America for me.

99
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:45,630
Oh, yes! Fifth and Sixth are clamoring to go over there and see their eldest sister.

100
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,570
I'll bring them along and also let them gain some experience.

101
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,410
Father, what about this matter...

102
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,560
You must stay in

103
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,020
Beixin. East Main Camp and the house cannot do without you.

104
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,860
I thought about it myself.

105
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,180
Now I appoint you as

106
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,460
the Deputy Commander of the Ying Army.

107
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:13,390
After I leave, you will manage all military affairs on behalf of me.

108
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:17,200
Father, aren't you just making a trip to America?

109
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,330
I can manage the military affairs during the period that you are not around. This is not a problem.

110
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:24,170
But this position, you gave it to me too early.

111
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,290
The Suiling battle,

112
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,310
and the Old Mo and Old Zheng's matter,

113
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:34,380
I can tell that you can take charge.

114
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,820
I will also transfer the military power to you gradually.

115
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,070
You are the backbone of the Ying Army.

116
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:44,230
If you are not around, how can I stabilize the troops' morale?

117
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,790
There will be a day when your father is old.

118
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,520
Third Master, you have to learn.

119
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,890
Take on the responsibility of the Xiao family.

120
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,560
Yes.

121
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,830
Since you've already decided, I'll continue to command and arrange.

122
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:06,340
I, the family, and the whole Ying Army will wait for you to come back safely.

123
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,660
Good.

124
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,450
Drink it while it's hot.

125
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,410
Have you told Beichen about your trip to the United States?

126
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,140
Focus on your recovery. Beichen won't disappoint you.

127
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:40,150
All these years, East Main Camp has gone through many ups and downs.

128
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:44,530
Beichen can now handle them himself. I'm confident in him for this.

129
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:48,270
Why don't you ever say those words in front of your son?

130
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,950
I've told him things I'm supposed to say.

131
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,440
You've worked hard for taking care of this family.

132
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,290
Are you sure you don't want me to go with you to the United States?

133
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,560
Haven't we pinky promised on this?

134
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,730
You're managing the family home and Beichen manages the military camp, so I can go on this trip without any worries.

135
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,390
- Commander, I...
- Don't worry.

136
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:16,220
I'll recuperate well, and come back in excellent shape.

137
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,300
When I'm back, I'll hand over everything to Beichen.

138
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,360
Then I will have idle time...

139
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,710
to stay with you.

140
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:32,020
From then on, we can be a normal married couple.

141
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:37,280
Then wait for Beichen and Hangjing to give us a big fat grandson.

142
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,390
Also, Shuyi will be married to a good family.

143
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,780
Then, we can watch

144
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,820
Fifth and Sixth grow up.

145
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,910
That's settled then.

146
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,470
- Pinky promise.
- Pinky promise.

147
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,440
- Sealed.
- Sealed.

148
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,340
Governor, Xiao Haishan has already left to the United States.

149
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,000
Last time, during the Suiling battle,

150
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,630
he might have been injured but he set a great example and his reputation is roaring in the army.

151
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,140
Xiao Haishan retreats from his success and

152
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,240
stays away from the conflicts.

153
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,630
I see that is perhaps the best outcome.

154
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:26,830
But Xiao Beichen might be carrying a Deputy Chief Commander title right now,

155
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,600
but he has already taken over the entire Ying Army.

156
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,310
He is not easy to manage, I don't see him being on our side.

157
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,650
This Beichen...

158
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,610
became successful at a young age and has a card up his sleeve.

159
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:47,770
He won't follow the lead or easily be at someone else's order.

160
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:53,810

What if he becomes disloyal??

Then I'll take out all his fangs and claws,

to end the dispute between North and South.

The Soviet Union sent a military expert named Yakov to the South.

Because this is a matter of great importance, the South is very concerned.

At the driver's seat, there were two footprints. The left print is lighter than the right.

323
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,990
Are you sure?

324
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,460
Don't worry.

325
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,460
I will live here.

326
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,770
But your arm has been seriously injured.

327
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:45,040
It's not a good place for recovery. What if it becomes crippled?

328
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,160
There is nothing I can do.

329
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,160
My brother is like my arm.

330
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,200
I've lost my brother. There's no point in me keeping this arm.

331
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:00,580
Fox Mo, I'm telling you. I feel a little sleepy now.

332
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,690
I'm going to have a nap.

333
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:05,540
Be careful if you decide to open the door.

334
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,210
Don't knock the door into me.

335
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:24,830
[Xin Yue Tea House]

336
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,000
Brother Zizheng, Brother Yong is here.

337
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:53,040
Brother Yong, would it be possible that we're on the wrong track?

338
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,990
I have been secretly watching Jin Cheng for days. I've also tried getting knowledge from Jin Rouke.

339
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:59,880
I've also been to the archive room and Jin Cheng's study.

340
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,100
I have even been to the prison in Dong Ping.

341
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,110
But I've found nothing about Yakov.

342
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:08,560
But in Dong Ping, without Jin Cheng's order,

343
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,580
no one would dare to imprison a high-class Russian expert.

344
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:15,780
And to Jin Cheng, he must be more cautious than cautious regarding this matter.

345
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:19,820
It won't be easy to find the loopholes.

346
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:24,320
If that's the case,

347
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,990
then Jin Cheng must have a decision regarding Yakov.

348
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:31,060
I will be able to find some clues by then.

349
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:34,110
I hope this will be a lead.

350
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:39,090
Jin Cheng will soon set off to Beixin. I will go with him. I will continue my investigation there.

351
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:42,210
You are going to Beixin?

352
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:45,500
Yes. Is there an issue?

353
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:51,000
I meant to say we can meet up in Beixin now.

354
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,590
Yes. I can finally meet Hangjing and my mother.

355
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,590
[To Hangjing]

356
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:25,150
Brother Yong, I have a bad feeling about this.

357
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:28,020
Are we really not going to tell Brother Zizheng about Miss Lin?

358
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:32,180
He will definitely find out once he is in Beixin.

359
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,740
I really don't know how to tell him.

360
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,300
Let's leave it for now.

361
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:43,420
I'll explain to him when he is in Beixin.

362
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,590
Brother Zizheng.

363
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,860
Zizheng, what are you doing here?

364
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,610
Brother Yong, what were you talking about?

365
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,380
Nothing.

366
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,720
What happened to Hangjing?

367
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,280
Brother Zizheng, actually...

368
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:14,070
Brother Yong, just tell me what exactly happened to Hangjing.

369
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,490
I feel like your words have another meaning.

370
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,680
Zizheng,

371
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,530
Hangjing...

372
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,750
is married.

373
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:37,320
What are you saying? Don't joke with me.

374
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,950
It's true.

375
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,510
To whom?

376
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,420
Xiao Beichen.

377
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,400
Xiao Beichen?

378
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,990
That's impossible. Hangjing hates Xiao Beichen the most!

379
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:00,610
She wouldn't marry him. That's impossible!

380
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,170
Zizheng, calm down.

381
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:06,840
They got married suddenly after you left.

382
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:11,950
The Xiao Family had a grand wedding. Jin Cheng and Kang Jingxiong attended it, too.

383
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,430
That's impossible.

384
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:21,090
That doesn't make sense. Brother Yong,

385
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:25,800
did you give my letter to Hangjing?

386
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:31,160
I'm sorry. I didn't give it to her.

387
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:38,180
Why?

388
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:41,670
Zizheng, actually, at the time,

389
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,640
Xiao Beichen came to see me.

390
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:47,140
What do you mean?

391
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,600
We've never crossed paths, Third Master.

392
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,540
What's brought you here?

393
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:03,050
To be honest, I'm here today,

394
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:05,560
for a person.

395
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:09,050
I don't know who Third Master is talking about.

396
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:11,060
Mu Zizheng.

397
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:20,320
I don't know how Zizheng has offended you, Third Master.

398
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:25,540
Or... are you doing this for Miss Lin?

399
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,040
You're a smart man.

400
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:32,480
I'm warning you to only ask things you can ask

401
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,480
and do not mention the things you shouldn't know.

402
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:41,860
Don't worry. It's not Mu Zizheng's life I'm after.

403
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:45,990
I just want him to disappear from Beixin.

404
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:50,600
Kang Jingxiong was attacked. He won't leave the matter.

405
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,450
Even if you didn't bring up the matter,

406
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:56,140
we would try our best to get Zizheng out of here for the time being.

407
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,040
It's just there are some unsolved matters.

408
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,070
We need some time.

409
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,680
I want him to leave tonight.

410
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,440
According to what you said,

411
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:20,790
it was Xiao Beichen who wanted me gone and it was part of his plan?

412
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,360
Sorry, Zizheng.

413
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,270
What's the point of apologizing now?

414
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,240
You're my most trusted Eldest Brother!

415
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,030
How can you join forces with him and lie to me?

416
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:34,140
I was worried about your safety back then.

417
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:37,140
I didn't want you to fall into this love triangle.

418
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,230
Xiao Beichen is not something you can offend.

419
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:44,000
I wanted to move you somewhere else temporarily back then.

420
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,160
Once your mission had been finished, I would move you to another location.

421
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:52,180
I didn't know you would go all the way and investigate the Japanese military plan.

422
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,410
And you also lost contact with the organization.

423
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:01,200
Sorry, Zizheng.

424
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,720
If you want to blame someone, you can blame me.

425
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:08,380
Today, I'm standing here to receive your punishment.

426
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,560
Don't be like this, Brother Zizheng! All he did was for your sake.

427
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:50,140
Zizheng, what happened?

428
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,530
Zizheng, what actually happened?

429
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:02,190
You never drink this much.

430
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:08,230
Sister Rouke, do you know?

431
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,820
The girl I love...

432
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:16,530
is already married.

433
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:18,310
Who did she get married to?

434
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:21,640
She married the man whom you cannot offend in Beixin.

435
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,110
Xiao Beichen?

436
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,370
Yes.

437
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,430
How could that be?

438
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:44,250
Zizheng, if the lady you love is single,

439
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:48,130
no matter what happened, I would always support you.

440
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:50,580
- But now that Xiao Beichen...
- What about Xiao Beichen?

441
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:55,160
So I can't be with her? So I don't deserve her? So I have no right to fight for her?

442
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,880
That's not what I meant. What I said is for your own good.

443
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,540
I don't want you to get hurt again.

444
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:09,360
I'm sorry, Sister Rouke.

445
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,150
But don't worry about me. I believe Hangjing cares about me.

446
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:19,540
She married Xiao Beichen because she had no other choice.

447
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:22,580
Now I'm back alive,

448
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,670
I will never allow him to separate us again.

449
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,910
Drink the soup while it's still hot.

450
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:35,120
Don't drink anymore.

451
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,280
Thank you, Sister Rouke.

452
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,090
- Miss.
- Young Master Xu.

453
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:03,540
Give him my duck leg as well.

454
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,340
Okay.

455
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,080
I gave mine to you.

456
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,030
Mo Weiyi!

457
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:31,200
You don't have to eat it. Why are you taking out your anger with the duck leg?

458
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,840
I didn't even bear to eat it myself.

459
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:52,410
I know you'll be bored eating alone.

460
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:54,430
I'll eat with you.

461
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:05,960
Can you calm down and listen to me speak?

462
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,960
Living here these days,

463
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,450
I recalled so many...

464
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,420
so many things that happened when we were kids.

465
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:27,410
The most memorable things in the past for me...

466
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:31,310
are moments that the three of us brothers spent together.

467
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,010
It was like we never parted before.

468
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:42,580
Wherever you were, Third Brother and I were always there.

469
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:47,550
Wherever Third Brother was, you and I were always there.

470
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,260
Do you still remember our oath?

471
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,250
In the name of Heaven,

472
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,770
I, Xiao Beichen,

473
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:02,860
I, Mo Weiyi,

474
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,630
and I, Xu Zijun!

475
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:09,910
We swear today to be brothers by different surnames.

476
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:14,270
May the Gods of Heaven and Earth attest...

477
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,380
to what is in our hearts.

478
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:22,740
If we should ever do anything to betray our friendship, may Heaven and the people of the earth both strike us dead.

479
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:26,290
From today on, we'll entrust each other with our life and death.

480
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:28,340
Save each other regardless of fortune or misfortune.

481
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:32,900
Rely on each other regardless of weal or woe. And support each other amidst trials and tribulations.

482
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:53,300
Do you really think Third Brother didn't know you would save your father?

483
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,710
Without his permission, do you think it would be so easy for you to save him?

484
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,670
But my father... is still gone.

485
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,890
Are you still suspecting Third Brother for killing your father?

486
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:12,700
I can assure you with my life, Third Brother would never do it!

487
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:16,050
Mo Weiyi, don't you know this more than I do?

488
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:24,940
Anything else, I can convince myself.

489
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:27,350
I can give in and I can be open-minded.

490
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:29,860
But he's my father!

491
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,110
You should leave. Don't bother me here.

492
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:43,250
I won't leave until you come around.

493
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:46,440
You're a man. How absurd is it for you to stay here at my door?

494
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,980
It doesn't matter! I just want you to come back!

495
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,370
The three of us should be together!

496
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:02,670
Xu Zijun, I'm making it clear to you one more time.

497
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:06,330
You can stay here for as long as you like. But Xiao Beichen and I,

498
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:09,330
our brotherhood has come to an end!

499
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:21,830
Did I drool?

500
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:26,020
I know you guys are always laughing at me for being foolish.

501
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,660
I know I'm indeed not smart,

502
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:32,040
that's why I use the dumbest method and wait for you.

503
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,310
I'll wait until the day of your return.

504
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:38,840
Do whatever you want.

505
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:22,380
♫ Who is looking forward to the spring breeze? ♫

506
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:27,560
♫ Who is staring at the moving flowers? ♫

507
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:32,700
♫ Who is watching the galaxy in the summer night ♫

508
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:39,220
♫ Who remembers a shooting star going by in a moment? ♫

509
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:44,980
♫ Who is afraid of heartbreak, denies the heartbeat? ♫

510
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:50,040
♫ Allow loneliness to smear the other’s protective coloration ♫

511
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:55,300
♫ Who would be willing to pass the other like this ♫

512
00:43:55,300 --> 00:44:02,020
♫ I also want to be a shooting star to make you warm ♫

513
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:09,380
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

514
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:14,990
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

515
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:20,660
♫ At least the flight will be smooth ♫

516
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:26,240
♫ Waiting for a promise my whole life ♫

517
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:31,770
♫ I cherish even the short-lived happiness ♫

518
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:37,320
♫ Leave some tenderness to the years ♫

519
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:43,090
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

520
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:48,740
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫

521
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:54,340
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

522
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:59,870
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

523
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:07,420
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

524
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:21,260
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫
