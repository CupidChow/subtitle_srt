[Episode 23]

21
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,840
Ever since then,

22
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,820
I'd decided...

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,410
that I must make my mark

24
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,410
and must change the injustice in the world.

25
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,740
If we can't take hold of our fate,

26
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,370
our dignity will be trampled on for one more day.

27
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,990
Zizheng.

28
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,690
When I was in the labor camp,

29
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,580
I nearly died there.

30
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,530
There,

31
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,000
I met many people

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,400
whose lives were like grass, like me.

33
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,040
When the guards killed one,

34
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,000
it was as easy as killing an ant.

35
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,340
You know,

36
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,420
it was the first time in my life...

37
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,750
that I regretted my own decision.

38
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,560
I was not afraid of dying,

39
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,540
but I was afraid that I would die...

40
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,920
before I could see you for the last time.

41
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,160
I'm sorry, Zizheng.

42
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,980
Miss Jin told me about what happened to you at the labor camp.

43
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,110
I really had no idea that you'd been through that.

44
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,890
It was Third Brother's fault to transfer you away.

45
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,250
I apologize to you on his behalf.

46
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,880
You apologize to me on his behalf?

47
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,140
Actually, I'm here today...

48
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,340
- to make it clear...
- Stop saying it.

49
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,100
I don't want to listen.

50
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,610
No, I have to make myself clear.

51
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,460
In fact, when I arrived in Beixin that year,

52
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,630
facing a completely foreign world,

53
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,410
facing a life completely different from before,

54
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,480
I was at a loss and didn't know what to do.

55
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,890
On the surface, I seemed calm.

56
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,630
But in fact, I was very disturbed mentally.

57
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:05,810
The first time I met you, you protected me.

58
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:12,260
Later, we became close confidants.

59
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,320
Being with you, I could say anything I wanted.

60
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,150
I didn't have to respect all the doctrines and rules.

61
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:28,150
Those happy, careless days.

62
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:31,190
I'll always keep those memories deep in my heart.

63
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,350
And you, I treat you as

64
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,280
a forever confidant and friend.

65
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,800
But now, I'm Xiao Beichen's wife.

66
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,480
So, no matter what, we can't...

67
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,220
go back to the past.

68
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,890
I told you.

69
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,760
I have the power to take you away from here.

70
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,660
After I complete this mission, we can elope and go somewhere far away.

71
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,650
We can go to Yulin, we can go anywhere.

72
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,140
A place where Xiao Beichen can't find us.

73
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,850
I can't go with you!

74
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,530
Why?

75
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,370
Why is that?

76
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,840
Because I love Xiao Beichen.

77
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:35,230
How's that possible? You used to hate him the most!

78
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,000
Xiao Beichen forced you to. I'll go find him!

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,540
Zizheng!

80
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,560
Nobody forced me.

81
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,250
I just spoke from my heart.

82
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,780
I don't believe it!

83
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,440
Yes, I used to hate Xiao Beichen.

84
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,400
To me, he was arrogant and domineering.

85
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,190
A young master that made things difficult for others.

86
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:13,530
But later on, we went through many things together.

87
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,650
I realized that

88
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,950
it was me who never understood who he really was.

89
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,640
The real person is kind,

90
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,070
soft-hearted, responsible, and values friendship.

91
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,150
He's been meticulously taking care of me,

92
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,690
and he protected me with his life.

93
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,580
I originally thought,

94
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,630
maybe I was just relying on him.

95
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,050
But at the moment when I thought I was about to lose him,

96
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,360
I realized...

97
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,540
that he is very important to me.

98
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,560
In my heart,

99
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,740
he's already someone I can commit my whole life to.

100

101

Why have we become like this?

102
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,980

103
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,670
Take care.

104

Zizheng! Calm down, Zizheng!

105
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,770
How can I calm down?

106
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,560
Based on what? I was here first!

107
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,090
Why do you still not get it?

108
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,780
Love doesn't care about first come, first serve.

109
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,720
Zizheng, I really understand your feelings.

110
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,390
But do you know?

111
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,010
I used to be deeply in love with someone as well.

112
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:43,800
I thought we'd never be separated for the rest of our lives, living together until we got old.

113
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,340
I was willing to give up everything for him.

114
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,770
Even leaving my father.

115
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,930
But still, he betrayed me.

116
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,770
I've been asking myself,

117
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,440
where did I do not well enough?

118
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,280
Until he died under my father's gun.

119

Laid in my embrace.

120

I still didn't know the answer.

I'm sorry, Sister Rouke. I was...

I'm fine. These are all in the past.

123

I just wanted to tell you,

124
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,410
that love won't always be as we wish.

125

No.

You went to see Mu Zizheng.

It's regarding the Western antiques you reserved from the Huang Residence.

The owner worried about your military schedule and didn't dare bother you.

Since you've been in Beixin for a few days,

that's why he is calling to find out if you want to keep them or want to do something else.

So, you think Yokav is associated with Huang Residence?

When Deputy Officer Zhou reported to Jin Cheng today,

158
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,080
I thought there was something suspicious.

159

They might be talking about antiques, but it sounds like a hidden code.

160
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,950
Huang Residence is definitely suspicious.

161

00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:07,130
Zizheng, listen to a piece of advice.

167
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,200
Your staying next to Jin Cheng

168
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,500
is already a dangerous mission.

169
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,480
Do not get involved in Xiao Beichen and Lin Hanging's relationship.

170
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,710
That will expose you to another bigger danger.

171
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,710
Don't worry, Brother Yong.

172
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,500
I won't do anything stupid.

173
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,420
I also won't let emotion take over my job at the Youth Union.

174
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,550
If you say that,

175
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,590
I'm at ease.

176
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:47,900
We have solid evidence. I don't need to carry on with the nonsense.

177
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,810
Tell me.

178
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:53,910
Who ordered you to kill Regiment Leader Mo?

179
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,290
How about the thing you promised me?

180
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:03,880
[Awaken From Repentance]

181
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,650
Your family has been moved to a safe location.

182
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,760
They're settled at the Yi Long Inn outside the city.

183
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,440
They're watched 24 hours a day.

184
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,200
Don't worry, it's very safe.

185
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,700
I was originally a soldier.

186
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,580
I was injured in training

187
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,930
and then I retired.

188
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:45,340
Later my boss found me and asked me to handle some of his personal matters.

189
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:50,150
Also, he promised me, that he would compensate me with a hefty sum of money after each mission.

190
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:55,420
I can see that. That's why you became an addicted gambler.

191
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,810
When you're doing things every day that your life could have been at risk,

192
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,790
if you think of a way to relieve stress,

193
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,580
how can that be?

194
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,370
Carry on.

195
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:12,750
When I was a soldier, I knew my boss very well.

196
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,330
I didn't want to do it initially,

197
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:22,600
but I had a big family.

198
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:27,420
That bit of handicap subsidy,

199
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,110
it's impossible to raise them.

200
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,030
I'd no choice.

201
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,050
Who is your boss?

202
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:37,180
Kang Jingxiong.

203
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,510
Was it he who asked you to kill Regiment Leader Mo?

204
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,140
Yes.

205
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:49,050
He is prone to suspicion.

206
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:53,680
Earlier that day, he asked me to hide near Suiling.

207
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:58,440
Once I was done with Mo Xibai, I would be able to turn and return to the manor.

208
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,080
If not, I would be killed.

209
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,260
- You bastard!
- Weiyi! Weiyi!

210
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,010
Calm down!

211
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:08,010
My dad is dead! It's useless if you kill him now.

212
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,230
- I want to kill him!
- Weiyi!

213
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:13,100
Weiyi! Calm down!

214
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,770
Weiyi!

215
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,720
Calm down!

216
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:21,820
Your real enemy is Kang Jingxiong.

217
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,620
If you kill him now, you're just destroying his witness.

218
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,930
Calm down.

219
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:58,780
Beichen, you managed to train the troops at East Main Camp so well in such a short time,

220
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,720
thanks for your hard work.

221
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,550
That's the effort of my father and also my uncles.

222
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:07,250
You're too humble. I admire the Tiger Regiment.

223
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,770
That's why we arranged for them to have an exercise with the Spike Team.

224
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:15,860
Let's move forward to Suiling next month. What do you think?

225
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,820
Governor, Tiger Regiment is a tactical division suitable to sudden attack.

226
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,700
They're also good for fortified battle.

227
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,650
If we sent the troop to guard the border,

228
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:32,100
I believe 1st Regiment 2nd Division is more suitable.

229
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,350
Beichen, your Tiger Regiment,

230
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:37,790
I can see how capable they are.

231
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,160
I've another idea.

232
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,140
I want Tiger Regiment to give mine

233
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:47,410
and Jingxiong's troops an example.

234
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:53,000
How do they have the ability to set an example on behalf of your troops?

235
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,740
Beichen, you've known me for many years.

236
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,070
Do you know why I use your father that much?

237
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,510
Please tell me, I'm listening.

238
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,550
It's because of loyalty.

239
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:11,360
Haishan never said no to my orders.

240
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,580
Personal ability is very important.

241
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:17,620
But for me, loyalty is even more important.

242
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,890
If this person is very capable but not loyal enough,

243
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,640
perhaps it could be a hidden risk. What do you think?

244
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,900
Don't worry, my father is loyal to service till his death.

245
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,660
I'll always remember.

246
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:35,570
You're a smart person, and you know what I mean. I don't need to say any further.

247
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:39,040
For this matter, we've made the decision.

248
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,090
Yes.

249
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,100
Shuyi, what did your eldest sister say?

250
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,100
She said...

251
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,870
father's operation was very successful.

252
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:57,860
Brother-in-law and she are taking care of him.

253
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,610
That's great. Our entire family can be at ease.

254
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:04,960
That's right. I haven't seen Uncle Xiao and those two brats.

255
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,060
I do miss them a lot.

256
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,570
Once when Commander and those two brats are home,

257
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,340
we need to celebrate together.

258
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,180
That's great! Father's health is fully recovered,

259
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,270
it's really very happy news.

260
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,490
Madam, dinner is ready.

261
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,870
Let's have dinner.

262
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:24,270
Madam, Young Master said he has a meeting at Xiaoxi Pavilion; he won't join you for dinner.

263
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,590
What's the urgent matter?

264
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,270
Hangjing, do you know anything?

265
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,670
I'm not sure about that.

266
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,320
I heard something

267
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,420
about Governor Jin wants to deploy Young Master's Tiger Regiment.

268
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,820
Young Master and Young Master Xu are quite worried.

269
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:44,620
Commander is not home, how can this happen?

270
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,530
I hope it won't create any chaos.

271
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,500
Seventh Aunt, shall we ask Father to think of ideas?

272
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,200
Uncle Xiao just finished surgery and needs time for recovery.

273
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,730
If he hang East Main Camp over to Third Brother, that means he has faith in him.

274
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,560
We shouldn't be worried about it.

275
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,110
Hangjing, do you think so?

276
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,430
That's right.

277
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,020
Third Brother, I don't care what you think.

278
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,550
I'm very upset the more I think about it.

279
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,450
The key members of the Tiger Regiment are all the

280
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:17,130
brothers from the same school as

281
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,870
you, me, and Fox Mo.

282
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:21,010
We went to the battlefield for the first time together.

283
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,640
During those three years, we've gone through so many bloody battles.

284
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,460
When we returned to East Main Camp, Third Brother picked the top soldiers to

285
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,180
form the current Tiger Regiment.

286
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,510
I'm telling you. If you want to form another team like that,

287
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:36,440
we need another three to five years.

288
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:41,710
The joint commander is Dongping; Governor's person.

289
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:48,260
In this way, Tiger Regiment has now become part of Governor Jin's troops.

290
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,560
Governor is going to send the joint forces to Suiling.

291
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,920
On the surface, it's to station there.

292
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,470
But in fact, he wants to control the three regional borders; and also,

293
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:02,090
block off our passage to the West.

294
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:06,870
What is this? It's to threaten us with a gun to our throats.

295
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:12,380
This "one-stone-three-birds" plan is well calculated.

296
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:17,300
Third Brother. Instructor Du. Is there a way out of this?

297
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:23,240
The governor is using military power to suppress Beichen.

298
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,820
Now that he has dispatched a troop with a cause, it's not that easy to change the situation.

299
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:35,900
If there is nothing we can do, just let it go.

300
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,420
Third Brother.

301
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,840
My father isn't at East Main Camp.

302
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,450
I don't want to create unneeded problems.

303
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,580
Go enjoy your tea.

304
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,180
Are you looking for me?

305
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,350
Tell me. I'm listening.

306
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:15,580
Eldest Sister sent a telegram, saying that Father's surgery was a success.

307
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:19,620
Seventh Aunt asked me to tell you, so you don't have to worry.

308
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,310
That's great.

309
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,520
Hang—

310
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:30,440
Don't you want to say something else to me?

311
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,020
No.

312
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,980
- Why?
- Because I love Xiao Beichen.

313
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:09,010
In my heart, he's already someone

314
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:12,460
that I can commit my whole life to.

315
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:19,570
♫ The story ends with the season. Please save your goodbyes ♫

316
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:23,220
♫ The pain I suffered from the severance ♫

317
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,600
♫ Proves my deep love for you ♫

318
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:34,160
♫ Seasons come one after another. The sky is
shadowed with farewell ♫

319
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:42,860
♫ Only when the winter snow melts does the spring approach ♫

320
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,970
Good to see you.

321
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:49,440
Deputy Commander Xiao, I'm counting on you this time.

322
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,360
I'm more than happy to help with this, Manager Chen.

323
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,690
Thank you so much! I'll be waiting for the good news!

324
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:59,240
Farewell, Deputy Commander. I'll be on my way now.

325
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:36,550
Sir Mu, I don't think I'd invited you to come here.

326
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:41,910
Third Master Xiao, I'm taking over the Tiger Regiment matter.

327
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,890
Since I'm meeting you today, I'll just notify you the time.

328
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:48,410
Two days later, I'll take your people with me.

329
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,730
I understand. You can't bear it.

330
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:59,100
The trusted subordinates and elite troops you've trained for so many years,

331
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,230
will be taking orders from someone else over a night.

332
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:10,160
But the governor is your father's superior,

333
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,900
and the one who promoted the Xiao family to its position today.

334
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,240
I think even if your father were standing here,

335
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,290
he wouldn't dare say a single "no" word.

336
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,090
Mu Zizheng.

337
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:24,230
My suggestion for you is, don't play with fire.

338
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,630
These are instructions from the governor.

339
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:31,470
I'm only taking orders from him.

340
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,790
I hope Third Master Xiao will cooperate.

341
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:39,570
But I know what it's like

342
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:44,750
to be deprived of yourmost beloved thing.

343
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,900
And it's finally your turn to learn about that feeling, Third Master Xiao.

344
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,730
You're walking on the edge of a cliff.

345
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:05,120
If the governor learns that his adopted son is a member of the Youth Union,

346
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,560
what would he think?

347
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,590
You're threatening me.

348
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:16,490
Third Master Xiao, please don't forget.

349
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,440
If my identity is revealed,

350
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,010
Hangjing, and even the whole Xiao family

351
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,490
will be implicated, too.

352
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,180
Mu Zizheng.

353
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,450
You've become despicable.

354
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,020
Despicable?

355
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,460
Not at all.

356
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:38,440
The weak are the prey to the strong. Isn't that what Third Master Xiao taught me?

357
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:46,560
And back in the days, it was so easy for you to point your gun towards my head.

358
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,310
That's not a pretty scene.

359
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:04,340
Tell me. If people see it,

360
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:09,900
wouldn't they think that Third Master Xiao was not satisfied with the governor's deployment,

361
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:12,660
and is trying to make it hard for me on purpose?

362
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,810
I let you borrow some "guts." Let's see if you dare.

363
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,240
Okay.

364
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:35,530
If that's the case, two days later,

365
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,670
I'll personally be present at the East Main Camp

366
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:40,710
to complete all the transfer processes.

367
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:42,810
We'll see what happens.

368
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,860
Goodbye.

369
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:04,910
Miss Fengqi, Director Sato sent a basket of flowers again.

like a secret love affair between a mysterious businessman and an actress.

375

Old love is always unforgettable, and an old lover is the hardest to say goodbye to.

To the future Madam of the Beixin City.

377
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:36,200
Call him, and tell him I'll invite him to dinner sometime.

378
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,620
Okay.

379
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,820
Salute!

380
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,000
Over.

381
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:52,110
Deputy Commander Xiao, here's the handover document.

382
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:56,150
Today, I'll be taking away your Tiger Regiment.

383
00:29:56,150 --> 00:30:01,210
But... rest assured. When Governor receives your elite troops,

384
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:04,280
the governor won't neglect them.

385
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,480
From today on, the 33rd Regiment of the Ying Army

386
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,500
will become the 32nd Regiment under Governor Jing,

387
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,930
and will be managed by the Governor's Office.

388
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:20,360
Listen to my orders! Move ahead!

389
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:34,530
What do you mean?

390
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,680
You're openly disobeying orders.

391
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,590
The governor gave you every soldier and every weapon.

392
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:47,950
If you disobey the orders, you are rebels!

393
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,810
What are you doing?

394
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:07,680
What are you doing? Put down the guns!

395
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,930
Loyal soldiers will never serve a different owner!

396
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,680
If the governor has to take away the Tiger Regiment,

397
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,240
we would rather commit suicide!

398
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,780
What's happening here?

399
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:43,100
Governor, the Tiger Regiment is publicly disobeying orders.

400
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:51,880
Is that the military discipline that the East Main Camp has taught them?

401
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,500
Disobeying military orders,

402
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,080
do you know the consequences?

403
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,210
Anyone who disobeys military orders will be executed!

404
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:08,950
Deputy Commander Xiao, please give your orders.

405
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:13,540
We won't leave the East Main Camp even if we have to die.

406
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:26,020
Governor, it is my fault that I hadn't trained my soldiers well.

407
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,440
- Third Brother.
- I am willing to be punished.

408
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,240
Wait!

409
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,950
Governor Jin, this is all a misunderstanding.

410
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:16,640
To go against an order by being held at gunpoint, you call this misunderstanding?

411
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,850
I'm the team leader of the Tiger Regiment.

412
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:24,270
They cannot leave East Main Camp because it's my order.

413
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:26,000
What do you mean?

414
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:33,050
I personally asked every one of them to sign off a death waiver.

415
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,730
Please take a look.

416
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:48,620
Mo Weiyi, how dare you?

417
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:53,260
You signed a death waiver with the soldiers under the table? That's against military law.

418
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:58,060
I know. That's why I didn't tell Deputy Commander Xiao.

419
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:02,290
I'll take full responsibility as this was my idea.

420
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:05,090
Governor Jin, please punish me.

421
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:09,190
Good.

422
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:13,760
Governor, Weiyi's mistake, I am willing to take on the blame.

423
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,680
How can you take the blame when you don't even know?

424
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:20,740
- Mo Weiyi!
- You personally signed the death waiver with the soldiers.

425
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:24,190
This is against military rules, and I can execute you right here.

426
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:36,450
Governor!

427
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:49,900
Governor, Weiyi has been with me and won numerous battles.

428
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:54,600
Consider this his first time, please give him a chance.

429
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:30,230
Beichen, you and I are family.

430
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,600
Everybody, this is the first time Beichen has managed the East Main Camp.

431
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:41,660
I'm here today to award him.

432
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:46,850
However, for Mo Weiyi, he violated military order.

433
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:52,250
Mo Weiyi, because of Xiao Beichen,

434
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:56,070
I'm letting you go this time.

435
00:35:56,070 --> 00:36:00,140
But you need to remember there won't be a second chance.

436
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:07,180
Fine three months' worth of salary and strip his honors

437
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,600
- as punishment.
- Yes!

438
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,590
I'll remember.

439
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:20,530
Governor, I'm sorry for today's incident.

440
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:24,840
I'll deploy the 1st Regiment 2nd Division to you, it won't delay the joint military exercise.

441
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,660
Good.

442
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:33,910
Beichen, I'll be at ease if you're leading the troops.

443
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,030
Come up now.

444
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:21,890
I cannot believe Xiao Beichen's army can be so tough.

445
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:25,760
Half-way through this Mo Weiyi killed everything, which totally ruined our plan.

446
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:31,100
They realized that I cannot take drastic actions in Beixin City.

447
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:35,970
Foster Father, I'm sorry I didn't do a good job. Please punish me.

448
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:41,160
I don't blame you for this. No matter who goes, we wouldn't have been able to take the troops away.

449
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:45,550
What I'm worried about is Xiao Beichen's soldiers,

450
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:48,520
because of him, they're willing to sacrifice their lives.

451
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,090
That's the scariest.

452
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:57,320
Foster Father, if we can't confiscate their Tiger Regiment, what shall we do next?

453
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,080
We promised to have the military exercise for three months.

454
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:04,940
Although we didn't get the Tiger Regiment, Beichen still gave us

455
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:10,780
the 1st Regiment, 2nd Division. We need to carry on with the military exercise and do it well.

456
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,890
- Understood.
- You guys should head back first.

457
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:15,540
Got it.

458
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,340
Third Brother.

459
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:51,070
Third Brother, do you still remember when we were young, whenever we argued

460
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:55,360
and had conflicts, we would naturally come to this place.

461
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,900
We told each other what bothered us the most.

462
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:03,920
Weiyi, thank you.

463
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:08,020
I know that for today's matter,

464
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:11,060
you put your own life on the betting table in order to protect me.

465
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:19,160
Third Brother, you don't need to thank me.

466
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,580
I should be the one who apologizes to you.

467
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:26,930
It's because of my father's situation, I blamed you for so long.

468
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,690
It's because of your father's death, that you were under a lot of stress.

469
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:38,890
No matter what he did to my family,

470
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:41,850
he was still your closest and dearest person;

471
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:44,360
he was your father.

472
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:47,660
When you were young, you looked the most carefree,

473
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:51,710
but in fact, you had been protecting me and Zijun.

474
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:56,160
Every time when we made a mistake, you were the one who took the blame.

475
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:11,920
We were young and crazy,

476
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,930
I felt like there were nothing we couldn't get.

477
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,890
Later when we grew up,

478
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:24,090
I realized that...

479
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,420
there is no such word as "easy" in this world.

480
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:32,860
Nothing on earth is as simple as we thought.

481
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,800
Sometimes, protecting someone I care about,

482
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:39,180
it's very hard to achieve.

483
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:42,630
I want to become a mountain sometimes,

484
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,380
as solid as rock.

485
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:02,060
You forgot, we still have this thing.

486
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:14,610
Third Brother, no matter what we'll encounter in the future,

487
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:17,120
Zijun and I...

488
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,060
will always be next to you.

489
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:24,550
Three of us will be connected in one line.

490
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:45,400
My Lady, can you call this double happiness?

491
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,570
Our Young Master kept his troops,

492
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:51,090
and also reconciled with Young Master Mo.

493
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:57,470
It's amazing.

494
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:01,770
I haven't seen our lady smile for a very long time.

495
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:09,230
Should I tell Young Master this piece of news?

496
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:13,170
Jinxiang, you're becoming a smooth talker now.

497
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:19,020
Lady, people said the more you care about someone, the more anxious you are.

498
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:23,060
I can see that Young Master did this because he cares about you.

499
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,630
Shall we take his happy occasion

500
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:28,830
to reconcile with Young Master?

501
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:32,650
Jin Xiang, you don't understand.

502
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,110
Okay, okay, okay. I don't understand.

503
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:39,550
I see you still care about Young Master.

504
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:42,790
Jin Xiang, if you keep on talking,

505
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:45,060
I'll pay no attention to you forever.

506
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,720
Fine. I'll stop talking.

507
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,000
- Shall I prepare something for you to eat?
- Okay.

508
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:15,460
♫ Who is looking forward to the spring breeze? ♫

509
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:20,650
♫ Who is staring at the moving flowers? ♫

510
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:25,930
♫ Who is watching the galaxy in the summer night ♫

511
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:32,360
♫ Who remembers a shooting star going by in a moment? ♫

512
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:38,080
♫ Who is afraid of heartbreak, denies the heartbeat? ♫

513
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:43,190
♫ Allow loneliness to smear the other’s protective coloration ♫

514
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:48,460
♫ Who would be willing to pass the other like this ♫

515
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:55,370
♫ I also want to be a shooting star to make you warm ♫

516
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:02,490
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

517
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:08,090
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

518
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:13,760
♫ At least the flight will be smooth ♫

519
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:19,400
♫ Waiting for a promise my whole life ♫

520
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:24,950
♫ I cherish even the short-lived happiness ♫

521
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:30,640
♫ Leave some tenderness to the years ♫

522
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:36,310
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

523
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:41,860
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫

524
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:47,510
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

525
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:52,980
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

526
00:44:52,980 --> 00:45:03,080
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

527
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:13,800
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫
