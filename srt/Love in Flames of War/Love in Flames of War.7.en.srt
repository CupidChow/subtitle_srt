00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,920
[Episode 7]

21
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,000
How come he has this figurine?

22
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,390
This has been Beichen's favorite since he was a child.

23
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,430
Seventh Aunt, do you know the story of this figurine?

24
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,820
Do you remember I told you about Beichen's mother?

25
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,590
She died a long time ago.

26
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,920
Beichen was seven years old that year.

27
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,390
The commander sent someone to pick them up and bring them to Beixin.

28
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,140
They hadn't seen each other for five years.

29
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,620
When they moved here, the commander was busy and didn't have time to take care of them.

30
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,970
On her birthday, Commander promised

31
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,790
to see her performance.

32
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,490
But because of military business, he was delayed.

33
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,310
In the end, Commander didn't show up

34
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,980
and she died under the enemy's bullet.

35
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,320
At that moment, if it wasn't for First Madam

36
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,080
protecting Beichen under her embrace,

37
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,690
Beichen would have died long ago.

38
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,590
Then,

39
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,700
what happened?

40
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:35,620
Later, First Madam was shot.

41
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:42,000
I heard Beichen had taken out all the filling from his jacket

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,840
and tried to stop the bleeding on her wound.

43
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,590
But it didn't stop the blood.

44
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:55,240
She then died before midnight.

45
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,140
Commander still couldn't make it back on time.

46
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,160
Poor Beichen,

47
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,750
a seven-year-old child,

48
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,870
he was hugging his mother's body all night.

49
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,170
He wouldn't let go of it. He kept crying and saying

50
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,410
"Mother is not dead.

51
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:24,240
Mother is just tired, she is sleeping.

52
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,970
When Mother awakes,

53
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,200
we still need to watch the opera together."

54
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,020
From then on, Third Master's temper changed.

55
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,200
He always went against the commander.

56
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:44,690
He's just a child who lost his mom at a young age.

57
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,020
Who can really understand that?

58
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,420
Boss Jiu wants to give you a small gift.

59
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,440
When we built the orphanage, weren't we short of a lot of funds?

60
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,790
Boss Jiu donated it.

61
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,520
Third Brother.

62
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,410
Today, our training topic is the obstacle course.

63
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,340
I'm going to demonstrate next.

64
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,290
Are you okay, Third Brother?

65
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,830
- Did you do that?
- Who else?

66
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,340
Hold it still.

67
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,420
I'm so happy today.

68
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,850
Didn't you see his face turn green?

69
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,670
I'm telling you... We're only using a few of our tricks.

70
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,910
If we use all of them...

71
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,740
Instructor Du. No... No...

72
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,670
We might be all male, but you can't be peeking at us taking showers.

73
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,150
Mo Weiyi! Xu Zijun! Come out!

74
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,140
You two are going to the watchtower to do the overnight shift.

75
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,960
No... No… Instructor Du, to stand sentry overnight...

76
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,880
We're new here, it should be assigned to the seniors.

77
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,410
That's right.

78
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:56,350
New members are great. They have unlimited strength.

79
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:00,520
Instead of doing bad things, it's better to do some proper things.

80
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,610
Report!

81
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,360
I volunteer to stand sentry with them.

82
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,470
I knew you had that attitude,

83
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,760
such a loyal friend.

84
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,740
Even Instructor Du has to listen to you, isn't that so?

85
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,700
Did you see that? His face turned green.

86
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,320
Of course.

87
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,680
We're not afraid as long as we're with Third Brother.

88
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,380
"Duzhi Society Announcement.

89
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,880
In order to extend our vision and exchange knowledge,

90
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,580
those who are interested are invited to participate in the reading event held by the Society on a regular basis.

91
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,900
The goal is to have discussions that can sparkle ideas,

92
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,860
allow us to reflect on our times, enhance ourselves, and study together."

93
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,560
Hangjing, you must be interested. Right?

94
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,520
The point of reading is to exchange ideas with others, so we don't get stuck in our own ideas.

95
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,760
I think this is a great event.

96
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,900
- We can go together!
- Great!

97
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,440
So disappointing. I was expecting something like a dance event.

98
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,540
Right. How boring it is for a group of strangers to get together just to read.

99
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,060
You read all day. I can't believe you're still not bored.

100
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,180
You don't even have the guts to attend the Reading Society. You're hardly a woman of the new era.

101
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,560
Hey, this woman of the new era is ready for a fight.

102
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,540
Who knows if you're going there for the purpose of reading, or to get to know boys and date?

103
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,440
- You...
- Exactly.

104
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,360
There's nothing wrong with dating.

105
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,220
Lin Hangjing, what are you talking about? You really have no shame.

106
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:37,230
If you meet a like-minded person and you appreciate each other, what's wrong with dating?

107
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:42,090
The dancing event is freedom. Reading is freedom. Dating is also freedom.

108
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,000
Hangjing, well said!

109
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,390
Lin Hangjing, you're going against me on purpose, aren't you?

110
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:51,940
I'm just stating my opinion. It's okay if you don't accept it. It's your freedom.

111
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,670
Okay, okay, let's go.

112
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:56,650
We won't delay them from attending the dance event.

113
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,010
What? These two people are...

114
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:01,760
Shuyi, your family member Hangjing is being too bold!

115
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,290
I've said it so many times. She's not my family! Not my family!

116
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,420
But I think she was so cool just now.

117
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,190
What did you say?

118
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,040
That Crazy Du is wicked!

119
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,830
On the surface, he's not doing anything to us.

120
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,600
But in secret, he's torturing us to death.

121
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,140
Third Brother, it's such a cold day today.

122
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,580
Yeah. It's so cold tonight.

123
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,550
Here's the plan. You guys wait here for a second.

124
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,030
I'll go back to the room and bring the two quilts here.

125
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,880
Thank you, Third Brother.

126
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,900
Just say whatever you want. Why are you staring at me like that?

127
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,230
Come closer.

128
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,470
Isn't there a canteen nearby?

129
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,100
Canteen?

130
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,350
Why do you need a canteen?

131
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,380
I'm the canteen myself, I'm telling you.

132
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,770
- Reliable.
- Thinking on the same page.

133
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,520
Of course!

134
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,810
This is called "in tune with each other."

135
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,940
The two of us!

136
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,190
We can eat when Third Brother comes back.

137
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,900
- Okay?
- Yeah, of course.

138
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,150
We can cook it first and wait until Third Brother comes back.

139
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,060
Move this inside.

140
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,990
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay. It just burned my finger.

141
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,640
Let's carry on.

142
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,010
It's cooked.

143
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,230
Okay, I'm going to start eating.

144
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,100
Let's wait until Third Brother gets here.

145
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,240
It's hot.

146
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,120
Of course, it's hot. It's just cooked.

147
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,110
I wasn't talking about the corn.

148
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,500
It's my bottom.

149
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,260
Your bottom?

150
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,800
Now that you said so, my bottom feels like it's burning too.

151
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,860
Oh my, a fire!

152
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,850
Hurry!

153
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,610
- Third Brother.
- Third Brother.

154
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,870
- Third Brother, what are we going to do now?
- It's on fire.

155
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,340
What did you do?

156
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,990
We fell asleep.

157
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,710
What are you doing? Put out the fire!

158
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,900
But how, Third Brother?

159
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,430
Fire! Fire!

160
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,810
Come on! Hurry!

161
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,050
Hurry!

162
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,750
- We're done for.
- Don't panic.

163
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,230
Come on!

164
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,690
We need more water!

165
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,300
Hurry!

166
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,920
Any news?

167
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,470
Starting an unauthorized fire is forbidden at the military school.

168
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:42,740
And the sentry tower has been burned down. People who caused it will be severely punished.

169
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,300
We know there's severe punishment.

170
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,910
I want to hear the details!

171
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,760
It's said at least ten whips.

172
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,310
What? Ten whips?

173
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,090
I can barely take one.

174
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,820
I don't believe

175
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,010
they dare whip the first son of Commander Xiao.

176
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,460
Yeah.

177
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,870
Shut up, you!

178
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,610
Even if others won't, Crazy Du will.

179
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,460
It looks serious.

180
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,270
No matter what happens

181
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,980
or how painful it is, we have to hold our heads up.

182
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,400
I—

183
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,130
What's he doing?

184
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,790
I don't know.

185
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,840
Third Brother.

186
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,140
From Class 3, Semester 5, Xiao Beichen,

187
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,640
Mo Weiyi, and Xu Zijun

188
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,600
started an unauthorized fire and burned down the sentry tower.

189
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,930
They're supposed to receive the punishment of ten whips each.

190
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,490
Du Heng, the instructor for Class 3 Semester 5

191
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,880
takes responsibility for the lack of supervision and guidance.

192
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,560
He volunteers to take the punishment himself for the students.

193
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,430
He'll receive thirty whips in total.

194
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,170
Execute!

195
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,540
I think we're here.

196
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,400
[Study Group of Aspiration]

197
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,520
Hello, everyone. Not long ago,

198
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,800
Sir Lu Xu published Lunatic's Diary on New Youth.

199
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,880
This is the first published novel written in a common language.

200
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,000
Feel free to share your thoughts after reading the novel.

201
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,100
I think the purpose of this novel is to

202
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,180
attack the feudal family system

203
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,630
and reveal the harms the feudal hierarchy has done to people.

204
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,690
Sir Lu Xu calls on people to

205
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:01,140
overthrow the inhumane system.

206
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,350
I have a different opinion.

207
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,710
In my opinion, the crazy person in the novel is a persecutory delusional patient.

208
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:09,340
He thinks everyone around him wants to do him harm. He's been driven crazy by his own imagination.

209
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,560
There are many heretical people in history

210
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,330
- who were seen as crazy as they overthrew the old tradition.
- Hangjing,

211
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,830
- what do you think of the novel?
- What can crazy people do?

212
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,880
- I think the purpose of Sir Lu Xu is to...
- When there's only one person who's right...

213
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,910
- tell the people not to be onlookers.
- they'll be seen as crazy.

214
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,070
- Onlookers? What do you mean?
- But this crazy man is the only one that sees the truth.

215
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,470
- But if his opinions are wrong...
- You two! You two!

216
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,880
Sit first. Sit first.

217
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,090
Zizheng, what do you think?

218
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,620
I don't think this novel

219
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:46,090
is about persecution.

220
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:48,750
Of course, it's not a diary written by a lunatic.

221
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,510
What it's really about is to express how much the author hates people being mere onlookers.

222
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:56,480
You share the same view.

223
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,440
As for the feudal hierarchy

224
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,030
and feudal family system,

225
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,540
Sir created this lunatic

226
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,180
to stop people from being silent and onlookers.

227
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:10,620
He hopes the determination and rebellious spirit of a lunatic

228
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,770
can call on people's awareness,

229
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:17,620
anger, dissatisfaction, hatred, and anxiety.

230
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,870
However, these sentiments are of no use

231
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:23,210
if people do not act. Action is the only drive

232
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,430
that can bring changes.

233
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:28,910
Without action, they can only be seen as a lunatic.

234
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,800
People who are brave to act

235
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,550
are the revolutionaries who will overthrow feudalism.

236
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,890
What kind of future we will have

237
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,710
is determined by what we do right now.

238
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,880
Well said!

239
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,330
Bravo!

240
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,200
His view is the same as ours.

241
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,020
What an honor!

242
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,040
They're the students from Shengyi Girls School.

243
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,980
Shengyi Girls School?

244
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,560
Students at that school are all from rich families.

245
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,720
This is a place for new literature and politics.

246
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,710
It's a place for fairness, justice, and freedom.

247
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,600
Ladies like you who live a luxurious life

248
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,580
may never understand them.

249
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,590
Since you mentioned fairness,

250
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,140
freedom, and justice,

251
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,540
then first you need to break through hierarchy.

252
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,220
But as far as I'm concerned,

253
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,350
you have placed people in the level they belong to.

254
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,450
You sound like a guy who holds onto hierarchy.

255
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,220
I—

256
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,580
We're all here to share our views.

257
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,650
I hope more people can join us.

258
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,310
I hope to see more different views discussed here.

259
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:35,290
I welcome the students from Shengyi Girls School.

260
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,510
Welcome.

261
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,170
Thank you, everyone.

262
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,370
So, are you and the guys who were at the lecture

263
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,480
all students from Dacheng Boys School?

264
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,790
I'm not a student.

265
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,400
I work at my uncle's kite workshop.

266
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,620
In my free time, I go to Dacheng Boys School to listen to their lectures.

267
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,880
That's how I know them.

268
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,000
It must be hard to

269
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,810
work and study at the same time.

270
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,900
Work is the way to making a living.

271
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,240
Studying is the way to equipping my mind.

272
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,370
Working and studying go side by side.

273
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,000
Hangjing.

274
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,010
My uncle's kite shop is on the second block on the Xi'er Alley. Would you like to visit it?

275
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,550
Some other day. I'm a little busy today.

276
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:23,520
Sure. You're welcome to visit our shop anytime.

277
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,640
Okay.

278
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,240
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

279
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:25,370
Why aren't you in bed? It's late now.

280
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,030
Principal Luo.

281
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,020
Xiao Beichen, you have broken another rule.

282
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,340
Tell me what's bothering you.

283
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,850
We're the ones who made the mistake.

284
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,760
But Instructor Du...

285
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,200
Is this what it's for?

286
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,810
You really are children.

287
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:57,500
You don't understand

288
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,310
Instructor Du's efforts at all.

289
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:03,730
To you, Du Heng is your instructor.

290
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,480
When you make mistakes,

291
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,360
he punishes you.

292
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,160
However, outside your squad,

293
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,480
you are all his soldiers.

294
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,490
He takes full responsibility for the mistakes you make.

295
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:18,840
He is the first person who should take punishment.

296
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,660
It's no different when it's on the battlefield.

297
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,200
Soldiers don't make mistakes.

298
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,910
Generals are the ones who bear the consequences of the mistakes they make.

299
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:32,650
In the hands of a general, there are thousands of lives

300
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:35,230
and the fate of countless people.

301
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,620
I understand now. He was teaching us a lesson.

302
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,420
That's right.

303
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,710
Du Heng is a qualified talent to become a general.

304
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:52,240
He can teach you guys a lot, and can also help you a lot.

305
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,160
I believe you've seen that

306
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,110
he is covered in scars.

307
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:02,770
Yes, I have. I guess he got them from the battlefields.

308
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:09,230
Instrcutor Du has won many battles.

309
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,520
He has also been defeated many times.

310
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,380
But for soldiers, victories and defeats

311
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,190
are equally valuable.

312
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:22,000
To be honest, many military officers

313
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,610
have come here to offer him a promotion and a pay raise.

314
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:30,740
But Instructor Du has never been waivered by those things.

315
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:34,760
He puts his heart into training the students here.

316
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:39,640
Other instructors mainly teach the students

317
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,180
practical skills.

318
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,650
But he's different.

319
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:48,550
He spends a long time telling students

320
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:51,700
the reasons why we fight wars.

321
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:56,260
As he usually says, "Weapons are used to stop fights.

322
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:59,440
Wars are never the ultimate purpose."

323
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,990
It's a means that we can put a stop to turmoil in a short time.

343
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,620
In Oliver Twist,

344
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,890
Dickens, a renowned British author,

345
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:36,350
revealed many issues in society at that time,

346
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,210
such as dark alms houses,

347
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:41,340
labor, teenagers in crime, etc.

348
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,590
It's written in a manner of dark humor and sarcasm.

349
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:47,220
The book condemns hypocrisy at the time.

350
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:51,110
It's a book very worth reading.

351
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:54,490
We've learned a lot from Mr. Cao's analysis and recommendation.

352
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:57,290
As usual, you need to make notes while you read the book at home.

353
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:59,500
We will have a discussion when we next gather.

354
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,630
See you all next time.

355
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:03,550
Goodbye.

356
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,190
Let's go.

357
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,450
Let's go.

358
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,580

368

Goodbye.

Let's go.

370
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,660
Hangjing, we need to be somewhere.

371
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,770
- See you.
- See you.

372
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:45,590
Hangjing, I think

373
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,430
we need to come here often.

374
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:51,210
Not only can we learn knowledge, but we can also meet new people,

375
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:54,890
especially the boy who lent you the eraser.

376
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,670
Chengyu, what are you talking about?

377
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,620
I saw it all. Admit it.

378
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,810
What did you see?

379
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:02,050
I saw you staring at each other.

380
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,150
Chengyu!

381
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,750
I'm kidding with you.

382
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,720
However, I've never seen a guy

383
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,010
as considerate as Mu Zizheng.

384
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:14,970
Do you know? He used to be a young master, too.

385
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:19,150
His father used to be a painter for the royal family during the Qing Dynasty.

386
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:22,220
However, he got addicted to opium and spent all his fortune.

387
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,630
Then he died afterward.

388
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,940
How do you know all this?

389
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,410
I heard it from a guy in the group.

390
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:31,210
He has been living with his mother all these years.

391
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,070
His family is too poor to send him to school.

392
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:36,260
That's why he goes to school and listens to lectures in his free time.

393
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,650
Did you see the kites in the basket on his back?

394
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,970
I heard he drew them by himself.

395
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,970
Though his father died early,

396
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:45,470
he inherited the talent of painting.

397
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:49,890
In a way, his father taught him the means to make a living.

398
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,470
I didn't know his family

399
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:58,250
had been through such a tragedy.

400
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,290
I wish boys and girls could go to the same school.

401
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:04,780
Then we could know more good boys

402
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,340
so that we could live up to people's expectations.

403
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:13,220
Hangjing, what are you thinking about?

404
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,330
Nothing.

405
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,110
I agree with you.

406
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,430
I knew I was right.

407
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,100
Huyang Pass is the first military fortress south of the Great Wall.

408
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,510
Yang Gongcheng has formed an army of

409
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,570
20,000 people on the south border of Zhibei.

410
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:37,470
They have already started shelling our border garrison.

411
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:41,150
Just now, Governor Jin sent us an urgent order.

412
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:45,750
He has ordered us to defend Huyang Pass at all costs,

413
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,190
because Qingshan iron mine

414
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:51,030
is an important source of finance for the Zhibei Region.

415
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,920
We cannot let it fall in the hands of Yang Gongcheng.

416
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,460
What I heard was that Governor Jin didn't plan to

417
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,940
send us there. How come he changed his mind all a sudden?

418
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,440
I guess it will be our soldiers who will be dispatched. What does he want?

419
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,470
The way I see it is that he treats Ying Army as a suicide squad.

420
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:10,380
Commander, we can't just submit to a death trap like that.

421
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,900
That's right. If we win, the land will be theirs.

422
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,430
If we lose, it'll be our men who lost their lives.

423
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,600
Orders are orders.

424
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,000
It's not your first day as military men, is that right?

425
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:28,990
Commander, who are you planning to send then?

426
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,060
Commander, I'll do whatever you say.

427
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,740
I'd give up my life to defend Huyang Pass.

428
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,880
Keep your life I'm telling you!

429
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,870
Come back intact!

430
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,220
Yes.

431
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,490
That's settled. Go and get ready.

432
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:49,430
- Yes.
- Yes.

433
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:51,500
Let's go.

434
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:11,820
The student who achieved the highest total grade this time is

435
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,020
Xiao Beichen from Class Three of Fifth Semester.

436
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,760
We won!

437
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,100
Instructor Du, you don't need to worry anymore.

438
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,430
They're still a couple of brats.

439
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:55,380
This has just started.

440
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,540
You all have behaved quite nice today.

441
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,470
Here's a reward for you from the school.

442
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:21,620
It's a rare opportunity. You can relax!

443
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,160
Yay!

444
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,510
Yay!

445
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,480
Hey.

446
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,920
It's just a bottle of drinking water. He's tasting it like a 30-year-old aged wine.

447
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,570
Drinking water? Third Brother, smell it.

448
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,580
Wow!

449
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,320
Where did you get it?

450
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,760
Oh my god.

451
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,760
Really? Where did you get it?

452
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,240
- You want it? You're not going to get it.
- Third Brother!

453
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,300
Third Brother! Please!

454
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,210
I'll just take a sip! Just one sip! Okay?

455
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,130
You're lying! You always lie to me.

456
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:44,860
This is called "getting drunk without any wine."

457
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:50,490
“To invite the moon, I raise my cup. We're three, as my shadow shows up.”

458
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:53,770
Young Masters, I can't believe you're reciting poems.

459
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:58,090
I‘m not an expert in literature. But I'll recite a few lines as well.

460
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:01,720
“Birds dwell in a tree by a pond.

461
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,280
A monk knocks at the door under the moon.” How's this?

462
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,330
- Great poem!
- Good for you!

463
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,420
I'll recite a poem as well.

464
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,360
“If you're forever shone clear and bright,

465
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,250
I’ll give you warmth despite snow and ice.”

466
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,550
- How's that?
- Such a great poem!

467
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,370
I thought of one as well.

468
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:20,580
Forget it.

469
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,590
It will be dawn before you can think of a poem.

470
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,910
Hey! I do have one!

471
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,330
"The moon is so full... that it looks like steamed bread.

472
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,560
I'll eat two for dinner, but that's not enough!"

473
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,520
How's that? Applaud for me!

474
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,310
Good poem!

475
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:44,360
Look how coarse they are.

476
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,690
They're such coarse people.

477
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:50,330
But then again, we're very lucky to have Xiao Douzi in our class.

478
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:52,990
Little Bean fixes all our clothes. Isn't that right?

479
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:55,320
Brothers, you've all been so nice to me.

480
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:00,320
I... haven't been to school. And I'm not good at using weapons.

481
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,590
I can help fix your clothes,

482
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:05,160
I can help fix your clothes and be of help to you!

483
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,000
Your body build is not fit for being a soldier.

484
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,860
Right? What did you want to do before you came here?

485
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,750
Back in my hometown, my father and mother

486
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:17,170
had a tailor shop. So I wanted to be a tailor since I was a kid.

487
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:19,890
In the future, after I receive my salary from the army,

488
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:23,390
I will make a beautiful wedding dress for my older sister.

489
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,590
So she can have a magnificent wedding.

490
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:28,630
Great! We'll all keep it in mind.

491
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:32,160
After we graduate, all our clothes

492
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,930
will all be made by you!

493
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:37,410
- No problem! Thank you, Third Brother!
- What are you talking about, Third Brother?

494
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:40,370
Xiao Douzi makes wedding dresses!

495
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:44,730
If you want him to make clothes for you, you have to get a wife first.

496
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:47,640
Don't you have a chick at home?

497
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,010
What do you mean, a chick?

498
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:54,490
I've got a real beauty at home!

499
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:59,290
But you do have a pig at home.

500
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,850
You...

501
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:07,430
Who are you talking about? Do you want to die?

502
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:11,630
Stop! Don't make me fall! Please!

503
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:21,390
[Kite Shop]

504
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:25,000
Auntie, what happened? Here, let me help you get up.

505
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:27,690
Let me help you.

506
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:36,290
- Where is your home?
It's right in front.

507
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,670
Mother!

508
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,030
Zizheng?

509
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,830
Hangjing?

510
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,250
Are you feeling better?

511
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,150
Yes.

512
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,990
You know each other?

513
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:21,330
Mother, Miss Hangjing is a member of our Society.

514
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:26,100
What a coincidence!

515
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:30,980
Miss Hangjing, why don't you stay here for a meal together?

516
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,770
It's okay, Auntie. You're not feeling well today.

517
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,520
I'll say goodbye now.

518
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,460
I'll come back to visit you another day.

519
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:41,220
It's okay, I'm feeling better now.

520
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:45,110
I must cook some of my best dishes to thank you.

521
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:48,230
Hangjing, do stay.

522
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:52,700
You helped my mom. My mom can cook some food to show her gratitude.

523
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:58,020
Well then... okay. Thank you, Aunt.

524
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:00,520
Here's a few topics. Please take a look.

525
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,550
Hangjing, the food is ready.

526
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:27,950
Did you take all these photos?

527
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,630
Yes.

528
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,510
It's you!

529
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:37,000
You submitted those photos to the First Society Newspaper, right?

530
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,800
How do you know?

531
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,660
Of course, I know. My first column was written

532
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:45,190
based on a topic that comes from your photos.

533
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,290
So you're Qing Yong!

534
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:51,400
That article was quite enlightening!

535
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,310
It was a call for action to people from all walks of life to help children in need.

536
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:58,250
I rarely see any homeless children when I go out of the city gate now.

537
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,560
It's all thanks for the materials you provided.

538
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,120
Your photos were able to impact the readers more intuitively. And they inspired me, too.

539
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,930
I wish we had met earlier!

540
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:10,390
Do you know? Later on, the newspaper promoted donation and charity sales.

541
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:14,860
The new orphanage has been built. It is now home to many children.

542
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,290
Head of the orphanage Mr. Zhang is now finding people to paint the murals.

543
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:20,170
I was actually here to talk to you about this. Are you willing to do it?

544
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:22,400
No problem. When should I go?

545
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,800
Next week will do.

546
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,080
- Okay. It's a deal.
- Okay.

547
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,550
- Report!
- Come in.

548
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,030
What is it?

549
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,960
Commander, I heard that Xinping Military School

550
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,790
- is sending all of the fifth cohorts to the Huyang Stronghold.
- Yes.

551
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:47,340
Students of the Military School are soldiers, too.

552
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:50,660
It's normal that they'd be fighting on the battlefield.

553
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,530
Was this your proposal or Governor Jin's idea?

554
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:55,070
Why do you ask?

555
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:57,560
The Cheng Army is launching a forceful attack at the Huyang Stronghold.

556
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,360
It was a hard battle for us. It was difficult to keep the stronghold.

557
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,030
And Third Master is also in that cohort.

558
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:05,350
Isn't he a soldier?

559
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,770
- But...
- There's nothing to worry about.

560
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:13,120
They won't be sent directly to the frontline.

561
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,990
They'll just be working in the logistics at most.

562
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,020
Third Master should be tempered with some hardships.

563
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:26,420
As for you.

564
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:30,840
You can go there to oversee and watch over

565
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:34,920
how he's doing. Don't treat him specially.

566
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,620
Okay, I understand.

567
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:10,420
♫ Who is looking forward to the spring breeze? ♫

568

572
