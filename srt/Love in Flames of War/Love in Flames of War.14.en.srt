[Episode 14]

21
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:47,060
Third Master Xiao, I really don't quite understand you.

22
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,150
You‘re acting as if you're returning good for evil.

23
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,660
But you're just trying to save Lin Tangsheng.

24
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,920
Why do you make it

25
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,330
sound so noble?

26
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,970
You're right.

27
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,410
It's true that I came here today to save Lin Tangsheng.

28
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,560
But to tell you the truth,

29
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,460
everything I told you today was from the bottom of my heart.

30
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:32,060
Besides, I brought a small gift for you.

31
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,590
Bring it in.

32
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,850
This is...

33
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,200
Governor, take a look at it.

34
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,990
This bonsai. How is it?

35
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:07,080
This pine tree looks as if it's standing on steep hills.

36
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,140
It looks robust and powerful, quite impressive.

37
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,630
Then, do you know what it represents?

38
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,580
It's just trees and flowers to be

39
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,320
trimmed to our liking.

40
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,480
Governor, as you can see,

41
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,360
no matter how robust

42
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,550
and impressive it is,

43
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,760
it's just a tree in a pot.

44
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,230
We can just easily destroy it with such minimal effort.

45
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,110
Isn't this like what we are like now?

46
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,890
We close our doors, pretending to be the emperor.

47
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,410
But if the country is in turmoil, then our families will be unsettled, too.

48
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,490
No matter how powerful we are, with just the smallest effort,

49
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,780
we can be destroyed just like this tree.

50
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,370
Third Master Xiao, you have great foresight.

51
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,430
But I just want to stay in my territory...

52
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,840
and live a simple life.

53
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,790
No, you don't.

54
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:29,300
You put Lin Tangsheng in an important position to develop the economy. He has different political opinions from you,

55
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,170
but you still didn't kill him. Why?

56
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:37,690
Because you're waiting. You're waiting for the day when the unrest ends in the country.

57
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,280
The country will definitely put someone like him to good use.

58
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,790
So, Governor Cheng,

59
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,500
what you value isn't the present,

60
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,860
it's the future and hope.

61
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,980
We have never met,

62
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,190
but you understand me.

63
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:16,400
Remember to bring me a new pot next time.

64
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:22,360
But next time I'm not going to bring you a pot of this.

65
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,320
I will bring you a clivia.

66
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,860
You brat!

67
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,000
Governor Cheng asked us to wait a few more days, but he didn't give us a clear response.

68
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,170
Third Brother, we just leave like this?

69
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,930
Are you sure he won't go back on his word?

70
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,760
I'm not sure.

71
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,780
I can only bet on my judgment of him.

72
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,290
By the way.

73
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,710
Before we get a clear answer about Uncle Lin,

74
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,650
don't let anyone know about it.

75
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,510
- Okay.
- Okay.

happened to your father.

80
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,190
I really don't know what to do right now.

81
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,190
Even Uncle Xiao couldn't save my dad.

82
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,920
Don't cry, Hangjing.

83
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,610
There might still be a chance.

84
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:02,970
I just talked to every one of my father's friends. I asked for help from everyone I could.

85
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:06,220
No one is willing to help me.

86
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,960
But, Zizheng, there's no way that my father faked the accounts.

87
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,340
He was falsely accused!

88
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:17,500
No, I can't wait here every day anymore. I'm going to go save my father.

89
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,940
Hangjing, where are you going?

90
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,970
I'm going back to Yulin.

91
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,190
There are wars and dangers everywhere along the way. How do you plan to go back?

92
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,660
There's no need to persuade me.

93
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:32,150
I'll return to the South. I'll go door-to-door and ask my father's friends for help.

94
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:36,220
I think there must be someone who values their friendship and is willing to help me.

95
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,860
If there's still no way around it, I'll beg Governor Cheng in person.

96
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,670
I'll go with you.

No, you have to take care of your mother.

98
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:51,580
Hangjing, you won't be able to save your dad by going to the South alone.

99
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,830
I have some friends in the South. Some of them work in the government.

100
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:59,260
I'll go with you. Maybe we can figure out some other ways.

Tell me. Where have you been for a few days?

I went to Xinping, to check the batch of newly purchased machine guns.

But the guards saw your car. It wasn't going in the direction of Xinping.

I did.

130
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:09,460
Third Master, we understand you want to save Lin Tangsheng.

131
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:14,810
But Cheng Ling will ask a lot from you. What do you have to negotiate with him?

Then I can just persuade him with emotions and reasoning.

Third Master, stop hiding it from us!

134
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,600
Right. If Governor Jin knows that you touched the provisions,

135
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,420
this will end up really bad.

No matter how bold I am,

If you don't trust me, you can check the storage.

140
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,070
Third Brother, you can't be thinking about using the food for the army.

141
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:52,230
If they discover it, not only will you suffer military punishment. It's a serious offense as well.

It's urgent. We'll use it temporarily.

But 100,000 catties of provisions... Commander will definitely know.

There's no need for that much. Let's get 30,000 catties first and send it to them.

Send it to Cheng Ling first.

00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,850
Then purchase more supplies from the granaries in Fengcheng and Xinping.

Reporting to Commander! All provisions are there!

Even if Third Master did not use the provisions,

Governor Jin has clearly forbidden us from meddling with the South.

Third Master, no matter what, you met with Cheng Ling.

You have violated the military rules. You must be punished.

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,110
Army Chief Xiao Beichen, disobeyed military orders

161
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,860
and intervened in the matters of the South.

162
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,340
He will be punished with 30 whips and solitary confinement.

163
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,520
- Execute!
- Yes.

164
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:20,060
Commander, Beichen only met with Cheng Ling once.

165
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,000
And now he is neutral with us.

166
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,430
I can’t believe this Beichen

167
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:31,460
would be such an amazing negotiator.

168
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,780
So what should we do next, based on your opinion?

169
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,150
Hello?

170
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:00,540
Governor? It’s me, Jingxiong.

171
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,840
There is good news, I bet you don’t know yet.

172
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,610
Army Chief! Your confinement is over.

173
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,410
You can leave now.

174
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,630
- Third Brother!
- Third Brother!

175
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,910
Come, take it easy.

176
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,950
Are you okay, Third Brother?

177
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,300
Look how much torture you’ve received.

178
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,190
It’s fine.

179
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,270
How can you find it funny?

180
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,170
I should go home and see Hangjing.

181
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:54,730
I bet there will be news about her father soon, that way she can be at ease.

182
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,820
Let’s go!

183
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,060
My Lady, are you sure you don’t want to tell Seventh Madam?

184
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,710
If she knows about it, I’m sure she won’t let me go.

185
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,540
If I tell them, they’ll be worried.

186
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,430
If that’s the case, I will accompany you no matter where you go.

187
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:22,550
Jin Xiang, we don’t even know what to expect on the journey.

188
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,940
I’ll feel better if you stay here.

189
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,970
Don’t let me worry about you, all right?

190
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,940
I want to say I’ll be worried about you initially,

191
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,620
but luckily Mr. Mu will be with you,

192
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,740
If that’s the case, I won't be worried

193
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:44,570
My Lady, are you leaving tomorrow morning by ferry?

194
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,700
Zizheng and I will meet at the pier.

195
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,790
He’ll help me come up with a solution.

196
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,930
You don’t need to be worried.

197
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,370
That’s right. How come I haven’t seen Third Brother?

198
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:03,010
I heard he was in East Main Camp in confinement.

199
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:05,050
Confinement?

200
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,440
My Lady, don’t worry about him.

201
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,520
He is Commander Xiao’s son,

202
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,260
they wouldn’t do anything to him.

203
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,980
Let’s do this.

204
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,550
Lin Hangjing, in your heart,

205
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,730
can you only accommodate Mu Zizheng?

206
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:44,300
He is the one you can trust the most and can rely on, isn’t it?

207
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:54,140
Commander, what did the governor say?

208
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:58,680
Regarding Beichen visiting Commander privately,

209
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,050
I thought I wanted to apologize to him.

210
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,810
I couldn’t believe he didn’t blame me,

211
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,380
he kept talking about Beichen’s wedding.

212
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,540
For the assassin incident,

213
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:18,520
I wonder what Kang Jingxiong said in front of the governor.

214
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,780
If this wedding is fake,

215
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,700
it proves that we are covering up the truth.

216
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,890
Governor gets suspicious easily,

217
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:34,670
that’s why he has been asking me about the wedding.

218
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:38,010
But if Hangjing is not willing to marry Beichen,

219
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,620
we can’t force her.

220
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,770
Isn’t it making the whole thing worse?

221
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:49,670
Lin Tangsheng hasn’t been released yet, how can the governor mentions anything like that?

222
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:56,210
How about this? I’ll try to delay things on the governor's side.

223
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:59,740
We will take care of things after Tangsheng has been released.

224
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,570
Let’s eat something first.

225
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,270
Brother Yong!

226
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:16,000
Brother Yong! Why are you looking for me so late at night?

227
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,470
Zizheng, there is an urgent mission.

228
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,620
The organization found out Kang Jingxiong

229
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,430
sent a bunch of workers to the South.

230
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,960
We need to investigate the situation in discreet.

231
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,010
What we can do now is to send someone undercover

232
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:36,800
observe and record the whole situation.

233
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:41,190
What you mean is you need to send someone to Southern Liao?

234
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,260
You know how to draw,

235
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,430
and the higher-ups know about your ability.

236
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,820
Although...

237
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,910
you failed to kill Kang Jingxiong last time,

238
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,750
you managed to retreat unscathed.

239
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,430
The higher-ups can clearly see your bravery.

240
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,970
If you can bring the intel back to us,

241
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:06,400
you can lead the Beixin area action force.

242
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:09,920
Brother Yong, I’m sorry.

243
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,960
I’ve already promised Hangjing that I would go to the South and save her father.

244
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,540
No matter how high the odds we have at winning,

245
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,070
I cannot let her go on her own.

246
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:22,880
If it’s about this matter, I can tell you now.

247
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,420
Lin Tangsheng will stay alive.

248
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,670
Really? How do you know?

249
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:35,160
Do you believe in me?

250
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,250
Of course, I believe you!

251
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,140
I need to tell Hangjing this good news.

252
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,390
We don’t have time!

253
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:45,200
Each group of workers will be sent to Southern Liao every two weeks.

254
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,770
If we can't make it this month, we’ll need to wait for next month.

255
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:51,210
The car is right in front of here, you need to go right now.

256
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,110
Stop hesitating.

257
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,190
The organization has already made the decision.

258
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:01,440
I’m here to deliver the order, not to negotiate with you.

259
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,010
Hurry up and go.

260
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,120
Okay. I accept the order.

Please take care of my mother.

Also, Brother Yong,

263
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:20,900
can you bring a letter to Hangjing?

264
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,970
I don’t want her to be worried about me.

265
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,820

00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:30,640
these are his tokens of gratitude as your uncle.

323
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,780
Third Master, congratulations.

324
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,880
Please say thank you to the governor on my behalf.

325
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,700
I can’t believe we made you come all the way here.

326
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:46,580
The governor has this love towards our family especially Beichen.

327
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:50,110
Please show my gratitude towards him for me.

328
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:55,310
For sure. Governor also said there hasn't been a wedding in so long.

329
00:26:55,310 --> 00:27:00,120
He is looking forward to receiving the wedding invitation soon so that we can celebrate together.

330
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,220
Of course!

331
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,320
I’m heading out now.

332
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:09,190
Come over here, and put it there.

333
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,830
Commander, what should we do now?

334
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:16,260
Father, please tell me the truth.

335
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,200
Did you know about this ahead of time?

336
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,110
I did. I was discussing this with your Seventh Aunt.

337
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:26,690
We thought we would wait until Hangjing’s father was released,

338
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:30,070
then we’d explain that to the governor.

339
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:33,800
But we don’t expect the governor to go ahead and send us a gift in such a grand gesture.

340
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,190
I’m afraid the entire Beixin City knows about this by now.

341
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:40,390
He is determined to have you two get married.

342
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,600
Father! Father! Who is getting married? There are so many gifts.

343
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:07,290
Lin Hangjing, you are sending my brother to death, don’t you know?

344
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,930
What are you talking about?

345
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,100
Third Brother was trying to save you at court.

346
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:15,470
He said he is marrying you and now even the governor knows about it.

347
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:18,240
Governor sent a message and said he will be attending your wedding.

348
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,740
He even sent gifts here.

349
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,440
How would it be?

350
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,590
My third brother has to marry Sister Fengqi.

351
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,830
How are we going to explain this to her?

352
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,690
How am I going to explain this to Uncle Zheng?

353
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,370
Shuyi.

354
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:34,020
Ling Hangjing, nothing good has happened since you came to our family.

355
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,010
I hate you!

356
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:45,860
Seventh Aunt, what Shuyi said was true?

357
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,290
My dear child, on this matter,

358
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:53,980
this is their military game plan. This has nothing to do with you.

359
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:58,290
Don’t worry, our family will not force you.

360
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,960
For Uncle Xiao and me,

361
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,630
you’re always our daughter, our dear child.

362
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,980
We won’t let you suffer.

363
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:14,760
Seventh Aunt, I’m sorry. If it was not because of me,

364
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,630
- nothing would have happened.
- All right, don't take it to heart.

365
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:21,930
For this matter, leave it to your Uncle Xiao.

366
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:31,610
[I'm glad the Xiao Family took you in and you're doing well at school. I'm safe in prison under the protection of Commander Xiao.]

367
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:58,980
Lin Hangjing, you cannot be so selfish.

368
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:02,590
You can’t bring any crisis to the Xiao Family.

369
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:29,820
Lin Hangjing, is it this difficult to marry me?

370
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,150
Hey!

371
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,140
Third Brother.

372
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,290
You look preoccupied.

373
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:07,070
Are you still thinking about the words I told you before?

374
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,940
You stand here, looking like a lost soul.

375
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,340
It's just a joke.

376
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,130
I promise you.

377
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,810
What did you say?

378
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,930
Seventh Aunt has already told me.

379
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:27,430
The governor knows about the incident in court.

380
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:31,120
He has been pressuring Uncle Xiao and is forcing us to get married.

381
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:36,960
Don't worry about it. My father and I'll explain everything to the governor.

382
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,000
You don't need to take responsibility.

383
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,880
No. The governor has already sent us the wedding gifts.

384
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,480
Everybody is aware of it. He wants Uncle Xiao to surrender.

385
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,560
I was the one who made the mistake.

386
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,570
No matter for my father or the Xiao Family,

387
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:55,970
I should take the responsibility.

388
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:57,800
You mean...

389
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,660
you are really willing to marry me?

390
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:04,490
That's right. But I have one condition.

391
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,830
What's the condition? Tell me.

392
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:14,600
I hope it can be a contract marriage.

393
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,140
Contract marriage?

394
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:21,870
Meaning we're only married on paper.

395
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:26,490
We've the title, but not the real marriage. You and I cannot cross the line.

396
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:28,950
You want me to pretend to be a couple?

397
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:31,570
Yes. It's only two years.

398
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:34,200
Then, we'll separate.

399
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,090
The reason will be because I didn't obey a woman's virtues.

400
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:40,400
In that way, it'll not damage Xiao Family's reputation.

401
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,790
Fine, Lin Hangjing.

402
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:54,830
You've been thinking about this plan since the beginning, isn't that so?

403
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:59,300
Fine. I agree.

404
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:05,510
Since it's all acting, let's take it seriously.

405
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:09,030
We cannot let Kang Jingxiong find out the truth.

406
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:12,590
Then, this is the deal.

407
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:16,210
We'll act like a couple during the day and draw the line during the night.

408
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:20,100
Thank you for agreeing to this arrangement.

409
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:24,880
Don't worry, I'll do what I promised you.

410
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,940
Thank you, Third Brother.

411
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:37,400
What? Marriage?

412
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,060
Brother, have you gone insane?

413
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,300
It concerns your entire life.

414
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,160
Lin Hangjing, say something.

415
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,060
Uncle Xiao. Seventh Aunt.

416
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:55,970
This marriage was something Third Brother and I thoroughly discussed.

417
00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:00,780
Hangjing, every time when we mentioned your engagement with Beichen,

418
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,750
you were against it.

419
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,180
That's right, Hangjing.

420
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:08,580
I told you that you don't have to worry about the pressure from the governor.

421
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,550
Uncle Xiao will handle this matter.

422
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,570
I know you care about me.

423
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:16,260
But I caused the trouble.

424
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:20,260
If we refuse to get married now, it would mean that we are deceiving the governor.

425
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:24,090
People may start to believe the rumor that the Xiao's were behind the assassination.

426
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:31,290
Uncle Xiao, I know that you've been working hard to gain the governor's trust all these years.

427
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:35,020
I don't wish to see your efforts fall short of your goal.

428
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:38,800
So, all the problems will be solved,

429
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,810
only when Third Brother and I get married.

430
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:45,030
Lin Hangjing, I have really underestimated you.

431
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:47,230
What about your secret lover?

432
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,840
Shuyi.

433
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,960
It's not your place to speak.

434
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,790
Father!

435
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,320
Go back!

436
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:56,730
No!

437
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:02,560
Hangjing, we understand your concerns.

438
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,630
But it concerns the happiness of your lifetime.

439
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:08,740
Marriage is a very serious matter.

440
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:13,630
I disagree. I don't want you to be unhappy for the rest of your life.

441
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:16,450
Uncle Xiao, I won't be unhappy.

442
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:19,370
I am willing to marry Third Brother.

443
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:23,000
Seventh Aunt, you are right. Sincerity is a valuable merit.

444
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,480
For all these years I have known Third Brother,

445
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,480
we have had a lot of misunderstandings.

446
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,910
We've had a lot of arguments.

447
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:35,480
But I've never really acknowledged his kind gestures to me.

448
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,090
After all the things that have happened, I found

449
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:43,900
the feelings Third Brother has for me are very valuable.

450
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:49,540
And he hasn't changed a bit in all these years.

451
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:53,770
I believe he is the man I can spend the rest of my life with.

452
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:59,880
Lin Hangjing, what a great show! You should become an actress!

453
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,770
Xiao Shuyi.

454
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,270
Have you really thought it through?

455
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:08,720
Dad, don't worry.

456
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,590
It concerns the rest of our lives. We are not taking it as a joke.

457
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:16,050
Commander, I think the both of them genuinely want to be together.

458
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,490
Please approve.

459
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:22,160
If it's so, then that's great.

460
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,520
We're very happy for you.

461
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,990
Thank you, Uncle Xiao.

462
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:33,670
He's no longer your uncle. It's time to change your address to him.

463
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,350
Congratulations, Young Master!

464
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:39,440
Congratulations, Young Master!

465
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,540
Commander, what do you mean by this?

466
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,820
What did you tell me before?

467
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,550
Beichen announced Lin Hangjing was his fiance in front of the public.

468
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:02,860
And you told me it was an expedient solution.

469
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,580
But how is it now? They're really getting married!

470
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:08,520
No, listen to me. It was originally supposed to be this way.

471
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,600
But we didn't expect Kang Jingxiong would tell Governor Jin about it.

472
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,370
If these two don't get married,

473
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:19,540
then it'll confirm that there is some kind of relationship between the Xiao Family and the assassin.

474
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:28,840
Commander, my daughter Fengqi

475
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,690
has been madly in love with your son.

476
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,280
She told me she went to study abroad

477
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:38,360
in order to be good enough for Third Master.

478
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,470
Everything she does is for him.

479
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:44,750
How do I tell her about this when she comes back?

480
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:51,550
Well, when Fengqi comes back, I will ask Beichen to

481
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:54,320
visit your family to apologize.

482
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,300
There's no need.

483
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:03,360
Fengqi has a dowry of an army of more than 10,000 soldiers.

484
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:07,560
What does Lin Hangjing have? You and Beichen

485
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,150
should really think about the benefits.

486
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:13,020
Old Zheng.

487
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:16,740
You were just saying you wanted to leave. And now you're threatening

488
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,510
their marriage with your army.

489
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:22,530
You should think about our family bonds.

490
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,890
You still think there are still family bonds between us?

491
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:37,320
My family has always been loyal to you.

492
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,210
Is that how you treat my daughter?

493
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,280
Commander,

494
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:49,210
it's not the end of it!

495
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:00,160
[Outrageous!]

496
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,040
- That's enough.
- Sir, you've had too much to drink.

497
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:07,730
You're not a young man anymore!

498
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:13,220
Don't you dare stop me.

499
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,570
Old Mo, don't stop me.

500
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:23,390
You're on their side.

501
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:27,220
You son and Xiao Beichen

502
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:30,420
have been friends since they were toddlers.

503
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,630
Of course, you will take the Xiao Family's side and speak for them.

504
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,590
What are you talking about?

505
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,370
Sir!

506
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,290
We're here out of good faith.

507
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:44,990
Excessive drinking won't change a thing.

508
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:49,270
I can do whatever Xiao Haishan says.

509
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:52,090
I've never complained!

510
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:55,960
But now my daughter is mistreated because of him!

511
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,910
I won't allow it!

512
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,830
- That's enough!
- You can't drink anymore, Sir.

513
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:05,730
Do you really think you can stop a loving couple from getting married?

514
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:08,140
- That's right.
- Think about it!

515
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,290
Do you still remember the battle at Shanghai Pass?

516
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:19,750
I found and saved Xiao Haishan

517
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:24,000
from the pile of corpses.

518
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,100
- We know.
- That's what our brotherhood entails.

519
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:36,470
He knows my daughter is my life.

520
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:37,950
No!

521
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,460
No.

522
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:47,050
I have to bring justice to the matter for my daughter!

523
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,010
I want the Xiao Family to regret their decision today.

524
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:56,980
I want the Xiao Family

525
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:01,910
to regret. Regret...

526
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:17,580
Stop looking. Get back to work.

527
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,390
Go on!

528
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,300
Are you okay?

529
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,560
- What are you doing?
- Shut up.

530
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,320
Move it. Move it!

531
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,230
Faster!

532
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,670
Faster!

533
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,360
What are you looking at! Do your work!

534
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,500
Do it faster!

535
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:49,170
Good news! Master Lin's recognizance has been approved!

536
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:53,990
Commander, Master Lin's recognizance has been approved.

537
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:58,090
"Lin Tangsheng has been put on recognizance as the evidence provided was insufficient to condemn the party for corruption."

538
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:00,130
The prison term has been changed to one year.

539
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:05,200
- Great news!
- Thank God!

540
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,800
We finally got some good news.

541
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:12,770
Commander, why did Governor Cheng change his mind about Tangsheng's case?

542
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:16,130
- It's Beichen.
- Beichen?

543
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:18,460
I don't know what exactly happened, either.

544
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:21,340
Beichen refuses to tell me the full account.

545
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:25,730
After all, it's all out of Beichen's love for Hangjing.

546
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:30,940
Now they finally understand each other's feelings. It's great news!

547
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:33,810
You are right! Great news!

548
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:40,350
I'm so blessed that I can live.

549
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:44,250
I've been put on recognizance.

550
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:48,820
You've been living at the Xiao's residence since you were sixteen.

551
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:54,160
Commander is like your father. Seventh Madam also treats you as her own daughter.

552
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,520
They've taken great care of you for so many years.

553
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,440
You must remember

554
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,070
their kindness to you.

555
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:10,290
Beichen is a young man with great talents and competence.

556
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:12,660
He is a great man.

557
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:16,800
You living with the Xiao Family and being protected by them

558
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,690
lifted all my worries.

559
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:25,960
Every time I think about not being able to be at your side

560
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:31,070
it makes me sad. I feel ashamed that I owe you too much.

561
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:49,030
♫ Who is looking forward to the spring breeze? ♫

562
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:54,190
♫ Who is staring at the moving flowers? ♫

00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:59,420

565
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:11,580
♫ Who is afraid of heartbreak, denies the heartbeat? ♫

566
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:16,720
♫ Allow loneliness to smear the other’s protective coloration ♫

567

♫ Who would be willing to pass the other like this? ♫

♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫
