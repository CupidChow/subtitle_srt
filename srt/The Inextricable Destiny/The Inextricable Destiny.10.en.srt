[Episode 10]

4
00:01:54,339 --> 00:01:56,499
Be patient.

5
00:01:56,499 --> 00:02:02,799
When I claim the first prize in horsemanship and get the most precious nine-section worm beetle on the snow mountain,

6
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,892
I'll come back to feed you.

7
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,499
Make me proud.

8
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,619
The rain in Nanjiang comes down whenever it wants to.

9
00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:40,959
By the way, I heard Ling'er was stopped on the street again.

10
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:47,200
Yes, now everyone is saying the He family has a daughter sought by many families.

11
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:51,820
Father, since Ling'er doesn't have a lover,

12
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,559
she can be on her own, as long as she's happy.

13
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:59,759
Yes, as long as she's happy.

14
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:06,820
I think it's going to be a full four years next month.

15
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,500
Nowadays, Nanjiang is peaceful and the people are safe and sound.

16
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:16,020
I don't know if our family is relieved from our disaster yet.

17
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:24,139
Father, in these years of suppressing bandits, we have suffered from countless injuries.

18
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:27,460
Last year, when you took Qingxing and Jiuling to suppress bandits,

19
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:34,519
if it weren't for Yang Ying, I'm afraid you and Qingxing would have frozen to death by the Canglan River.

20
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:41,260
Last month, the emperor passed away, but we couldn't get back to the capital in time.

21
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,379
The emperor's edict has arrived for General He.

22
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:57,799
Qingxing, take a look.

23
00:03:57,799 --> 00:03:58,740
Take a look.

24
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,704
Hurry up.

25
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,204
Father…

26
00:04:08,204 --> 00:04:10,084
You should all take a good look.

27
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,280
Father!

28
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:19,160
Do you all know I got first place in horseback archery?

29
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,180
If it's not you, who else could it be?

30
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,460
I never doubted the fact that no one could exceed you.

31
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:35,724
Ling'er, there's another important matter for our family.

32
00:04:35,724 --> 00:04:40,460
Father, is the emperor really asking us to return to the capital and reward the He family with a nobility title?

33
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,840
I'm not dreaming, am I?

34
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,912
It's true.

35
00:04:42,912 --> 00:04:47,080
The emperor has always been close with Jiuling, he even casually gave you his dragon pendant.

36
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,780
Could it be that he is thinking of you?

37
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:51,800
Don't talk nonsense.

38
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,800
Don't try to guess the emperor's mind.

39
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,420
The late emperor has just passed away, and Crown Prince claimed the throne at 15.

40
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:04,580
As his ministers, we should be loyal and dutiful in helping him be the emperor at ease.

41
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,400
But if we go back, will the Rong family matter be a deadlock again?

42
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,100
Lord Rong hasn't mentioned anything or contacted us during these years.

43
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,879
I'm afraid he's already given up on the thought.

44
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:24,779
Even if he mentions it again, we can say Ling'er has an imperial edict to return to Nanjiang and tactfully say no.

45
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:30,139
As long as Lord Rong can't wait and arranges a marriage for his son in the capital city,

46
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:32,939
the deadlock will be resolved.

47
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,040
However, I heard from the capital city

48
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,580
that Master Rong can only speak and recognize a few characters now.

49
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,780
I'm afraid no one would want to marry him in such a situation.

50
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,120

What are you doing? How dare you?

58

Are you putting me under house arrest?

59
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,279
Is it the emperor's decision?

60
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,139
Or is the order from my royal brothers?

61
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:34,120
It doesn't matter whose decision it is.

62
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,440
The important thing is whether you obey orders.

63
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,820
The emperor has been unwell recently, and things could be chaotic.

64

Okay.

69
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,699
- Jiuling. 
 - I'm fine. Hongzao injured her leg.

70
00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:52,600
It's all my fault. I shouldn't have gone hunting wild hares.

71

I caused Hongzao to get hurt.

Luckily, her bones are fine.

73
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,220
However, it seems that Hongzao cannot travel with us.

74

In that case, you go ahead first.

00:15:19,744 --> 00:15:24,156
♫ Have you ever looked back on the joys 
 and sorrows of the years? ♫

178
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:31,752
♫ The longing crystalizes into frost and brilliant stars ♫

179
00:15:31,752 --> 00:15:39,124
♫ You quietly turned around and closed 
 the marriage book with your own hands ♫

180
00:15:39,124 --> 00:15:41,340
♫ Smiling and asking how many stars there are 
 in the world tonight ♫

181
00:15:41,348 --> 00:15:43,260
Let her go if you didn't die from the fall.

182
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,840
Let go! Let go!

183
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,559
What are you doing? Why is it you again?

184
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:51,548
Go away.

185
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,100
Forget it. Let's go.

186
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,140
Let's go.

187
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,559
Why did you jump down from there?

188
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:02,560
I told you not to jump. Why didn't you listen?

189
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,539
I told you not to jump. Why didn't you listen?

190
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:06,759
Do you realize how dangerous it was?

191
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:08,500
Why are you saying so much to him?

192
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,660
Does he even look like he understands?

193
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,659
I understand.

194
00:16:13,659 --> 00:16:15,660
Then, why did you do it?

195
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,480
You're always like this.

196
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,420
When can you make people worry less?

197
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,499
But I missed you so much.

198
00:16:31,499 --> 00:16:34,859
I didn't want to stay at the top.

199
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:38,519
Her brother here is still alive.

200
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,760
What did you say? Hooligan.

201
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,904
Let go of her.

202
00:16:41,904 --> 00:16:43,440
- No, I won't. 
 - Let go.

203
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,520
I won't.

204
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,640
- I'll hit you. 
 - Third He, I dare you.

205
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,896
Go get the horses.

206
00:16:49,896 --> 00:16:51,572
Go.

207
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:04,739
You can't jump down from high places. Do you understand?

208
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,299
Why are you here all by yourself?

209
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:13,499
Where are Heshan and Zhanping?

210
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,096
I don't know.

211
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,580
Then, what are you doing here?

212
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,039
I came to find you.

213
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,048
To find me?

214
00:17:23,048 --> 00:17:27,699
Because I saw you in the night sky.

215
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,480
Is she your sister?

216
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,520
I don't know if she's my sister.

217
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,939
I don't know if she's my sister.

218
00:17:40,939 --> 00:17:42,644
Let's go.

219
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,220
If you can't eat shrimp, don't eat.

220
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,459
It'll be a waste.

221
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:07,820
So, this is He Jiuling's legendary husband, huh?

222
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,180
Not really.

223
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,380
Why not?

224
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,980
Anyway, Father and we will never agree.

225
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:17,179
Besides, we've already fallen out with the Rong family.

226
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,019
If he could be with your annoying sister, that would be nice.

227
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:26,440
Second Sister-in-law, I used to think you didn't have much taste when you pursued my second brother.

228
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,584
I'm more certain of it now.

229
00:18:28,584 --> 00:18:33,620
When he was famous, I didn't think he was worthy of Jiuling.

230
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,240
But you think it's fine when he's like this.

231
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,540
Look.

232
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,359
All he sees is He Jiuling.

233
00:18:43,459 --> 00:18:46,899
He Jiuling is really annoying.

234
00:18:48,219 --> 00:18:50,900
I'm going to buy some herbs to apply to Hongzao.

235
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,300
You guys eat.

236
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,568
Go ahead.

237
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,484
Peel your own shrimp.

238
00:18:58,912 --> 00:19:01,824
[Kaiyuan Inn]

239
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,300
- We'll take four vacant rooms. 
 - All right, Miss.

240
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,480
There happen to be four vacant rooms on the second floor.

241
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:10,759
You're eating and living off my sister.

242
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:12,500
As a grown man, have some dignity.

243
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,700
- Thank you. 
 - How can you be so shameless and spend a woman's money?

244
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,339
- What is less? 
 - Boss, could you help me carry my luggage upstairs?

245
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:23,319
Not less. Shameless.

246
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:24,880
It means happy.

247
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,960
I asked how you could be so happy spending my sister's money.

248
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,132
I'm happy.

249
00:19:32,132 --> 00:19:35,839
No, every time I talk to you, I get a headache.

250
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:39,040
Third He, take Rong Yu upstairs first.

251
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,600
I'll see how I can get in touch with Heshan.

252
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,260
He and Zhanping must be worried.

253
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,240
Why are you following me?

254
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,140
I can't work with you around.

255
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,140
Go upstairs and rest first.

256
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,340
I'm going with you.

257
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:59,076
I'll be back in a while.

258
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,680
I'm scared.

259
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:08,576
Young Master Rong,

260
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,540
let me tell you He Jiuling's stories in Nanjiang.

261
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:18,860
You see, this cloak you're wearing is from the wolf that He Jiuling took a great risk to hunt.

262
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,419
The weather was icy and snowy…

263
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,080
Stop. You won't be able to find her.

264
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,519
That time, that wolf almost killed He Jiuling.

265
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:35,568
If she had died, you would have never seen her again.

266
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,659
You wouldn't find her anywhere.

267
00:20:37,659 --> 00:20:40,440
Never see her again?

268
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,268
Wouldn't find her...

269
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:46,520
anywhere?

270
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,439
Second Sister-in-law, look what you've done to him.

271
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:23,060
I didn't do anything.

272
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,640
You can't blame me.

273
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,500
Besides, he's not looking for He Jiuling now.

274
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,820
Isn't this good?

275
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,324
You…

276
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,036
Young Master Rong,

277
00:21:39,036 --> 00:21:40,840
it's been so long.

278
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,540
Why are you still upset?

279
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:52,900
Oh my god, don't be like this. Okay?

280
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:57,100
As men, we should never cry, even if we die.

281
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:01,060
Also, I'm telling you, He Jiuling hates it when men cry.

282
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,319
You're being so wimpy.

283
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:04,480
She will hate you for the rest of her life.

284
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:11,379
Do you hear me? Knock it off.

285
00:22:14,639 --> 00:22:17,900
He Qiuting, well done, huh?

286
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,500
Why are you poking me?

287
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,880
Why did you hit Rong Yu? Do you think he is easy to bully?

288
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,660
I didn't hit him.

289
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:26,380
Can you try to understand the situation first?

290
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,780
I did not bully him.

291
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,620
Second Sister-in-law, help me out.

292
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,279
Say something.

293
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,880
I'm tired. Going to bed now.

294
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,559
Yang Ying, are you trying to turn us against each other?

295
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,500
Yang Ying, are you trying to turn us against each other?

296
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,780
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

297
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:50,099
You. Stop pretending.

298
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:52,820
I didn't do anything. Why are you acting so hurt?

299
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,588
Let go of her.

300
00:22:54,588 --> 00:22:56,779
Get your hands off of her.

301
00:22:56,779 --> 00:22:58,920
Don't touch him.

302
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,599
You didn't like him at first sight. You're always mocking him.

303
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:05,499
- I… 
 - I pretended not to hear, but it doesn't mean I'm okay with it.

304
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,579
I won't leave you with others from now on.

305
00:23:10,579 --> 00:23:12,260
I will take you along wherever I go until Heshan comes.

306
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,859
I will take you along wherever I go until Heshan comes.

307
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:19,060
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

308
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,820
He Jiuling, are you insane?

309
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,660
You're running around taking care of him, going out to find someone to pick him up late at night.

310
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:31,340
You... and now you're even apologizing to him.

311
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,148
Go to bed.

312
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,880
Go to bed now.

313
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,699
It's unbearable.

314
00:23:41,699 --> 00:23:43,180
Really unbearable.

315
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:48,620
I left the capital for four years, and the idiot there has become powerful.

316
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:56,800
You can sleep here for the night.

317
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,360
My room is next door.

318
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,540
If you need anything, just push open the door and come in.

319
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,300
Sleep tight.

320
00:24:13,459 --> 00:24:14,692
What?

321
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,659
Sleep.

322
00:24:16,659 --> 00:24:18,220
This is your room.

323
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,659
Go in there and you can sleep.

324
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:23,480
I sleep with you.

325
00:24:26,219 --> 00:24:28,120
No, it's inappropriate.

326
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,079
We used to sleep together before.

327
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,959
That's not true. Stop the nonsense.

328
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:35,419
We did. You took off my shoes. And we shared a quilt.

329
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:36,820
We did. You took off my shoes. And we shared a quilt.

330
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,179
I... I…

331
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,719
We shared a quilt. And I hugged you.

332
00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:45,519
We shared a quilt. And I hugged you.

333
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:47,780
All right.

334
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:03,439
We stayed in one room that time because we had to. But now, we have two rooms.

335
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:15,480
Besides, men and women before they're married, cannot sleep together.

336
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,412
You understand that. Right?

337
00:25:19,459 --> 00:25:21,076
Fine.

338
00:25:21,076 --> 00:25:23,780
Did I make it too complicated?

339
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:28,239
You should listen to me in the future, got it?

340
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,619
Okay, I'm going to make your bed.

341
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,204
Your bed is ready.

342
00:25:43,204 --> 00:25:46,379
You should go to sleep now. I'm leaving.

343
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,500
Why are you following me again?

344
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,859
To sleep.

345
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,120
Didn't we just agree?

346
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,500
You will listen to me.

347
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,159
I will listen to you.

348
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:08,060
You said you would take me along until Zhanping comes.

349
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,960
I… I am listening to you.

350
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,140
That's not what I just said…

351
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,252
Come on.

352
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:23,039
You lied to me, didn't you?

353
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,520
So many people have lied to me.

354
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:32,300
They said you left, you didn't want to see me, and you'd never come back.

355
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,399
They also said they'd seen you

356
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:41,719
but the people who took me to find you disappeared after a while.

357
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:45,979
They all lied to me, and so did you.

358
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,880
No, I-I didn't lie to you.

359
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,320
You did.

360
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,860
I really didn't lie to you.

361
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,980
It's just… I just… I went to the next room to get the quilt.

362
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,380
It's just… I just… I went to the next room to get the quilt.

363
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,900
I…

364
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,200
really didn't lie to you.

365
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,744
Really?

366
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:32,060
Sister-in-law, you know what kind of person I am. Right?

367
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:35,840
When we get to the capital, don't tell my second brother and others. Okay?

368
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,739
You messed around with him before, and now you want to mess around again without taking the responsibility. Right?

369
00:27:40,739 --> 00:27:42,080
Don't worry, Sister-in-law.

370
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,124
Young Master Rong is stupid, and I can pretend to be stupid, too.

371
00:27:44,124 --> 00:27:45,240
No, no.

372
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,120
It's cold. Keep yourselves warm.

373
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,000
Sister-in-law, come back and clarify what you mean.

374
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,619
We will be warm.

375
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,699
I will keep you warm.

376
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:08,020
All set. Good night.

377
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,388
No, not yet.

378
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,056
He Jiuling.

379
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,904
He Jiuling.

380
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,859
He Jiuling.

381
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,928
He Jiuling.

382
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:39,300
Aren't you going to sleep?

383
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,780
I'm afraid you'll leave.

384
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,660
I'm not leaving.

385
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:51,820
You won't leave in the future?

386
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:02,899
I missed you. Did you miss me?

387
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,020
Can I sleep with you?

388
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,320
Rong Yu, go back to the bed.

389
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,300
I… I didn't hear you clearly just now.

390
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,212
I answered wrongly.

391
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:24,740
You lied to me again.

392
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,180
How did I lie to you again?

393
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,019
You agreed just now.

394
00:30:29,019 --> 00:30:32,920
I… I didn't realize it.

395
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,020
Forget it.

396
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:42,760
It's all right with you.

397
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,119
You don't understand anything now.

398
00:30:54,739 --> 00:30:56,304
Rong Yu.

399
00:30:56,739 --> 00:30:58,756
Trust me.

400
00:30:59,879 --> 00:31:03,179
He Jiuling will definitely cure you.

401
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,580
But you have to wait for a while.

402
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:16,699
I have been looking for you for a long time.

403
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:23,200
I am sorry.

404
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,580
It's all right.

405
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,540
Why are you so nice?

406
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:45,319
If you could be more selfish or more annoying,

407
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:48,500
I probably wouldn't be so sad.

408
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:53,720
As the days pass,

409
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,519
the longer I know you, the more I owe you.

410
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:02,060
When can I ever repay you?

411
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,180
You're sleepy, right?

412
00:32:10,899 --> 00:32:14,040
Come on, let's go to the bed. It's chilly on the ground.

413
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,580
I'm thirsty.

414
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,580
I'll go and get you some tea.

415
00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:23,440
The tea doesn't taste good.

416
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,619
Then I'll go get…

417
00:32:45,499 --> 00:32:49,279
Rong Yu! Rong Yu!

420
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,480
A pot of hot water, please.

421
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,020
Okay.

422
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,388
Master Qiuting.

423
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,880
You're quick. Come.

424
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,240
Luckily, it's the suburb of the capital.

425
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,019
I came as soon as I could.

426
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,000
Jiuling, are you there?

427
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,412
Jiuling.

428
00:33:44,412 --> 00:33:46,000
Who is this?

429
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,680
He's from the Rong mansion, came to get Rong Yu.

430
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,339
Jiuling, I'm coming in.

431
00:33:51,339 --> 00:33:55,819
He Jiuling sent a message last night, and he came in the morning.

432
00:33:55,819 --> 00:33:57,828
That was fast.

433
00:34:01,028 --> 00:34:02,052
Wait a moment.

434
00:34:02,052 --> 00:34:03,059
What for?

435
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:05,660
We should get rid of this hot potato as soon as possible.

436
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,579
Master Rong! Master Rong.

437
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:11,080
Someone has come to pick you up.

438
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:24,219
Master Qiuting, is my master here?

439
00:34:25,419 --> 00:34:27,780
Never let your master come out causing trouble again.

440
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,220
In 15 minutes, either die or get lost.

441
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,459
In 15 minutes, either die or get lost.

442
00:34:30,459 --> 00:34:32,680
He Jiuling.

443
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,239
He Jiuling, come out!

444
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,099
He Jiuling, come out right now!

445
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:42,484
Why are you yelling?

446
00:34:42,484 --> 00:34:47,160
He Jiuling, come out! Come out!

447
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,880
- He Jiuling. 
 - Why are you yelling in the early morning?

448
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,000
I want to ask you what you're doing.

449
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,500
I'm very angry right now.

450
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,460
Don't provoke me. Come out now.

451
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:00,000
He Jiuling, if you don't come out, I'm going in.

452
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,420
- Stop knocking. 
 - Come out!

453
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,708
Do you hear me?

454
00:35:06,419 --> 00:35:08,484
Open the door!

455
00:35:10,879 --> 00:35:12,256
Young Master.

456
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:15,300
- Heshan. 
 - Rong Yu, I'll tear you apart.
