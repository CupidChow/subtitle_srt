[The Inextricable Destiny]

00:01:31,456 --> 00:01:34,400
[Episode 14]

3
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,079
Are you still unhappy?

4
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,799
How could I be happy about all this?

5
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,659
You don't understand anything.

6
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:57,079
You don't know anything.

7
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,040
I know.

8
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,680
If you knew, why did you do so many

9
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,940
silly, meaningless

10
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,659
worrying things?

11
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,719
Falling into the lake could kill you.

12
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,919
Do you know what death means?

13
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,280
All my family died.

14
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,479
I have nothing now.

15
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,920
But you, you have so much.

16
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,400
Yet you do such foolish things.

17
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,408
Forget it.

18
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,759
Let's not argue. It's pointless.

19
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:45,400
I want to find your departed family members
and give them back to you,

20
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,520
but I can't.

21
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,479
I did not know

22
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,680
I would fall into the lake today.

23
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,360
I did not know

24
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,080
you would hate all this.

25
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:05,120
I just wanted to make you happier.

26
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,000
Madam, look.

27
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,199
This is General He Liang
that Young Master made for you.

28
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,439
Do you find it ridiculous?

29
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,752
I agree.

30
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,400
Everyone thinks he's silly

31
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,200
and naive.

32
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,420
But only he

33
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,719
would do such things.

34
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,719
Young Master really tried every method

35
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,840
to make you happy.

36
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,840
He wanted to bring the He family to you,

37
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,879
at least on your birthday.

38
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,360
He wanted you to have your family with you.

39
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,840
Your father was a general, right?

40
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,400
He must have been very commanding.

41
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,039
This one.

42
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,280
This one is your eldest brother.

43
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:10,599
He was… He was…

44
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,580
Elder brother was a…

45
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,696
Strategist.

46
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,119
This is a book I wrote before.

47
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:18,439
I gave it to him.

48
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:33,920
This is your second brother.

49
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,359
Second brother was a junior general.

50
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,160
Surely he was as commanding as your father.

51
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,808
This is the Third brother.

52
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,560
Third brother…

53
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,720
I haven't finished dressing him yet.

54
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,000
You woke up too early.

55
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,488
You're crying.

56
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,720
Really, I can't do anything right.

57
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,224
No, Rong Yu.

58
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,959
The little bunny and the fish you gave me,

59
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,360
as well as my family members,

60
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,079
I like them very much.

61
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:47,840
Really?

62
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,040
Then every year on your birthday,

63
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,000
I will gift you bunnies, fish,
and family members.

64
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,360
A little rabbit will be enough.

65
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,560
Don't build so many snowmen.

66
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,079
You should take care of yourself.

67
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,608
I'm not cold.

68
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,940
But you'll be happy if you have
family members around

69
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,480
to celebrate your birthday.

70
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,439
You're part of my family, too.

71
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,008
Aren't you?

72
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,920
Every year,

73
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,040
as long as you accompany

74
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,660
your little rabbit lady,

75
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,120
she'll be happy.

76
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,399
I will accompany my little rabbit lady.

77
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,440
Ling.

78
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,480
Don't cry.

79
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,920
I hope that in the days to come,

80
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,920
you can be happy every day.

81
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,232
Good girl.

82
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,480
You must be happy.

83
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,304
Dad.

84
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,272
Chenzhou.

85
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,280
Qingxing.

86
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,952
Qiuting.

87
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,259
Dad, Chenzhou, Qingxing.

88
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:20,288
Qiuting.

89
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:06,199
If you never treat anyone wholeheartedly,

90
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:09,600
you will never experience loss

91
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,264
or separation.

92
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,656
But with this person,

93
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,199
I want to try one last time.

94
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,720
Here come the longevity noodles.

95
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:42,240
Madam, although it wasn't made
by the young master himself,

96
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,979
it was made

97
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:45,039
under his supervision.

98
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,799
So it counts as his affection.

99
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,919
Madam. Listen.

100
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,460
If I didn't stop him,

101
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,960
he really wanted to do it himself.

102
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,120
Then you wouldn't be able

103
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,719
to have longevity noodles in the morning.

104
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:00,800
Thank you.

105
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,020
Let me try

106
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,080
the longevity noodles prepared by you.

107
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,080
Delicious. These are the best I've ever tasted.

108
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,799
Is your hand okay?

109
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,440
Yes, all thanks to my husband.

110
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,912
Husband.

111
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,480
You called me Husband.

112
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:44,736
Why?

113
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,020
Can't I call you that?

114
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,120
No, no.

115
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,759
Can I build a small

116
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,759
dispensary in the yard?

117
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,799
I lost everything back in Nanjiang.

118
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,919
I have to raise some small insects anew.

119
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,279
But they are all some strange kinds.

120
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,679
is that okay?

121
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,860
Also, if I

122
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,280
ask you to eat these little bugs,

123
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,368
would you eat them?

124
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,879
But this would be a secret
between the two of us.

125
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,639
Besides Zhanping,

126
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:46,639
not even Lord Rong can know it, okay?

127
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:51,560
Why are you just saying yes?

128
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,279
Isn't there anything you want to ask?

129
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:02,279
Can you

130
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:11,919
call me Husband again?

131
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
Husband.

132
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,919
Miss, do you want one?

133
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,640
Hot.

134
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:03,584
Thank you.

135
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:05,760
Slow down.

136
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:11,776
Is it good?

[Weiyang]

138
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,760
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- So cute.

139
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,768
Yeah.

140
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,008
Dad.

141
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,679
Chenzhou, sister.

142
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,840
Qingxing, Ying.

144
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:09,679
The New Year is coming. Happy New Year.

145
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,784
Over here, sir.

146
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:36,000
- He's here.
- Thank you.

147

[Rong's Mansion]

148
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,399
Please come in.

149
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,719
This is the amazing master

150
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:55,720
I told you about.

151
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,799
He is also well-known in Xijiang.

152
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:05,960
I have learned about the situation.

153
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,500
On my way to the capital,

154
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,200
I also thought about some solutions.

155
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,080
However, seeing
that Master Rong's eyes are clear,

156
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,480
and his behavior is no different
from that of an ordinary person,

157
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,320
as for his current state of health,

158
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,160
we still have to use our Xijiang methods

159
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,600
to investigate thoroughly

160
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,184
before we can make a conclusion.

161
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:26,816
Please make yourself at home.

162
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,639
However, I have my rules.

163
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,399
There must be no disturbance
during the consultation.

164
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:36,420
Lord Rong, could you please step aside?

165
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,399
Understood. Thank you for your help, master.

166
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,639
I know.

167
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,720
This is an echo insect.

168
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,960
Do you know this insect?

169
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,080
But it should be gold.

170
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,519
How do you know there are gold ones?

171
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:36,080
Isn't it common?

172
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,264
It's impossible.

173
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,040
Echo insects are rare,

174
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,940
let alone gold ones.

175
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,159
It's hard to breed one in ten thousand.

176
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:49,088
Is that so?

177
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,159
This looks familiar.

178
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,080
These are just some ordinary knives.

179
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:24,880
To use an echo insect to investigate,
I need to draw your blood.

180
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,079
But I won't take much.

181
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:29,560
No need. Just hold it in your hand,

182
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,120
and it will find the illness on its own.

183
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,840
No, my Guagua can't.

184
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,944
No.

185
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,600
What is a Guagua?

186
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:49,960
Who said he was stupid?

187
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,639
He's definitely an expert in pharmaceuticals.

188
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,840
Young master, have you ever
raised medicinal insects?

189
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,540
What insects?

190
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,039
Tell me, I can ask someone to find it for you.

191
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,920
He has so many insects
that he doesn't even remember?

192
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,559
How about I go get my echo insect?

193
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,000
Sure. That'll be good.

194
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,960
Did I run into a disciple
of Hermitess Xuantian?

195
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,656
Could it just be a coincidence?

196
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,559
Don't panic yet.

197
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:30,624
I must be overthinking it.

198
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,784
I raised it.

199
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,640
How do you know

200
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,168
how to raise a top-tier echo insect?

201
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:10,480
It's quite easy.

202
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,160
E-Easy?

203
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,520
May I ask, young master,

204
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,020
who, who is your master?

205
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,880
Let me guess.

206
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,679
I heard that back in the day,

207
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:31,480
Hermitess Xuantian had certain connections

208
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,279
with the Astrology Pavilion.

209
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:38,160
Are you…

210
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:40,799
Are you…

211
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,480
You must be her disciple.

212
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,380
If you want to discipline me
on behalf of your master,

213
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,799
why beat around the bush?

214
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,200
You, you have poisoned me.

215
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,140
What, what poison did you use?

216
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,439
My whole body

217
00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:05,799
feels like it's on fire and I can't breathe.

218
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,319
Fine. So this was your plan all along.

219
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,400
Turns out her disciple

220
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,440
is even more powerful than herself.

221
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,008
Master.

222
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:34,260
Master, I did steal her secret scriptures

223
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,440
and her instruments.

224
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:37,580
I learned a few things

225
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,860
and falsely claimed to be
better than your master,

226
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,740
but I, I didn't harm anyone.

227
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,620
Undo the poison on me, please.

228
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,680
I can't take it anymore.

229
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,328
I can't stand it anymore.

230
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:00,896
I can't take it.

231
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,920
Hot, hot, I am burning up.

232
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:22,480
Lord. My lord.

233
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,608
The person from Xijiang
just jumped into the pond.

234
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:26,119
What?

235
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,232
He jumped into the pond.

236
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,896
What is this doing here?

237
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,272
The aphrodisiac bait.

238
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,440
Why is there so much missing?

239
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,119
Speak up. What were you up to?

240
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:28,160
What do you mean by "up to"?

241
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,160
When I was not in the room,

242
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,559
did you take my things?

243
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,419
You have the face to say yes. Rong Yu.

244
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:41,460
Well done.

245
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,920
You dared to touch my things without asking me.

246
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:47,279
I'll ask you now.

247
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,680
Sure.

248
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,960
Can you move back to live with me?

249
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:57,400
I can sleep in the outer room.

250
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:01,120
No.

251
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:05,100
I know in other families,

252
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,200
the wife and the husband share a room.

253
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,160
Besides, last time at the inn you also said

254
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,200
those who are married can live together.

255
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,799
You sure know a lot, don't you?

256
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,559
Why can't you be more assertive

257
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,319
and ask to sleep with me?

258
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,160
Would you agree then?

259
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,599
So unconfident?

260
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,008
Then I'll leave…

261
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:32,608
No.

262
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,680
You have to sleep me today.

263
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,640
Sorry, wrong timing.

264
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,416
No.

265
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,240
Sleep me.

266
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,660
Not "sleep you".

267
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,200
It's "sleeping with you".

268
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,279
Tomorrow, also sleep with me.

269
00:23:08,896 --> 00:23:09,920
What about the day after tomorrow?

270
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,920
Same.

271
00:23:21,056 --> 00:23:22,199
- What is this?
- Stop. Rong Yu.

272
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:23,200
It's nothing.

273
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:25,979
Rong Yu, it's nothing.

274
00:23:25,979 --> 00:23:27,100
Let go of me.

275
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,640
Don't pull my clothes.

276
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,640
I'll be mad.

277
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,839
I'll get angry.

278
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:41,759
You're taking advantage of the fact
that I wouldn't hit you, right?

279
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:43,760
But that…

280
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,240
There's no but, I'm fine.

281
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:54,279
I'll go change first.

282
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:56,520
Warm up the bed

283
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,480
so that I'll be warm when I come back to sleep.

284
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,839
Rong Yu, you used to be my biggest pain,

285
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:13,312
but now,

286
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:15,519
you are my biggest fortune.

287
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,520
Excuse us.

288
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:57,856
New Year's money.

289
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:24,359
What is this for?

290
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:27,776
New Year's…

291
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:31,640
New Year's money.

292
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,120
But it used to be gourds before.

293
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,839
Why the little rabbit now?

294
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:42,759
Well, it's a great fortune for me.

295
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:47,400
It means…

296
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:50,519
having a lot of money. So much money.

297
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,680
I don't want to be rich.

298
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,720
All I want is you.

299
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,039
Your Majesty, the Regent has come.

300
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,240
Uncle.

301
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,140
Long live the Emperor.

302
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,208
Stand up.

303
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:52,160
I've said before, we're family,

304
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,279
and there's no need for formalities.

305
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,319
Your Majesty, ancestral rites
cannot be discarded.

306
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,620
Your Majesty, the court officials
will come to celebrate the New Year,

307
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,640
and you can't stand here.

308
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,079
I'll stay wherever you say I should.

309
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:11,759
Your Majesty, you should be there.

310
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,440
Why hasn't my cousin come today?

311
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,559
Your Majesty, I have grounded her today.

312
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,152
Why?

313
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,360
Well…

314
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,100
I'm not an outsider.

315
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,960
What doesn't Uncle want to tell me?

316
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,359
Just tell me, Uncle.

317
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,336
Your Majesty,

318
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,480
Songlin is getting more and more unruly.

319
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,860
She says that she will marry in the Spring,

320
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,920
and she's afraid that her husband's
family won't like her.

321
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:53,600
She asked me to plead with Your Majesty

322
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,400
and grant her a princess title.

323
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,000
But how is that possible?

324
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,660
I'll grant it.

325
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,239
As long as it makes my cousin happy.

326
00:28:01,239 --> 00:28:02,272
Why is this not possible?

327
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:06,000
Wang Dequan, how do I formulate the edict?

328
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:09,120
There is no precedent

329
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,380
so I need to ask Lord Li

330
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,440
from the Rites Department.

331
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,180
Get it done as soon as possible.

332
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,559
I won't dig deeper into such a minor matter.

333
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,656
Yes.

334
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,279
Thank you, Your Majesty.

335
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:34,279
I wish Your Majesty a Happy New Year.

336
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:37,500
May everything go smoothly
for Your Majesty next year.

337
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,480
May everything be perfect next year for Jialin.

338
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,160
Husband, let go.

339
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:13,519
On New Year's Eve, all the important ministers
will take their families into the palace

340
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,200
without personal guards or weapons.

341
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,839
If anyone wants to kidnap or kill someone,

342
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,960
it's the perfect time.

343
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:25,319
Who wanted to get rid of my family?

344
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:27,199
Who framed my family?

345
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,720
How many people were involved?

346
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,279
Today, I will find out the truth.

347
00:29:37,248 --> 00:29:38,304
Jiuling.

348
00:29:38,304 --> 00:29:39,659
Lord Rong. Lord Song.

349
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:40,672
Jiuling,

350
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,976
are you still cold?

351
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:49,888
What took you so long?

352
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:53,760
Why are you still standing there?
Hurry up and come over.

353
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:58,839
You are getting more and more unruly.

354
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,620
When we pay respects
to the Empress Dowager later,

355
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,480
have some manners, understood?

356
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,968
Lord Rong.

357
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,559
Happy New Year, My Lord.

358
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,776
Happy New Year.

359
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:15,584
Happy New Year.

360
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:22,080
Is it hot?

361
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,920
- I'm okay.
- Forgive me.

362
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,960
I don't know how…

363
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,704
How can you fail to hold

364
00:30:28,704 --> 00:30:30,480
- a cup of water steadily?
- It's all my fault.

365
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,096
It's all my fault.

366
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:34,112
Young Lord.

367
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,800
It's okay.

368
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:39,920
Since your clothes are wet,

369
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,536
you should go home first.

370
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:44,079
Why not ask the servants
to bring Mrs. Rong a new outfit?

371
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,960
Young Lord, no need for that.

372
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,060
There's no need for you to worry, Young Lord.

373
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,860
Don't let me delay His Majesty

374
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,200
or the lords here.

375
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,319
Come on.

376
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,384
Rong Yu.

377
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:06,688
Lord Rong, Lord Rong.

378
00:31:07,968 --> 00:31:09,039
Lord Rong, Lord Rong.

379
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,280
Go and meet His Majesty first.

380
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,359
I'll wait for you at home.

381
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,340
- I…
- Take a look at what His Majesty wears

382
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,319
tell me about what he said when you get home.

383
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:19,168
Listen to your uncle.

384
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,576
Mrs. Rong.

385
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,640
Mrs. Rong, the Princess requests to see you.

386
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,072
Her Highness?

387
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,600
Is Her Highness here?

388
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,960
Yes.

389
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,580
Mrs. Rong, please wait here.

390
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,039
Her Highness will arrive shortly.

391
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,559
Tell me, who told you to deceive me?

392
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:08,300
The princess?

393
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,920
That's a lie. I don't know Her Highness.

394
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,279
So why would she suddenly summon me?

395
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,900
Besides, no one has lived here for a long time.

396
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,500
It's obvious I was deliberately lured here.

397
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,939
I guess the one
who splashed me with water earlier

398
00:32:18,939 --> 00:32:20,160
was also part of your scheme, right?

399
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:24,079
Tell me, what is going on?

400
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,232
He Jiuling.

401
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,992
It's me.

402
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,319
During these years when Father was sick,

403
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:38,440
he had been relying heavily
on the Astrology Pavilion.

404
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,919
He listened to everything Rong Jiang said

405
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:42,240
and did everything according to his will.

406
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,380
He started the construction project

407
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,640
and built the Astrology Pavilion.

408
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,000
He recruited the best
fortunetellers in the world.

409
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,559
Rong Jiang was almost omnipotent.

410
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,039
After Father passed away,

411
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,000
I thought I could just avoid the Rong family.

412
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:57,440
But the court is surrounded
by tigers and wolves.

413
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,359
After the Rong family,
there's the Jiang family.

414
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:04,440
Although Lord Zhongyong is my uncle,

415
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,839
he takes advantage of my youth.

416
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,720
Today, Jialin

417
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:11,519
has almost become his possession.

418
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,319
The military authority and troops
are all under his control.

419
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,336
And their group

420
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,240
went to great lengths to destroy the He family.

421
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,599
I am the Emperor in name,

422
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:27,640
but I have no say in anything.

423
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:30,000
I even have to pretend to be silly, mad,
and fearful of him.

424
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,640
As the saying goes, if the lips are gone,
the teeth will be cold.

425
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:35,584
He Jiuling.

426
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,359
I failed to protect the He family.

427
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:41,600
I am at fault.

428
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:44,096
Your Majesty.

429
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:47,119
I am guilty but I have
no means to atone for it.

430
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:49,519
Even for this etiquette,

431
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:52,240
I dare not let anyone else know.

432
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:56,799
I play the role of a pathetic emperor.

433
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,519
I'm the pathetic one.

434
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,519
I can't even protect my own family.

435
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,960
What does it have to do with others?

436
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,744
He Jiuling.

437
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:14,119
When Father was alive,

438
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,352
he mentioned you to me.

439
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,920
The message said you
were better than your teacher.

440
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,808
In Nanjiang,

441
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,239
you were more famous than General He.

442
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,416
If you were not a woman,

443
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,320
you'd probably be a general by now,

444
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,679
Even if that's true,

445
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,039
it's meaningless.

446
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:41,320
No, it's not.

447
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,400
Because I want you

448
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,239
to be my General He.

449
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,079
Your Majesty.

450
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,552
In all history,

451
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:53,360
there has never been a woman
to assist the emperor.

452
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,319
But this great palace

453
00:34:56,319 --> 00:34:57,760
is filled with truth and illusion.

454
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,559
Although I sit high every day,

455
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,920
I have no one I trust.

456
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,416
On reflection,

457
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,039
no one trusts me either.

458
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,640
I now clearly know

459
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,039
who conspired with Lord Zhongyong
to frame the He family.

460
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:23,559
As for the other chaotic and fawning officials,

461
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,079
I need you to help me investigate them
one by one in the future.

462
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,936
You need a family revenge,

463
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:29,664
and I have a national responsibility.

464
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:32,544
He Jiuling.

465
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:35,800
Can I entrust the future of Jialin

466
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,528
to you?

467
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:42,480
I, I…

468
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:52,039
Maybe I'm being presumptuous.

469
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,280
Your family was willing to die
just to hand you to Rong Yu.

470
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:59,440
They simply wanted you
to live a normal woman's life.

471
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,159
If I were your family member,

472
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,960
I wouldn't want you to get involved either.

473
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,976
If you want to say no,

474
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:09,280
I can understand.

475
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,800
I do have a burden.

476
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,280
My only burden is,

477
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,199
how do I deserve

478
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:24,559
the trust of His Majesty?

479
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:32,627
♫ Under the setting sun in dusk ♫

480
00:36:34,848 --> 00:36:40,647
♫ I travel far for thousands of miles ♫

481
00:36:40,647 --> 00:36:47,617
♫ Playing the zither under the moonlight ♫

482
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:55,003
♫ The drinks won't let me forget ♫

483
00:36:55,968 --> 00:37:01,956
♫ The longing I write down for you ♫

484
00:37:03,072 --> 00:37:08,612
♫ Our fate is written on paper ♫

485
00:37:08,612 --> 00:37:12,911
♫ Just like the strongest wine ♫

486
00:37:12,911 --> 00:37:16,326
♫ There's no escape for destiny ♫

487
00:37:17,248 --> 00:37:23,332
♫ Looking back, I see you waiting ♫

488
00:37:23,332 --> 00:37:30,500
♫ Our lives are filled with joy and sorrow ♫

489
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:37,435
♫ The longings crystalize
into a bright galaxy ♫

490
00:37:37,435 --> 00:37:45,252
♫ You turned around quietly
and closed the marriage book ♫

491
00:37:45,252 --> 00:37:50,852
♫ Asking how many stars there are in the sky ♫

492
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:22,660
♫ The longing I write down for you ♫

493
00:38:24,224 --> 00:38:29,828
♫ Our fate is written on paper ♫

494
00:38:29,828 --> 00:38:33,862
♫ Just like the strongest wine ♫

495
00:38:34,272 --> 00:38:36,804
♫ There's no escape for destiny ♫

496
00:38:38,368 --> 00:38:44,420
♫ Looking back, I see you waiting ♫

497
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:51,460
♫ Our lives are filled with joy and sorrow ♫

498
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:58,657
♫ The longings crystalize
into a bright galaxy ♫

499
00:38:58,661 --> 00:39:05,924
♫ Gently I stroke the zither,
waiting for a passerby like you ♫

500
00:39:06,528 --> 00:39:12,688
♫ Turns out you are my inextricable destiny ♫
