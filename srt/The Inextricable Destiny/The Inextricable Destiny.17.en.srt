00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,280
Didn't we agree to a lifetime?

5
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:48,928
I'm not angry.

6
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,879
I just don't want to be greedy anymore.

He Jiuling.

8
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:56,959
I've become a thief.

9
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,799
But I hope

10
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,920
you can be with someone you like

Miss.

24
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,479
Master Rong.

25

Miss Tan is here.

26
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:09,879
- She's still asleep. Wait for a while.
- Okay.

27
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:52,992
Morning.

28
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,488
- Last night…
- Last night…

29
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,256
Last night…

30
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,959
I'm sorry about what happened last night.

But…

32
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,840
It's all my fault.

33
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,519
Let's not mention it anymore.

34
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,720

Every time Wu Ritan comes,

38
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,279
she rushes out in a hurry.

39
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,399
What exactly are they up to?

40
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,460
<i>Get more men to protect the young Master.</i>

41

<i>Something's up in the capital.</i>

42
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,648
Young master.

43
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,000
Go to the Ministry of Justice

44
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,479
and use the name of astrological predictions

45
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,680
to get the files of the He Family case.

46
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,480
Get some of the other files as well,

47
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,488
<i>[Rong's Mansion]</i>
so that it won't attract attention.

48
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,920
- Master, why…
- Do not ask why.

49
00:07:30,496 --> 00:07:31,552
I…

50
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,239
Get a clear blueprint of the mansion

51
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:34,240
and get familiar with it.

52
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,720
- Arrange for people to get in and stand by.
- Yes.

53
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,640
But the object is small

54
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,959
and important,

55
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,760
so even if someone does get in,

56
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,879
where should they start?

57
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,880
There are a hundred Gold Insects

58
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,959
and they can detect gold objects.

59
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,480
My master and I used to mess around with them.

60
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:54,040
Who'd think they would come in handy like this?

61
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,680
Okay.

62
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,480
There's something else.

63
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,360
Recently I've been browsing
through medical books

64
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,319
and there was a medicinal herb called

65
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,312
Celestial Grass.

66
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,839
But most of the pharmacies
I asked didn't have it.

67
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,279
Do you know where I can find any?

68
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,679
Such a small herb

69
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:19,480
can only be used to cure headaches and fevers.

70
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,020
It's hard to find and not easy to store.

71
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,100
Once picked,

72
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,959
it only has medical efficacies
for two or three hours,

73
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,199
so it has long been extinct in the market.

74
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,780
If you're feeling unwell,

75
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,959
I can prescribe some other herbs for you.

76
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,360
It's not for me.

77
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,900
I have other uses for it.

78
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,040
Just tell me where I can find it

79
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,240
and I will go and look for it myself.

80
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,300
I heard from the herbalist

81
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,719
that it was seen on Jingshan,

82
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:45,340
all in hard-to-find locations

83
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,080
and you might not recognize it.

84
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,720
How about this?

85
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,780
I'll send my herbalist to scout for it,

86
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,920
and if I get any news, I will let you know

87
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,304
- and you can pick it yourself.
- Thank you.

Lord Zhongyong.

90
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,120
Nanjiang is so far and dangerous,

91
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,480
and it would be hard to know
about any drastic changes here.

92
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,320
Instead of going through all the trouble

93
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,480
to eradicate the He family,

94
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,840
why not wait for everything to settle down
and then make use of it?

95
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,919
There were superior strategies,

96
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,120
but why choose the inferior one?

97
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:32,520
Master, school is over.

98
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,559

00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,720
A little, yes.

102
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,380
What did you learn

103

in the literacy class?

104
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:04,399
I haven't been attending
literacy classes recently.

Never mind, your wife

106
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,800
doesn't know many words anyway.

It's fine if you can't keep up.

kite-flying in the suburbs, alright?

This big tiger belongs to you.

111
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:27,060
- Do… Do I get one too?
- Of course, you are a child too.

112
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,128

- What?
- Young master, Madam.

the young emperor is going
on a hunting trip tomorrow,

Am I going too?

150
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,000
- Do you not want to?
- No.

151
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,540
It's just that in past years,
there was no precedent

152
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,180
for bringing family members to the hunt.

153
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,296
It might not be proper…

154
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,560
I understand.

Let's move to the other mansion

158
00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:11,960
after the hunting trip.

159
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,020
You love chestnuts, don't you?

160
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,680
The steward told me that
the chestnut trees there

161
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,600
have produced a lot of fruit.

162
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,159
If we go there, we can eat chestnuts every day.

163
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:23,744
Let's go.

164
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,219
As soon as we arrived at the hunting ground,
my younger brother was looking around.

165
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:42,799
I bet he's looking for you.

166
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:44,864
You're flattering me, Your Highness.

167
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,400
Although I've been conferred
the title of Princess,

168
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,840
I'm still not used

169
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,240
to you calling me that.

170
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,420
In a while,

171
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,159
I probably shouldn't call you
Your Highness anymore.

172
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,520
My father told me

173
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,920
the new king had ascended
to the throne in Xunnan.

174
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,880
The marriage alliance not
completed four years ago

175
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,960
has been brought up again.

176
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,480
You're going to be the Queen in Xunnan.

00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,559
Congratulations in advance.

That can wait until it's settled.

00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,360
But by that time,

180
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,960
many would be laughing at me.

this new King of Xunnan

182
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,120
was the unpopular Prince Yong.

183
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:21,460
He came to Jialin four years ago,

184
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,820
asking to marry He Jiuling

185
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,960
in a persistent and determined manner.

186
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,279
Rumors were all over the place.

187
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:28,919
Now he's marrying me,

188
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:31,639
and I'm just a make-do.

189
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,180
Becoming a Queen is not make-do.

190
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,340
Few men

191
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,460
would pine for a woman for four years.

192
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,880
Even if there is,

193
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,120
sooner or later, the affection would be
torn to pieces by the power

194
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,080
and boundless temptation at hand.

195
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,480
People are fickle.

196
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,260
This thing called love

197
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,559
is most worthless.

198
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,759
<i>What difference does the illusory love make?</i>

199
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:00,220
<i>I've read so many books</i>

200
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,500
<i>and I haven't seen any episode</i>

201
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,359
<i>of a love-laden story</i>

202
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:04,840
<i>having a good ending.</i>

203
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,840
<i>Rather, many get hurt due to deep love.</i>

204
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,219
- There will be a competition.
- For His Majesty to see.

205
00:15:41,219 --> 00:15:42,279
I have heard there would be many rewards.

206
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:45,000
The annual hunt is a competition itself.

207
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,800
I don't know why they have to add one

208
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,039
and invite so many people.

209
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:51,360
Are you tired?

210
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,440
I slept too well

211
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,679
and you must be tired.

212
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,639
Next time, just wake me up directly.

213
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,464
Look, they're over there.

214
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,432
Young Lord.

215
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:05,240
I'm looking forward to your score.

216
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:08,120
These years, you have been
learning famous sword techniques

217
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,960
from a famous master,

218
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,060
and finally, there is a chance for us to see.

219
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,120
We were just saying

220
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,320
you would definitely be in the top three.

221
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,320
No problem.

222
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,359
What top three?

223
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:22,200
There are many talents in the court.

224
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,680
I'm not impressive at all.

225
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,579
At most, compared to a few years ago,

226
00:16:25,579 --> 00:16:27,320
I'm just ten or eighty percent better.

227
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,900
Young Lord is being modest. Look.

228
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,920
Now,

229
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,740
I can only fight three to five people at most.

230
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,260
One person fighting three to five
people is actually quite ordinary.

231
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,940
Like the 'Cat Cradling Prince',

232
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,640
single-handedly swept half a street
of the gambling house.

233
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,320
That's really impressive.

234
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,408
You…

235
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,819
Making a mountain out of a molehill,

236
00:16:43,819 --> 00:16:44,840
who told you that?

237
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,120
Young Lord, we will leave first.

238
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,312
Let's go.

239
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:54,480
- Wait, what they said…
- Was a mountain out of a molehill.

240
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,920
We know. We understand.

241
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,200
What do you understand? You weren't there.

242
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,380
Let me tell you,

243
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,200
this thing is basically true.

244
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,500
Among all the men in Jialin,

245
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,239
I only admire the 'Cat Cradling Prince',
understand?

246
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:06,500
Yes. Yes. We do.

247
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,620
You are the epitome of humility.

248
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,440
Let's wait and watch the battle tomorrow.

249
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,300
This time, many noble ladies have come too.

250
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,120
At that time, everyone would see

251
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,759
your peerless elegance.

252
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,272
Young Master Zhang.

253
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:32,320
Where is Lord Rong?

254
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,579
He spent the whole night looking at the stars

255
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:38,480
and sent someone to tell
the Regent in the morning

256
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,256
that he wanted to rest.

257
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,528
Seriously?

258
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:45,580
I think he just doesn't want

259
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,079
to sit with his niece-in-law.

260
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,440
After all, he's not his biological child.

261
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,456
However indulged he was before,

262
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,960
he has been foolish for all these years

263
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,120
with no improvement.

264
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,560
Even if the heart was hot,

265
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,960
it would get cold eventually.

266
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,864
I know.

267
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:04,559
The Astrology Pavilion
has lost the royal favor.

268
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,000
Now it doesn't even have a decent heir.

269
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,219
With superstitions,

270
00:18:10,219 --> 00:18:12,480
no one believes it from the beginning.

271
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,679
If it weren't for the Young Master's

272
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:16,100
striking popularity

273
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,400
and the former emperor being a face-judger,

274
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,599
it would have failed long ago.

275
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,280
By now,

276
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,359
it is probably even more of a disaster.

277
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,519
The Emperor has arrived.

278
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:26,640
The Emperor is here. Let's go.

279
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:29,079
The Emperor is here.

280
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,839
Perform well during the hunting period.

281
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,339
To encourage you all to strengthen your bodies,

282
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:16,519
and also to select talents this year,

283
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:23,559
His Majesty specially held
a martial arts competition.

284
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:26,900
I hope all the young talents…

285
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,959
You are still the same as before.

286
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,359
Will actively participate.

287
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,480
Why are you laughing?

288
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:40,440
Amused by the fair match
of an evil woman and a silly man.

289
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:43,100
How could a woman

290
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,880
ask her husband to attend to her?

291
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,240
He Jiuling knows no manners.

292
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,400
She bosses people around under everyone's eyes.

293
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,240
I can't imagine what she would do in private.

294
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,760
Only Rong Yu would be so foolish

295
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,799
to tolerate her insult.

296
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,680
- The first prize is a horse and a sword.
- Wait.

297
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:03,120
For the first prize,

298
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,480
how is a sword and a horse enough?

299
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,200
Whoever gets the top spot today,

300
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,120
if they already have an official position,

301
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,400
I'll promote them.

302
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:12,340
If they are still a commoner,

303
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,160
I'll let them enter the palace directly.

304
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,224
That's very generous.

305
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,440
Your Majesty.

306
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,279
Wouldn't that be too arbitrary?

307
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:23,720
What's the matter?

308
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,079
It's the top place, right?

309
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,960
I just felt the prize was not enough.

310
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,780
Is everyone planning to have fun

311
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,100
and be done with me?

312
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,359
Or are you saying

313
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:34,360
I can't even make

314
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,559
such a small demand?

315
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:37,920
Well, it's not like that.

316
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,000
What is it then?

317
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,120
Alright.

318
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,759
All up to the Emperor's will.

319
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,136
Okay.

320
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,039
As His Majesty has said,

321
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,620
if the first winner is a court official,

322
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,480
they would be promoted.

323
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,080
If they are a civilian,

324
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,039
they will enter the court to serve.

325
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:01,600
<i>[Yuanqing Mansion]</i>

326
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,840
<i>[Closed Today]</i>
Miss He cannot participate in person.

327
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,000
According to her orders,

328
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,100
the Lord's Mansion would be empty,

329
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,119
and we commence the operation at 5 a.m.

330
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:13,279
Wang Mang wins.

331
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,440
- Be careful.
- Okay, Dad.

332
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,260
The Young Lord Zhongyong wins.

333
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,400
Good.

334
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,800
- Impressive.
- Well done, Young lord.

335
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,119
- Okay.
- Okay.

336
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,799
Are you bored from sitting here?

337
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:19,039
Let me take you to fly a kite.

338
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,880
- Do you want to go?
- Who else?

339
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:25,600
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

340
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,624
Come on,

341
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,360
Is the Young Master

342
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,039
challenging the Young Lord?

343
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,799
Congratulations on your victory, Young Lord.

344
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:39,800
My husband didn't stand up

345
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,200
to challenge the heir.

346
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,320
I apologize if there

347
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,460
has been any misunderstanding.

348
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,560
This is a contest

349
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,120
arranged by His Majesty.

350
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,760
Why is the Young Master

351
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,439
treating it like a joke?

352
00:22:50,439 --> 00:22:51,488
I'm sorry.

353
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,880
It's okay.

354
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,660
Let's say it was a misunderstanding.

355
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,939
There's no way I can compete

356
00:22:56,939 --> 00:22:58,200
with the likes of Master Rong.

357
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,240
Yeah, yeah. We all know

358
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,360
what the Young Master is like.

359
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,060
Don't make it hard for him.

360
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,799
Yeah, that's right.

361
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,160
Silence.

362
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,519
Everybody keep quiet!

363
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:22,480
Is there anyone else who wants
to try their skills with me?

364
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,480
Does anyone dare to come out

365
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,000
and challenge me?

366
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,592
Anyone?

367
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,000
Let's exchange a few moves.

368
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:35,776
Me.

369
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:40,576
If my husband doesn't want to,

370
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:42,624
I will.

371
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,559
You?

372
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,559
You're a woman.

373
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:48,640
So what? I don't recall His Majesty forbidding

374
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,400
women from participating.

375
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,319
Interesting.

376
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:55,120
Indeed, I did not say that women
can't be in the arena.

377
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,480
I am actually interested.

378
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:00,192
Your Majesty.

379
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,579
This is not right.

380
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:03,640
Why not?

381
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,920
I've heard that my royal grandmother

382
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,920
was famous for her good
martial arts and sword skills.

383
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,839
Even my royal grandfather
often exchanged moves with her.

384
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:14,160
So why can't women and men

385
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,579
have a contest?

386
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:18,720
Indeed, Your Majesty.

387
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:21,080
But He Jiuling

388
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,519
is the daughter of a criminal,

389
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:26,380
and she is not worthy
to fight with my good boy.

390
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,392
Nonsense.

391
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,080
Don't listen.

392
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:31,712
Young Master.

393
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,080
You are ill,

394
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,136
and I

395
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,040
will let this slide.

396
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,620
But I won't.

397
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,319
From now on, you are not welcome
in the Astrology Pavilion.

398
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,540
So don't come

399
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,880
for divination.

400
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,000
- Young master.
- Don't call me.

401
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:52,640
- Rong Yu.
- I'm here.

402
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:58,280
Don't let this trifle ruin the atmosphere.

403
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,680
It's just He Jiuling.

404
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:02,920
Cousin, just beat her down and be done with it.

405
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,960
I…

406
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,300
I've made up my mind.

407
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,424
He Jiuling,

408
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,504
go get a weapon.

409
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:11,328
Yes.

410
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,160
- Madam.
- Wait for me. I'll go beat him up.

411
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,816
Min.

412
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,776
Young lord, come on.

413
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,920
- Young lord.
- Min, slow down.

414
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,968
Min.

415
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:00,559
He Jiuling wins.

416
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:08,799
Let me go.

417
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,079
The young lord was defeated by her.

418
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,980
The young lord just didn't want

419
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,200
to really fight with a woman.

420
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:17,319
Anyone?

421
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,599
Does no one dare to fight?

422
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,440
I was harsh to her before.

423
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,300
I don't know if she holds a grudge.

424
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,400
Don't make eye contact with me.

425
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,359
You!

426
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:39,424
Me?

427
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,272
Come on up.

428
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,799
Mrs. Rong,

429
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:55,160
this is not a challenge.

430
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:57,100
His Majesty never said

431
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,839
the victor could not challenge anyone.

432
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,319
Your Majesty,

433
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,599
there have been rules to martial arts contests
since ancient times.

434
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,960
If the victor on the stage
can challenge anyone freely,

435
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,720
those clearly inferior to her

436
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,380
would have no way to survive.

437
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,920
She's resolving a personal vendetta.

438
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:15,920
Are you admitting to being inferior to a woman?

439
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,960
What is your family name?

440
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,640
Who is your father?

441
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:21,980
What was your ranking
in this year's spring exam?

442
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,400
I…

443
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,720
Now you're talking about rules.

444
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,920
Why didn't you follow them just now?

445
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,400
Everyone knows the Young Master
didn't study martial arts.

446
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:33,140
So why did his standing up

447
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,720
count as challenging the Young Lord

448
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:37,440
and no one was willing to back down?

449
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,120
Perhaps you have remembered it wrong.

450
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,480
It wasn't me who was causing trouble.

451
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,160
Your Majesty, my son is ignorant.
Please forgive him.

452
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,799
Go up quickly.

453
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:55,840
Stop embarrassing me.

454
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:01,599
Good. I admire your courage.

455
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,624
He was defeated so quickly.

456
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:29,519
Rong Yu is better than you in every aspect.

457
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:31,599
I warned you four years ago.

458
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,740
If I see you talking nonsense again…

459
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,180
I was wrong. I won't do it anymore.

460
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,559
I'm sorry. I won't dare ever again.

461
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:46,559
He Jiuling wins.

462
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,720
Anyone else?

463
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,020
The entire venue is suppressed by a woman.

464
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,540
- Yes.
- What is going on?

465
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,616
What a disgrace.

466
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:01,599
Who would dare to go up?

467
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:04,759
Where's Young General Yan?

468
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,784
He's over there,

469
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,360
General Yan, it's your turn.

470
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,500
Yes, that's right,

471
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,200
General Yan, come on. General Yan, go on.

472
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,480
- I won't compete.
- Lie'er.

473
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,200
Father.

474
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,440
Pick up the sword.

475
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,839
You know

476
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:22,119
I won't harm the He family again…

477
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:23,776
Take it.

478
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,048
Take this!

479
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,279
He's really bleeding.

480
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:21,824
Is he bleeding?

481
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,752
What?

482
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:30,839
He Jiuling wins.

483
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:35,160
She even defeated General He,

484
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,359
Good.

485
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:37,440
That was great.

486
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:40,608
Impressive.

487
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:45,888
You…

488
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:50,119
If no one dares to fight again,

489
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,179
He Jiuling will be the winner
of this competition.

490
00:30:53,179 --> 00:30:54,279
When He Jiuling is like this,

491
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,599
nobody can beat her, right?

492
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,380
- Lord Li.
- Yes.

493
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,720
Didn't you say

494
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,319
that you've invited all the young talents
from the capital?

495
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:08,680
How can they not match up
to a woman from the backyard?

496
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,328
I…

497
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:14,219
I apologize.

498
00:31:14,219 --> 00:31:16,079
You apologize all the time

499
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:17,759
and it's useless.

500
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:21,359
I will reward her personally.

501
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,100
As for the reward I add…

502
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,319
He Jiuling,

503
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:26,960
do you want to enter the palace
as a military officer?

504
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:29,184
T-This…

505
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:33,699
Your Majesty, please reconsider.

506
00:31:33,699 --> 00:31:35,920
Your Majesty, although she is married,

507
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,359
she's still once a part of the He family.

508
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,920
The officials are right.

509
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:46,100
The competition is not over yet

510
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,060
and it's still too early
to make a conclusion now.

511
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,519
I still want to challenge someone.

512
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,519
Who can fight with you?

513
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,960
The Young Master can.

514
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,600
What?

515
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:02,688
What is she doing?

516
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:11,232
Come on.

517
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,960
What is this about?

518
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:40,240
Hold it and stab me.

519
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,120
Stab you?

520
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,200
- W-What?
- Rong Yu, take the sword.

521
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,960
Stab me.

522
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,112
I…

523
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,056
Stab this way.

524
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:17,640
How can this count?

525
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,688
Does it hurt?

526
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,288
No.

527
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,640
- This is child's play!
- The Young Master of Astrology Pavilion wins.

528
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:40,300
So, Rong Yu is the winner

529
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,344
of this competition?

530
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:43,319
That's absurd.

531
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:48,799
This is an arena,

532
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,440
and it's a competition.

533
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,160
What you just did was obviously fake,

534
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:55,240
and I will not pretend not to see it.

535
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:57,600
I wasn't faking it.

536
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,559
The only one who can defeat Jiuling

537
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,464
is Rong Yu.

538
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,279
Beside him,

539
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:07,800
no one else can make me

540
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,840
willingly fail.

541
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:12,639
That's true.

542
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,320
I defeated other people

543
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,340
and the Young Master defeated me,

544
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,399
so, he's the winner.

545
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,408
At least,

546
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,760
I think so in my heart.

547
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,260
Since you are the winner,

548
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,840
I will grant you, Rong Yu,

549
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,920
The role of the Commanding Inspector.

550
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,919
Your Majesty, there's no such position.

551
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:35,000
Then, we'll create one.

552
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,800
No need to do much.

553
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,859
You just oversee the generals,

554
00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:40,800
commanders and the like.

555
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,159
See whether they are doing their job.

556
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:47,000
So this position is higher
than generals and commanders.

557
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:48,608
It is decided.

558
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,976
Yes.

559
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,248
Congratulations.

560
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:02,800
wait for me,

561
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,928
Rong Yu.

562
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,639
I'm tired. I can't walk anymore.

563
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:16,760
Rong Yu,

564
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,039
why are you upset?

565
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,020
Is it because I made the decision

566
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,199
without asking you?

567
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:27,680
Just take a look at them now, all of them

568
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,040
are sulked and speechless.

569
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,160
Who dares to defy you now?

570
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,559
Even if they are aggrieved,

571
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,680
they have to call you,

572
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,100
Lord Inspector.

573
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,300
Here, apart from His Majesty,

574
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,580
you are the highest-ranking.

575
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,840
You asked me to pick up the sword

576
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:44,320
and stab you.

577
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:47,119
Well,

578
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,880
of course, I'd dodge.

579
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,320
Okay, I see.

580
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,920
It's my fault.

581
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,159
It won't happen again.

582
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,520
He Jiuling.

583
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,000
You should at least act
like a martial artist, okay?

584
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:04,159
You need to know the limit when wooing a man.

585
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:05,580
Can't you see he's distant?

586
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,320
Stop embarrassing yourself.

587
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,599
This is not your business.

588
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:12,300
Also, Young Lord, you're wrong.

589
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,100
I am not wooing any man.

590
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,840
I am wooing my husband.

591
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:19,712
I…

592
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:21,940
The Three Obediences and Four Virtues

593
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,519
have certainly brought great harm.

594
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:30,121
<i>♫ Under the setting sun in dusk ♫</i>

595
00:36:32,342 --> 00:36:38,141
<i>♫ I travel far for thousands of miles ♫</i>

596
00:36:38,141 --> 00:36:45,111
<i>♫ Playing the zither under the moonlight ♫</i>

597
00:36:46,325 --> 00:36:52,497
<i>♫ The drinks won't let me forget ♫</i>

598
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:59,450
<i>♫ The longing I write down for you ♫</i>

599
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:06,106
<i>♫ Our fate is written on paper ♫</i>

600
00:37:06,106 --> 00:37:10,405
<i>♫ Just like the strongest wine ♫</i>

601
00:37:10,405 --> 00:37:13,820
<i>♫ There's no escape for destiny ♫</i>

602
00:37:14,742 --> 00:37:20,826
<i>♫ Looking back, I see you waiting ♫</i>

603
00:37:20,826 --> 00:37:27,994
<i>♫ Our lives are filled with joy and sorrow ♫</i>

604
00:37:27,994 --> 00:37:34,929
<i>♫ The longings crystalize
into a bright galaxy ♫</i>

605
00:37:34,929 --> 00:37:42,746
<i>♫ You turned around quietly
and closed the marriage book ♫</i>

606
00:37:42,746 --> 00:37:48,346
<i>♫ Asking how many stars there are in the sky ♫</i>

607
00:38:14,582 --> 00:38:20,154
<i>♫ The longing I write down for you ♫</i>

608
00:38:21,718 --> 00:38:27,322
<i>♫ Our fate is written on paper ♫</i>

609
00:38:27,322 --> 00:38:31,356
<i>♫ Just like the strongest wine ♫</i>

610
00:38:31,766 --> 00:38:34,298
<i>♫ There's no escape for destiny ♫</i>

611
00:38:35,862 --> 00:38:41,914
<i>♫ Looking back, I see you waiting ♫</i>

612
00:38:41,914 --> 00:38:48,954
<i>♫ Our lives are filled with joy and sorrow ♫</i>

613
00:38:48,954 --> 00:38:56,151
<i>♫ The longings crystalize
into a bright galaxy ♫</i>

614
00:38:56,155 --> 00:39:03,418
<i>♫ Gently I stroke the zither,
waiting for a passerby like you ♫</i>

615
00:39:04,022 --> 00:39:10,182
<i>♫ Turns out you are my inextricable destiny ♫</i>
