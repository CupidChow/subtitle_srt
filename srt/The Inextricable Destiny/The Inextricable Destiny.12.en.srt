3
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:48,736
Stop.

4
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,160
Go.

5
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:54,880
Go.

6
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,552
Go.

7
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,048
They're arresting people again.

<i>[Wanted Notice]</i>

9
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,599
What crime did they commit?

10
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,472
Go.

11
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,639
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:23,712
I can't help you.

13
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,312
All I can tell you is

14
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,360
run.

15
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,080
Run as far as you can.

16
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,800
If someone wants to place blame,
they will always find an excuse.

17
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,120
No one can save you.

18
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,159
Get away!

19
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,879
Get away!

20
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,800
Go as far as you can.

21
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,319
Get away now!

22
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,448
What's the matter?

23
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,120
Are you scared to die with

24
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,880
Father and our brothers?

25
00:02:59,424 --> 00:03:00,480
Jiuling,

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,048
I'm not scared.

27
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,680
You will be the only one survived
in our family.

28
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:20,800
What are we doing here?

29
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,039
- He San. He San.
- Who?

30
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,184
Hurry. It's the escapee of the He family.

31
00:03:25,184 --> 00:03:26,240
What are you doing?

32
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,400
Why do you come to Rong's Mansion blatantly?

33
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
When you see the jade pendant,
it is as if you see the Emperor.

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,520
You are just guardians.

35
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,759
How dare you!

36
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:34,520
Aren't you afraid of offending the Emperor?

37
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,616
Get out of my way, all of you.

38
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,800
This dragon pendant can only work for a while.

39
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,936
A while is enough.

40
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:41,536
Rong Yu.

41
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,680
Rong Yu.

42
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:46,520
Come out. Jiuling's here to see you.

43
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,584
Rong Yu.

44
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,240
Young master, please have some soup.

45
00:03:56,128 --> 00:03:57,216
Rong Yu.

46
00:03:57,728 --> 00:03:58,759
He Jiuling's here to see you.

47
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,800
He San, put me down.

48
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,856
Rong Yu.

49
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,152
He Jiuling.

50
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,912
He Jiuling.

51
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,400
What's wrong with you?

52
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,400
He San,

53
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,479
what the hell are you doing?

54
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,080
They are over there.

55
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,240
Hurry up.

56
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,279
Master Rong.

57
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,319
I'll entrust Jiuling to you from now on, okay?

58
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,199
Marry Jiuling now.

59
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,480
You want me to get married at a time like this?

60
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,712
Jiuling,

61
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,720
we have no other choice now.

62
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,800
But, what does this have to do

63
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,160
with whether I get married or not?

64
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,839
The He family is guilty,

65
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,959
but it should not affect an outsider.

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,439
Outsider?

67
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,519
They're in the young master's courtyard.
Hurry up!

68
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,440
Hurry up.

69
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,800
They're in the young master's courtyard.

70
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,160
Open the door. Hurry up!

71
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,800
So, you don't want me
to be part of the He family?

72
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,864
I don't.

73
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,656
Hurry. Open the door!

74
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,639
Capture them and execute them immediately.

75
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,680
The young master is inside. Don't harm him.

76
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,680
Go. Hurry. Open the door!

77
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,040
He Qiuting, who do you think you are?

78
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,079
What gives you the right
to not want me in the He family?

79
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,480
What gives you the right
to marry me to the Rong family?

80
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,800
Because I'm your brother.

81
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,360
Jiuling,

82
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,360
you have never treated me as your brother,

83
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,399
nor have you ever called me brother.

84
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,279
But Father and older brothers are not here,

85
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,519
you have to listen to me.

86
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,519
Rong Yu,

87
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:27,879
about the past marriage contract,

88
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,680
it was our fault.

89
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,199
We owe you an apology.

90
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,928
Do you still want to

91
00:05:32,928 --> 00:05:34,600
spend the rest of your life

92
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,360
with He Jiuling and never part with her again?

93
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,879
Open the door!

94
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:40,360
Then you now kneel with her
before heaven and earth

95
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,000
and marry her as your wife, is that okay?

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,519
I don't want to.

97
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:44,576
Hurry. Break it open!

98
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,519
Open the door. Break it open. Hurry up!

99
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,720
Open the door. Hurry. Open the door.

100
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,688
He San.

101
00:05:56,032 --> 00:05:57,040
Open the door.

102
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,199
Jiuling,

103
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,519
I once told you,

104
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:02,319
if you want to rob,
I'll dispose of the stolen goods for you.

105
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,600
If you want to steal a flower,
I'll keep watch for you.

106
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,040
If you want to kill someone,
I'll help you hide the body.

107
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,199
But now you're going to be killed,

108
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,879
I'll stand in your way.

109
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,959
I'm useless.

110
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,759
I can't save Father.

111
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,319
I can't save elder brothers
and sisters-in-laws.

112
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,639
He San!

113
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,040
I can at least save you.

114
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:46,279
Today is my sister's wedding day.

115
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,959
Welcome to the ceremony.

116
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,152
Get him!

117
00:07:28,896 --> 00:07:30,016
Rong Yu,

118
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,720
I beg you to take good care of Jiuling.

119
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,399
She always thinks she's very smart,

120
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,800
but she's actually very naive.

121
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,160
And she's particularly strong-willed.

122
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,439
No matter how much it hurts,
how much she aches,

123
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:42,160
she won't cry for herself.

124
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,199
She is so strong-willed.

125
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,600
She has only shed tears for you

126
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,920
in the past.

127
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,759
Don't make her cry anymore in the future.

128
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,040
Young master.

129
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,920
What does it matter
if she's wanted by the court?

130
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,040
Do you really want her to die

131
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,360
and leave the young master sad?

132
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,519
- Jiuling.
- Don't stand in my way.

133
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,120
It's very dangerous.
Stop the young master from stepping forward.

134
00:08:08,672 --> 00:08:09,696
- Young master.
- Jiuling.

135
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,240
He Jiuling.

136
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,560
He Jiuling.

137
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,439
Jiuling. Jiuling.

138
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,048
He Jiuling.

139
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,279
You will be the only one survived
in our family.

140
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,279
Don't let me die in vain.

141
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,759
I beg you.

142
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,456
Get down on you kneel.

143
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,008
Hurry up.

144
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,504
First kowtow.

145
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,759
Young master, hurry. Kneel with Miss He.

146
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,399
First kowtow.

147
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,224
To Heaven and earth.

148
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,960
Second kowtow.

149
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:51,840
To Brothers.

150
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,792
Young master, hurry up.

151
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,360
Father. Father. Father.

152
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,559
<i>- I'll kill you
- Father.</i>

153
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:43,639
<i>Father, if you got her a scar,
my brother-in-law will ask for a return.</i>

154
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,360
<i>Father, don't be muddled. Father.</i>

155
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,360
<i>Father.</i>

156
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,600
<i>How do you want to style your hair?</i>

157
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,879
<i>I'll go to learn it.</i>

158
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:57,559
<i>From now on,
you can just sit here every morning</i>

159
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:59,000
<i>and I'll comb your hair for you.</i>

160
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,679
Third brother!

161
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,960
<i>Regardless, I have helped you with one thing.</i>

162
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,519
<i>When siblings work together,
their strength can cut through metal.</i>

163
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,679
<i>I will definitely protect you.</i>

164
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:25,960
<i>Make sure you are happy and carefree.</i>

165
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,440
He Jiuling.

166
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,720
He Jiuling.

167
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,200
He Jiuling.

168
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,480
He Jiuling.

169
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,328
He Jiuling.

170
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,240
Get He Jiuling.

171
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,296
Yes.

172
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:03,679
Young master and young madam
have completed their rites just now.

173
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,200
Who dares to harm the young madam?

174
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,200
You can't take my wife away.

175
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:18,799
Young master,
your marriage is just child's play.

176
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:22,279
Zhanping said, if we completed the rites,
we are husband and wife.

177
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,840
You can't take away my wife.

178
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,080
The He family was sentenced to extermination.

179
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,480
Even if you have got married,

180
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,000
it still happened after the sentence.

181
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,639
He Jiuling must be taken away
by the order of the Ministry of justice.

182
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,360
Don't you think she can get acquitted

183
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:36,128
by the dishonest measure.

184
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:42,016
Lord Rong,

185
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,639
do you agree?

186
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:46,720
Uncle.

187
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,039
You should take me as well then.

188
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,480
I have married He Jiuling.

189
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,519
I am also a member of the He family now.

190
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,640
Uh.

191
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,336
Lord Song.

192
00:13:07,872 --> 00:13:08,960
Yes.

193
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,399
They did get married in a hurry.

194
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,799
But the engagement was set long ago.

195
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,000
He Jiuling is a member of the Rong family.

196
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,639
She shouldn't bear the sins of the He family.

197
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,919
Lord Rong,

198
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,399
how could you be so confused?

199
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,919
Back then, He Jiuling ran off to Nanjiang.

200
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:26,960
Everyone knows

201
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,120
she was escaping from the marriage.

202
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,440
Now, she's using the marriage pact

203
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,039
to save her life.

204
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:33,559
How ruthless of her.

205
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:35,919
How can you let her do this!

206
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,919
So, do you want to take Yu with you too?

207
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:44,679
I certainly won't take the young master.

208
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,000
He is just acting impulsively now.

209
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:48,639
After a while,

210
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,159
he will surely forget about her.

211
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:54,752
I'm afraid he won't.

212
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:12,799
Zhanping, go take care of Heshan.

213
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:13,960
I will take care of her.

214
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,776
Don't be afraid.

215
00:14:55,776 --> 00:14:56,800
He Jiuling.

216
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,464
Don't be afraid.

217
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,399
General He,

218
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,000
He Qiuting has died.

219
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:21,279
This is his belongs.

220
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,600
You can have this before the execution.

221
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,360
Father, what did he just say?

222
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,519
Qiuting, what happened to Qiuting?

223
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,399
D-d-did he say

224
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,879
that he ran away?

225
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,376
This kid

226
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,600
is usually timid and afraid of pain.

227
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,759
He is good at nothing

228
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:05,559
but running away.

229
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,648
It's good that he ran away.

230
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,039
I always knew that he could run away.

231
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,216
It's good that he ran away.

232
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:15,552
It's good that he ran away.

233
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,448
It's good that he ran away.

234
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,319
Young master, don't cover her anymore.

235
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:31,039
The young madam
has already been covered with so many quilts.

236
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,359
If you cover her more, she will be smothered.

237
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,559
But her hands are so cold.

238
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:38,400
I will make her a hand warmer.

239
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,319
The hand warmer is too hot.

240
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,599
The young master
knows to hold her like this all the time.

241
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:45,920
Then holding her like this all the time
is the right thing to do.

242
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,799
The quilts are too stuffy.

243
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,079
You'll suffocate her, young master.

244
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,712
Alright then.

245
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:07,519
Young master,

246
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,960
t-t-today is not a good day.

247
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,319
I wonder if the young madam will wake up.

248
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:18,680
When it's noon,

249
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,160
I'll go to collect her families'…

250
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What time is it now?

251
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,119
- Young madam. You woke up!
- You woke up!

252
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,079
Prepare the horse.

253
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,976
Yang Ying.

254
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:14,784
I'm sorry.

255
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,519
If there is a next life,

256
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,880
I want to love you passionately.

257
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,000
<i>You just have to say it every day.</i>

258
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,319
<i>I love you.</i>

259
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:13,039
<i>In this way, he will be pretty</i>

260
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,359
<i>and happy to be your child.</i>

261
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,160
<i>Oldest brother, you have to say this too.</i>

262
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,359
<i>No, I can't.</i>

263
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:19,519
<i>Say it.</i>

264
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:20,920
<i>Say it.</i>

265
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,039
<i>Say it.</i>

266
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:23,072
<i>Say it.</i>

267
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,000
I love you.

268
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,152
I love you too.

269
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,520
<i>[Order]</i>

270
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,960
Execute.

271
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,968
Stop the carriage.

272
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,480
Zhanping, stop the carriage.

273
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,400
The loyal soul never dies,

274
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,720
awaiting the day of redress.

275
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:21,720
Farewell,

276
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,160
Father.

277
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,440
<i>Father!</i>

278
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,119
<i>My sweet daughter!</i>

279
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:54,599
Farewell, oldest brother and sister-in-law.

280
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:09,152
<i>How adorable!</i>

281
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,559
Farewell, second brother and sister-in-law.

282
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,784
<i>Thank you.</i>

283
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:29,279
<i>Come on, I'm here.</i>

284
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,480

I'm okay.

303
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,624
This is yours.

304
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:10,848
Keep it for now.

305
00:28:33,696 --> 00:28:34,799
Young master.

306
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,800
Today we have to go to the Astrology Pavilion.
Don't forget about it.

307
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,839
The garden of the Astrology Pavilion

308
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:59,400
is more beautiful than here.

309
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,079
The wintersweets bloom particularly well there.

310
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:04,640
Heshan said, those were all

311
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,000
planted by me.

312
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,400
Do you want to go and see them?

313
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:18,599
It's not snowing outside.

314
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:21,400
There are some shops open on the street.

315
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:25,880
Young master, it'll be late
if you don't go now.

316
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,200
When you want to go out,

317
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,920
just tell me.

318
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,440
Young madam, the lord wants to see you.

319
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,080
Young madam.

320
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:15,359
It should be me paying respects to you.

321
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:18,976
I should also apologize.

322
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,839
I would never forget your kindness

323
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:24,039
for saving my third brother that day.

324
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,799
Why are you…

325
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:33,759
The lord has stripped me of my role
as young master's personal guard.

326
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:35,480
He asked me to leave the Rong's mansion

327
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,680
and never set foot in it again.

328
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:39,168
Leave?

329
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,232
I will tell young master and Zhanping

330
00:30:43,232 --> 00:30:44,640
that I will go back to see my families.

331
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:46,880
So please keep the secret for me, young madam.

332
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:51,359
What about afterwards?

333
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:53,799
Things will get better afterwards.

334
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,640
I'm just an insignificant person.

335
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,400
No one will remember me

336
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,440
after a while.

337
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,039
Loss and gain.

338
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,279
Meeting and parting.

339
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,952
It happens a lot.

340
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:07,920
Don't blame yourself, young madam.

341
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,759
And don't plead with the lord.

342
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,079
Otherwise, it might be even worse.

343
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,319
Just keep the secret for me.

344
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,080
Gain.

345
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,296
Loss.

346
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,120
Meeting.

347
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,424
Parting.

348
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:33,440
It happens a lot

349
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:35,880
only for acquaintances.

350
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,128

<i>If you never fully commit to anyone again,</i>

00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:53,240

<i>[Remember Forever]</i>

355
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,519
I heard that your left hand hurt again.

356
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,839
A minor injury. It's not a problem.

357
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,464
That's fine.

358
00:32:12,192 --> 00:32:13,312
I asked you to come here today

359
00:32:13,952 --> 00:32:15,079
to remind you of something.

360
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:17,519
I allowed you to marry to Rong Yu,

361
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:19,960
so you should abide by the rules here.

362
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:25,000
When elders admonish, you should kneel.

<i>[Spirit tablet of Rong Zhizhi]</i>

364
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:40,800
Being a wife,

365
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,559
you should prioritize your husband.

366
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,080
If your husband does not return,

367
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,319
you should not eat or sleep first.

368
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,328
When your husband is home,

369
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,119
you should take care of him

370
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,200
and worry his worries.

371
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,519
You shouldn't let him worry for you.

372
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,240
Do you understand?

373
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:04,480
Yes.

374
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,880
When he's ill,

375
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,240
you should sleep in separate beds.

376
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,039
Nowadays,

377
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:12,160
Rong Yu and you are sleeping separately.

378
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,519
But I think

379
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,960
the one sleeping outside

380
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,440
should not be Rong Yu, right?

381
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,759
We will switch back tonight.

382
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,279
I don't care
whether you practice martial arts in the past.

383
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:30,464
But now,

384
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,279
Rong Yu's body is weak.

385
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:34,400
He cannot stand such things.

386
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,759
Put away your swords.

387
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,160
Forget about

388
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:42,784
all the martial arts thing.

389
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:44,416
As for what happened to the He family,

390
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:47,000
it is your fortune

391
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,079
to survive.

392
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:50,079
From now on,

393
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:52,039
just be your young madam.

394
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,160
If I know

395
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,799
you are not reconciled to your life,

396
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:57,799
I will punish you with the family rules.

397
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,240
I will send you some women's teachings.

398
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:03,839
You have to copy them a hundred times first.

399
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:07,904
Yes.

400
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,320
In a few days,

401
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,960
Lord Song from the Ministry of Justice
will hold a promotion banquet.

402
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,559
Rong Yu and you will attend it
and take some gifts

403
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:17,480
on behalf of the Rong family
and the Astrology Pavilion.

404
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,032
Yes.

405
00:34:23,968 --> 00:34:27,239
<i>[Astrology Pavilion]</i>

406
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,519
The sky is blue and the earth is yellow.

407
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,239
The sky is blue and the earth is yellow.

408
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,440
The universe is boundless
and the time is endless.

409
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,199
The universe is boundless
and the time is endless.

410
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:40,480
The sun rises and sets.
The moon gets full and wanes.

411
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,800
The sun rises and sets.
The moon gets full and wanes.

412
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,719
The stars studded the sky.

413
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,360
Young master, you should have turned the page.

414
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,360
The stars studded the sky.

415
00:34:48,896 --> 00:34:50,079
Okay.

416
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,239
Let's stop here today.

417
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,079
You must imitate the copybook carefully
after you get home.

418
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:57,400
Next time we will learn new characters.

419
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:01,440
School's over. School's over. School's over.

420
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,800
Time to go home.
Young master. Young master. Young master.

421
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,840
Young master. Young master. Young master.

422
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,760
Young master. Young master. Young master.

423
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,320
Young master.

424
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:14,784
Have a taste of this.

425
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,639
How can you give him a pastry

426
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:18,239
that you have taken a bite of?

427
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:19,880
I really couldn't resist it

428
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,840
during the class.

429
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,400
Did you learn all the characters
in today's lesson, young master?

430
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,664
Then there's no need to worry. I didn't either.

431
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:32,760
Young master, I studied very hard today.

432
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,519
Can you reward me with a head pat?

433
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,599
Me too. Me too.

434
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:40,719
I want a pat, too.

435
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:41,719
Me too. Me too.

436
00:35:46,496 --> 00:35:49,440
Okay, I don't have time to play with you today.

437
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,480
I need to go back and accompany my wife.

438
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,360
Why does your wife need company?

439
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,400
Yes, why?

440
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,760
Because,

441
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,559
because she's unhappy.

442
00:35:57,559 --> 00:36:00,440
You can cheer her up
with some candied hawthorns.

443
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,639
You could also buy her a pet cricket.

444
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:04,000
Are you dumb?

445
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,119
We are fortunetellers.

446
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,559
We should use the methods we learned
in the Astrology Pavilion to solve this.

447
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:11,760
Young master,
do you know when is your wife's birthday?

448
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,519
I will let my father cast a forecast
for your wife

449
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:15,559
to see if there's a way
to solve the wife's problems.

450
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,920
Little brother, it's not the wife.

451
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,719
She's young master's wife.

452
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:21,800
We should call her young madam.

453
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,440
So, when is our young madam's birthday?

454
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:28,519
She's not our young madam.

455
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,239
She's young master's young madam.

456
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:33,519
It's on the 22nd day of the twelfth month
in the sixth year of Zhenyuan era.

457
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:34,719
Isn't that three days away?

458
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,239
Leave the divination to me.

459
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:40,360
Young master, isn't this a great opportunity?

460
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,639
Have you prepared a fun birthday present

461
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:43,840
to make her happy?

462
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,880
Yes, yes.

463
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:46,880
A birthday present?

464
00:36:51,296 --> 00:36:55,987
<i>♫ Under the setting sun in dusk ♫</i>

465
00:36:58,208 --> 00:37:04,007
<i>♫ I travel far for thousands of miles ♫</i>
