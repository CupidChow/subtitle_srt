<i>[The Inextricable Destiny]</i>

2
00:01:31,616 --> 00:01:34,336
<i>[Episode 11]</i>

3
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:40,256
Young master.

4
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,599
Rong Yu, I will tear you apart.

5
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,480
He Jiuling,

6
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,480
come here.

7
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,599
Young master.

8
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:52,672
Go away!

9
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:54,976
Young master.

10
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,959
What was wrong with you last night?

11
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,359
I can accept your usual unruliness.

12
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,959
But why did you

13
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,959
stay with him last night?

14
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,640
If other people know about this,

15
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,120
how can you get married in the future?

16
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,800
I don't plan to get married.

17
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:17,344
A-And he doesn't understand anything.
Don't imagine things.

18
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,800
Why is your room

19
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,824
such a mess?

20
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,960
That's because I couldn't sleep last night.

21
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,439
So I practiced some martial arts.

22
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,456
Step back.

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,080
Stand farther away.

24
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,319
Why are your lips swollen?

25
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,072
They are?

26
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,824
Alright.

27
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,240
D-D-Don't overthink it.

28
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,080
Look at your guilty expression.

29
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,984
You don't need to explain.

30
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,520
I totally understand.

31
00:02:56,864 --> 00:02:57,879
Rong Yu!

32
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,400
- He San!
- You--

33
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,639
He San, you've frightened him.

34
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,039
Get out of my sight.

35
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,800
Go back to your own mansion.

36
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,728
It was the Astrology Festival a few days ago,
and everyone was very busy.

37
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,000
We let our guard down after seeing him do well.

38
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,199
We didn't expect him to take the chance
to leave the Astrology Pavilion.

39
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:17,319
If it weren't for your message, I'm afraid…

40
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,919
Don't mention it.

41
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,199
Meeting him

42
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,032
was just a coincidence.

43
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,159
I don't know if it's a coincidence or not.

44
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,479
Every time the young master gets lost,

45
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,039
it seems to have something to do with you.

46
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,879
But it also seems to
have nothing to do with you.

47
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,879
He got lost before?

48
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,120
He's gotten lost twice in recent years.

49
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,680
The first time was three years ago.

50
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,159
The young master wanted
to eat wontons on the street.

51
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,479
Zhanping bought the wontons,

52
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,800
and the young master was gone in a blink.

53
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,080
<i>Young master,</i>

54
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,360
<i>I need a prescription to dispense medicine.</i>

55
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,919
<i>I can't give you medicine
without a prescription.</i>

56
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,280
<i>How about</i>

57
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,680
<i>you ask someone else to come over?</i>

58
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,800
<i>There's no time.</i>

59
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,280
<i>He Jiuling is sick. She needs medicine.</i>

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
<i>Well… Young master! Young master!</i>

61
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,759
<i>- Young master!
- Young master.</i>

62
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,120
<i>Young master, how did you get here?</i>

63
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,192
<i>Let's go. Let's go home.</i>

64
00:04:12,736 --> 00:04:13,792
<i>The medicine!</i>

65
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:14,879
<i>Young master.</i>

66
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,968
<i>The medicine!</i>

67
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,839
<i>The medicine! The medicine!</i>

68
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,639
Was it February three years ago?

69
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,399
How did you know?

70
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,160
The other time was last winter.

71
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,759
The young master ran even further.

72
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,920
He said, "He Jiuling is cold."

73
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,768
Miss He?

74
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,808
Miss He?

75
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,199
It's okay.

76
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,680
I was just a bit absent-minded.

77
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:30,519
The young master wanted to find you.

78
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,680
But he didn't know where you were.

79
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,199
So he went towards the cold

80
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,319
and towards where there was water.

81
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,600
When we found him,

82
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,920
both of his feet had frostbite.

83
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,079
Blood spurted from his boots,

84
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,680
and ice got in.

85
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,208
Miss He.

86
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,600
Why are you crying?

87
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,848
I'm happy.

88
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,639
I'm happy that you're fine.

89
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,639
I'm happy that you can talk again.

90
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,600
I'm happy we can see each other again.

91
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,240
I'm so happy that I want to cry.

92
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,920
Then I also want to cry.

93
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,639
No.

94
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:21,519
No, you can't cry.

95
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,680
I like your smile.

96
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:26,240
You'll always have to smile in the future.

97
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,952
I had the plague once.

98
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,648
The doctor said

99
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,040
I only had a month to live.

100
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,720
But I had to survive.

101
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:43,199
Not just for a month.

102
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,800
Not just for a year.

103
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,160
I had to live my whole life.

104
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,160
Otherwise,

105
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,519
no one could change you back

106
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,000
to that smart and talented Rong Yu,

107
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,439
and you would never be truly happy
in your life.

108
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,399
And that winter,

109
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,000
I was trapped by a snowstorm
by the Canglan River,

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,160
and I was cold and sleepy,

111
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:09,279
with a pack of hungry wolves staring at me.

112
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,199
They were waiting for me to sleep.

113
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,439
But I couldn't let them get me.

114
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:17,480
I just shot a snow wolf
and got its hide for you.

115
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,040
I hadn't made you a cape yet.

116
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,720
How could I sleep?

117
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,000
But how did you know I was sick?

118
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,399
How did you know I was cold?

119
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,040
Did you read the stars again?

120
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,752
What is star reading?

121
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,720
I just know many things.

122
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,079
You're the best

123
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,112
in Jialin.

124
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,519
In the future,

125
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,759
could you perhaps stop worrying about me?

126
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,376
I'm not worth it.

127
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,352
What does that mean?

128
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,079
I mean, you should stop running around

129
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,160
and stop making people worried.

130
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,680
Eat what you want to eat,

131
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,680
and do what you like to do.

132
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,240
Don't care about others.

133
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,439
Just make sure you are happy.

134
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:17,399
I'm very happy right now.

135
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,199
Then you and Heshan

136
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,240
should return home happily.

137
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,079
Let's go home together.

138
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,759
You should go to your home.

139
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,240
I won't go with you.

140
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,696
Aren't…

141
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,399
aren't you coming together?

142
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,232
I'm not going.

143
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,440
I still have unfinished business.

144
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,080
Just wait for me at Rong's mansion, will you?

145
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:51,840
Rong Yu,

146
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,519
you said you would listen to me,

147
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,224
right?

148
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,392
I promise,

149
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,720
I will go to Rong's mansion to see you,

150
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,328
okay?

151
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,600
He Jiuling,

152
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,399
why are you crying
like you are parting forever?

153
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,639
How did you become so silly

154
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,159
after staying with Rong Yu for a day?

155
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:26,320
Can't you, a man,
be a bit more straightforward?

156
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,440
He Jiuling dislikes men

157
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,120
who are clingy and indecisive.

158
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,639
The more troublesome you are,
the more she will dislike you.

159
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:32,640
Do you understand?

160
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,840
Is that so?

161
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,480
Alright, you guys should go back quickly.

162
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,519
Don't let Lord Rong

163
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,639
blame his escape

164
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,120
on Jiuling again.

165
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,376
Stop crying.

166
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,200
Rong Yu!

167
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,720
- Rong Yu!
- Jiuling!

168
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,664
Jiuling!

169
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:29,664
Rong Yu!

170
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,600
Don't listen to He San.

171
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,680
He's not correct.

172
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,960
Even if everyone else rejects you,

173
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,552
I won't.

174
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,639
No matter what you become,

175
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,919
you will always be my best Rong Yu.

176
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:14,080
Truly, every creature has its nemesis.

177
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:17,039
I originally thought
that for a person like He Jiuling,

178
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,840
no man would be able to conquer her.

179
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,639
I didn't expect it would be such a man.

180
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,320
Chenzhou!

181
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,640
Yan Zhao,

182
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,000
you've served under me for many years.

183
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,480
We have gone through life and death together.

184
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,720
We were like sworn brothers.

185
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,879
I didn't expect

186
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:04,320
that you would have drawn your sword

187
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,120
against my family today.

188
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,240
The evidence is conclusive
that you have committed treason.

189
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,639
For the sake of the country and my family,

190
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:19,720
I can't spare you
out of personal considerations.

191
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:22,519
I am just following the order.

192
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,360
His Majesty gave the order

193
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,759
that when you arrive in the capital,

194
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:28,120
you will be arrested.

195
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,279
I hope you

196
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:32,480
will not make things difficult for me.

197
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,559
So His Majesty summoned us

198
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,919
back to the capital to arrest us.

199
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,216
Chenzhou.

200
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,120
Enough!

201
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:07,840
If His Majesty wants us to die,

202
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,399
we have no choice but to die.

203
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,056
General,

204
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,879
considering our friendship,

205
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:26,480
please don't make things difficult
for the women of our family.

206
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,480
Okay, I will guarantee you that.

207
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,440
We won't tie up Ms. Li.

208
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,559
And your servants will get a decent burial.

209
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,960
Jiuling!

210
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,120
Tan!

211
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,480
Jiuling!

212
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,576
Tan?

213
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:38,799
Tan?

214
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:40,992
Don't go back to the capital.

215
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,639
What's happening?

216
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:46,320
The imperial court didn't plan
to reward your family at all.

217
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,519
General He, Master Chenzhou,
and Master Qingxing

218
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,679
have all been arrested.

219
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,120
If you and Master Qiuting go back,

220
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,720
you will also be arrested.

221
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,559
What?

222
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,600
What are you saying?

223
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,752
What happened to Qingxing?

224
00:14:58,752 --> 00:15:01,664
<i>[He's Mansion]</i>

225
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:19,968
How is it?

226
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,519
The mansion is full of people

227
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:23,720
waiting for us to walk into the trap.

228
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,720
If we enter the mansion without knowing it,

229
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,480
we will be arrested.

230
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,399
What exactly is happening?

231
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:31,840
Why is our family accused of treason?

232
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:34,639
What should we do now?

233
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,559
It is a totally groundless accusation.

234
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:39,679
There must be a misunderstanding.

235
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:44,480
He San, don't you know people
from the Ministry of Justice?

236
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,559
Right, let's go find Minister Zhang.

237
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:48,840
He is Chenzhou's teacher.

238
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,840
I think he will help us.

239
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,960
Let's set off now.

240
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,279
Time is of the essence. Let's go.

241
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,720
Yang Ying?

242
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,799
It's okay.

243
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:01,960
I'm just worried about Qingxing.

244
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,200
Given his character,

245
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,440
he wouldn't give up without a fight.

246
00:16:06,656 --> 00:16:07,744
I'm afraid

247
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,519
he must have suffered.

248
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,759
Sister-in-law, I'm sorry.

249
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,759
Since my father and I won't plead guilty,

250
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:51,120
there won't be any doctors coming.

251
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,480
Whether you admit guilt or not,

252
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,639
we can't escape from death anyway.

253
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:01,480
Your elder brother will have me
and the baby in my belly by his side

254
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,544
on the road to the netherworld.

255
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,640
We won't be lonely as a family of three.

256
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,799
It's us, the He family, that owe you.

257
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,839
You don't owe me anything.

258
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,559
Having found the love of my life

259
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:36,240
and accompanying him in death brings me joy.

260
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,240
This is the decision I made four years ago.

261
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,359
As long as Qiuting, Jiuling,

262
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:50,079
and Yang Ying can escape this disaster,
it's enough.

263
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,040
Qiuting.

264
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:57,184
Jiuling.

265
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,680
And…

266
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,680
<i>Since the first time I saw you,</i>

267
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,440
<i>it has been 276 days.</i>

268
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:07,079
<i>You would feel something
if you spent that long with a pet, right?</i>

269
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:10,119
<i>I don't expect you</i>

270
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:11,880
<i>to like me as much as I like you.</i>

271
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,559
<i>I simply wish</i>

272
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,319
<i>you'd spare a little bit of your fondness</i>

273
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,400
<i>for He Jiuling for me.</i>

274
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,480
Yang Ying.

275
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,440
Qingxing?

276
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,839
Knowing the He family was in trouble.

277
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I shouldn't have wavered
for personal reasons then.

278
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,519
It's my fault.

279
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:36,720
I can't drag her into this.

280
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:25,759
Young master, it's late at night.

281
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:27,456
Let's go back to sleep.

282
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,712
Young master.

283
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,856
How far away

284
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,000
is "future"?

285
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,759
Is tomorrow "future"?

286
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,168
Yu.

287
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:58,640
Uncle.

288
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,799
Yu,

289
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,079
why are you still awake so late?

290
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:02,880
I'm waiting for someone.

291
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,040
She said

292
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:09,240
she would come to me.

293
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:18,848
Yu,

294
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,920
go to sleep.

295
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,984
She won't come.

296
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:24,960
You said the same thing before.

297
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,079
But I met her.

298
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,088
But this time, it's true.

299
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,520
Over there!

300
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:43,104
Catch them!

301
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,568
Stop!

302
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,064
Release!

303
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,520
Go!

304
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,176
Jiuling!

305
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:10,368
Let's go!

306
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:15,319
Jiuling, hang in there.

307
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:21,120
Stop!

308
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,720
After them!

309
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,520
Jiuling,

310
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:41,184
hang on.

311
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,424
Jiuling.

312
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,279
Search over there. They couldn't have gone far.

313
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,079
Return and search carefully again.

314
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:02,880
Yes.

315
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:05,920
Yang Ying?

316
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,079
I'm right here. Come and get me.

317
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:16,448
I'm not afraid of you.

318
00:22:16,448 --> 00:22:17,504
Don't let her run away.

319
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:18,592
Come on if you dare.

320
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,088
Stop!

321
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,240
Are you guys

322
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,480
not full?

323
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,799
You can't even catch up with a woman.

324
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,640
Quickly…

325
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:38,432
Quickly…

326
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,640
Write a letter to my senior brother…

327
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:46,079
Senior brother…

328
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,200
Jiuling!

329
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,296
Jiuling!

330
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:53,920
Jiuling!

331
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,680
Don't scare me.

332
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:01,920
I will definitely think of a way.

333
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,519
I will definitely think of some way

334
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:05,680
to save our family.

335
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,519
Now it's just me and you.

336
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:13,216
Jiuling.

337
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,552
Jiuling.

338
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,000
You're pretty tough-boned.

339
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,839
Whether you admit your guilt or not,

340
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,079
you've been convicted.

341
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,200
General He,

342
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,519
even if you don't consider yourself,

343
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:49,359
you should think about your family.

344
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,920
Do you bear to see me

345
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,400
torture and interrogate Jiuling like this?

346
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:01,408
Speaking of which,

347
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:05,720
my family has suffered a lot

348
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,559
and gotten many cold shoulders

349
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,559
over the years

350
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:10,960
because of her.

351
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:14,519
My nephew's career was also ruined.

352
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,920
But since then,

353
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,079
his ability to torture people

354
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:21,359
is even better
than that of the Ministry of Justice.

355
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,319
I'll hand over He Jiuling to him.

356
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:29,408
General He,

357
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:31,519
what do you think about that?

358
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:34,839
You've found her?

359
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,119
It's just a matter of time.

360
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:41,888
Lord Song!

361
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,384
Lord Song,

362
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:46,784
we've captured Yang Ying.

363
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,128
General He.

364
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,528
General He,

365
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:01,000
I have good news for you.

366
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,200
He Jiuling has run away.

367
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:06,480
But we still got something today.

368
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,592
Father!

369
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,984
Father!

370
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,559
- Yang Ying.
- I'm not a patient person.

371
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,920
I don't want to wait too long.

372
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,079
I quite want to try some of the punishments
I intended for Jiuling

373
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,400
on her.

374
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,519
To try or not to try

375
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:33,400
depends on you, General He.

376
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,759
Are you admitting your guilt or not?

377
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,039
You wish!

378
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,160
Come at me if you want anything!

379
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,839
I, Yang Ying, am not afraid of you.

380
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,279
You!

381
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,352
Yang Ying?

382
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,744
You beast!

383
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,960
- Yang Ying?
- You scoundrel!

384
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,400
Yang Ying! Yang Ying!

385
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,704
You beast!

386
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,000
Come at me if you have any problems!

387
00:26:28,096 --> 00:26:29,599
I-I…

388
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,200
I've already divorced her.

389
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:32,864
I have already…

390
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,319
<i>[Divorce Letter]</i>
I've divorced her.

391
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:37,079
She's not a member of the He family.

392
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:39,160
She's not.

393
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,079
- Yang Ying!
- Qingxing…

394
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:45,160
Qingxing,

395
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,440
if you divorce me,

396
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:50,519
you might as well kill me.

397
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:55,799
Yang Ying…

398
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:42,599
I plead guilty.

399
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,440
General He,

400
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,920
what did you say?

401
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,079
Louder.

402
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,200
I said

403
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,440
I would plead guilty.

404
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:12,640
I, He Liang,

405
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:16,759
used my daughter's name

406
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,200
to communicate with Xunnan.

407
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,160
I, He Liang,

408
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,839
am the sinner

409
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:32,680
who committed treason.

410
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,680
Make it quick for my family.

411
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,024
Master Qiuting,

412
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:11,360
are you still going to find help?

413
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,016
Take good care of her.

414
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,720
Greetings, Your Highness.

415
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,680
<i>[Prince Yong's Mansion]</i>
The others are all waiting outside for your order.

416
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,600
Let's enter the palace.

417
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,296
You Highness!

418
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:44,680
I have to go to Jialin.

419
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,696
You Highness?

420
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:48,039
We don't have the time, Your Highness.

421
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:49,359
Now that the king is dead,

422
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,640
- it's the time that--
- But at Jialin…

423
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,559
Your Highness, no matter the matter,

424
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:55,039
we should focus on the present.

425
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,200
Jiuling is in grave danger.

426
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,079
Your Highness!

427
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:02,680
You have been laying low for 20 years.

428
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,039
Isn't it just for this day?

429
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:08,079
Victory or defeat will be decided
at this very moment.

430
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:09,160
If you give up now,

431
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:10,880
it will not be worth it.

432
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,319
Please reconsider, Your Highness!

433
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:15,400
Please reconsider, Your Highness!

434
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,840
Senior brother,

435
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:23,392
help me.

436
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:26,464
Senior brother.

437
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,608
Senior brother.

438
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:34,752
Senior brother.

439
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,680
Father. Father.

440
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:49,720
No, father.

441
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,656
<i>Jiuling,</i>

442
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,448
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

443
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:07,232
Head to the palace.

444
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:20,680
My father's subordinates,

445
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,480
Chenzhou's colleagues,

446
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:26,160
Qingxing's military friends,

447
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,279
and my good friends…

448
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,359
I have reached everyone.

449
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:34,680
No one is willing to help us.

450
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,584
Master Qiuting,

451
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,640
today at dusk,

452
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,240
General He and the others will be taken
to the death cell at Liudaokou.

453
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,400
They will be executed in three days.

454
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,359
From today on,

455
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:01,240
the Ministry of Justice
will search every family for suspects.

456
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:06,119
<i>[Wanted, Notice]</i>
Neighbors or those who hide them will also be punished.

457
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:08,416
Neighbors too? Based on what law?

458
00:32:08,416 --> 00:32:09,839
Be careful

459
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:12,119
not to be implicated without knowing it.

460
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,400
We must be very careful.

461
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,319
Nowadays,

462
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:18,528
it's better for everyone to be careful.

463
00:32:18,528 --> 00:32:24,096
<i>[Ministry of Justice]</i>

464
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,720
They are trying to catch General He's daughter.

465
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,319
- Move!
- And their youngest son.

466
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:37,519
Yes.

467
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,240
They are trying
to catch General He's daughter and son.

468
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,408
What are their names?

469
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,279
Here they come.

470
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:45,408
Let's take a look.

471
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:49,720
Looks like they have been tortured already.

472
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,880
Criminal He Liang,

473
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,359
He Chenzhou,

00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:54,400
He Qingxing,

00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:00,119
Li, and Yang

476
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:02,160
are convicted of treason.

477
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,559
The whole family will be executed.

478
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,960
This is too tragic.

479
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,759
Execution will take place at Liudaokou
three days later.

480
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:14,279
Criminal He Liang,

481
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:17,119
He Chenzhou,

482
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:18,240
He Qingxing,

483
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:23,279
Li, and Yang

484
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:25,480
are convicted of treason.

485
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,960
The whole family will be executed.

486
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:30,680
Execution will take place at Liudaokou
three days later.

487
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,000
Criminal He Liang,

488
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,279
- He Chenzhou,
- Get lost!

489
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:37,408
He Qingxing--

490
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,319
Get lost quickly!

491
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:42,759
How dare you tell me to get lost!

492
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:43,880
Get lost quickly!

493
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,432
You will be dead soon.
Let this be a lesson for you.

494
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,279
Father!

495
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:49,280
- Father!
- Father!

496
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:53,279
Yes, I will be dead soon.

497
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,680
That's why I told you to get lost.

498
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,359
Get as far away as possible.

499
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:58,720
Go away!

500
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,776
How defiant you are!

501
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,336
Move!

502
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,728
Move!

503
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:07,872
Move!

504
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,720
Get lost.

505
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,416
Move!

506
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,400
Get lost quickly.

507
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,320
Get lost.

508
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,360
Move!

509
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,599
Get as far away from me as possible.

510
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,599
Get lost quickly.

511
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:23,712
Move quickly.

512
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,639
Get lost right now!

513
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,639
Jiuling and I are leaving now.

514
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,800
Where are you going?

515
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,000
She is not covered.

516
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:44,576
And her fever's just gone.

517
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,400
I don't know either.

518
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,344
But if we stay here, it will implicate you.

519
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I'm not afraid.

520
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,159
I am.

521
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:53,280
- But--
- Don't say anymore.

522
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,519
And don't make it difficult for Jiuling.

523
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,519
You've done a lot for us.

524
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:04,128
Jiuling.

525
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,336
He San,

526
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:08,800
while I was asleep,

527
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:12,039
I heard people cursing my father.

528
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,440
They said my father was a criminal,

529
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,559
a traitor.

530
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,488
That was a dream.

531
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,639
I'm clearheaded. It wasn't a dream.

532
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,360
No one

533
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,079
is willing to help our family, right?

534
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,000
We have nowhere to go,

535
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,368
right?

536
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,440
It's my fault. I'm too useless.

537
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:53,199
Sir! Sir!

538
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:54,400
It's here.

539
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,440
There's a suspicious man here.

540
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,480
- This way.
- It's here.

541
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,800
Hurry up. Quickly.

542
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,880
It's the place.

543
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:02,272
It's right here.

544
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,024

00:39:13,256 --> 00:39:15,788
<i>♫ There's no escape for destiny ♫</i>

562
00:39:17,352 --> 00:39:23,404
<i>♫ Looking back, I see you waiting ♫</i>

563
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:30,444
<i>♫ Our lives are filled with joy and sorrow ♫</i>

564
00:39:30,444 --> 00:39:37,641
<i>♫ The longings crystalize
into a bright galaxy ♫</i>

565
00:39:37,645 --> 00:39:44,908
<i>♫ Gently I stroke the zither,
waiting for a passerby like you ♫</i>

566
00:39:45,512 --> 00:39:51,672
<i>♫ Turns out you are my inextricable destiny ♫</i>
