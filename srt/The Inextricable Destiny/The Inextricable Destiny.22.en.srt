<i>[The Inextricable Destiny]</i>

2
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,336
<i>[Episode 22]</i>

3
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,400
Just bury her.

4
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,560
If you don't want to go peacefully,
I'll grant your wish.

5
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,432
Nobody moves.

6
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,064
Put your blade down.

7
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,288
Young master.

8
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,384
Don't move.

9
00:03:04,128 --> 00:03:05,216
Yu.

10
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,072
Yu.

11
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,300
You ran out when you just woke up.

12
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,280
Your injured body can't take this.

13
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,848
Come on.

14
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,080
Yu, what's wrong?

15
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,480
I know everything.

16
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:30,976
About what?

17
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,864
You.

18
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,288
The He family.

19
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,199
If you do,

20
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,719
you should understand

21
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,879
why I did what I did.

22
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,599
Because of a private grudge,

23
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,879
you wrongfully murdered the entire family
of a loyal General of Jialin.

24
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,520
That upsets me.

25
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,280
Working with evil men

26
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,280
and disturbing the imperial court

27
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:15,960
is not the path of the Astrology Pavilion.

28
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,224
You…

29
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,959
How could you do this?

30
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,519
I have already come this far.

31
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,000
There's no turning back.

32
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,736
Uncle.

33
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,399
I never intended for you to find out.

34
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,940
You should always be the pure Rong Yu

35
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,120
and the innocent young master.

36
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,600
And you will guard

37
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,959
the innocent Astrology Pavilion.

38
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,040
Since you know everything now,

39
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,439
maybe this is destiny.

40
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,319
What do you want me to do?

41
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,879
Do you want me to die for my sins?

42
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,120
The act of rebellion

43
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,279
is punishable by death.

44
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,319
I, Rong Jiang, have lived my life

45
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:51,920
without a wife or child,

46
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,232
for I have spent my life

47
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,040
with all my heart

48
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,000
in bringing you up.

49
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,879
I taught you to study.

50
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,639
I taught you astrology.

51
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:10,279
Even these five years,
I have never once given up.

52
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:16,279
But now, you actually want me to die.

53
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,040
For a woman?

54
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:24,839
You're turning against me over a woman.

55
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,040
She burned the Astrology Pavilion.
She burned the star chart!

56
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,000
Didn't she burn the Astrology Pavilion
precisely because of you?

57
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,079
With all that's happened,

58
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,040
do you still think

59
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:50,199
this is just about one woman?

60
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,879
Don't you have the slightest regret?

61
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,560
I won't regret it.

62
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,959
I will never forgive such a person.

63
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,260
She drove a wedge between you and me.

64
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,759
It was she who ruined everything.

65
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,279
If you want to kill me, just do it.

66
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,464
Uncle,

67
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,208
I've said it before.

68
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,399
You are very, very

69
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,744
important to me.

70
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,439
I've always seen you as my father.

71
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,800
Your sins should be punished.

72
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,720
Your sins should be punished.

73
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,800
Isn't it also punishing my heart?

74
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,399
I owe you too much to repay.

75
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,920
I cannot

76
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,272
send you to die.

77
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,120
But I can't pretend that none of this

78
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,680
happened either.

79
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,519
You have acted as the Master
of the Astrology Pavilion

80
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,240
for more than twenty years,

81
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,679
working tirelessly

82
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,519
and devoted to everything.

83
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,720
I respect you,

84
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,679
and I never thought that one day,

85
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,440
I would take back the Astrology Pavilion

86
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,120
in the name of the rightful heir, from you.

87
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:05,792
How could you?

88
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,120
You even brought out

89
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,944
your father's will.

90
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,159
Have you been preparing for this all along?

91
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,159
From now on,

92
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:23,879
you are no longer Lord Rong

93
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,080
or a fortuneteller of the Astrology Pavilion.

94
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,000
I will send you away.

95
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,120
This will be the last time

96
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:36,039
we see each other.

97
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,272
The last time?

98
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,720
We are like father and son.

99
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,279
And a son should atone for his father's sins.

100
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:47,559
You owe the He family

101
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,039
and all those whom you've hurt or killed.

102
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,840
These debts

103
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,519
are now on me.

104
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,080
And as the true Ninth Master
of the Astrology Pavilion,

105
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,260
I failed to prevent the Astrology Pavilion
from going astray,

106
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,519
or the divination skills from being
used in political alliances

107
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,759
and framing loyal officials.

108
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,039
It was my dereliction of duty.

109
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,256
I, too,

110
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:18,848
should be punished to death.

111
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,960
Yu, Yu, what are you doing?

112
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,904
What are you doing?

113
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:25,984
I'm taking the Astrology Pavilion

114
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,000
back to the right path.

115
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,759
I'm getting everything back on track.

116
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,519
Until all is calm,

117
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,384
then,

118
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:43,120
I will atone for my sins.

119
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,800
You…

120
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,120
Yu…

121
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:19,940
What do we do now?

122
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,360
What will happen to the Astrology Pavilion?

123
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:24,060
- I really don't know.
- Yeah.

124
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,480
It's really hard to tell.

125
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,519
Do something.

126
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,120
Think of a solution.

127
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:38,080
Here comes the young master.

128
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,040
I, Rong Yu,

129
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:55,960
am following the will

130
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,960
of the Eighth Astrology Pavilion Master

131
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,879
to officially become the Ninth Master.

132
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:05,320
And I will work alongside you all

133
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:09,240
to rebuild the Astrology Pavilion.

134
00:12:19,716 --> 00:12:21,700
<i>[Yuanqing Mansion]</i>

135
00:12:50,308 --> 00:12:52,200
<i>[Rong's Mansion]</i>

136
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,440
Why is it my fault? It's their fault.

137
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,120
- Sir.
- It's them.

138
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,184
Sir.

139
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:00,900
It's them. They hurt us.

140
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,060
They ruined the Rong family.

141
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,400
All I did was make them pay
the price they should have.

142
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,639
- Sir.
- I didn't do anything wrong.

143
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:08,700
Sir, please get in the carriage, sir.

144
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,240
It's not my fault, Yu.

145
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,120
I don't need you to atone for my sins.

146
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,940
- Yu…
- Sir, please get in the carriage.

147
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,500
Yu, Yu, Yu…

148
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,600
- Sir, please get in the carriage.
- Yu.

149
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,759
I am not guilty. It's not my fault, Yu.

150
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,880
They ruined our family, Yu.

151
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,840
It's their fault, Yu.

152
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,039
Not mine. Yu.

153
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,879
They ruined our family.

154
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,799
Useless scums!

155
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,440
Your Highness.

156
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,360
Your Highness.

157
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,280
Your Highness.

158
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,180
I've just heard

159
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,000
that you've recovered from a serious injury

160
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:06,919
and even your old ailments have been cured.

161
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:09,279
How fortunate.

162
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,448
Yes, I'm better now.

163
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,959
The Astrology Pavilion has changed
its master overnight. Why is that?

164
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,799
Where is Lord Rong now?

165
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,940
My uncle suddenly fell ill

166
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,559
and has set off for a convalescent stay away.

167
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,240
Since I've recovered from my illness,
I took over as the Master.

168
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:32,980
He fell ill?

169
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,080
Yes, he did.

170
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,440
You just woke up,

171
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,560
and Lord Rong is suddenly seriously ill.

172
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,559
Isn't that a bit too coincidental?

173
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,100
I think it's more likely

174
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,720
that you've secretly driven him

175
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,240
out of the capital, right?

176
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:55,200
Why would you think that?

177
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,440
Because without Lord Rong,

178
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:00,559
you can openly defend

179
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,120
the He family's orphan daughter.

180
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,744
Last night…

181
00:16:07,744 --> 00:16:08,832
Last night?

182
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,320
Nothing. Well, Lord Rong,

183
00:16:21,824 --> 00:16:23,360
I wish you all the best.

184
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,960
Likewise.

185
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,540
As for my naive words during my illness,

186
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,000
please, Your Highness,
do not take them to heart.

187
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:32,480
Of course.

188
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,120
But since we just mentioned my wife,

189
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,220
I have found evidence that proves

190
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,679
her innocent in the fire
at the Astrology Pavilion.

191
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,919
If she's innocent, there's no defending her.

192
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,799
I'm going to the Ministry of Justice
to get her.

193
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:49,799
You're going to the Ministry of Justice?

194
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:50,880
Yes.

195
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:59,879
Your Highness, what's so funny?

196
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:01,960
Nothing.

197
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:05,740
I just think it's absurd.

198
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,079
I also find it absurd,

199
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,400
the claim that my wife would
set fire to the Astrology Pavilion.

200
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,912
Of course,

201
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,279
if Your Highness is willing to accompany me,

202
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,000
I would be more than grateful.

203
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,359
Claiming to be going to the Ministry of Justice

204
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,519
when you've obviously rescued her.

205
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,319
- Go to the Ministry of Justice.
- Yes.

206
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:46,912
Your Highness.

207
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,880
Something's wrong.

208
00:17:51,456 --> 00:17:52,520
What happened?

209
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,160
The people you sent to Changye were all killed.

210
00:17:57,764 --> 00:17:59,908
<i>[Memorial to the throne]</i>

211
00:18:23,712 --> 00:18:30,528
<i>[Yuanqing Mansion]</i>

212
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,896
Young master.

213
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,960
Your arrest because of the Astrology Pavilion
has been resolved.

214
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,080
Those corrupt officials from
the Ministry of Justice who wanted to kill you

215
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,599
have been punished.

216
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Everything will be fine from now on.

217
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,039
But everyone thinks you're dead.

218
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,656
Although it's not the best time to come back,

219
00:19:38,656 --> 00:19:39,840
it doesn't matter.

220
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,680
I just need to go to the Ministry of Justice.

221
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:45,984
Are you… completely recovered?

222
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,960
I have.

223
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,079
Does it still hurt a lot?

224
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,160
Why is your hand wrapped in such thick gauze?

225
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:03,872
It looks bad.

226
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:05,696
But it's nothing.

227
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:09,472
The Astrology Pavilion,

228
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:12,160
is anyone else hurt?

229
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:18,176
So it's just you.

230
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:21,480
You were the only foolish one.

231
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:26,680
I'm not worth it.

232
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:32,119
You still need to go
to the Ministry of Justice later.

233
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,080
The newly appointed official there
is my old acquaintance.

234
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,400
That day you were lying in bed,

235
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,519
and you wouldn't wake up.

236
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,559
Every time I close my eyes, I see that moment.

237
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,960
Then I saw you again.

238
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:51,839
I thought it was a dream.

239
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,799
When I woke up in the clinic,
and only Zhanping was there,

240
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,720
he told me to wait,

241
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:00,579
wait for them all to be punished,

242
00:21:00,579 --> 00:21:02,160
wait for my injuries to heal.

243
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:04,960
But I couldn't.

244
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,680
I wanted to know if my dream was real.

245
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,160
If anyone was punished,

246
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:23,740
or if my injuries were healed,

247
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,240
why does it matter?

248
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:29,960
Do you still remember when we went
to see the stars together,

249
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,319
we made the first wish?

250
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,920
<i>I hope my husband can be healthy
and live a long life,</i>

251
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,960
<i>safe and sound,</i>

252
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,000
<i>and become an old man
who lives up to 100 years old.</i>

253
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,279
Now that I think about it,

254
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:48,440
all the bumps you've encountered in your life

255
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:51,480
seem to be because of me.

256
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,400
I had decided

257
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,200
that I would confess many things
to you once you get better,

258
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:04,200
but I've figured many things out.

259
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,680
I've let go of a lot.

260
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:11,000
As long as you're fine, nothing else matters.

261
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,580
You like to watch stars,

262
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,759
and I will accompany you
to watch the stars for a lifetime.

263
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,860
If you think the Astrology Pavilion
is the most important,

264
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,920
let's rebuild it together

265
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,599
to protect it for the rest of our lives.

266
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,680
I can never

267
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,368
truly become a family

268
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,599
with your only family member left,

269
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:46,440
but I still hope you'll be cherished

270
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,939
and loved.

271
00:22:48,939 --> 00:22:50,359
You seem to be forgetting something.

272
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:54,368
What?

273
00:22:58,039 --> 00:22:59,240
We're divorced.

274
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,088
Since the night of the birthday banquet,

275
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,039
we have no relationship anymore.

276
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,808
The divorce?

277
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,480
You…

278
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,280
still remember.

279
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,200
Shouldn't we move past that?

280
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,160
It won't change

281
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:26,912
what has happened.

282
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,200
Stay here and recover.

283
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,519
The Astrology Pavilion needs me.

284
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,200
I will stay there.

285
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:50,559
When you're fully recovered,

286
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,480
wherever you want to go,

287
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,240
Zhanping will escort you.

288
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:57,920
You can go to Nanjiang,

289
00:23:59,108 --> 00:24:00,356
or Xunnan.

290
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:02,912
It's up to you.

291
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,519
Do you really want me to leave?

292
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:09,600
You want me to go away?

293
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,640
Everything will get better.

294
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,240
Everything will start over.

295
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,599
Rong Yu, look at me, I am He Jiuling.

296
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,799
Did the medicine I gave you

297
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:25,760
make you forget things again?

298
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,400
Just like a few years ago.

299
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,740
You forgot how to eat,

300
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,500
and you forgot how to speak.

301
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,576
I didn't forget.

302
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,200
Instead,

303
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,359
I remember everything now.

304
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,152
That day in Jiang Town,

305
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,160
didn't we

306
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,640
say our goodbyes?

307
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,759
And that night before you left for Nanjiang,

308
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,400
you told me to forget you, didn't you?

309
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,456
So,

310
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:02,960
every mistake afterward

311
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,400
will be, bit by bit,

312
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:09,599
corrected by me.

313
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,160
You think that everything between us

314
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,480
was a mistake?

315
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,696
Miss.

316
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,808
Chengbi.

317
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,000
At this point,

318
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,000
I can't hold you back anymore.

319
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,119
You can go back to Xunnan.

320
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,272
Please

321
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,039
deliver my last letter to my Senior Brother.

322
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,312
Aren't we leaving together?

323
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,319
Xunnan is your home.

324
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,680
And this is mine.

325
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,480
Please tell him

326
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,040
that I'm sorry.

327
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,728
Jiuling.

328
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,919
Why did you come out like this?

329
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,159
You should go back, Your Majesty.

330
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:02,304
Sit.

331
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:06,759
Enough of that now that I'm here.

332
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,600
But…

333
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,260
I wanted to play things safe,

334
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,759
and I almost lost you.

335
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:15,720
I regretted it instantly.

336
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:17,720
I thought I was such

337
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:19,720
a weak Emperor.

338
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:22,920
So no matter what,

339
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,680
I wanted to see you.

340
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,079
You're being willful.

341
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:30,799
Look at me now.

342
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:32,900
I'm fine, aren't I?

343
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,100
Look how thin you are.

344
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,359
You're nowhere near fine.

345
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:39,440
I've told you,

346
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,039
I'm a lucky person.

347
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,799
This small injury is nothing to me.

348
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,488
Drink your medicine.

349
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:51,119
You are lucky indeed.

350
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,880
Otherwise, the Astrology Pavilion
wouldn't have fallen so quickly.

351
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:58,360
The star chart is gone, and Rong Jiang is sick.

352
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,079
We've got rid of his cronies
in the Ministry of Justice

353
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,000
using your imprisonment.

354
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,480
We are getting closer and closer to our goal.

355
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,480
I know you're upset,

356
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,440
which is why

357
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,079
I had to come and see you in person.

358
00:28:27,488 --> 00:28:28,544
Focus on recovery for now,

359
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:31,079
and leave the rest for later.

360
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,920
I've lived long enough under your protection,

361
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:38,368
and now it's time

362
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:40,839
for me to carry on our work.

363
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,359
I want to leave with my sister.

364
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,632
You waited so long to see me for this?

365
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:51,360
What else would it be?

366
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:56,400
I thought you would, on behalf of Jialin,

367
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,920
break your alliance with Xunnan.

368
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:02,799
It seems that the men of Jialin

369
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,000
can only do so much for their loved ones.

370
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,599
Ren Yinxiao, don't push your luck.

371
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,928
With due respect,

372
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:27,519
what makes you think you can take her away?

373
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,159
She's married into the Xunnan royal family,

374
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,400
so she's one of us.

375
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,039
We'll provide her with a life
of honor and luxury,

376
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,920
treat her illness, and dig her grave.

377
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:37,980
What's wrong with that?

378
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,359
What's wrong?

379
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:43,640
Don't you know why my sister became so ill?

380
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,232
What are you laughing at?

381
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:49,759
I didn't hurt her,

382
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,279
and you should find the right person to pester.

383
00:29:53,312 --> 00:29:54,380
Show the young lord out.

384
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,459
Who dares to touch me?

385
00:29:55,459 --> 00:29:56,740
- Take him away.
- Yes, yes.

386
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,824
Who dares to touch me?

387
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,720
Let go of me.

388
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,740
- Let me go.
- Let's go.

389
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,279
Ren Yinxiao, mark my words.

390
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,340
With your black heart and rotten personality,

391
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,540
no one will ever

392
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,219
treat you sincerely.

393
00:30:07,219 --> 00:30:08,448
Let go of me.

394
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,720
Is there a new task to do?

395
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:30,160
He just came to see me

396
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,319
and told me to recover well.

397
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,520
Good. In your current state,
if you do anything else,

398
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,720
it won't go well.

399
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,559
How's your shoulder?

400
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:44,800
Jiuling.

401
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,072
Jiuling?

402
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,904
I'm sorry.

403
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,079
I was distracted.

404
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:56,160
I don't think you should stay here anymore.

405
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,519
Go back to Rong's Mansion.

406
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,759
But I don't like Rong's Mansion.

407
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:07,279
But you like that person.

408
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:08,928
I don't understand why you would

409
00:31:08,928 --> 00:31:10,016
hide your affections.

410
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,000
Where I come from,

411
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,519
if we like someone, we admit it boldly
and pursue them boldly.

412
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:16,559
Now that the Emperor is managing things,

413
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,960
why don't you try to win Master Rong back?

414
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:23,039
After doing so many wrong things to him,

415
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,480
what right do I have to tell him I like him?

416
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,180
It's because there are so many wrongs

417
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,920
that you need to make it up to him.

418
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,080
Now that he's recovered from his illness

419
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,620
and remembers the past,

420
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,439
he thinks you're still the old you,

421
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:38,140
who hates him, wants to cancel the marriage,

422
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,960
and only got married with no choice.

423
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,240
That's why he wanted to leave you.

424
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,920
He wrote the divorce paper
after the hunting trip

425
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,520
when you were acting abnormally.

426
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,759
He was sad, so he made up his mind.

427
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:54,200
Everything Master Rong did was for you.

428
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:03,168
Tan.

429
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,440
I really don't know.

430
00:32:08,484 --> 00:32:09,536
Even if he returns

431
00:32:09,536 --> 00:32:11,519
to the bright and charming Astrology Master

432
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:14,440
who doesn't need my care or protection.

433
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,960
As long as he still loves me,

434
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,520
I will traverse mountains
and wade through thorns

435
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,079
to stay by his side.

436
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:28,400
But now he is pained even looking at me.

437
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,880
The way he sees me, I…

438
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,920
Tan, let me be alone for now.

439
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:05,079
Your Highness.

440
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,080
What's going on?

441
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:08,720
These two are spies
who infiltrated the mansion.

442
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,080
They were found sneaking around in your study

443
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,160
and have been executed by us.

444
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:19,440
We also found military tokens on them.

445
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,640
- Military tokens?
- Yes.

446
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,880
When did these two infiltrate the mansion?

447
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,519
Last month, before the hunting trip.

448
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:41,880
It seems that I've been too kind recently,

449
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,440
letting that little rascal feel emboldened,

450
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:48,599
daring to make a move under my nose.

451
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:58,839
<i>If we like someone, we admit it boldly
and pursue them boldly.</i>

452
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,920

<i>That's why he wanted to leave you.</i>

460
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,380
<i>[Astrology Pavilion]</i>
This Astrology Pavilion was rebuilt so quickly

461
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,480
after the big fire.

462
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:30,619
Looks like the star chart is beyond saving.

463
00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:33,459
As for others, the Star-picking Master
has recovered from his illness

464
00:34:33,459 --> 00:34:35,680
and convened artisans from all over
to help rebuild the Astrology Pavilion,

465
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,960
so of course, it was quick.

466
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,800
Welcome.

467
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,640
Greetings. Is the Astrology Master
teaching personally today?

468
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,940
Yes, this is the first open class
of the Astrology Pavilion,

469
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,700
aiming to attract talented scholars
and revive the Astrology Pavilion.

470
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,039
You should seize this opportunity.

471
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,840
Of course, it would be great
to seize the opportunity.

472
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,500
The Astrology Pavilion has so many
unique, exclusive, and secret techniques,

473
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,624
and we'd be more than content
to learn just a little.

474
00:34:58,624 --> 00:34:59,640
Please come inside.

475
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,079
I also heard

476
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:04,220
that the Master has been in danger a few times
but has turned misfortune into blessings.

477
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,900
He is a well-deserved immortal.

478
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,976
Is he?

479
00:35:06,976 --> 00:35:08,980
Let's go. Let's hurry in.

480
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,719
- This way, please.
- Ok.

481
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:20,820
Young Master, will you not be able
to play the zither in the future?

482
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,039
He's the Master now.

483
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,272
There were nine-fingered zither players
and one-armed warriors.

484
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,480
Strong people are not limited by their bodies.

485
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:31,232
As long as you want to,

486
00:35:32,064 --> 00:35:33,152
you can play the zither.

487
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,920
Will it leave a scar?

488
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:39,720
External beauty is the least important.

489
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,100
Young Master, I prefer it when you look good.

490
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,480
He's the Master now.

491
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,920
Song Xiaobao, you are shallow.

492
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,719
My father said that the Young Master
was very brave when saving people that day.

493
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:54,719
He's the Master. The Master. The Master!

494
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,320
I still feel a little lost without Lord Rong.

495
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,300
Father said our strongest hope
in the Astrology Pavilion is gone.

496
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,599
Lord Rong also left.

497
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,140
It's basically over.

498
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:11,679
Master, is our Astrology Pavilion
really going to be destroyed?

499
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:14,592
No, it won't.

500
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,568
This way, please.

501
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:19,200
As vast as the sea can accommodate all rivers,

502
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,840
as long as the lineage is there,
the Astrology Pavilion will always be here.

503
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,119
<i>[Star Pavilion]</i>

504
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,159
I am deeply honored

505
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:28,719
to be trusted by everyone here

506
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,119
to teach astrology and fortune-telling
at the Astrology Pavilion.

507
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,319
As many of you know,

508
00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:36,400
the unique technique of the Astrology Pavilion
has never been shared with outsiders.

509
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,199
However, working alone does not
contribute to progress

510
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:42,119
nor is it beneficial for the development
of the Astrology Pavilion.

511
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,920
In order to allow this technique
to be better passed on,

512
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,159
this time I would like to break the rule

513
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,000
and make it public.

514
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,639
Consider it as an attempt to attract talent.

515
00:36:54,816 --> 00:36:55,840
All of you present here,

516
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,360
no matter where you come from
or what school you belong to,

517
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,079
are welcome to bring out your learnings

518
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:04,460
and discuss them with everyone.

519
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,519
- This is good.
- Yes.

520
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,104
The seven stars of the Azure Dragon

521
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,840
are Horn, Neck, Root, Room, Heart.

<i>[Imperial Study]</i>

523
00:37:36,704 --> 00:37:37,792
Uncle,

524
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:39,520
what is the meaning of this?

525
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,519
This morning's lecture ends here.

526
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:44,519
If anyone has any questions,
you can raise them now.

527
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:48,256
I want to know

528
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:51,599
is it true that a fortune-teller cannot

529
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:53,500
predict his own fortune?

530
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,540
How could we know such a thing?

531
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,576
Indeed, that's true.

532
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,039
Young Master, it's the Madam.

533
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,220
I thought she was sending Chengbi home.

534
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,480
Why did she suddenly come here?

535
00:38:08,512 --> 00:38:09,600
Indeed.

536
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:11,232
No.

537
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:13,859
Other things might not be predictable,

538
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:16,280
but one thing can definitely be predicted.

539
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,440
Marriage.

540
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,424
Marriage?

541
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,260
Why don't you divine for me
so that everyone can see?

542
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,519
Miss He, what do you want to prognosticate?

543
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:28,760
Of course,

544
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:30,688
it's my marriage fate.

545
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,640
One person cannot complete a marriage.

546
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,039
This is a matter for two people.

547
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:39,320
Since the fortune-teller
can't see his own marriage,

548
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,960
he can look at the other person's.

549
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:46,559
The Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches,
the Heavenly Palace and the star chart

550
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,480
are not easy to understand.

551
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,459
Could you take yourself as an example,

552
00:38:51,459 --> 00:38:54,000
and try to tell the fortune of a marriage?

553
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,400
What?

554
00:38:59,488 --> 00:39:00,608
Young lady.

555
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:03,340
You're well aware that the Master is married,

556
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,600
yet you deliberately ask such a question.
What's your intention?

557
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,656
Exactly.

558
00:39:06,656 --> 00:39:07,940
Exactly, yes.

559
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,300
Telling one person's marital fate
from another person

560
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,359
is not accurate.

561
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,500
Otherwise, before marriage,

562
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,080
why match the two people's
eight characters, right?

563
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,920
Exactly, yes.

564
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:20,360
I have the birth information
of the Master's wife.

565
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,000
Could I ask the Astrology Master

566
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,000
to make a divination for them?

567
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,900
You really don't know when to give up.

568
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,500
Despite the accuracy,

569
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,880
who would say their marital luck
is not good, right?

570
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,360
- Exactly. Who would say that?
- That's true.

571
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:42,159
Since the Master is reluctant,

572
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,119
let me do the divination.

573
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,480
You're doing it now.

574
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,800
The Master's wife has had
a rough romantic journey.

575
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:59,159
She made a lot of mistakes
in the first half of her life.

576
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,880
She missed her destined partner several times.

577
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,660
Luckily, it all turned around eventually.

578
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,840
After all the twists and turns,
she went back to that person.

579
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:15,039
The two of them lived in harmony until the end.

580
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:18,360
She has this person,
and till death do they part.

581
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:22,280
What a happy ending.

582
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,240
Judging by the birth information,

583
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,459
Master and his wife are a match made in heaven.

584
00:40:34,459 --> 00:40:36,119
They are meant for each other.

585
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,580
It goes without saying, okay?

586
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,159
They're already married. Look!

587
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,104
Are you done?

588
00:40:43,104 --> 00:40:44,128
Yes.

589
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:46,816
It might be true,

590
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,344
but,

591
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,840
it should be her story with another man.

592
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:55,296
My wife and I

593
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,728
have divorced not long ago.

594
00:40:58,272 --> 00:40:59,300
Divorced?

595
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:02,599
So now, I'm not on her marriage line,

596
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,559
nor am I, her so-called

597
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:07,000
destined person.
