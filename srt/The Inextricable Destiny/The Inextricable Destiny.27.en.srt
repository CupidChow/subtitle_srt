[The Inextricable Destiny]

2
00:01:31,456 --> 00:01:34,304
[Side Story]

3
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,440
You stayed up all night reading books.

4
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,639
Where are you going now?

5
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,360
I want to go and see

6
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,159
if some stories

7
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,919
are true.

8
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,904
You should rest before you go.

9
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,919
Young Master, it's time to take your medicine.

10
00:03:23,584 --> 00:03:24,599
After my death,

11
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,639
if I'm not buried
in the Rong family's cemetery,

12
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,479
will they blame me?

13
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,980
Young Master, you're just not fully healed
from the old injuries.

14
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,120
You'll be fine.

15
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,240
My old injuries.

16
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,400
They were so severe.

17
00:03:42,144 --> 00:03:43,200
Why did I heal?

18
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,259
Madam always has some

19
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:47,040
rare treasures that we don't know about.

20
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,719
And she knows methods we are unaware of.

21
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:50,919
She was able to cure you before.

22
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,959
It's not surprising

23
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,016
that she healed you again.

24
00:03:58,752 --> 00:03:59,776
Young Master.

25
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,224
Master.

26
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,420
A painter named Huang is here.

27
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,960
He said he was your friend.

28
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,439
He is waiting outside the door to see you.

29
00:04:23,552 --> 00:04:24,608
Mom.

30
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:47,040
There's something I must tell you.

31
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,279
Gui's mother.

32
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,336
Miss Jiu.

33
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,160
I hunted some chicken here.

34
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,800
Would you like these two?

35
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,600
I'm really sorry, Miss Jiu.

36
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,279
I twisted my hand chopping wood recently.

37
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:09,399
Gui has been cooking these past few days.

38
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,920
I, I really can't help you with that.

39
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,240
I suggest you ask someone else.

40
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,920
The strange woman they mentioned is here.

41
00:06:04,128 --> 00:06:05,240
It's here. Right here.

42
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,959
She's clearly an old woman but she's pregnant.

43
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,020
Doesn't that make her a demon?

44
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,079
Totally.

45
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,152
It's here.

46
00:06:13,152 --> 00:06:14,368
How disgraceful.

47
00:06:14,368 --> 00:06:15,480
Let's go.

48
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:17,759
Young Master, just let me.

49
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,859
I added something

50
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:26,359
from the booklet

51
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:28,360
in the tea,

52
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,880
so that someone as cute and smart

53
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,800
as me can accompany you.

54
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,920
If one day I'm gone…

55
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,400
Go to Mount Wuhua.

56
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,560
Mount Wuhua?

57
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,199
I need to go to Mount Wuhua
as soon as possible.

58
00:08:01,664 --> 00:08:02,688
Madam.

59
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,240
Madam. Jiuling is…

60
00:08:13,664 --> 00:08:14,720
You!

61
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:14,848
Madam.

62
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,039
As long as you can save her and the child,

63
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,640
I am willing

64
00:09:21,216 --> 00:09:22,800
to do anything in return.

65
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,960
Only that disciple of mine would be so silly.

66
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,520
She sacrificed her own life
just to let you live.

67
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,984
Madam.

68
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,360
The Pipa Zui in her body can only be used once.

69
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,759
Killing you won't help.

70
00:09:39,232 --> 00:09:40,320
No…

71
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:43,120
Are you sure?

72
00:09:45,312 --> 00:09:46,400
Tell me.

73
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,640
If I can't make both of them live,

74
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,720
who do you choose?

75
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,080
Madam.

76
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,080
If you can save her,

77
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,360
I can accept having no children in my life,

78
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,759
as long as He Jiuling is with me.

79
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,840
Even if she is no longer young and beautiful?

80
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:10,976
In Nanjiang,

81
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,200
I once told a story about a sword master.

82
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,600
That sword master

83
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,600
was actually my mother.

84
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,360
My father and her exchanged letters

85
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:22,960
and gradually fell in love.

86
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:25,559
Even if every time the result was safe,

87
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,399
he still got worried.

88
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,440
So,

89
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,320
he stopped doing divinations

90
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,440
or replying to her letters,

91
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,080
because my father went to find her

92
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:39,080
and married her.

93
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,960
He wanted to be there for her in every battle

94
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,600
and accompany her day by day.

95
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,960
He was her own fortuneteller

96
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,120
and peace amulet.

97
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:49,888
So,

98
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,720
just like what you asked me before

99
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:55,639
about if He Jiuling lost or died,

100
00:10:56,512 --> 00:10:57,519
you ask me now,

101
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:01,080
if she's old and not pretty,

102
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,380
what would I do? My answer

103
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,200
will always be the same as my father's.

104
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:10,039
I will spend my life with her
even if death separates us.

105
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,159
When I went to Nanjiang,

106
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:15,240
I was prepared for this.

107
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,008
She guards the home and the country,

108
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:22,784
and I will guard her.

109
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,480
Hurry up.

110
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,592
We are almost there.

111
00:11:37,184 --> 00:11:38,260
- Jiuling is here?
- Yes.

112
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,440
- Go.
- Lead the way.

113
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,039
Master.

114
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:33,360
Is that really you?

115
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,960
If it's not me,

116
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,559
who else would come to collect your body?

117
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:46,279
What are you doing here?

118
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,368
Now

119
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,559
is not the time to catch up.

120
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,240
Look at you.

121
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,759
It's only been a few months
since we saw each other,

122
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,600
and you've wrecked your body.

123
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:09,600
I told you in Nanjiang.

124
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,200
You're surviving on Pipa Zui.

125
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,440
How could you give that up?

126
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:21,639
If anything happens to you,

127
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,879
how would I…

128
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,360
What would I do?

129
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,504
Master.

130
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:49,039
You know everything.

131
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,224
Drink it.

132
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,000
I had no other choice.

133
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,600
I was at my wits' end.

134
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,240
I couldn't…

135
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,799
I couldn't just watch him go and do nothing.

136
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,799
I'm sorry.

137
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,600
You say you're sorry,

138
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,279
but if you had to make the choice again,

139
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:35,879
you'd do the same.

140
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,919
The men in this world

141
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,320
are no good.

142
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,800
Once you're dead and gone,

143
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,519
he can remember you for a while,

144
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:50,559
but not forever.

145
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,040
When you're but a skeleton,

146
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,480
he's living a carefree and happy life.

147
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:59,260
I'd rather he didn't remember me.

148
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,679
You…

149
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:02,559
He can be carefree,

150
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,639
happy,

151
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:08,960
and fall in love with another person.

152
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,639
As long as he is happy in his lifetime,

153
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:18,360
everything will be fine.

154
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:24,832
You're so naive.

155
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:27,759
You're so silly.

156
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,440
I've been silly all my life.

157
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,279
And I accept it.

158
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,919
There's no turning back in life.

159
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,759
We all have to move on.

160
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,440
I don't have much time left.

161
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,519
The only thing I can't let go

162
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,759
is the baby in my belly.

163
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,000
He is very strong.

164
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,519
He has accompanied me so far

165
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,620
on such a difficult journey,

166
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,360
but he is still here.

167
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:17,919
He is truly a miracle.

168
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:22,000
He must long to open his eyes

169
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,799
and take a look at this world.

170
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,839
I have no other wish

171
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:30,159
but for you to think of a way to save him.

172
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,159
This is indeed a miracle.

173
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,480
Perhaps this time,

174
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,120
the miracle can save you.

175
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,639
There's no more Pipa Zui in your body.

176
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,919
but there might still be some in his.

177
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,200
You said he has accompanied you
on such a difficult journey,

178
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,559
and he's still here.

179
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,559
Have you ever thought
that it is because of Pipa Zui?

180
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,839
With your current physical condition,

181
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,039
all I can do is make him
meet you as soon as possible.

182
00:17:15,616 --> 00:17:17,400
And then try to find a way

183
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,840
to extract the remaining Pipa Zui

184
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,319
from his body.

185
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,000
No, I don't want him to go through that pain.

186
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,072
Ling.

187
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,680
He grew up with Pipa Zui.

188
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:35,000
The fact that he has survived this way

189
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:37,160
has made him

190
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,240
an existence different from others.

191
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:41,560
Even if we extract the Pipa Zui

192
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,000
from his body,

193
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,719
he wouldn't experience the pain
like everyone else,

194
00:17:47,719 --> 00:17:49,319
and he would be okay.

195
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,280
He Jiuling.

196
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,860
I've only read a sentence

197
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,220
about this kind of person in the records

198
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,599
of my master's master on Mount Wuhua.

199
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:04,800
He is a miracle.

200
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,016
Trust me.

201
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,680
Go to the drugstore and buy me
ginseng and danggui. Hurry up.

202
00:18:24,256 --> 00:18:25,408
Yes.

203
00:18:41,824 --> 00:18:42,880
Here.

204
00:18:49,056 --> 00:18:50,112
Cheers?

205
00:18:51,232 --> 00:18:52,320
Sure.

206
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:54,240
Come on.

207
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,000
Shangyuan, TianTing, Taiwei Palace.

208
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,640
Shangyuan, TianTing, Taiwei Palace.

209
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,760
Dazzling stellar phenomena tread the firmament.

210
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,519
Dazzling stellar phenomena tread the firmament.

211
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:36,900
Duanmen is just one of the gates.

212
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,640
Duanmen is just one of the gates.

213
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,900
The guards stand in the east and west.

214
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,959
The guards stand in the east and west.

215
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:50,360
Master, I have a question here.

216
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,080
Now is not the time for queries.

217
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,140
If you have questions,

218
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,060
and you still don't understand them
after I finish the lecture,

219
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,520
you can ask them.

220
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,580
But asking them now is the same.

221
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,280
Because I never understood it,

222
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,880
and I am very anxious.

223
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,180
Here, about the guards.

224
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,140
Where are your manners?

225
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,020
As a fortuneteller,

226
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,580
you mustn't be anxious

227
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,220
or impatient for success.

228
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,880
- Young Master.
- You should be calm and composed at all times.

229
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,680
Just like our Master.

230
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,520
Just like the Master,
occasionally being impatient

231
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,880
is also normal.

232
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,000
Young Master, hurry up.

233
00:21:15,136 --> 00:21:16,219
How did you get in?

234
00:21:16,219 --> 00:21:17,860
I haven't forgiven you yet. Leave.

235
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,580
Madam, let me wait here today.

236
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,480
Go away, you're an eyesore.

237
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,768
Madam.

238
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,032
Leave.

239
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,000
Okay, I'll leave.

240
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,620
It's already daylight.

241
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,200
How come there is no movement inside?

242
00:23:25,248 --> 00:23:26,304
Young Master.

243
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,160
They're gone.

244
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,480
Young master, they left through the side door.

245
00:23:59,808 --> 00:24:00,832
Young master.

246
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,559
After several years of entanglement,

247
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:11,400
I think you all understand
the meaning of "Deep love hurts".

248
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,460
He Jiuling is fine.

249
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,599
I'll take her away.

250
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,960
I only wish that you two

251
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,559
would bid farewell and let go.

252
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:43,519
Take a look.

253
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:46,599
Not bad.

254
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:48,260
Everyone says how lovely
the water towns in the South are.

255
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,800
The liveliness and prosperity here

256
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,000
are certainly no less than in the capital city.

257
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Tomorrow, are we going to Liuzhou?

258
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,079
Your Majesty, not Liuzhou, it's Chudi.

259
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:00,559
Why Chudi? Who arranged this?

260
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:03,480
The Princess heard that Your Majesty
wanted to make a secret visit,

261
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,880
and she especially wrote a letter inviting us.

262
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:07,039
No, we're not going.

263
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,080
Chu must be planning to torture

264
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,359
these courtiers following me.

265
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,359
Yes, I will inform the others
and change the route to Liuzhou tonight.

266
00:25:15,616 --> 00:25:16,672
Look.

267
00:25:18,048 --> 00:25:19,136
This is for you.

268
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,559
Chu might be a bit unruly.

269
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,279
But what she said is not wrong.

270
00:25:32,256 --> 00:25:33,312
The women in the South

271
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,360
are indeed more passionate and interesting

272
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,799
than the women in the capital city.

273
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,400
Little Uncle.

274
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,599
Can I ask you for a favor?

275
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,960
Did you call me Little Uncle?

276
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,199
Old Uncle.

277
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:08,580
Can I ask you for a favor?

278
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,000
Not Uncle, I…

279
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:14,719
If you insist on a title, call me brother.

280
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:16,279
Alright, old brother.

281
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,140
Everything about the south is good,

282
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,580
except for the children

283
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,119
who are a bit sillier
than those in the capital.

284
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,359
Tell me, what do you need?

285
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,119
Can you help me carry this?

286
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
My house is still some distance from here,

287
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,759
and I really can't carry it anymore.

288
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:39,200
Why are you out here at this age?

289
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,240
Where are your parents?

290
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,079
Why are you asking about my family?

291
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,320
I'm just asking.

292
00:26:46,496 --> 00:26:47,520
It's right for you not to tell me.

293
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,760
At such a young age,
if you encounter bad people,

294
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,919
it will be dangerous.

295
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:51,936
Bad people?

296
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:53,960
I'm not afraid of bad people.

297
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:55,800
Why aren't you scared?

298
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,079
You're just a little girl.

299
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,519
Aren't you afraid that I'll kidnap you?

300
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,319
I'd like to see you try.

301
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,959
You're pretty tough, huh?

302
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:07,559
No, in the whole family, I am the weakest.

303
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,760
Wang Dequan, this young girl
might be a little silly,

304
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,039
but she's quite interesting.

305
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,720
Yes, yes.

306
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:18,119
Come on, let's go. I'll take it.

307
00:27:18,752 --> 00:27:19,808
Take this.

308
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,200
Okay, let's go.

309
00:27:23,648 --> 00:27:24,704
What's in this?

310
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,328
There's a noise.

311
00:27:27,328 --> 00:27:28,519
A cricket?

312
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:29,536
No.

313
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,776
A scarab beetle?

314
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,728
But it doesn't seem like it.

315
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,776
An owl?

316
00:27:36,384 --> 00:27:37,440
An owl?

317
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,360
There's such a bug?

318
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,376
No, there isn't.

319
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,440
Mom said only I could raise it.

320
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,520
Don't open it.

321
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,304
Don't open it.

322
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,800
Now you believe me, right?

323
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,400
I am not afraid of bad people.

324
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,839
It's like you've drunk a hundred jars of wine.

325
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,380
Make way. Move.

326
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,820
I'm not afraid of bad people.

327
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,100
I'm not a bad guy.

328
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,880
I didn't do it on purpose.

329
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:18,119
Mom.

330
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:20,599
Mom.

331
00:28:27,552 --> 00:28:28,608
Rong'er.

332
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,296
Come on.

333
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:54,720
What about my child?

334
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:56,799
Young master, are you alright?

335
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:25,960
What… what about me?

336
00:29:35,956 --> 00:29:42,040
