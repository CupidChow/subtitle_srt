[Episode 8]

4
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,439
You understood what I said?

5
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,760
Get the teapot. I want to drink water.

6
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,339
I am He Jiuling.

7
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,359
At least you could understand my actions today.

8
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:09,616
It's worth celebrating.

9
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,068
Put on your shoes. The ground is cold.

10
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:17,656
Shoes.

11
00:02:24,572 --> 00:02:25,628
Madam, I've brought the things you wanted.

12
00:02:25,628 --> 00:02:28,579
Madam, I've brought the things you wanted.

13
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,819
Here are the sweet potatoes you wanted.

14
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,080
You're almost running out of food, and you're still giving the best things to strangers.

15
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,680
You're almost running out of food, and you're still giving the best things to strangers.

16
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,219
Everyone who comes is a guest.

17
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:42,480
Moreover, those two are pitiable.

18
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,180
We should treat them nicely.

19
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,240
You're so kind. I'll be leaving now.

20
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,188
Take care.

21
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:55,536
Here. Have a sweet potato.

22
00:02:55,536 --> 00:02:56,260
Thank you, madam. This is my husband.

23
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,699
- Thank you, madam. 
 - This is my husband.

24
00:02:57,699 --> 00:03:01,080
He's just like your boyfriend. He doesn't speak either.

25
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,000
Your husband looks quite strong and capable of work.

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,059
Your husband looks quite strong and capable of work.

27
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,816
He's unlike my boyfriend,

28
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,240
who can't speak and is physically weak.

29
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,839
But he is nice to you.

30
00:03:17,728 --> 00:03:18,920
Eat it yourself.

31
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,639
I know how to use a spoon.

32
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,200
I've never seen a couple as devoted as you two.

33
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,980
Maybe your father is not insightful enough about men.

34
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,560
It doesn't matter if a man is strong or not.

35
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,100
What's important is that he is nice to the one he loves.

36
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,460
With such a young master lowering his dignity to take care of you, you are very blessed.

37
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,300
With such a young master lowering his dignity to take care of you, you are very blessed.

38
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,119
With such a young master lowering his dignity to take care of you, you are very blessed.

39
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:45,739
If this isn't enough for your father to let you marry him, he must be very blind.

40
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:49,240
If this isn't enough for your father to let you marry him, he must be very blind.

41
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,840
I'll give you a piece of advice.

42
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,000
Stay at my place for a few more days, and don't go back until you two have a baby.

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,759
Stay at my place for a few more days, and don't go back until you two have a baby.

44
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,520
No need.

45
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,200
We will set off tomorrow.

46
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,460
We are going to visit a relative.

47
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,400
Is that relative reliable?

48
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,860
Don't worry.

49
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,839
That relative will definitely take us in.

50
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:15,519
Could you not feed me continuously?

51
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,759
Let me take a break, will you?

52
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,748
Let me take a break, will you?

53
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,800
Eat it yourself.

54
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,780
I can eat myself. Look.

55
00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:50,720
You are quite normal when you feed yourself.

56
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,560
Yet you fed me like a pig.

57
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,739
Madam, this is our thank-you gift for letting us stay.

58
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:06,040
No, I can't take it.

59
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,639
I just let you stay for one night.

60
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,120
I didn't do anything else.

61
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,760
I can't accept so much money.

62
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,000
Just take it.

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,660
And please buy me some plain clothes.

64
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,240
I will get it done after the meal.

65
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:39,039
Take care of each other on the road and live a good life.

66
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,800
Thank you, madam.

67
00:05:47,284 --> 00:05:47,840
- Then we're leaving. 
 - Take care.

68
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,928
- Then we're leaving. 
 - Take care.

69
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,000
Be good. Don't run around.

70
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,380
Master Rong?

71
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,199
Master Rong!

72
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,419
Young Master!

73
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,272
Miss He?

74
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,060
Why are you dressed like this?

75
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,708
You…

76
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:35,440
You must have mistaken me for someone else.

77
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,360
Please do not follow us. I am scared.

78
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,300
You are scared?

79
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,519
You kicked me so hard just now, and you said you were scared?

80
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,640
You kicked me so hard just now, and you said you were scared?

81
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,399
You've already given yourself away. All right?

82
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,820
Miss He, so the person next to you must be Master Rong.

83
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,639
Miss He, so the person next to you must be Master Rong.

84
00:06:53,216 --> 00:06:54,220
There's no doubt about it.

85
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,559
I've been drawing his picture for so many years. I won't be wrong.

86
00:06:57,559 --> 00:06:59,040
Oh, Heaven.

87
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,159
Master Rong has finally woken up!

88
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,600
Master Rong. Master Rong.

89
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,808
He's really a fool now?

90
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,860
My livelihood!

91
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,679
I won't sell any books.

92
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:28,920
My heart aches.

93
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:33,079
He will always be the Star-picking Master.

94
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:36,080
Once I take him to Mount Wuhua, everything will be fine.

95
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,319
Then go.

96
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,700
Why are you creeping around here?

97
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,100
Haven't you noticed that they are searching everywhere?

98
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,428
Searching for you?

99
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,560
He's the young master of the Astrology Pavilion and His Majesty's favorite minister.

100
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,544
He's the young master of the Astrology Pavilion and His Majesty's favorite minister.

101
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:59,600
I guess the capital is probably in chaos now.

102
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,020
Even this small city has checkpoints.

103
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,300
B-But aren't you guys already married?

104
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,380
Nobody believes you can save him.

105
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,504
Me and him…

106
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,284
Forget it.

107
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,940
Keep an eye on him for now.

108
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,160
I'm going to the post station to see if there's a hitchride.

109
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,880
Your hand is injured. I will go ask.

110
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,500
That will do.

111
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,440
Then ask them if there's a carriage that goes to Shidu.

112
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,412
If not, ask them if there's a carriage going to Mengze in Jiangling or Xinze Lake in Guizhao.

113
00:08:29,412 --> 00:08:31,560
The carriage to Mengze in Jiangling must be big.

114
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,240
Master Rong's in bad condition.

115
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,960
But if it's a carriage to Xinze Lake in Guizhao, it must be small.

116
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,719
There are too many officers and soldiers along the way.

117
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,159
If we get recognized on the way, we're done.

118
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,020
If there's nothing available, ask them if there's any—

119
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,279
Stop. You go and ask yourself.

120
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:51,300
I'll stay and take care of him.

121
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,484
All right.

122
00:08:52,484 --> 00:08:54,400
Young Master.

123
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,899
I'm going to find some water.

124
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:01,979
We're out of water.

125
00:09:01,979 --> 00:09:04,120
I need to get some.

126
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,700
T-To find water?

127
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,959
Wait here for me. All right?

128
00:09:11,739 --> 00:09:15,232
I'll get you a bun to eat.

129
00:09:15,232 --> 00:09:16,720
Bun?

130
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,784
Once you finish eating it, I'll be back.

131
00:09:35,648 --> 00:09:37,336
Thanks.

132
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,980
I'm adding some seasoning powder for you.

133
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,779
Here, take the bun.

134
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,692
Take good care of him.

135
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,680
We have the same buns. Why does yours smell so good?

136
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,959
Why does yours smell so good?

137
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,120
Star-picking Master, it's an honor to spend time with you at such close range.

138
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,959
Though the timing isn't right, I want to introduce myself. I am—

139
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:33,140
Though the timing isn't right, I want to introduce myself. I am—

140
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,400

 Be careful. Don't slip.

144
00:10:43,859 --> 00:10:45,436
Sir, do you have a carriage that goes to Mengze in Jiangling?

145
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,979
Sir, do you have a carriage that goes to Mengze in Jiangling?

146
00:10:50,979 --> 00:10:53,720
If not, I could rent one.

147
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,860
I'm not too sure myself.

148
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,820
Why don't you go in and ask our boss?

149
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,659
Thank you.

150
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:02,428
Please come in.

151
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,500
Do you have a carriage going to Mengze in Jiangling or Guizhao?

152
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,359
Do you have a carriage going to Mengze in Jiangling or Guizhao?

153
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,699
If you do, I will rent it. I don't mind the cost.

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,059
♫ How difficult it is to meet each other ♫

177
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,676
Let go of me!

178
00:12:50,676 --> 00:12:53,639
Let me go!

179
00:12:54,812 --> 00:12:59,358
♫ How difficult it is to meet each other, let's get drunk ♫

180
00:12:59,358 --> 00:13:05,408
♫ Floating clouds and changing seas, we will never forget each other ♫

181
00:13:05,408 --> 00:13:11,038
♫ Let's drink all the way up to the high mountains 
 and long rivers ♫

182
00:13:11,038 --> 00:13:12,720
Rong Yu!

183
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,180
♫ Having a drink, considering thoughts ♫

184
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,936
♫ How difficult it is to meet each other, let's get drunk ♫

185
00:13:19,936 --> 00:13:23,992
♫ Let's drink to our sorrow ♫

186
00:13:23,992 --> 00:13:28,471
♫ The hair on the temples is all frost, 
 laughing at the distressing dreams ♫

187
00:13:28,471 --> 00:13:37,872
♫ Floating clouds and changing seas, we will never forget each other ♫

188
00:13:43,652 --> 00:13:45,404
Ling'er!

189
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,599
Thank you for sending my daughter home.

190
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:52,320
- Tell Lord Rong that I can't see him today. 
 - Are you hurt? Are you okay?

191
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,160
Tomorrow, I will personally apologize to him.

192
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,100
General He, my master said there's no need for that.

193
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,879
He also stated that people from the He family should no longer visit Rong Mansion.

194
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:05,628
What?

195
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,959
You are not hurt, are you? Your hand…

196
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:16,659
How did your hand get all tied up?

197
00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:19,320
Zong Ming, call the doctor.

198
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,280
The Rongs don't want Rong Yu to go to Mount Wuhua.

199
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,400
You insisted on taking him anyway.

200
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,160
I don't care about Rong Yu.

201
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,260
But if something happens to you, how will Father and I survive that?

202
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,840
But if something happens to you, how will Father and I survive that?

203
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,060
Enough. It's good that she came back.

204
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,680
I must say.

205
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,820
Didn't you hear what that person just said?

206
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,660
He said, "People from the He family should no longer visit Rong Mansion."

207
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,452
And look at what Rong Jiang did.

208
00:14:38,452 --> 00:14:40,700
Rong Yu is still unconscious, and he sent us engagement gifts.

209
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,764
Is he even human?

210
00:14:42,764 --> 00:14:45,499
Are the Rong family worthy of you risking yourself like this?

211
00:14:45,499 --> 00:14:47,300
Qiuting.

212
00:14:50,564 --> 00:14:52,588
Father.

213
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:57,220
Actually, Rong Yu woke up.

214
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,476
Really?

215
00:14:59,476 --> 00:15:01,660
That's good news.

216
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:03,460
Jiuling, even though you were a bit reckless, you got a good result in the end.

217
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,940
Jiuling, even though you were a bit reckless, you got a good result in the end.

218
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,020
Jiuling, even though you were a bit reckless, you got a good result in the end.

219
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,480
You should be happy for that.

220
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,840
I want to be happy.

221
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,259
But I can't be happy at all.

222
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:18,440
- Ling'er. 
 - Jiuling!

223
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:20,924
Ling'er!

224
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,579
Young Master! Young Master, you can't go out.

225
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:37,200
Young Master, you can't go out.

226
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,532
Young Master.

227
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,836
You can't go out.

228
00:15:48,804 --> 00:15:50,360
Lord Rong, I am ashamed.

229
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,130
Lord Rong, I am ashamed.

230
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,039
The current situation of the young master is something I've rarely seen in my life.

231
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,760
The current situation of the young master is something I've rarely seen in my life.

232
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,999
So I can only try to write a few prescriptions, hoping they can make him better.

233
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:03,579
So I can only try to write a few prescriptions, hoping they can make him better.

234
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:05,640
So he's just like that?

235
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,920
Foolish?

236
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:13,199
He can't remember anything.

237
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,079
But why does he only remember her?

238
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:19,560
Why does he want her?

239
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,139
Why does it have to be her?

240
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:25,040
Lord Rong, this is not hard to understand.

241
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,380
Newborn ducks and goslings will stick with the first person they see.

242
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,280
Newborn ducks and goslings will stick with the first person they see.

243
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,980
The young master is now mentally like a newborn baby.

244
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,360
When he was conscious, only Miss He was by his side.

245
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,420
He naturally considers her the closest person and feels uneasy if she is not present.

246
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,139
The closest person…

247
00:16:49,739 --> 00:16:54,220
This is going to turn the Rong family upside down.

248
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,660
Young Master! Young Master, you can't go out.

249
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,076
Yes.

250
00:17:01,076 --> 00:17:03,160
Young Master, you cannot go out.

251
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,800
I will go back to the Imperial Medical Bureau and discuss it with everyone.

252
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,640
I will take my leave first.

253
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,039
Young Master, you cannot go out.

254
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,760
Young Master, please stop.

255
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,259
Young Master…

256
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:34,419
Young Master is awake.

257
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:36,740
Heshan, did you hear that?

258
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,699
Young Master is awake.

259
00:17:38,699 --> 00:17:40,640
In the future, you will still be his personal guards.

260
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,980
In the future, you will still be his personal guards.

261
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,840
Thank you for your kindness.

262
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,959
But I can't forgive your betrayal of the Rong family.

263
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:52,264
But I can't forgive your betrayal of the Rong family.

264
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:56,984
The sin...

265
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,440
shall be borne by me alone.

266
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:08,752
Leave a decent person by Young Master's side.

267
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,020
Master, I have a thing to ask.

268
00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:40,679
Yu'er, here.

269
00:18:41,316 --> 00:18:44,604
Let's eat. Take these.

270
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,719
Let's eat.

271
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,859
Good. Grab them.

272
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:01,840
Yu'er, this soup is your favorite.

273
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,448
Here.

274
00:19:18,752 --> 00:19:22,408
Come. Drink some soup.

275
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,064
Do you want to eat the bun?

276
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:39,484
Here.

277
00:19:41,316 --> 00:19:43,204
Come one.

278
00:19:43,204 --> 00:19:45,348
Eat it.

279
00:19:58,659 --> 00:19:59,984
Does it not taste good?

280
00:20:06,532 --> 00:20:07,956
Someone!

281
00:20:10,456 --> 00:20:10,880
- Sir. 
 - Tell the kitchen to make whatever buns they can.

282
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,420
- Sir. 
 - Tell the kitchen to make whatever buns they can.

283
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,240
Also, go outside and buy one of every type of bun in the city.

284
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,220
Also, go outside and buy one of every type of bun in the city.

285
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,279
Go.

286
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:21,859
Mister, bakeries only do early morning business.

287
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:24,539
Then bring those bakers back to make buns here.

288
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:26,439
Double-pay them.

289
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:28,156
Do I need to teach you that?

290
00:20:28,156 --> 00:20:29,720
I'm on my way now.

291
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,140
Yu'er.

292
00:20:58,112 --> 00:20:59,968
Young Master!

293
00:21:01,604 --> 00:21:03,228
Young Master!

294
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:10,044
Young Master!

295
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,000
Young Master!

296
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,808
I am sorry.

297
00:21:34,808 --> 00:21:38,319
You're awake. That's great.

298
00:22:32,828 --> 00:22:35,116
Rong Yu!

299
00:22:52,068 --> 00:22:53,692
Jiuling! Your hand!

300
00:22:53,692 --> 00:22:54,960
Jiuling! Your hand!

301
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,420
Your left hand is just an auxiliary one.

302
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,500
Don't rush to exercise it.

303
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,139
Martial arts practitioners should not rush for success.

304
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,488
I don't.

305
00:23:06,488 --> 00:23:08,540
Aren't you eager to become stronger?

306
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,200
But now you are too eager.

307
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,820
Even if you can use a sword now, I can beat you with my bare feet.

308
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,079
Even if you can use a sword now, I can beat you with my bare feet.

309
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:19,560
What's wrong with wanting to become strong?

310
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,680
In the future, no one can hurt anyone in front of me.

311
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,779
In the future, no one can hurt anyone in front of me.

312
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:27,360
No one can take anyone away from me.

313
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:30,419
I know.

314
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:32,356
You don't.

315
00:23:32,356 --> 00:23:34,659
In those ten years at Mount Wuhua, my master and senior brother protected me.

316
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:37,219
In those ten years at Mount Wuhua, my master and senior brother protected me.

317
00:23:37,219 --> 00:23:40,279
When I got back, you guys protected me.

318
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:45,000
But I can't protect anyone.

319
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,359
Didn't you say before that you were the best in the world?

320
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,080
That's just nonsense.

321
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,340
Don't use it against me.

322
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:02,380
Meet me at the training ground tomorrow morning, and let's exercise.

323
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,700
Meet me at the training ground tomorrow morning, and let's exercise.

324
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,412
Can you get up on time?

325
00:24:08,808 --> 00:24:10,296
I can.

326
00:24:10,296 --> 00:24:12,599
If you really want to learn martial arts, we won't indulge you like at home.

327
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:15,820
If you really want to learn martial arts, we won't indulge you like at home.

328
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,100
I don't need indulgence.

329
00:24:31,983 --> 00:24:34,020
[To my disciple, Jiuling]

330
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,620
I have a deep hatred for the Astrology Pavilion.

331
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,599
Hence, the life or death of people from that place is irrelevant to me.

332
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:44,320
I will leave the mountain and travel soon.

333
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,619
Don't come looking for me.

334
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:51,480
What kind of old history...

335
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,060
can make my master harbor such hatred?

336
00:24:56,659 --> 00:24:58,860
It must be painful.

337
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,180
Do I have to make my master give up her hatred for the mistake I made?

338
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,219
Do I have to make my master give up her hatred for the mistake I made?

339
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,279
Senior Brother, something is wrong with Amnesia.

340
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,959
After taking it, Rong Yu not only didn't sever emotional ties but was also mentally damaged.

341
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:33,700
After taking it, Rong Yu not only didn't sever emotional ties but was also mentally damaged.

342
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,820
After taking it, Rong Yu not only didn't sever emotional ties but was also mentally damaged.

343
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,499
I need a prescription to make an antidote.

344
00:25:38,499 --> 00:25:40,284
I'm hoping to get a reply soon.

345
00:25:40,284 --> 00:25:42,120
Send the Blood Vine Grass and Dragon Head Ginseng that I've found to Jialin quickly.

346
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,700
Send the Blood Vine Grass and Dragon Head Ginseng that I've found to Jialin quickly.

347
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,768
Your Highness, these are the treasures of healing you've found for our king.

348
00:25:44,768 --> 00:25:46,060
Your Highness, these are the treasures of healing you've found for our king.

349
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,999
Your Highness, these are the treasures of healing you've found for our king.

350
00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:48,840
It took you two years to finally get your footing right.

351
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,639
It took you two years to finally get your footing right.

352
00:25:50,639 --> 00:25:53,360
Now, we are at the moment where the king is re-choosing the heir.

353
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,976
So please don't do that.

354
00:25:54,976 --> 00:25:58,179
Hurry to Jialin. This matter needs not to be discussed again.

355
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,340
Okay.

356
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,572
Okay.

357
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:20,740
- How is it going? 
 - It’s hard to describe in one word.

358
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,620
- How is it going? 
 - It’s hard to describe in one word.

359
00:26:29,472 --> 00:26:31,128
Take care.

360
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:34,724
Watch out.

361
00:26:34,724 --> 00:26:36,444
Faster!

362
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:46,899
Hold steady. And thrust!

363
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,420
Miss, are you here to see Young Master, too?

364
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,279
I'm afraid you might have come in vain.

365
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,580
Something happened to Young Master recently.

366
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,299
He hasn't been out in a while.

367
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:26,500
In the past, many people waited here just to catch a glimpse of him.

368
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,040
In the past, many people waited here just to catch a glimpse of him.

369
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,280
But things have changed.

370
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,680
Even my tea stand business is down.

371
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,319
Could you get me a pot of tea?

372
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:36,512
Okay.

373
00:27:36,512 --> 00:27:37,920
I also heard that he seems to have become a fool.

374
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,780
I also heard that he seems to have become a fool.

375
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,400
He can't eat or speak.

376
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,200
And yet, you still like him.

377
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,380
You are the only one I've seen like this during this time.

378
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,132
He is not a fool.

379
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:54,960
All right, he's not.

380
00:28:00,336 --> 00:28:01,139
Idiot.

381
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:03,079
Truly an idiot.

382
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:06,380
When I was here with my father last time, he was just staring at a bun.

383
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:10,060
This time we came, and he was still staring at a pancake.

384
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,040
Don't you think he looks like someone?

385
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,799
He looks like the dog you fed the bun to last time.

386
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,119
Exactly.

387
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:17,939
You also noticed his gaze. Right?

388
00:28:17,939 --> 00:28:20,860
Yes, the gaze is exactly the same.

389
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,300
I initially planned to throw a stone at him when the two guards were not looking.

390
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,160
I initially planned to throw a stone at him when the two guards were not looking.

391
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,919
I wanted to see if he truly couldn't speak or dodge.

392
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,179
I wanted to see if he truly couldn't speak or dodge.

393
00:28:35,008 --> 00:28:36,040
Who hit me?

394
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,040
Your nose is bleeding. Are you okay?

395
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:40,760
- Sir, do you need me to wipe the blood? 
 - Who hit me?

396
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,980
Who wants your damn rag?

397
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,084
- Are you okay? 
 - Who is it?

398
00:28:44,084 --> 00:28:45,100
It's her.

399
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,440
Go.

400
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,124
You…

401
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,400
H-He Jiuling.

402
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:55,119
Did you throw the stone?

403
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,240
Tell me! Did you throw the stone?

404
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,540
No, I didn't. The guards in the mansion were watching closely. It was just my thought.

405
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,579
No, I didn't. The guards in the mansion were watching closely. It was just my thought.

406
00:29:01,579 --> 00:29:04,519
I really didn't throw it.

407
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:11,640
Ouch, it hurts. Miss He! Miss He!

408
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,552
Get me a bun.

409
00:29:12,552 --> 00:29:13,400
Okay.

410
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,279
Miss He, what are you trying to do?

411
00:29:17,628 --> 00:29:19,616
Here, miss.

412
00:29:19,616 --> 00:29:22,999
This is the bun awarded to you by me. Eat it.

413
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:25,380
Eat it with gratitude.

414
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,939
Eat it.

415
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,408
Eat it now.

416
00:29:40,408 --> 00:29:41,680
Eat.

417
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,879
He Jiuling, we were trying to stand up for you.

418
00:29:45,879 --> 00:29:47,459
His Majesty granted your marriage to him.

419
00:29:47,459 --> 00:29:49,199
But now he has turned into a fool.

420
00:29:49,199 --> 00:29:51,220
How is he worthy of you?

421
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,359
What does it have to do with you?

422
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:55,319
If you keep spouting nonsense, next time what I feed you won't be just a bun.

423
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:57,639
If you keep spouting nonsense, next time what I feed you won't be just a bun.

424
00:29:57,639 --> 00:29:59,840
Y-Y-You… you are lawless.

425
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,560
Have you forgotten the fate of the young lord?

426
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,340
- Sir, should we stop this? 
 - Everyone, get out!

427
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,820
They came here to see the spectacle with the excuse of visiting the sick.

428
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,700
I can't teach them a lesson.

429
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,604
Let her hit them.

430
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,712
- Sir. 
 - Is there something wrong with Young Master?

431
00:30:23,712 --> 00:30:25,300
- Sir. 
 - Is there something wrong with Young Master?

432
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,700
The buns are spoiled.

433
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,120
Buy more.

434
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,399
Yes.

435
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,716
Miss He.

436
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,532
Did Rong Yu…

437
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,919
Your face…

438
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,912
It's nothing.

439
00:30:52,912 --> 00:30:55,499
How could it be nothing? It's all because of me…

440
00:30:55,499 --> 00:30:57,359
How could it be nothing? It's all because of me…

441
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:59,719
I need to go back.

442
00:30:59,719 --> 00:31:01,659
Young Master isn't feeling well.

443
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:03,639
He hardly sleeps or eats.

444
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:06,060
All he does is stare at a bun all day.

445
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:09,060
I'm adding some seasoning powder for you.

446
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:12,019
Once you finish eating it, I'll be back.

447
00:31:12,459 --> 00:31:14,248
I think I know why he doesn't eat.

448
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:15,240
I will go buy it.

449
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,724
Miss He.

450
00:31:18,979 --> 00:31:22,359
Can you visit Young Master?

451
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,940
No, I won't go.

452
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,140
I can't implicate anyone else.

453
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,268
Don't worry.

454
00:31:31,268 --> 00:31:33,920
Nobody will be punished again.

455
00:31:36,676 --> 00:31:38,300
Young Master.

456
00:31:39,716 --> 00:31:41,340
Young Master.

457
00:32:08,768 --> 00:32:11,540
Young Master, this way.

458
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:15,560
Young Master, slow down.

459
00:32:16,928 --> 00:32:18,239
Slowly.

460
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:20,404
Come.

461
00:32:27,264 --> 00:32:29,179
Slowly, Young Master.

462
00:32:31,556 --> 00:32:33,180
Come.

463
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:46,979
