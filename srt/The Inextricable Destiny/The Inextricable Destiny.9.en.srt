[To Jiuling]

5
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,748
General He.

6
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:45,500
Lord Li.

7
00:02:46,084 --> 00:02:47,279
Master He, I presume the marriage between the Astrology Pavilion and the General Mansion will be arranged soon.

8
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:50,560
Master He, I presume the marriage between the Astrology Pavilion and the General Mansion will be arranged soon.

9
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,100
Master He, I presume the marriage between the Astrology Pavilion and the General Mansion will be arranged soon.

10
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,459
When will we receive the wedding invitations?

11
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:58,160
My second and third brothers are not yet married, so Ling'er won't get married in a short time.

12
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,799
My second and third brothers are not yet married, so Ling'er won't get married in a short time.

13
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:02,699
Besides, the young master is seriously ill.

14
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:04,760
How can he manage a wedding?

15
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,288
Please be careful with your words, My Lords.

16
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:10,899
I'm already preparing for the wedding.

17
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:14,879
That's good. Then we will wait for the wedding invitation.

18
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,800
I'll take my leave.

19
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,500
We will definitely bring generous gifts to the wedding.

20
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,640
Congratulations.

21
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,479
- Lord Rong, Rong Yu and Ling'er are... 
 - sure to be married.

22
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,560
- Lord Rong, Rong Yu and Ling'er are... 
 - sure to be married.

23
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,580
But I have visited your mansion several times, and you have always refused to see me.

24
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,700
But I have visited your mansion several times, and you have always refused to see me.

25
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,959
Why are you bringing up their marriage now?

26
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,380
General, you are wrong.

27
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,480
I said there's no need for you to visit.

28
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,800
What does that have to do with He Jiuling?

29
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:51,240
She is now a member of my family no matter if she's alive or dead.

30
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,600
She is now a member of my family no matter if she's alive or dead.

31
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,619
Nonsense! It's totally nonsense.

32
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,560
What did Rong Jiang mean?

33
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,280
Does he want me to marry Ling'er to Rong Yu and let her die there?

34
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,400
Does he want me to marry Ling'er to Rong Yu and let her die there?

35
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,480
Ling'er is the apple of my eye.

36
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,320
I won't let them torment her.

37
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:19,080
It doesn't matter what Lord Rong wants.

38
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,004
The thing that matters is…

39
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,100
Father, do you still want to keep this promise and marry Ling'er to Rong Yu?

40
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,279
Father, do you still want to keep this promise and marry Ling'er to Rong Yu?

[He Mansion]

42
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,519
No rush.

43
00:04:55,339 --> 00:04:57,200
Nobody showed up in the last several evenings.

44
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,620
Today everyone is here.

45
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,400
I got some good news.

46
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:12,079
My left hand...

47
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:18,680
can hold things now.

48
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:27,079
Let me serve the soup for you, Sister-in-law.

49
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,260
- Be careful. 
 - Actually,

50
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,999
I'm good at making soup.

51
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:39,779
I'll show you all next time.

52
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,040
Why don't you eat?

53
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,880
Ling'er, I am trying to find a way to cancel your marriage agreement with Rong Yu.

54
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,800
Ling'er, I am trying to find a way to cancel your marriage agreement with Rong Yu.

55
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:05,360
Why bring this up all of a sudden?

56
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,679
It has to be solved sooner or later.

57
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:13,159
When Rong Yu brought the decree of breaking off your marriage, I did not agree.

58
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:14,700
When Rong Yu brought the decree of breaking off your marriage, I did not agree.

59
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,840
It was my fault.

60
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:23,639
Rong Yu brought the decree of breaking off our marriage?

61
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,779
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

62
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:27,620
At that time, I just wanted you to marry him.

63
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,760
At that time, I just wanted you to marry him.

64
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,840
How could I possibly tell you?

65
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,079
So why now?

66
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,820
You think Rong Yu is foolish.

67
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,420
You disdain him. You look down on him.

68
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,680
So you want me to break off the engagement.

69
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,359
Fancy that!

70
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:51,940
You are righteous, candid, and sharp-sighted.

71
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,500
How can you be so vulgar this time?

72
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:00,640
You don't like the marriage either, do you?

73
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,480
Now, Father and our oldest brother are on your side.

74
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,100
Why aren't you happy?

75
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,180
You really want to spend your life with a man who cannot do or understand anything?

76
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,400
You really want to spend your life with a man who cannot do or understand anything?

77
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,980
Why don't you want to marry a true hero who can travel thousands of miles on horseback across rivers and mountains?

78
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,720
Why don't you want to marry a true hero who can travel thousands of miles on horseback across rivers and mountains?

79
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,520
If I had broken the engagement when he was the Best Young Master of Jialin, I was plain and candid.

80
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,540
If I had broken the engagement when he was the Best Young Master of Jialin, I was plain and candid.

81
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,279
But now he is ill and his future is ruined.

82
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,680
If I step away now, I'm afraid we will be humiliated by everyone.

83
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,739
If I step away now, I'm afraid we will be humiliated by everyone.

84
00:07:22,739 --> 00:07:25,539
If I step away now, I'm afraid we will be humiliated by everyone.

85
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,920
Ling'er, what do you think?

86
00:07:35,739 --> 00:07:37,119
I...

87
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,260
will cancel the engagement after he recovers.

88
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,260
What if he won't recover?

89
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,319
He will.

90
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,740
Though my master is unwilling to help, I'm his disciple.

91
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,800
Though my master is unwilling to help, I'm his disciple.

92
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,020
I'm working on a plan. Will you trust me?

93
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,260
What if you're asked to marry him soon?

94
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,180
Then I will marry him.

95
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,419
Are you out of your mind?

96
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:00,460
I have never been soberer than now.

97
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,600
Sober? I think you've lost your mind.

98
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,980
Sober? I think you've lost your mind.

99
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,160
You have no idea. Rong Jiang…

100
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,060
That's enough.

101
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,579
Ling'er, sit down.

102
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,412
Sit down.

103
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,080
Sit down.

104
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:20,060
I have to tell you.

105
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,859
I'm not discussing it with you.

106
00:08:21,859 --> 00:08:24,860
I'm just telling you my decision.

107
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,480
If anyone humiliates us, let them do it.

108
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,060
If anyone humiliates us, let them do it.

109
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,219
But, no matter what, I will never let you marry Rong Yu.

110
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:34,559
But, no matter what, I will never let you marry Rong Yu.

111
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,579
You shouldn't go anywhere for a while.

112
00:08:37,579 --> 00:08:40,000
Think carefully at home.

113
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,879
- Ling'er. 
 - Let her go.

114
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,484
Jiuling!

115
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,840
Keep a close eye on her these days.

116
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,199
Don't let her go out.

117
00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:02,740
Yes.

118
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,039
Okay, let's eat.

119
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:06,819
After dinner, I have something else to tell you.

120
00:09:06,819 --> 00:09:09,720
After dinner, I have something else to tell you.

121
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:29,819
Jiuling, stop. You are not allowed to go anywhere.

122
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:34,200
Let me go.

123
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:51,479
It's been five days.

124
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:54,820
Is something wrong with Miss He?

125
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:59,460
However, if anything happened to her, everyone in the capital would have known it.

126
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,019
However, if anything happened to her, everyone in the capital would have known it.

127
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,620
Young Master, don't wait any more.

128
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,060
She hasn't come at this hour. I don't think she will come today.

129
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,920
She hasn't come at this hour. I don't think she will come today.

130
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,339
Why don't we practice speaking or reading words?

131
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:16,300
Or Heshan can perform a sword dance for you.

132
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,419
His sword dance is good.

133
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,020
I bow to Your Majesty.

134
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:38,959
The situation at the border in Nanjiang has become critical.

135
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:43,996
Your Majesty,

136
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm willing to move my family out of the capital, and go to Nanjiang to hold the fort.

137
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,979
I'm willing to move my family out of the capital, and go to Nanjiang to hold the fort.

138
00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:53,740
I will set down roots at the borders...

139
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,099
to defend against the enemies for Jialin.

140
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,279
Jiuling, the prescription is attached.

141
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:11,799
If you have any questions, feel free to write me a letter.

142
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,480
Come here.

143
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,400
You two, move this over there.

144
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,084
Yes.

145
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:35,480
- Put this over there. 
 - Yes.

146
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,400
Be careful with this. Yes.

147
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,472
What is going on?

148
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,259
We may be moving.

149
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:44,460
Why are we moving?

150
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:47,000
Father's position has changed.

151
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,219
We are leaving the capital.

152
00:12:49,219 --> 00:12:50,400
It seems we are taking everything with us.

153
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,120
It seems we are taking everything with us.

154
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,299
Right. We're leaving with Father.

155
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:57,019
And your second brother won't return to the capital either.

156
00:12:57,019 --> 00:12:59,059
He will meet us there.

157
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,652
Ling'er!

158
00:13:02,652 --> 00:13:04,512
Jiuling!

159
00:13:04,512 --> 00:13:06,068
Ling'er!

160
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:16,559
Father, why are we leaving the capital?

161
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:18,700
My oldest brother loves solving cases in the Ministry of Justice.

162
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,979
My second brother will be promoted immediately when he returns to the capital.

163
00:13:20,979 --> 00:13:22,900
Third He wishes to serve as a Jinwu guard in the palace.

164
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,260
He had prepared for the spring test for such a long time.

165
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,860
Just because of my marriage, everyone will have to leave everything at hand.

166
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,920
Just because of my marriage, everyone will have to leave everything at hand.

167
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,080
And leave here for good.

168
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,360
If we want to serve the country and make friends, we can do that anywhere.

169
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,580
If we want to serve the country and make friends, we can do that anywhere.

170
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,519
If we want to serve the country and make friends, we can do that anywhere.

171
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,320
Okay, I am not going. I will stay here.

172
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,179
I will wait for Rong Yu to recover.

173
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,099
No one will stay here.

174
00:13:47,099 --> 00:13:49,720
The emperor has learned that you practice martial arts at school.

175
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,439
So he conferred the title of Left General to you.

176
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:53,660
You don't have any choice.

177
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,940
Why don't you ask for my opinion?

178
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,019
Because I know your opinion.

179
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:01,500
Do you think your marrying Rong Yu will change his current situation?

180
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,820
Do you think your marrying Rong Yu will change his current situation?

181
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,700
- Father. 
 - Don't you think it is torture for me, too?

182
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,528
If you want to compensate, fine.

183
00:14:17,528 --> 00:14:18,928
If you want to compensate, fine.

184
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,420
I will sacrifice everyone in our family to Rong Yu.

185
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,859
I will sacrifice everyone in our family to Rong Yu.

186
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,440
Chenzhou,

187
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:31,119
tell her...

188
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:34,640
what Rong Yu said.

189
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:43,599
Rong Yu said if Father insists on guarding the border, his contribution will make the emperor and the ministers afraid.

190
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:45,679
Rong Yu said if Father insists on guarding the border, his contribution will make the emperor and the ministers afraid.

191
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,759
Father will not end well.

192
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,540
N-Not end well.

193
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,579
N-Not end well.

194
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,840
D-D-Die in battle?

195
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,760
D-D-Die in battle?

196
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:03,780
Dying for Jialin, for the people, is the glory of our family.

197
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,739
Dying for Jialin, for the people, is the glory of our family.

198
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,520
Dying for Jialin, for the people, is the glory of our family.

199
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,616
So,

200
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,000
Rong Yu's prophecy doesn't scare me at all.

201
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,560
Rong Yu's prophecy doesn't scare me at all.

202
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,300
Yihua and I are also willing to die for Jialin.

203
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,800
Qingxing and Qiuting won't live alone either.

204
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:25,596
Ling'er,

205
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:29,540
it's not all about you this time.

206
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,620
The emperor has mentioned several times that the borders need to be guarded.

207
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,560
The emperor has mentioned several times that the borders need to be guarded.

208
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,640
We can't refuse.

209
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:43,139
To follow your brothers and me into the battlefield, to protect the people of Jialin,

210
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:45,520
To follow your brothers and me into the battlefield, to protect the people of Jialin,

211
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:49,279
you can also ensure Rong Yu's safety for the rest of his life.

212
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,400
you can also ensure Rong Yu's safety for the rest of his life.

213
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,579
Ling'er,

214
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,899
I also want to see you get married and have children.

215
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:04,639
I want to see you live a happy life.

216
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,100
But if I stay in the capital to see you marry a fool

217
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,979
But if I stay in the capital to see you marry a fool

218
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,960
and be scolded and tormented by others,

219
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,919
why would I live such a bitter life and abandon my strength of character?

220
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:19,559
why would I live such a bitter life and abandon my strength of character?

221
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:22,756
It's better that...

222
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,200
I follow the path that we should take.

223
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,459
Now that we've reached this point,

224
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,039
to stay or leave,

225
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,480
it's up to you.

226
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:46,419
I don't believe in Heaven, nor in fate.

227
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:48,060
I don't believe in Heaven, nor in fate.

228
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,199
I believe in man's ability to conquer nature.

229
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,060
I, He Jiuling,

230
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:08,659
am willing to dedicate myself to Jialin and die.

231
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,864
Prepare yourself.

232
00:17:36,864 --> 00:17:38,319
We will set out for Nanjiang the day after tomorrow.

233
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:41,019
We will set out for Nanjiang the day after tomorrow.

234
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,304
Rong Yu,

235
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,940
if we'd known the outcome from the start,

236
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,280
should I have not given you hope?

237
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:59,560
Even though I really want to see you again before we part,

238
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,820
Even though I really want to see you again before we part,

239
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,028
but... I can't.

240
00:18:04,028 --> 00:18:05,688
but... I can't.

241
00:18:05,688 --> 00:18:07,680
I shouldn't.

242
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:11,459
Please forget about me for now.

243
00:18:11,459 --> 00:18:14,220
In Nanjiang, there are many rare and exotic grasses.

244
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,200
I will make the antidote as soon as possible.

245
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,520
I will make the antidote as soon as possible.

00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,208
The master is here.

248
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,360
Young Master, take a look.

249
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,968
This is the note you wrote before. Take it.

250
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:14,580
Does he come to read every day?

251
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:18,200
Yes, he just doesn't recognize much yet.

252
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,320
The wind is a bit strong.

253
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,419
Young Master is not good.

254
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:40,440
And there's no stove here.

255
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,259
Don't come up here again.

256
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:46,619
Whatever he wants to read, you can fetch for him.

257
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,044
Yes.

258
00:19:48,459 --> 00:19:49,700
This is Master's stuff.

259
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,940
- Be careful with it. 
 - Yes, yes.

260
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,592
Be careful.

261
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,760
Ling'er, how is the packing going?

262
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:00,200
We are leaving early tomorrow.

263
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,159
Have you packed everything?

264
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,120
Jiuling, A'Tan said she will come to see you off tomorrow morning.

265
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,319
I have to go out to bid farewell to a few close friends later.

266
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,900
Maybe, we won't come back anymore.

267
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,300
Maybe, we won't come back anymore.

268
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,040
Perhaps, we will die on the battlefield in Nanjiang.

269

Perhaps, we will die on the battlefield in Nanjiang.

270

Don't be so gloomy.

346
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,860
Quickly, stop Young Master.

347
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,799
-Young Master! 
 - Young Master!

348
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,380
- He Jiuling. 
 - You can't go out.

349
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,000
I want to find He Jiuling.

350
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,219
[Rong Mansion] 
 You can't go out.

351
00:27:55,219 --> 00:27:56,800
Young Master.

352
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,500
Young Master!

353
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,240
Young Master.

354
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:56,432
[Nanjiang]

355
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:04,460
[Nanjiang]

356
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,380
Second Sister-in-law's falling technique has improved again.

357
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,960
This time, even I can't see the flaw.

358
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,040
You're asking for a beating.

359
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,688
Stop messing around.

360
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,959
Jiuling's swordsmanship is getting better and better.

361
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:15,959
After dinner, I want to spar with you.

362
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:17,000
Give me a break. You're the weakest in the family.

363
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,440
Give me a break. You're the weakest in the family.

364
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,940
If you were my sparring partner, I would feel that it's a waste of my time.

365
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,380
He Jiuling, don't be so proud.

366
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,300
One day, I'll be able to beat you down.

367
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,540
Jiuling, lie down.

368
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,840
Look. I knocked down the most exceptional person in our family.

369
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,120
Look. I knocked down the most exceptional person in our family.

370
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,200
He Qiuting, you're really asking for death.

371
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,260
It's time to go home for dinner.

372
00:30:37,144 --> 00:30:38,059
- Let's go. 
 - I really hate these twins.

373
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:40,960
- Let's go. 
 - I really hate these twins.

374
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:44,680
Do you want to argue or eat?

375
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,859
Eat you. Is that okay?

376
00:30:46,859 --> 00:30:49,880
What did you say? I didn't hear it.

377
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,179
Run. Run. Run. Second Sister-in-law is going to hit us.

378
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:55,000
Run. Run. Run. Second Sister-in-law is going to hit us.

379
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,896
Let's eat.

380
00:30:57,459 --> 00:30:59,520
I love you. Be good.

381
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,300
I love you. Be good.

382
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,579
Second Sister-in-law has a great capacity for alcohol.

383
00:31:01,579 --> 00:31:03,188
Drink more.

384
00:31:03,188 --> 00:31:05,739
Why do you say these things to him every day?

385
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:08,240
You have to. He can understand.

386
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,499
You just have to say it every day.

387
00:31:10,499 --> 00:31:11,380
Mom loves you.

388
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,140
In this way, he will be pretty and happy to be your child.

389
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:16,180
In this way, he will be pretty and happy to be your child.

390
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,599
Big Brother, you have to say this too.

391
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:20,660
Say it. Say it now. I want to hear.

392
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,780
What should I say?

393
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:25,099
Say, "Father loves you."

394
00:31:25,099 --> 00:31:26,679
No, I can't.

395
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:29,080
Hurry up, Big Brother. Say it.

396
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,260
Say it.

397
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,480
Say it.

398
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,500
Say it.

399
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,400
Say it.

400
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,540
Say… Okay. I will say it.

401
00:31:41,659 --> 00:31:43,699
I…

402
00:31:45,939 --> 00:31:48,004
I…

403
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,079
I…

404
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,680
- Eat. Eat. 
 - Just eat.

405
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,059
Don't embarrass him anymore.

406
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:04,320
Eat up, please.

407
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,460
Now, our older sister-in-law is the most important.

408
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,639
Here, have a chicken leg.

409
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:08,720
Here, have a chicken leg.

410
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,279
No, no.

411
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:12,480
They cook specially for me every day.

412
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,479
I can't eat so much.

413
00:32:16,479 --> 00:32:19,140
Just eat this. All right?

414
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,040
Here's for you, Ling'er.

415
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,000
Thank you.

416
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,728
This is for you, Father.

417
00:32:33,728 --> 00:32:34,652
Okay.

418
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:35,999
You just recovered from the cold.

419
00:32:35,999 --> 00:32:38,240
You still need to take care of your body.

420
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,928
All right.

421
00:32:45,219 --> 00:32:47,540
Ling'er, another one for you.

422
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:02,036
I've had enough.

423
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:06,939
Thank you, Jiuling. I love you.

424
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,300
Now, it's rare that the family is all here today.

425
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,839
Let's drink a toast together.

426
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,816
Cheers.

427
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,040
In Nanjiang's martial arts competition this year, the first prize is a co-leadership position.

428
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,100
In Nanjiang's martial arts competition this year, the first prize is a co-leadership position.

429
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,720
There are also rewards for other ranks, just some medicinal materials like nine-section worm beetle.

430
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,259
There are also rewards for other ranks, just some medicinal materials like nine-section worm beetle.

431
00:33:41,259 --> 00:33:42,724
It's nothing special.

432
00:33:42,724 --> 00:33:44,380
Qiuting, don't just eat.

433
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,999
Qiuting, don't just eat.

434
00:33:45,999 --> 00:33:48,640
Do you want to register?

435
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,020
Though I'm good at martial arts, there are always others who are better.

436
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,959
Though I'm good at martial arts, there are always others who are better.

437
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:54,400
I guess I won't register.

438
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,559
You can still get better if you think so.

439
00:33:57,559 --> 00:33:59,859
Chenzhou, register for him.

440
00:33:59,859 --> 00:34:02,059
- Father, I… 
 - Horseback archery, sticks, spears, knives,

441
00:34:02,059 --> 00:34:04,480
swords, formation, hooks, halberds or darts? Which one do you choose?

442
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,972
Which one?

443
00:34:05,972 --> 00:34:07,159
For me, there's no difference. I…

444
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:08,260
For me, there's no difference. I…

445
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,780
Okay. Since there's no difference, I'll just register him for everything.

446
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,280
Okay. Since there's no difference, I'll just register him for everything.

447
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,220
What? What?

448
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:16,280
You two are tricking me on purpose. Right?

449
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,740
Last year, Jiuling took first prize.

450
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,540
Is she not allowed to participate this year?

451
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:22,050
Why are you messing with me?
