[The Inextricable Destiny]

2
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:34,574
[Episode 16]

3
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,799
It's a pity that the marriage alliance

4
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,952
with Jialin fell through four years ago.

5
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,400
What do you mean, Your Majesty?

6
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,200
I'm planning to

7
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,400
give it a try again.

8
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,439
For Your Majesty and Miss He?

9
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,120
It's not appropriate, is it?

10
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,240
When did I say it was for myself?

11
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,479
When did I mention Jiuling?

12
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,100
My brother is a bloodthirsty and violent man

13
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,439
who tortured and killed several concubines

14
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,479
when he was the crown prince.

15
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,580
Now he has been dethroned

16
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,680
and imprisoned in his mansion.

17
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,719
It has preyed on his mind.

18
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:27,080
If I were to find him a suitable marriage

19
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,520
to improve his status

20
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,780
and bring him peace,

21
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,140
wouldn't it be a good idea?

22
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,184
What do you think?

23
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,840
That would be great.

24
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,659
Are you talking about Princess Xilan of Jialin,

25
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:39,439
Your Majesty?

26
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,312
No.

27
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,960
- Another one.
- Another one?

28
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,552
I'll let Jiuling pursue her revenge.

29
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,479
Upon its completion,

30
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,520
I will bring her

31
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,560
back to my side.

32
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,560
Madam.

33
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,340
Why are you standing outside?

34
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,440
I just applied medicine to Mr. Rong,

35
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,759
and he drove me out.

36
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,160
I don't know what he's doing alone in there.

37
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,240
You'd better check on him.

38
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,400
Rong Yu,

39
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,560
I'm back.

40
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,159
I also brought the snacks you wanted.

41
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,199
Rong Yu, open the door.

42
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,439
You asked for them, didn't you?

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,360
Don't you want to have a taste?

44
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,599
Rong Yu, come out.

45
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,128
Rong Yu.

46
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,960
Rong Yu.

47
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,520
I'm really worried about you.

48
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,599
- Take this.
- What are you doing?

49
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,280
Y-You…

50
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,800
- It's taking too long.
- What do you mean?

51
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:17,439
Do you mean that it's taking too long
for me to back?

52
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,140
Then, why didn't you open your door?

53
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,879
Are you trying to make me worried?

54
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,399
How dare you?

55
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,040
Now you dare to mess with me.

56
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,299
I was going to,

57
00:04:35,299 --> 00:04:37,000
but now I don't want to anymore.

58
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,439
I am going to make some soup.

59
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,220
Oh my goodness!

60
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,759
You frightened Zhanping off

61
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,959
Let me have a look at your hand.

62
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,279
It's still pretty swollen.

63
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,560
Come on. Let's apply some more medicine.

64
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,808
My dear,

65
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,360
that guy is bad news.

66
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,408
Who?

67
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:12,019
That man.

68
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:13,839
I don't want you to see him.

69
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,420
What's wrong with him?

70
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,320
You knocked over the tea yourself,

71
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,400
and you disrespectfully tossed away the cloth

72
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,439
that he handed you.

73
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:24,299
It looks like you're the one
who needs to watch your attitude.

74
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:26,079
I will watch my attitude.

75
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,920
I will be a very nice person.

76
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,359
I will work hard to learn how to read

77
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:30,500
and astrology.

78
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,759
I will also make a lot of money.

79
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,079
Please don't…

80
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,079
- Please don't…
- What?

81
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,839
Don't leave me for someone else.

82
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,959
When did I say I would leave you
for someone else?

83
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,560
Besides, you don't have to try that hard.

84
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,759
Remember what I said when we were in Rong City?

85
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,060
Rong Yu, listen up. No matter what happens,

86
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,879
no matter what you become,

87
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,519
you will always be the best to me.

88
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:07,419
Not all the time.

89
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:09,480
Remember when I said I was taking leave before?

90
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,519
I wasn't exactly telling the truth.

91
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,319
I was trying to get on your nerves just now.

92
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:19,279
I want you to feel free to laugh
when you're happy

93
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,480
and cry when you're feeling down.

94
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,440
If you are in a bad mood,

95
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,879
you can vent on me.

96
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,519
If you ever feel like fibbing to me,
that's fine too.

97
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,120
You don't have to be The Best Young Master
of Jialin

98
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,240
nor the young master of Astrology Pavilion.

99
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,480
You are just Rong Yu.

100
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,439
So just be yourself.

101
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,880
If you're into learning to read or astrology,

102
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,060
go for it.

103
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,920
But if not, no big deal.

104
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,800
I just want you to be happy.

105
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,439
If you want to get better,

106
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:56,199
I'll do whatever it takes to cure you.

107
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,639
As long as you are happy.

108
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,839
As for making money,

109
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:05,239
if the Rongs go broke,

110
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:07,380
I'll hit the road

111
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,959
and become a female knight to support you.

112
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,600
Madam,

113
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,480
how are you, Master Rong,

114
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,560
and Zhanping

115
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,376
doing?

116
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,439
Hey, everyone's doing great.

117
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:58,120
Master Rong is learning

118
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,600
more words

119
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,600
every day,

120
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,560
and he's been laughing a lot lately.

121
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,380
He even asked Zhanping

122
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,480
if you're coming back after the New Year.

123
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:13,000
I have a new maid.

124
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,000
She's really skilled in martial arts,

125
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,940
so there is no need to worry about

126
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,199
Master Rong and Zhanping to be bullied.

127
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,520
Zhanping has to scold you

128
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,199
a few times a day.

129
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,460
I wonder what Heshan's been up to

130
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,959
since he's been gone for so long.

131
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,680
He didn't even come back for the New Year,

132
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,600
even though the young master was so nice
to him before.

133
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,460
Don't come back. Don't come back.
Don't come back. Don't come back.

134
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,620
He was so mad that you left
without taking care of Master Rong.

135
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,120
In a few months,

136
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,039
when Lord Rong is no longer angry

137
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,739
or when Master Rong gets better,

138
00:08:45,739 --> 00:08:47,599
I'll have him talk to Lord Rong

139
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:48,840
to give you permission to come back home.

140
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,480
You told me that you were insignificant,

141
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,720
and no one would remember you after a while.

142
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,320
However, even if time passes,

143
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,399
those who truly care about you

144
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,140
will always remember

145
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,500
and miss you more and more.

146
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,559
Happy New Year!

147
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,336
Wish you all the best.

148
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:09,080
What are your New Year's wishes?

149
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,620
Don't worry if it's a difficult one.

150
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,699
I will find a way

151
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:16,759
to help you achieve it

152
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,424
I have no wishes

153
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,140
How can it be?

154
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,639
You must have some wishes.
Even Zhanping has wishes.

155
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,760
Madame gave me two gold bars.

156
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,080
Even the one for Heshan was given to me.

157
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,399
This will piss him off.

158
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,279
Newbie, what's your wish?

159
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,879
She's been here for a while

160
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,399
and hasn't said anything.

161
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,840
Is she mute?

162
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:52,896
It's okay if you don't speak.

163
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,060
It's better for you not to speak.

164
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,399
Her name is Chengbi.

165
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:59,080
C-Chengbi.

166
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:01,399
This name is really hard to remember.

167
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,120
What…

168
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,960
What's your wishes?

169
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,000
It's all happening.

170
00:11:06,293 --> 00:11:08,016
[Gongsun's Mansion]

171
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,399
Why are you canceling the hunting plans?

172
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,240
Your Majesty,

173
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,560
there was a murder case in the capital recently

174
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,919
and it's still unresolved.

175
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,680
It makes everyone feeling anxious.

176
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,679
For the sake of Your Majesty's safety,

177
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,300
I think it's better to stay in the palace.

178
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,639
So do you mean

179
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:38,519
as soon as I step out of the palace,
I'll be killed.

180
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,840
Your Majesty,

181
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,120
I…

182
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,360
I'm just worried.

183
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,440
Worried?

184
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,080
Are you guys that useless?

185
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,440
We held spring exams to select military attaché

186
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,580
and Jinwu guards.

187
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,080
Did you guys select a bunch of losers?

188
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,320
They can't even catch a suspect.

189
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,500
Maybe, we should hold another martial exam.

190
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,799
Hold the hunt at the same time.

191
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,120
- I want to personally select people.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

192
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,559
So we don't need to cancel the hunt after all.

193
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,320
Send more people at that time

194
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,600
to follow Your Majesty.

195
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,000
Your Majesty.

196
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,919
That's a good idea, uncle.

197
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:20,960
Then let's do it this way.

198
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,120
I understand.

199
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,639
Everything is settled with the hunting plans.

200
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,448
Don't bother me again with this.

201
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,320
Uncle, what brought you here?

202
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,399
I'll leave now, Your Majesty.

203
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,679
Your Majesty.

204
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,880
A few days ago,
Mr. Qian from the Salt Transport Department,

205
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,160
was assassinated.

206
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,440
Does Your Majesty know about this?

207
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,440
The Ministry of Revenue and Population
has reported it.

208
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,159
I have already arranged for someone
to console his family.

209
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,519
By the way,

210
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:15,959
The Ministry of Justice
and the Ministry of Revenue and Population

211
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:17,320
have been working together
to catch the perpetrator but failed.

212
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:19,360
They did find out that old guy

213
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,679
embezzling a large amount of salt tax.

214
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,520
I don't really care about that,

215
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,040
so I sent them to you.

216
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,440
You won't blame me, will you?

217
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,679
How is that possible?

218
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,100
It's the minister's job

219
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,919
to relieve the emperor's worries.

220
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:35,960
If possible, could you also try to

221
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,759
recover the embezzled salt tax?

222
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:39,620
Then,

223
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,159
there's nothing left for me to do.

224
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,296
Not really.

225
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:45,400
It's about time to switch managers

226
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,159
for several salt fields

227
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,240
The latest report from Sichuan says

228
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,640
they found a huge area of salt fields.

229
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,840
The salt tax is crucial for economy.

230
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,760
So the position of Salt Transport Commissioner
is super important.

231
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,520
I came to Your Majesty today

232
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,959
just to ask

233
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,380
if you have a candidate in mind

234
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,960
for the position of the Salt Transport Envoy.

235
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:08,032
Well,

236
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,000
can you just make the decision for me?

237
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,220
This matter is of utmost importance,

238
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,960
so I want to hear Your Majesty's opinion.

239
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,840
The Salt Transport Department
is the main tax department.

240
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,759
The last Salt Transport Envoy
embezzled so much money.

241
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,000
It seems that I really need to

242
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,639
consider carefully about the candidate.

243
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,440
I thought General Yan's second son,

244
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,440
Yan Jin might be a good choice.

245
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,879
Even though he's new to
the Ministry of Revenue and Population,

246
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,599
his father and eldest brother both

247
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:41,080
have considerable prestige in the military.

248
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,220
He must be quite capable

249
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,300
and unafraid of offending others.

250
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,480
He should be entrusted with important duties.

251
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,919
I understand Your Majesty's intention,

252
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:52,320
and I will think about it carefully.

253
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:55,440
Here comes the hot water.

254
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,799
This medicine needs to be taken once a day
for five days straight.

255
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,780
After that, you'll become that super smart

256
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,720
Astrology Master that everyone knows

257
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,859
Why does this pill make a hissing sound?

258
00:15:12,859 --> 00:15:13,959
That's kinda weird.

259
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:16,200
Madam, there won't be any problem
with this medicine, right?

260
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:17,980
This medicine should be fine.

261
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,120
I've tried it myself,

262
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:23,120
but I'm still concerned about his weak health,

263
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,879
so I divided the doses.

264
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:28,260
Don't go to the Astrology Pavilion

265
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,360
and just stay at home for the next few days.

266
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,000
So I can take care of him all the time.

267
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,360
It's the last day.

268
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,640
We will find out

269
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,820
if Master Rong recovered

270
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,440
when he wakes up this time, right?

271
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,799
He'll definitely recover!

272
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,056
Miss He.

273
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:14,816
Miss He.

274
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,976
Take good care of him.

275
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,728
Miss Tan is here.

276
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,480
You go and make some soup now.

277
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,680
When Master Rong wakes up,

278
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,080
he'll definitely be hungry.

279
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,504
Okay.

280
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,240
There is a strict investigation going on.

281
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,539
Don't make any move for now.

282
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,640
Wait for my news.

283
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,448
Are you okay?

284
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,936
I'm fine.

285
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,368
Everything is fine.

286
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,420
You always say that.

287
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,960
If only I knew martial arts,

288
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,799
I could protect you through thick and thin.

289
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:43,680
What you've done for me
is already more than enough.

290
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:46,039
I don't want to drag you into this mess.

291
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,500
Once all of this is done,

292
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,536
we can do whatever you want.

293
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,680
I'll support you no matter what,
even if it means risking my life.

294
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,319
Don't say something like that.

295
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,100
We must all be safe and well.

296
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,319
I mean everyone.

297
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,800
You told me last time

298
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,359
that you found a way to cure Master Rong.

299
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,880
How is he doing now?

300
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,439
Really? If he gets better,

301
00:19:58,439 --> 00:20:00,500
you guys can reach to an agreement

302
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,920
and be together, right?

303
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,880
What do you mean?

304
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,960
There's no such thing as reaching an agreement.

305
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,680
Now,

306
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,319
I just wish him well.

307
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,799
If it was the past, I'd believe it.

308
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,680
Now you and Master Rong

309
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,319
look truly in love.

310
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:15,620
Don't make fun of me

311
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,160
with this matter.

312
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:20,680
He's still just a kid,

313
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,240
and doesn't really understand things yet.

314
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,520
He's close to me and relies on me

315
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,359
because he just sees me as family.

316
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:30,900
He used to help and protect me,

317
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,600
and even saved me

318
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,240
during a misfortune in the He family.

319
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,720
In terms of emotion and reason,

320
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,720
he should be the most important person to me.

321
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:40,400
I should always cherish and protect him.

322
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,400
But in this lifetime,

323
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,640
I owe him too much.

324
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,920
I can never fully repay him.

325
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,360
I've thought about it.

326
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,880
When he recovers,

327
00:20:58,519 --> 00:20:59,819
even without me,

328
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:00,880
he will still be

329
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,160
the young master of the Astrology Pavilion

330
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,720
that no one dares to bully.

331
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:06,920
We will go our separate paths.

332
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,079
We weren't meant to be together, after all.

333
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:13,880
No need to continue to fool ourselves.

334
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,000
As such a gentleman,

335
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:21,160
if one day he

336
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,400
found out

337
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,160
that during his most difficult times,

338
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,519
I abandoned him

339
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:29,500
and then married him
under the identity of a criminal's daughter

340
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,000
to save myself,

341
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,680
he would definitely feel utterly disgusted.

342
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,440
Even if he wouldn't say anything,

343
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,519
how could I hold onto the title of Mrs. Rong

344
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:40,960
and drag him down?

345
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:43,480
But you are not that kind of person.

346
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,079
Who cares whether you are or not?

347
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,079
None of these matters.

348
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,072
The important thing is,

349
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,920
you have to ask yourself

350
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:55,319
have you never liked Master Rong.

351
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,200
I haven't.

352
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:12,896
I'll go back to my room now.

353
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,279
Master Rong,

354
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,288
long time no see.

355
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,080
My dear, I've been here for a long time.

356
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,199
I saw the moon a minute ago,

357
00:23:10,199 --> 00:23:11,480
but I don't know why

358
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,119
it's disappeared.

359
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,064
Master…

360
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,592
Master Rong.

361
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,088
What?

362
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,519
Why do you call me like that?

363
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,480
Five years…

364
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:30,359
It's been five years.

365
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,579
I was sure it would work this time.

366
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,640
Why it's still not working?

367
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,799
If it doesn't work this time,

368
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,440
I really don't know what to do.

369
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,240
It's all because I'm useless.

370
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,976
I'm sorry.

371
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,160
I'm sorry.

372
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,559
I'm sorry.

373
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:09,599
I'm sorry.

374
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,440
I'm sorry.

375
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,640
Hey, please don't cry, okay?

376
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,799
I'm still the same Rong Yu.

377
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:24,500
Or maybe

378
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,260
you also don't like

379
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,880
this Rong Yu who doesn't know anything,

380
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,120
doesn't understand anything,

381
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,120
can't do anything

382
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,680
for you.

383
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,120
Don't say that about yourself.

384
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,960
You're always the best.

385
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:39,760
No matter what happens,

386
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,799
no matter what you become,

387
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,200
you're always the best Rong Yu.

388
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:54,080
Really?

389
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,184
Then why…

390
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:00,960
Why are you crying?

391
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:07,424
I won't cry anymore.

392
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:10,559
The moon is gone,

393
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,599
but the stars are still there.

394
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:15,359
Come on. Let's go stargazing.

395
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:19,360
Look.

396
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:29,720
No wonder you like stargazing so much.

397
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:33,980
Even if I can't tell the fate,

398
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,200
it's still beautiful to look at.

399
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,400
How did I not notice this before?

400
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:46,279
Look! Look! A shooting star!

401
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,440
I already made a knot for you. Make a wish.

402
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,780
When you see a shooting star,

403
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,420
tie a knot in your clothes

404
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,640
and then make a wish.

405
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,240
Then, God will hear your wish.

406
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:01,560
Then, God will help you fulfill it

407
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,860
I did it for you already.

408
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,872
Just make a wish.

409
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:12,039
I hope I can see my wife

410
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,880
every day

411
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:18,799
and never part from her.

412
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,760
Is this your wish?

413
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,240
Are you still thinking

414
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,440
that I will leave you?

415
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,360
I hope my husband

416
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,880
will live a safe and healthy life,

417
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,279
becoming

418
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:48,039
a wizard who lives to be a hundred years old.

419
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:01,720
Also,

420
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,160
I-I hope

421
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,840
my husband will be able to bully others,

422
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,200
but nobody can bully him.

423
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,039
I also hope…

424
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,839
Rong Yu, look! A meteor shower!

425
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,640
Though the moon is gone, there are stars.

426
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,960
If you can't recover,

427
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,696
I'll be with you.

428
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:01,632
Rong Yu,

429
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,119
I will never leave you.

430
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:08,680
Don't be afraid.

431
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,440
A dethroned Emperor and a female general.

432
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:18,279
It's tough out there,

433
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,040
and I'm not even sure where we're headed.

434
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,200
Over there.

435
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,960
Actually,

436
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:34,240
I can't promise you anything.

437
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,272
I promised you

438
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:41,079
to come back as soon as you finished your food,

439
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:43,744
but I didn't.

440
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:45,600
I promised you

441
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:48,000
I wouldn't leave you alone

442
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,119
in the capital,

443
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:51,079
and I would always protect you,

444
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,344
but I didn't.

445
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,440
The future is uncertain.

446
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,416
I can't even…

447
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,319
I can't even promise you

448
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,519
that I won't leave you again.

449
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:23,640
If I'm not here anymore,

450
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,200
and Lord Rong isn't either,

451
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,160
who else in the world

452
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,559
can accompany and protect you?

453
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,039
I can't let you be alone.

454
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,240
I know how hard it is
to go through tough times alone,

455
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:40,119
so I don't want you to experience that again.

456
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:46,880
Rong Yu,

457
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,759
do you want to…

458
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:56,079
want to…

459
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,799
have a…

460
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:35,480
Cover yourself up well. It's cold.

461
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,260
Zhanping, come here.

462
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,319
I have something to say to you.

463
00:32:55,904 --> 00:32:57,880
[Gongsun's Mansion]

464
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,980
The daughter of the Regent
has just been bestowed upon the princess.

465
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,380
Xunnan sent a message

466
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,160
with the intention of marrying the princess.

467
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,100
The Regent, of course, is thrilled.

468
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,480
They have all been preparing for this,

469
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:09,420
and were too busy to care about anything else.

470
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,359
Now, the Regent's people are falling apart.

471
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:14,039
He can only use the military talisman to bluff.

472
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,119
Wang Dequan,

473
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:19,160
how many days are left before the hunting?

474
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,856
Three days.

475
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,400
Grind ink. I need to write a letter.

476
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,320
It's from Heshan.

477
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,079
He is not coming back for the time being.

478
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,160
[To Zhanping]

479
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,680
How could Heshan do that?

480
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,519
He's been home for so long,
and he hasn't come back.

481
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,240
Doesn't he miss Master Rong at all?

482
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:44,640
It's not his fault.

483
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,279
I should go and talk to my uncle.

484
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,300
Okay. By the way, Master Rong,

485
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,519
last time you asked me to--

486
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,960
I'll go to the kitchen to make soup first.

487
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,639
Do you have something to say?

488
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,520
Take a look at this.

489
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,688
What is this?

490
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,519
I can't make you come to your senses.

491
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,039
Think about it this way.

492
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:05,139
If you can have someone

493
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:08,480
as smart and cute as me by your side,

494
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,559
then, even if there comes a day
when I'm not around.

495
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:13,152
He Jiuling.

496
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,840
If you're not around, I'll just be alone.

497
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:21,879
Can you stop being childish?

498
00:35:21,879 --> 00:35:23,139
This is the best promise

499
00:35:23,139 --> 00:35:24,159
I can give you.

500
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,440
- I'm going for a walk.
- Where are you going?

501
00:35:34,102 --> 00:35:38,793
♫ Under the setting sun in dusk ♫

502
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:46,813
♫ I travel far for thousands of miles ♫

503
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:53,783
♫ Playing the zither under the moonlight ♫

504
00:35:54,997 --> 00:36:01,169
♫ The drinks won't let me forget ♫

505
00:36:02,134 --> 00:36:08,122
♫ The longing I write down for you ♫

506
00:36:09,238 --> 00:36:14,778
♫ Our fate is written on paper ♫

507
00:36:14,778 --> 00:36:19,077
♫ Just like the strongest wine ♫

508
00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:22,492
♫ There's no escape for destiny ♫

509
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:29,498
♫ Looking back, I see you waiting ♫

510
00:36:29,498 --> 00:36:36,666
♫ Our lives are filled with joy and sorrow ♫

511
00:36:36,666 --> 00:36:43,601
♫ The longings crystalize
into a bright galaxy ♫

512
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:51,418
♫ You turned around quietly
and closed the marriage book ♫

513
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:57,018
♫ Asking how many stars there are in the sky ♫

514
00:37:23,254 --> 00:37:28,826
♫ The longing I write down for you ♫

515

♫ The longings crystalize

521
00:38:04,827 --> 00:38:12,090
♫ Gently I stroke the zither,
waiting for a passerby like you ♫

522
00:38:12,694 --> 00:38:18,854
♫ Turns out you are my inextricable destiny ♫
