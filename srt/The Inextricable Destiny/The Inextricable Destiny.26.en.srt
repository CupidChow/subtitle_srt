[The Inextricable Destiny]

2
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:34,336
[Episode 26]

3
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,784
Your Highness, could you please…

4
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,064
Please, I beg you…

5
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,400
I'm begging you.

6
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,719
Please hurry and take this item
to the Rong Family in the capital.

7
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:54,540
To save a life. Save a life.

8
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,140
I know you are begging me.

9
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,159
But why are you also rushing me?

10
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,659
Princess, she mentioned the Rong Family.

11
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,048
So what? There are so many…

12
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,480
How do you know someone
from the Rong Family needs saving?

13
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,039
Your Highness, please.

14
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,800
Please, I'm begging you.

15
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,160
Please.

16
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,280
Perhaps after this time,

17
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,199
Your Highness may get a wishful husband
and spend a lifetime together.

18
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,840
How do you know I came
to ask for a wishful husband?

19
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,039
Time is running out.

20
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:40,719
Please. You have to hurry.

21
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,520
Hurry, hurry.

22
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,744
Let's return to the capital.

23
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,759
- Make it tidier.
- Okay.

24
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,179
Who is this?

25
00:03:25,179 --> 00:03:26,520
Is Rong Yu dead?

26
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,759
It's Lord Rong who passed away.

27
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,759
As for the Master…

28
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,000
How can you not recognize the Princess?

29
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,800
Princess? Your Highness.

30
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,592
Your Majesty.

31
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:47,159
Princess, this is not a place for you to play.

32
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,312
I came for this.

33
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,039
His Majesty, this is the medicine
from the letter.

34
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,319
Don't you need to confirm where it is from?

35
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,099
- It's from Madam.
- Quickly.

36
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:08,199
Madam is here to save the young master.

37
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,120
Previously,

38
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,359
we talked about the Star-picking Master
from the Astrology Pavilion

39
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,500
getting seriously injured
on the Nanjiang battlefield.

40
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,160
He was a dying man without any cure.

41
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,720
But who would have thought that a woman
who loved him to the point of no return

42
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,540
moved the heavens with her love

43
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,579
and surprisingly found the magical medicine?

44
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:38,360
She saved the Star-picking Master's life.

45
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:43,160
Continuing from before, today, I will reveal

46
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,800
the true identity of this woman.

47
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,839
Speaking of this woman…

48
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,279
Please. Look at the fruit.

49
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:51,280
Moreover, she has a superb appearance…

50
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,220
- She…
- Fresh fruit.

51
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,360
She is the only princess of our Jialin.

52
00:04:57,472 --> 00:04:58,500
Speaking of this Princess…

53
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,760
It's tasty and not expensive.

54
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,620
And her destiny with the Star-picking Master

55
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,160
all started with a performance
at the Empress Dowager's birthday banquet.

56
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,840
She didn't even tell you.

57
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,639
So why would she tell me where she was going?

58
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,104
Then she…

59
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,220
You were the one who didn't want her
and asked her to leave.

60
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,399
Now she's gone, you are looking for her again.

61
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,240
I do not understand what you want with her.

62
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,639
Thank you for helping her

63
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,800
and taking care of her during that time.

64
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,279
If there is anything you need
my help with in the future,

65
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,464
please don't hesitate to ask.

66
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,264
Master Rong.

67
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,079
She's had a difficult life.

68
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,900
Only when talking about you and seeing you,

69
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,800
did she feel a bit of sweetness.

70
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,639
I don't know why she left
without saying goodbye,

71
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,800
but you are the last person
she would give up on.

72
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,460
I ask you to not fall in love with anyone else.

73
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,680
You must, you must find her.

[In Memory of the Ninth Master
of the Astrology Pavilion, Rong Jiang]

75
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,839
Let's pay our respects to the He family.

76
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,144
Master.

77
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:31,904
Quickly.

78

[Astrology Pavilion]

79
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,096
Master, we've searched everywhere.

80
00:09:20,672 --> 00:09:21,728
There are no signs of her

81
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:24,519
or any clues to track.

82
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:27,200
As for the person that the Princess said

83
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,320
she met on her way to Qingcheng Temple,

84
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,559
we've asked all the surrounding infirmaries

85
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,720
and no such person has come for treatment.

86
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:36,080
But rest assured, Master,

87
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,200
we will send more men

88
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:39,100
to keep looking for the person
mentioned by the Princess.

89
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,224
No more.

90
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,440
Bring over the newly compiled

91
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,392
courses in the Pavilion
these past days for me to look over.

92
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,519
Yes.

93
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,584
Also, tell them

94
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,440
that I've recovered

95
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:56,919
and my astrology course

96
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,200
can continue.

97
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,040
Yes, Master.

98
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:12,759
Master, I'm confused.

99
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,360
When you said no more just now,

100
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:20,720
did you mean that we don't
need to keep looking for Miss He?

101
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,512
Don't look for her anymore.

102
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,600
In fact, when everything ended,

103
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,360
it was the end of my connection with her, too.

104
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,360
I was stupid.

Every year, as long as you accompany
your little rabbit lady,

108
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,679
she'll be happy.

109
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,519
I will accompany my little rabbit lady.

110
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:51,840
It's so beautiful.

111
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,279
Mom, look.

112
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,336
It's so lovely!

113
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:59,480
Miss Jiu, were you a lady in the past?

114
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,240
No, I'm just a vulgar woman.

115
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,460
No way. When you were young,

116
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,639
you must have been a beauty.

117
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,340
As the saying goes,

118
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,620
certain crops only grow on certain soil,

119
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,879
and some people can only
be raised in certain families.

120
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:19,840
I can tell from the way you hold the pen.

121
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,600
Perhaps it's because I've spent a lot of time
with someone who loves to use pens,

122
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,640
and I've become different, too.

123
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,799
So you're not vulgar.

124
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,280
I envy people like you who can read and write.

125
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,039
It will be different wherever you go.

126
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,959
One lantern sells for ten pennies.

127
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,240
We'll need to make a hundred
lanterns to make enough.

128
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:49,700
We have to pay proper tuition
to the Young Master of the Astrology Pavilion.

129
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,779
Miss Jiu, it would be great
if I could sell a hundred.

130
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:55,159
It will be enough for my kid's tuition.

131
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,620
There's a saying that a light gift
shows heavy affection.

132
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,944
Although,

133
00:13:02,944 --> 00:13:05,980
our tuition isn't more expensive than others',

134
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,440
we can write a few auspicious
words for the Master

135
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,900
and show him

136
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,960
that in your heart, you respect and like him.

137
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:17,440
Gui, what should we write?

138
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,600
Gui, Gui, think quickly.

00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,500
I…

140
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,632
I'll teach you.

141
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,952
Thank you, Master.

142
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,192

00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,240
My name is Sun Gui, and I am
from Liuyuan Village, Jiang Town.

144
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,000
I know you're accepting disciples
and lecturing on Astrology today,

145
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,840
so I came specifically to back you up.

146
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,559
Your Highness.

147
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:53,664
She's the Princess.

148
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,984
Why is it you?

149
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,159
I can pick them up, Master.

150
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,820
The apprenticeship hasn't even
been successful yet.

151
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,080
Why are you calling him Master?

152
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,120
My father has prepared
many things for the New Year,

153
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,619
some of which would be great for you.

154
00:14:23,619 --> 00:14:25,120
I've brought them all.
Come with me and take a look.

155
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,760
Your Highness, they are gifts from your father,

156
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,420
and you should keep them well.

157
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,160
What's the use of keeping them myself?

158
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,520
I can't wear a man's robe as a skirt, can I?

159
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,559
Should I look at the few
orphaned copies that were collected?

160
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,200
It's so dirty. Don't pick it up.

161
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:52,679
Your Highness, this is the good intention
of my student.

162
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,680
I'm sorry.

163
00:15:00,512 --> 00:15:02,860
- Not at all.
- Is he apologizing for me?

164
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,936
It's okay.

165
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,519
Do you already consider me as family?

166
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,519
A humble gift is not
enough for expressing intention.

167
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,560
I with that every year,

168
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,519
the Master would be safe and content

169
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,279
with love and family.

170
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,696
I wish you'd be

171
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
safe,

172
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:53,728
and sound,

173
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,328
with family.

174
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,200
Rong Yu, this is Jialin's era
of prosperity and peace.

175
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:48,040
The court is now stable,
and Your Majesty is in charge.

176
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,159
Jialin will be

177
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:51,799
invincible,

178
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:53,632
dominant,

179
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,032
and prosperous.

180
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,792
A bright future.

181
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,376
Good.

182
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:12,640
This dragon pendant

183
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,640
has always been with me.

184
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,640
Now, it should be returned to its owner.

185
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,952
I still remember

186
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:24,580
how I gave it to her.

187
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,240
I learned from what happened
today that the earlier

188
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,280
to get engaged, the better.

189
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,000
With this, no one dares to stop you anywhere.

190
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,640
Take this as a token for my future wife.

191
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,440
When I was 11,

192
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:37,520
I joked about marrying

193
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,960
your daughter as my wife,

194
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:43,039
but I didn't expect that joke
to actually save her life.

195
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:45,480
It also saved my life.

196
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,288
Rong Yu,

197
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,160
why did she have to leave?

198
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,880
How could you lose her?

199
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,960
You had the best woman in the world.

200
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:03,440
How could you lose her?

201
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,279
She fought and protected this realm with me,

202
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,000
but she couldn't be here and watch
this peaceful and prosperous world.

203
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:11,920
I promised to protect her,

204
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,300
to make her the best
female general in the world,

205
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,160
and to let her be the best overlord.

206
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:22,119
But I don't even know where she is now.

207
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,920
I don't know if she is doing well.

208
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,000
Is she watching the fireworks

209
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,880
in the sky like us?

210
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:56,864
Your Majesty.

211
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,376
I know.

212
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:10,000
She left, because she didn't
want you to remember her.

213
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,519
She wanted you to be the old Rong Yu,

214
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,784
to not be burdened by the past,

215
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,992
and to start over.

216
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,359
If you can be with Chu,

217
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,160
it would be a good thing.

218
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,720
Go.

219
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,039
The Empress Dowager has personally
asked you to take her to see the lanterns.

220
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,039
I won't keep you.

221
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:36,000
Everyone has their own fate.

222
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,759
When fate comes, people meet.

223
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,200
When fate leaves, people separate.

224
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:43,872
Same with things.

225
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:46,480
This dragon pendant stayed with you

226
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,400
because of fate.

227
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:50,752
Just keep it.

228
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:20,599
[Zhenjiang]

229
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:21,696
Look at this.

230
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:25,400
Take a look.

231
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,660
Selling lanterns, candles,

232
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,744
and little decorations.

233
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,960
Slow down.

234
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,439
Make way, make way.

235
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:43,000
Very beautiful fabric.

236
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,240
Take a look.

237
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,680
Thank you.

238
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,720
That one over there.

239
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:50,816
Look at this.

240
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,480
The little rabbit is so cute.

241
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,992
Dear guest, please come in.

242
00:20:57,632 --> 00:20:58,784
I want this too.

243
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:02,500
This, this, and this. I want all of these.

244
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,500
The cloth is of very good quality.

245
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,120
- Sugar figure.
- Lanterns.

246
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,720
Sir.

247
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:08,960
Come here and take a look.

248
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:21,472
Happy and cheerful.

249
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,584
Rong Yu.

250
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:03,200
Rong Yu, do you like it?

251
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:19,480
Your Highness. This one.

252
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,279
Young Master, who are you waiting for?

253
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,580
Can you see clearly
with the veil on so late at night?

254
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,400
Here, put this on. I'll give it to you.

255
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:47,680
No need.

256
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,160
Why would you reject me again?

257
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,500
You refused the valuable

258
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,120
gifts I gave you before, fine.

259
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,880
But this doesn't cost much,
so why don't you accept it?

260
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:07,400
I did some things very wrong before,

261
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,179
but at that time, I had just
learned about your illness

262
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:14,180
and it was hard not to be shocked or afraid.

263
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:18,720
Any normal girl would be, right?

264
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,440
Besides, I am a very impulsive person.

265
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,340
I did say harsh words to you

266
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:30,240
and tried to hurt you. I'm sorry.

267
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,328
Can you…

268
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,559
can you forgive me?

269
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,056
I understand.

270
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,160
I didn't hold a grudge.

271
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,384
Really?

272
00:23:40,384 --> 00:23:41,440
Of course.

273
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,759
Your Highness, I owe my life to you.

274
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,960
So no matter what,

275
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,800
I will not hold these old things to heart.

276
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,240
That's good to know.

277
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,059
I will restrain my temper in the future

278
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:01,559
and be very, very nice to you.

279
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,160
Just think that I fell in love with you again.

280
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,648
Your Highness.

281
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:11,000
What you like is the master
of the Astrology Pavilion,

282
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,640
the Star-picking Master of Jialin,

283
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,599
an exceptional strategist
guiding great affairs,

284
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:20,039
and a favored minister in the Emperor's eyes,

285
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:22,176
but not Rong Yu.

286
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:24,039
Why would you say that?

287
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:27,240
I don't think there is any difference.

288
00:24:28,512 --> 00:24:29,568
Yes.

289
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:31,584
I am all of the above.

290
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:33,824
But that Rong Yu who couldn't read,

291
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,880
doesn't understand complicated words,

292
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,359
and can't do many things

293
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:40,864
is also me.

294
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:45,519
You said that any normal girl would be afraid.

295
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:49,408
That's not true.

296
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:52,920
There are countless women in the world.

297
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,119
Those who like me

298
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,200
are the same as Your Highness,

299
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,008
confused by superficial things.

300
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,279
But there was this one girl

301
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,759
who fell in love with me

302
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,960
when I was silly and useless.

303
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,219
She told me that no matter what,

304
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,640
I am the best Rong Yu.

305
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,760
Are you talking about He Jiuling?

306
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,480
I can do whatever she can do for you.

307
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:22,559
I said, I was arrogant and ignorant before.

308
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,280
I didn't want my future
husband to be like that.

309
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,939
But now I understand.

310
00:25:27,939 --> 00:25:29,200
If I had another chance…

311
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,440
I will definitely take care of you as she did.

312
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,279
Traveling alone

313
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,456
against thousands of troops,

314
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,240
will you still go with me

315
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:44,119
knowing it means death?

316
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:53,856
Thank you for your affection.

317
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,839
Your Highness, you should
seek another good man.

318
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:59,136
Fine.

319
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:02,160
She's the best of the best.

320
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:04,440
She's unparalleled.

321
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:08,039
But she left.

322
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,599
She abandoned you.

323
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:15,939
And you stopped looking for her, didn't you?

324
00:26:15,939 --> 00:26:17,920
You gave up on her too, didn't you?

325
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,492
Are you drinking?

326
00:26:31,492 --> 00:26:33,252
Without wine, it's not a farewell party.

327
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,079
As long as you want it,

328
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:43,840
I will grant your wish.

329
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,960
♫ Unable to wait for the dark night
with a flickering candlelight ♫

330
00:26:50,852 --> 00:26:57,728
♫ Drinking a cup of vicissitude,
I'm no longer impetuous in my youth ♫

331
00:26:57,728 --> 00:27:04,096
♫ Hearing you are somewhere across the water,
I'll swim against the current ♫

332
00:27:04,096 --> 00:27:08,128
♫ Drink the ups and downs on the journey ♫

333
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:11,328
♫ Sigh at the wastefulness of life ♫

334
00:27:11,328 --> 00:27:14,464
♫ Drink the entangled thoughts ♫

335
00:27:14,464 --> 00:27:18,336
♫ Let's get drunk,
for meeting you is difficult ♫

336
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:22,624
♫ Let's drink to our sorrow ♫

337
00:27:22,624 --> 00:27:26,400
♫ With grey hair, I laugh
at my distressing dreams ♫

338
00:27:27,264 --> 00:27:30,848
♫ I can't get over you after all the days ♫

339
00:27:33,376 --> 00:27:38,519
♫ We spent together ♫

340
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:39,599
Here are your noodles.

341
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,380
Nice craftsmanship, boss.

342
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:47,119
These noodles look delicious.

343
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:50,319
We are a small family business,
and it's a secret recipe.

344
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:54,920
The food is here.

345
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,480
Old lady.

346
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,839
You're out here eating
longevity noodles so late alone.

347
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:08,119
I'll give you some extra meat for free.

348
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:12,640
It's you again. Get out!

349
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,320
It's over there.

350
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:17,888
Don't let it run away.

351
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,319
There, there. Go, go, go.

352
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,464
Quickly, quickly.

353
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,600
It's right there. Kill it. I…

354
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,632
My fellow villagers.

355
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:29,140
Today is a merry day.

356
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,360
Let's not ruin it with killing.

357
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,439
What do you mean? What about my lost fish?

358
00:28:33,439 --> 00:28:35,920
If we don't put it in check,
it'll become lawless.

359
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,480
Yes. This cat is infuriating.

360
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:40,380
What about your fish?

361
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,400
Look, it nibbles one each day. One each day!

362
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,120
- Exactly. Look.
- I'm making sun-dried salted fish.

All eaten up by this stinky cat.

364
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,560
This is what I snatched from its mouth.

365
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,920
All eaten by this stinky cat, look.

366
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,240
Look at the marks it left.

367
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,060
It also keeps stealing my meat.

368
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,079
- How hateful!
- Exactly.

369
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:57,824
Take it.

370
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:04,279
It's my compensation for stopping you
from punishing the cat.

371
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,180
- Well…
- Come on.

372
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,240
But… this…

373
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,839
We won't bother you then.

374
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,648
Let's go.

375
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,504
How could this happen to us?

376
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,080
You're in the wrong place. Our young master
doesn't keep idle animals.

But…

379
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,079
- Master…
- I recognize it.

380
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:52,640
I think it is my cat.

381
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:56,180
Today is a rare celebration.

382
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,640
Go and have fun with Heshan.
Don't worry about me.

383
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:00,384
I want to take a walk by myself.

384
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,219
You had an accident at Jiang Town before,

385
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:04,256
I don't think we should…

386
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,119
There are so many people. I'll be fine.

387
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,519
I'll take a walk and get back
to the carriage myself.

388
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:25,824
Understood, young master.

389
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:40,559
Heshan.

390
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,720
Do you remember what I told you
about the Cat Cradling Prince?

391
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,359
Our young master is holding
a cat right now, isn't he?

392
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:51,140
Did I just discover a shocking secret?

393
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,600
Zhanping, you notice this much,

394
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,079
but why can't you see the Master?

395
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:00,839
It seems that he is just
going through the motions.

396
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,328
Or rather,

397
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:06,200
he is just living for the sake of living.

398
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,496
Be careful.

399
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,599
How much is this?

400
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:31,232
Old lady.

Are you sick?

402
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,380
The rabbit lantern is well made.

403
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,319
I'll trade this rabbit with you.

404
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,480
Why the little rabbit now?

405
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:04,640
New Year's…

406
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,980
New Year's…

407
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,032
New Year's money.

[Huang's Bookshop]

409
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,016
Young Master Rong.

410
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,800
Is that really you, Master Rong?

411
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,199
Of course I would recognize you.

412
00:34:57,504 --> 00:34:58,528
Don't you remember me?

413
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,900
We even had pancakes together.

414
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,960
You called me a pig.

415
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:09,740
Isn't this the big yellow
cat I've been raising?

416
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,900
How did it end up with you?

417
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,119
What a coincidence.

418
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:18,752
Come, Master Rong.

419
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:20,800
Let me tell you.

420
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,480
This is my most satisfying work.

421
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,480
It's also my last piece as Mr. Xiaoxiao.

422
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,119
Since the market wasn't so good,

423
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:29,580
I stopped drawing you after a while.

424
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:33,400
I used the money I saved to buy this shop.

425
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:35,136
Later on,

426
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,020
I heard they were selling
the He family's artifacts.

427
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,540
I couldn't afford the ones too expensive,

428
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:43,559
so I bought this painting back, look.

429
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:03,320
I, as an ordinary man, do not strive for much.

430
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,039
I just want to live a peaceful life,

431
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:07,808
marry a wife and have kids.

432
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,120
Plus raising that big yellow cat.

433
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,760
I don't have much to care about.

434
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:14,000
But I heard

435
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,880
that Miss He and Master Rong have broken up.

436
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,260
Love affairs, right?

437
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,599
It's normal to have ups and downs.

438
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:26,304
But,

439
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:28,079
it's not true, is it?

440
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,460
Anyway, I don't quite believe it.

441
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,672
I also don't believe

442
00:36:32,672 --> 00:36:36,060
that Princess and Master Rong
are a natural pair.

443
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,559
A match made in heaven? No way.

444
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,864
Why?

445
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:45,320
Perhaps I have seen what a true match
made in heaven looks like.

446
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:48,720
The woman in the painting.

447
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,260
Her hands are clearly ruined,

448
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,300
yet she's desperately protecting you.

449
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,580
How can she bear to leave you

450
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,559
and how could you bear to part with her?

451
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,928
Yes.

452
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,800
She's such a person.

453
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:07,119
How could she?

454
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,952
How could she leave?

455
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,239
I'd better put the painting away.

456
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,599
Let's not bring up the past anymore.

457
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,800
How's your business?

458
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:27,360
Not very good.

460
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,719
and perhaps it will pick up in a while.

461
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,360
Thank you for showing me the painting

462
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:37,280
and telling me this person

463
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,440

No need.

468
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,856
Is there a pen and paper?

469
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:04,192
Yes.

00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,880
I've heard countless people's stories,

473
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:29,719
with many twists and turns,

474
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,239
joy and sorrow, separation and reunion.

475
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:36,239
Most are like a dream
of flowers in a fantasy land.

476
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:38,656
I thought

477
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:42,719
I was only a bystander to these stories,

478
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,920
but later I realized,

479
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,320
I am also a part of the story.

480
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:57,280
Today,

481
00:38:58,519 --> 00:38:59,880
I'll write a story for your bookstore.

482

Even if I can't do anything,

483
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,199
I want to allow some people

to live on
