[The Inextricable Destiny]

2
00:01:31,488 --> 00:01:34,336
[Episode 13]

3
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,319
The birthday gift…

4
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,520
what should I give?

5
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,320
If it's a normal girl,

6
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,600
gifts are usually accessories or clothes.

7
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,640
But for someone like Madam,

8
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,688
you might consider giving her
a sword or a horse.

9
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,959
You have many treasures awarded by the palace

10
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,620
and presented by foreign countries.

11
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,459
You can look at your private collection

12
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:45,759
when you return to the mansion.

13
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,232
Move! Move! Get up!

14
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,759
Are you blind?

15
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,340
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

16
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,680
I was trying to avoid a cat.

17
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,240
I didn't mean to hit you.

18
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:46,159
Where did you come from?

19
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,144
Are you hungry?

20
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:56,896
Just eat.

21
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,479
Why don't you eat?

22
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,000
Is it not tasty?

23
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
- What was wrong with you?
- You should go see a doctor.

24
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,320
I'm really sorry.

25
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,480
- I'll pick them up for you.
- How can I sell them now?

26
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:24,920
Look what you did!

27
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,759
I'm sorry, sir. It was an accident.

28
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:31,040
They are all ruined.

29
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,879
No one will buy them.

30
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,799
Come and take a look!

31
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:40,639

32
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,840

- Take a bite.
- You could get rich overnight.

37
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,320
New prizes for today's Guess-and-Get!

38
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,520
Pearls from the western seas,
dragon horn incense from Uighur,

39
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,180
and unicorn stone from Kunlun!

40
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,600
Extraordinary treasures
are available in abundance.

41
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,784
Place the bet! Place the bet!

42
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,416
Open up!

43
00:05:05,024 --> 00:05:06,920
- Big!
- Young master!

44
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,408
You look unfamiliar. Are you new?

45
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,440
I want to see those things you just mentioned.

46
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,240
You mean Guess-and-Get? We are preparing it.

47
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,020
You have to wait a moment.

48
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,040
How about you play something else for now?

49
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
Let's go.

50
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,759
I'll hold it for you.

51
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,480
Please allow me.

52
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,439
Alright.

53
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:29,400
Come, young master. Follow me.

54
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,120
Take a seat.

55
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,160
Which to bet on?

56
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,299
- Here.
- This one.

57
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,800
Time to place your bets!

58
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,079
Come on!

59
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,480
Place your bets now.

60
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,660
I will still bet on this one.

61
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,180
- Place your bets.
- Open up!

62
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,399
Open up! Open up!

63
00:05:42,656 --> 00:05:43,840
Told you so. Come on.

64
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,928
Hurry up and bring it over.

65
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,660
Come on!

66
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,160
You have won a lot today.

67
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,320
You are really lucky today.

68
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,500
Come on. Place your bets.

69
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,552
Place your bets now.

70
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,824
Come and place your bets.

71
00:05:53,824 --> 00:05:54,879
Here we go.

72
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,319
Final decision and no regrets.

73
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,439
Place your bets.

74
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,064
Eat quickly.

75
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,800
This person is holding a cat.

76
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,728
This outfit looks a bit familiar.

77
00:06:05,728 --> 00:06:06,800
Place your bets!

78
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,920
I'll still bet on this one.

79
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,784
Bro!

80
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:12,960
The one holding the cat!

81
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,720
Hurry up and place your bet.

82
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:19,680
Do I need to pay to sit here?

83
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:22,799
Of course. You come here
to win money, don't you?

84
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,399
You have to take out your money to place a bet.

85
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,340
Hurry and place your bet.

86
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,448
We are waiting here.

87
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,752
- Just take out your money.
- Place your bet now.

88
00:06:31,584 --> 00:06:33,600
Are you new? Just follow me.

89
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,419
I guarantee you'll buy a manor

90
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:36,920
in the capital. Let's place your bet here.

91
00:06:37,824 --> 00:06:39,780
- Here we go.
- Open up!

92
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,160
Three, three, and five.

93
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,160
- Great!
- We won again.

94
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,264
Fantastic!

95
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,519
It's alright. Let's try again.

96
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,580
Some people are just in bad luck.

97
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,419
They might as well play Big-or-Small instead.

98
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:56,500
- Right?
- Exactly.

99
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,680
What do you know?

100
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,399
I will show you what a turning of luck is.

101
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,900
'Turning of luck'?

102
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,600
Keep betting! Keep betting!

103
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,459
Come on. Open up!

104
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,000
- Place your bets.
- Open up!

105
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,600
Come on. Open up! Open up!

106
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,079
Young master, I accidentally knocked over
someone's vegetable stall just now.

107
00:07:13,856 --> 00:07:14,880
Young master?

108
00:07:15,424 --> 00:07:17,439
Young master! Young master!

109
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,560
- Great luck.
- Come on!

110
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,399
Place your bets!

111
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,359
Where should I place my bet?

112
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:37,280
I'm telling you, my luck is good today.

113
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,760
Do you have any more money? Next round,

114
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,120
I'll help you turn the game around.

115
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,416
Stop discussing. Hurry up and place your bets.

116
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,048
Which to bet on?

117
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,039
T-This is valuable.

118
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:49,560
- This is valuable.
- No, not this one.

119
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,319
Not this one. You can't touch it.

120
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,352
You can't touch it.

121
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,380
Final decision and no regrets.
That's the casino rule.

122
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,560
He hasn't placed his bet yet.

123
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,912
Whatever lands counts.
Quickly choose one to bet on.

124
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,759
He must be new here.

125
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,760
As I've said, you can only place your bet.

126
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,879
You can't take it back.

127
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:09,504
I don't want to.

128
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,040
He shouldn't be here.

129
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,096
Exactly.

130
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,240
I'm sorry.

131
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,680
Bro,

132
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,060
this place is backed by the regent.

133
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,639
You better not mess around.

134
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,880
Or you'll get beaten up.

135
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,688
If you don't want it gone, just win it back.

136
00:08:26,688 --> 00:08:27,712
Right?

137
00:08:27,712 --> 00:08:29,820
It has been Small all the time.
Maybe you should bet on Big now.

138
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,000
Just bet on Big.

139
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,779
Young master,
why don't you just place your bet?

140
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,639
Maybe you'll win this round.

141
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:36,760
Then you'll break even.

142
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,900
Exactly, young master.

143
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,300
Just place the bet.

144
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,480
Go ahead, young master.

145
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,336
Place your bet now.

146
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,940
Come on. Open up!

147
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,159
Open up!

148
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,480
Young master, have you decided yet?

149
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,720
Don't rush him.

150
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,464
What is he writing?

151
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:06,399
I forgot one.

152
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,740
Where should I place it?

153
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,240
Bro, do you really want
to exchange one piece of jade for five?

154
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,600
Can it be exchanged for more?

155
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,799
It could be.

156
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,799
But let's forget it.

157
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:18,840
Let's place the bet first.

158
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,300
Place this one first. Come on, dealer.

159
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,620
Open up! Open up!

160
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,959
Come on. Let's open up.

161
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,120
Open up!

162
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,200
You've won!

163
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,260
You're a lucky guy.

164
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,144
You've won!

165
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,872
You're really good.

166
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,040
What's with the money?

167
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,140
Is this all you're going to offer?

168
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,080
Gold has its price, but jade is priceless.

169
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,040
Even the worst quality is worth--

170
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,159
My place, my rules.

171
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:47,320
How can I get more?

172
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,120
I'm angry.

173
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:56,832
Madam,

174
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,519
the young master is missing again.

175
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,760
But every time he disappeared in the past,
he would go to see you.

176
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,519
However, you are in the mansion this time.

177
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,860
Let's not tell Lord Rong about this first.

178
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,000
Where did he disappear?

179
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,080
We will split up and look for him.

180
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,176
Okay.

181
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,660
Place your bets. Come on.

182
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,060
Where should we place the bets?

183
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,280
- Just wait.
- Hurry up and place your bets.

184
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,580
- Wait.
- Open up!

185
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,679
Open up! Open up!

186
00:10:21,216 --> 00:10:22,272
We've won!

187
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,100
It's ten times!

188
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,920
One pays ten. Dealer, pay up.

189
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,279
Pay up! Pay up!

190
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,344
These are ours now.

191
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,279
Look at this.

192
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,099
If we followed them, we would have won too.

193
00:11:00,099 --> 00:11:01,360
They've won so much.

194
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,680
Such a big pile.

195
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,159
They're in such good luck.

196
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,340
Did you cheat?

197
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,352
What?

198
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,480
Stop playing dumb.

199
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,440
You must have cheated.

200
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,640
The dice's result is unpredictable.

201
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,480
Yet you have won every time.

202
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,159
I just can.

203
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,920
Wait, the dice are in your hands.

204
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,879
How could he possibly cheat?
He couldn't read them.

205
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,020
At first, you said the young man
playing with the cat could not afford to play.

206
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,400
Now that he has won,
you start to accuse him of cheating.

207
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,580
I think the one who can't afford it is you.

208
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,919
- Isn't it?
- Right.

209
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,160
Just hurry up.

210
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,360
Open up quickly.

211
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,400
Right. Open up.

212
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,860
Hurry up and open up.

213
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,400
Open up!

214
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,519
Come on. Open up!

215
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:42,699
Open up! Open up!

216
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:44,559
Open up! Open up!

217
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,856
Guys,

218
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,872
you can place your bets now.

219
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,600
What do you think?

220
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,679
I won't place my bet for this round.

221
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:00,140
No? Why aren't you betting this round?

222
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,360
Not betting with your friend now?

223
00:12:03,008 --> 00:12:04,096
That's not true.

224
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,640
Or is that because you can't cheat now?

225
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,720
Wait. Why--

226
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,240
Is it not okay if he doesn't want to bet?

227
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,879
It's because you have something in your hand.

228
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,940
I don't know why,

229
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,639
but you suddenly hid it in your hand.

230
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,639
What nonsense are you talking about?

231
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,820
There's something in his hand. Check him.

232
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,440
Take a close look at him.

233
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,919
What's this?

234
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,232
Look!

235
00:12:27,232 --> 00:12:28,320
Got you!

236
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,900
Don't mess around. No one can mess around.

237
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,480
You cheated. Smash this place.

238
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:34,320
Smash him. Smash him with the money.

239
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,180
- What are you guys doing?
- Beating you.

240
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,248
You cheater!

241
00:12:37,856 --> 00:12:40,352
Take this! Give my money back!
You stole my money!

242
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,060
I'll kill you!

243
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,279
Beat him!

244
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:45,480
- Beat him!
- You can't take the money.

245
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,000
- Let's go.
- You stole my money!

246
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,599
I'll beat you to death.

247
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:50,919
Beat him! Beat him to death!

248
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:52,960
Cheater!

249
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,160
Kitten!

250
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,799
How did you fall asleep?

251
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,720
What are these?

252
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,576
Let's go.

253
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,919
What is he doing?

254
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:52,608
It's definitely a trap. Don't forget our task.

255
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:54,016
He managed to turn the whole casino

256
00:14:54,016 --> 00:14:55,712
upside down and walk away unharmed.

257
00:14:55,712 --> 00:14:56,800
He's not to be underestimated.

258
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,368
Exactly.

259
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,779
Don't fight with me.

260
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:20,200
Go away! Move!

261
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,419
We are not on the same side.

262
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:23,440
Go away!

263
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,759
Don't fight with me. Give those to me.

264
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,448
Give those to me.

265
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,260
They're mine.

266
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,288
They're mine.

267
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,720
It's scary.

268
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,880
Someone's been murdered.

269
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:45,279
Run. Someone has been murdered.

270
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,279
Jiuling, what are you doing here?

271
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:08,440
Look, I found a cat.

272
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,912
Where's the cat?

273
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,480
Hold me tight.

274
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,056
Rong Yu.

275
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,128
We've arrived.

276
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,792
No, we haven't.

277
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,976
Young master, you've returned.

278
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:53,280
Hurry and help him dismount the horse.

279
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,399
Young master, please.

280
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:04,599
Young master, please dismount the horse.

281
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,839
Young master!

282
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,599
Young master,

283
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,424
Lord Rong is looking for you.

284
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,944
This way.

285
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,856
Let's go.

286
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,079
How was the class in the Astrology Pavilion?

287
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,000
It was good.

288
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,920
I get along well with everyone.

289
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:05,600
A young fortuneteller
even gave me some pastries today

290
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,599
and asked me
if I had mastered the characters I learned.

291
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:09,824
So, have you?

292
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,984
It's okay.

293
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,384
It's not your fault.

294
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,519
I heard there's a master in the west.

295
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,679
I've already sent people to invite him.

296
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,880
He'll arrive in a few days.

297
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,759
Maybe this time there will be a good solution.

298
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,359
Okay.

299
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:37,240
You can go to your room and rest first.

300
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:40,832
Yu,

301
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,079
did you see the jade ornament

302
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,008
I left here?

303
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,784
It's the one from the He family.

304
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,279
No, I didn't see it.

305
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,880
Well, I'll keep looking then.

306
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,759
You can go back first.

307
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,448
Young master,

308
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:24,119
could you please tell me first
if you're going somewhere next time?

309
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,000
Sorry, I didn't know I would go far.

310
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,080
And why are there so much gold and silver

311
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,519
in your book basket, young master?

312
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:35,260
There was a cat just now too.

313
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,039
It ran off before I could catch it.

314
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,160
I…

315
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,760
I just… like this….

316
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,559
and then like that.

317
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:46,279
Then I have all these.

318
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,440
Why are you hitting yourself?

319
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,936
Jiuling!

320
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:01,000
I will stay next door.

321
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,240
You don't have to guard the outer room tonight.

322
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,640
Excuse me.

323
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,079
Is it because I made you worry today?

324
00:20:35,616 --> 00:20:36,699
No.

325
00:20:36,699 --> 00:20:39,960
Is it because I sometimes get up
in the middle of the night and disturb you?

326
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,480
- No.
- Then why?

327
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,959
Don't worry.

328
00:20:45,959 --> 00:20:47,659
It's very warm here.

329
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:49,400
I will be fine.

330
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:55,559
I just want to be alone for some time.

331
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:06,079
Young master, what happened to madam?

332
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:08,759
Why did she move here with a quilt?

333
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,480
It's probably because

334
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,160
I made her unhappy today.

335
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,359
It probably has nothing to do with you.

336
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,536
Where is Heshan?

337
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,880
Is his wound healed?

338
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,680
He went back to his hometown.

339
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,480
He has been locked…

340
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,460
No, sick for several days.

341
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,459
And he didn't even tell you in person,

342
00:21:56,459 --> 00:21:58,159
causing you to worry like this.

343
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,140
Isn't that good?

344
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,519
What's so good about it?

345
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:03,960
At least he has a home to return to.

346
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,119
But Jiuling has no family left.

347
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:12,040
When someone dies, you won't see them again,

348
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,279
and you can't find them anywhere, right?

349
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:18,920
As for me, I can't do anything right.

350
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,400
If only Heshan were here.

351
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,200
He's clever and would know what to do.

352
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,140
But that's not right.

353
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,559
What's not right?

354
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,980
I can't do things right,

355
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,380
so I don't do anything at all?

356
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,448
That's not right.

357
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:40,160
Zhanping, come over here.

358
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,680
[The Preface to the Code of Conduct for Women]

359
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,720
Someone! Help!
The young master fell into the water!

360
00:23:24,192 --> 00:23:26,279
Young master! Young master!

361
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:28,880
How did you fall into the lake?

362
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,799
How are you going to explain this
to Lord Rong when he's back?

363
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:34,699
It's my fault. I accidentally fell.

364
00:23:34,699 --> 00:23:36,780
- Rong Yu!
- Jiuling.

365
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,460
Zhanping, prepare some hot water quickly.

366
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,488
Yes.

367
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,344
Well…

368
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,728
Here.

369
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:48,079

make a bowl of hot soup for him quickly.

371
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:51,168
Okay.

372
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,959
How did you sweat so much?

373
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:57,960
Cover it well.

374
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,639
What happened?

375
00:24:02,639 --> 00:24:04,079
How did you fall into the lake?

376
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,519
Madam, Lord Rong asks you
to come to the ancestral hall immediately.

377
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,480
Okay.

378
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:14,780
Stay here and keep yourself warm.

379
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,920
I'll be back very soon.

380
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,440
These are the ancestors of our family.

[Rong Shan's Memorial Tablet]
This is my elder brother

382
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,480
and the father of Rong Yu.

383
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:53,940
We, the Rongs, are fortunetellers

384
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,880
who often foresee the mysteries of heaven,

385
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,799
so

386
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:59,359
our lives are generally short-lived.

387
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:03,519
My elder brother passed away
when he just reached his prime.

388
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:06,279
He was 12 years older than me.

389
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,839
After our father died,

390
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,559
it was he who took care of me.

391
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:14,599
He treated me like half a son.

392
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:16,720
After he died,

393
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,880
I raised Rong Yu.

394
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,800
Rong Yu

395
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:24,240
is like my son.

[Eternal Words of Filial Thoughts]

397
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,280
Sadly,

398
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:35,920
he was weak and often ill

399
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,079
during his childhood.

400
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:42,759
I had to stay up night after night
to take care of him,

401
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,599
afraid that something bad might happen to him.

402
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:49,376
It can be said that I raised him

403
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,000
by holding him in both my hands.

404
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,759
I raised him for 20 years,

405
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,839
never letting him get hurt.

406
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,680
He is the future of our family.

407
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,319
My only hope

408
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:06,659
is that he continues
to be the Star-picking Master,

409
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:07,744
and can be happy

410
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,920
and blessed.

411
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,720
For him,

412
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:18,759
I can give up everything of the Rong family,

413
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,599
including my life.

414
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:23,620
I am his uncle,

415
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,599
but I am also his father.

416
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:27,552
To me,

417
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,680
he can only be happy,

418
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,799
and nothing else is acceptable.

419
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,759
But since he met you

420
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:39,799
five years ago,

421
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,180
whether you were by his side

422
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,880
or not,

423
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,680
he has always gotten hurt.

424
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,359
There were even a few times

425
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:52,000
when his life was hanging by a thread.

426
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,720
You are like his nemesis.

427
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:57,200
No matter if I kill you

428
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,976
or let you stay alive,

429
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,160
it doesn't change the fact
that you're his nemesis.

430
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,440
I have one more question for you.

431
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,960
Although I already have the answer,

432
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:15,359
I still want to ask.

433
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,000
Is it the poison you gave Rong Yu

434
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,039
that turned him into this?

435
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,424
Yes.

436
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:55,660
If you dared to deny it just now,

437
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,000
I would absolutely not spare you.

438
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,359
While you might escape death,

439
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:02,480
you should still bear the consequences.

440
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,440
This time, no matter

441
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,480
what made Rong Yu fall into the lake,

442
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,839
the blame lies with you.

443
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:17,900
Young master, can you not do

444
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,120
such a scary thing in the future?

445
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,640
Is it really worth it for that fish?

446
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,559
They said the fish was the ancestral emperor's,
so it is magical.

447
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:28,920
I just want to give Jiuling a surprise.

448
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,540
The ancestral emperor and empress

449
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,699
bestowed upon you so many things.

450
00:29:32,699 --> 00:29:34,439
There must be at least eight or ten of them.

451
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,279
I haven't seen you treasure them much.

452
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,780
It would be nice if Heshan were here.

453
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,119
He could surely keep an eye on you.

454
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,519
I wonder how long it will take him
to visit his family.

455
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,839
By the way, young master, are you hungry?

456
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,279
No, I will eat with Jiuling later.

457
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,440
Madam was called in
for questioning by Long Rong.

458
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,980
She hasn't returned by this time.

459
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,620
She's probably eating with Lord Rong.

460
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,920
Let's not wait for her.

461
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,900
Also, young master, it's snowing outside.

462
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,079
Weren't you trying to give Madam a surprise?

463
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:09,160
It seems that even the heavens are helping you.

464
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,400
The healing medicine…

465
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:30,160
Easy. Be careful not to get it on your clothes.

466
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:39,279
Do you think you are still in the He family?

467
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,200
And there will be healing medicine?

468
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,400
Young master, hurry up.

469
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:34,368
Come.

470
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,256
Here.

471
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:04,980
You're courting death!

472
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,960
It's time to go home for dinner.

473
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:21,880
Jiuling! Jiuling, are you alright?

474
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,519
I'm fine.

475
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:25,568
- Where did you get hurt?
- Let's go.

476
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:28,580
So, you don't want me
to be part of the He family?

477
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,839
I don't.

478
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,500
But now you're going to throw your life away.

479
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,240
I'll stand in front of you.

480
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,400
You are the only one left in our family.

481
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,519
Don't make my death worthless.

482
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,960
Zhanping, hurry up.

483
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,056
Hurry up.

484
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,639
Young master, I can't drag it anymore.

485
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,400
Lower your voice.

486
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:44,039
My voice is already very low.

487
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,079
I really can't drag it anymore.

488
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:49,119
I really can't.

489
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:54,119
M-Madam?

490
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,119
- Jiuling--
- What are you doing here?

491
00:34:58,119 --> 00:34:59,136
You're awake.

492
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,679
Jiuling,

493
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:07,199
how did you wake up?

494
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,660
You just fell into the lake,
and now you are playing with snow?

495
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,039
You will catch a cold.

496
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,799
Your hands are so cold.

497
00:35:14,799 --> 00:35:16,760
How can you cause so much worry?

498
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,640
And you. You're running wild with him.

499
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,000
We're not running wild.

500
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,279
Do you remember

501
00:35:23,279 --> 00:35:24,519
what day it is tomorrow?

502
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:27,460
Who cares what day it is?
Stop loitering around here.

503
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,000
Go to sleep.

504
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,320
It's your birthday tomorrow.

505
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,392
Don't you remember?

506
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,079
Look, these are bunnies
that Zhanping and I made.

507
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,160
I wanted

508
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,719
to make them all by myself.

509
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:49,960
But mine are tiny and ugly.

510
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:53,160
The nice-looking ones
were all made by Zhanping.

511
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,272
The ugly ones

512
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,320
were all made by me.

513
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:59,584
Happy birthday, my bunny lady.

514
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:12,480
I wish you more happiness

515
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,200
and more joy.

516
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,880
When Zhanping and I went to buy lanterns today,

517
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,220
the people there said

518
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,459
that the fish in the lake could bring luck.

519
00:36:20,459 --> 00:36:22,599
So I went to catch this fish.

520
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,400
You fell into the lake

521
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:32,039
for this?

522
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:36,060
I got only half my body wet. It's okay.

523
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,760
And I caught this fish at once.

524
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,400
Even Zhanping couldn't do that.

525
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,920
Are you still not happy?

526
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,400
How could all these things make me happy?
