00:01:24,964 --> 00:01:31,552
<i>[The Inextricable Destiny]</i>

2
00:01:31,552 --> 00:01:34,404
<i>[Episode 25]</i>

3
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,256
Ren Yinxiao,

4
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:43,680
we've already recaptured Wutu City.

5
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,519
Do you still plan on staying here?

6
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,400
You are a defeated general
who can't even guard a city.

7
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,040
Once we block the necessary route
back to Xunnan,

8
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,239
you'll have nowhere to retreat.

9
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:56,768
Then,

10
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,200
you can only stay in Nanjiang as a war slave
for the rest of your life.

11
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,344
Since,

12
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,719
even the remaining Wutu has been taken by you,

13
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:21,039
I don't want Nanjiang either.

14
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,319
Whether Xunnan soldiers are inferior,

15
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,879
or Jialin are divinely helped,
it doesn't matter.

16
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,536
But

17
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,712
someone

18
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,000
has to pay the price for this.

19
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,039
Before returning to Xunnan,

20
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,120
I want to kill someone to offer to Heaven

21
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:43,280
to calm the spirits of dead Xunnan warriors.

22
00:02:50,112 --> 00:02:52,080
It's Advisor Rong.
How did Advisor Rong get captured?

23
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,520
General He, congratulations.

24
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,040
You stepped on my land and killed my soldiers.

25
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,839
Now you insult my military advisor.

26
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:09,280
Yes, so what?

27
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,760
How can we bear such a humiliation?

28
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,640
We will fight to death to save Advisor Rong.

29
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,656
Let's go.

30
00:03:14,656 --> 00:03:15,744
Come back.

31
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,280
The only thing you have to do

32
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,080
is to guard Nanjiang City well.

33
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,880
Since you took Wutu,

34
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,159
I'll kill the person you least want to lose.

35
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,919
Thanks to the Emperor.

36
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,960
Your Majesty didn't punish
the Astrology Pavilion for treason,

37
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,199
and spared the life of Rong Yu's only relative.

38
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,840
But I have decided to kill myself
to apologize long ago.

39
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,296
Today,

40
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,680
every inch of the land
has been returned to Jialin.

41
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,960
Every story

42
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,240
has reached its conclusion.

43
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,439
It's time for me

44
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,079
to comfort the country with my blood.

45
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,720
Don't be sad for me.

46
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,160
At least,

47
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,800
I will not be killed by others.

48
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,240
Otherwise, it will humiliate Jialin.

49
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,400
Withdraw.

50
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,480
No.

51
00:05:14,052 --> 00:05:16,836
<i>[Nanjiang City]</i>

52
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,880
<i>From now on, she will be your little sister.</i>

53
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,880
<i>As her senior brother,
you need to take good care of her. Understand?</i>

54
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,720
<i>Let's eat some fried scorpions.</i>

55
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:47,480
<i>In the master's absence,
we'll just have to settle for this.</i>

56
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,079
<i>Thank you, Senior brother. You eat first.</i>

57
00:06:58,464 --> 00:06:59,839
<i>- Senior brother.
- Here.</i>

58
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,096
<i>Delicious.</i>

59
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,399
<i>Alright, don't be sad.</i>

60
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,439
<i>I descended the mountain to become
the most formidable and powerful person.</i>

61
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,800
<i>You are already very good now.</i>

62
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,680
<i>Why do you want to become a person like that?</i>

63
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,984
<i>Because only in this way</i>

64
00:07:29,984 --> 00:07:31,480
<i>can I protect the most important ones.</i>

65
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,528
<i>I'll leave now.</i>

66
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,879
Enough. Stop.

67
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,720
Jiuling.

68
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,279
He Jiuling, he's dead.

69
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,279
Is it worth it for you to die for him?

70
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,679
If he lives, I can die.

71
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,840
If he dies,

72
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,480
I must die with him.

73
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,180
Jiuling.

74
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,799
Even if it's a corpse,

75
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,039
I have to bring him home in a decent way.

76
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,840
We can't live together,

77
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:30,320
but we can die together.

78
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,152
Little sister.

79
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,879
If you knew this would happen,

80
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,840
why did you start it in the first place?

81
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,200
Let's go.

82
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:29,728
Rong Yu.

83
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:45,412
<i>♫ A flower blooms only for you ♫</i>

84
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:53,760
<i>♫ My tears and worries are only for you ♫</i>

85
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,648
Rong Yu.

86
00:10:57,956 --> 00:11:02,080
<i>♫ My longings, promising the next life ♫</i>

87
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:08,480
<i>♫ For you, I'd go wild and stay ♫</i>

88
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,480
Rong Yu.

89
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,840
This time, I will bring you home.

90
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,000
Rong Yu.

91
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:28,352
<i>♫ The realm is still there ♫</i>

92
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,000
Rong Yu.

93
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,040
I-I'm

94
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,799
sorry for

95
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,304
what happened to the H-He family.

96
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:47,232
<i>♫ Lend me a wish of a lifetime ♫</i>

97
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:48,800
Rong Yu.

98
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,679
I don't blame you.

99
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,000
Did you hear me?

100
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,840
I don't blame you.

101
00:12:03,204 --> 00:12:08,800
<i>♫ The old faces return to be with you ♫</i>

102
00:12:10,336 --> 00:12:23,320
<i>♫ The old faces return to be with you ♫</i>

103
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,448
Young master.

104
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:27,740
Previously, my master gave him
a rejuvenation pill.

105
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,000
It should be able to suppress it for a while.

106
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,879
Doctor, I have a lot of medicines here.

107
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,840
There are Qi-condensing ones,
blood-supplementing ones and

108
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:41,440
ones for unclogging the meridians.

109
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,759
I-I have a lot of others.

110
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:46,159
We should give it a try. It might work.

111
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,320
Rong Yu, open your mouth.

112
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:55,360
But it is too long since he took the poison.

113
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:00,360
Even if the poison has been forced out,

114
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,900
there is no way to restore the damage
in his body.

115
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,399
Even the best medicine can't help.

116
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:12,840
Your Majesty, I've tried my best.

117
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:15,399
Try to think of other ways.

118
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,800
You must bring him back to life.

119
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,480
Otherwise, I will punish you.
I will punish you all.

120
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,520
Your Majesty,
it's not that I'm not skilled in medicine.

121
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,200
It's really that his body is severely injured.

122
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,159
Old injuries have not healed yet
and new ones have followed.

123
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,039
There's really no way, Your Majesty.

124
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,759
Then tell me. How many days can he live?

125
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,080
Even if he is kept alive
with the best medicine,

126
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,759
it won't be more than ten days.

127
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,120
Rong Yu is injured like this. You have to live.

128
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,519
You have to treat yourself first.

129
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,360
Yes, I have to live.

130
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:11,519
I have to live to save him.

131
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:29,060
<i>You were born with an odd early aging disease.
When normal people live for ten years,</i>

132
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,399
<i>you may have already lived your whole life.</i>

133
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,120
<i>Five years ago,
everyone thought your disease had been cured.</i>

134
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,560
<i>Actually, you survived on a medical worm.</i>

135
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,900
<i>I used my life's greatest skills.</i>

136
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,759
<i>to make a medicine called Pipa Zui.</i>

137
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,440
<i>As long as this medical worm is in your body,</i>

138
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,919
<i>whether it's strange or serious disease
or external injuries,</i>

139
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:51,540
<i>as long as it doesn't harm the fundamentals,</i>

140
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,879
<i>Pipa Zui will repair it at the fastest speed.</i>

141
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,879
It is me who had you back this time.

142
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,799
Should I thank you?

143
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:54,560
Do you know

144
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,160
why I went to Hanshan temple?

145
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,840
I don't know and I don't want to know.

146
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:02,639
And this time I had you back

147
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,519
because Rong Yu is very ill.

148
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,200
He needs you.

149
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,200
Hypocrisy.

150
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:19,000
Every time Rong Yu got hurt is because of you.

151
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,600
You are the disaster of Rong Yu,

152
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,440
the disaster of the Rong family.

153
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,440
It's me.

154
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:54,720
I failed him.

155
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:01,440
If not for me,

156
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,200
he would have no will to live.

157
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:09,856
But this is even more painful than

158
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,799
killing me.

159
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,880
He is torturing my heart.

160
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,872
He Jiuling,

161
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,960
kill me.

162
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,559
Kill me.

163
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,240
Kill me.

164
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,296
Yes,

165
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,720
I should kill you.

166
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,440
My family was framed by you.

167
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,880
I shouldn't let any one behind this go.

168
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,160
But I can't kill you,

169
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,319
and I definitely won't forgive you.

170
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,720
This puts an end to our grievances.

171
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,528
I have failed my family.

172
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:29,519
I am ashamed to see my father,
brothers, sister-in-laws

173
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:32,240
and my unborn nephew.

174
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,160
After I die,

175
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,759
I will confess my sins to them.

176
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,920
In the future,

177
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,759
protect Rong Yu like before.

178
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:48,119
Don't do anything to make him sad again.

179
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,599
This is my only request.

180
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,512
Hurry.

181
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:46,944
Hurry. This way.

182
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:50,752
Come on. This way.

183
00:20:50,752 --> 00:20:51,776
Yes.

184
00:21:00,228 --> 00:21:02,436
<i>[To Zhanping]</i>

185
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,320
<i>Zhanping, Heshan,
I've left to search for medicines.</i>

186
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,960
<i>I will return within five days. Wait for me.</i>

187
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,992
He's here.

188
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:32,288
Xiao.

189
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:37,120
Master.

190
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,240
Take the token

191
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,240
back.

192
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,960
I won't come to Xunnan again.

193
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,920
Does Master want to scold me?

194
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:05,400
I have already scolded you.

195
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,759
It's just that I feel ashamed.

196
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:11,880
In the past over ten years,

197
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,000
you didn't learn how to let go.

198
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,592
Let go?

199
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,880
When your mother sent you to Mount Wuhua
to become my disciple,

200
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:31,260
she did not want you to kill so many people

201
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,480
and then sit here alone.

202
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,920
She wanted you to escape from the place where
people are killed without a second thought.

203
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:43,400
She wanted you to grow up
more carefree and happier than your brothers.

204
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,440
But you didn't understand her.

205
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,900
I have never forgotten to become the king

206
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,359
to avenge for the two of you.

207
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,559
Although you were always smiling,

208
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:00,400
you never had a happy day

209
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,000
on Mount Wuhua.

210
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,480
Now that things have come to this,

211
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:11,552
are you happy?

212
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:16,359
Did you truly feel happy

213
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:19,200
when you and Jiuling became enemies?

214
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,540
<i>Master, Master, I don't want to learn
how to extract medicinal insects.</i>

215
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,679
<i>Poison him. Soften his bones.
Replace his blood.</i>

216
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:34,000
<i>Keep him not eating
or drinking for several days.</i>

217
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,040
<i>Then you can remove the medicinal insects.</i>

218
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,039
<i>How can a person live like this?</i>

219
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:40,459
<i>They might not be able to live.</i>

220
00:24:40,459 --> 00:24:42,300
<i>I haven't tried before.</i>

221
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,720
<i>First, boil a thick soup with nine insects,
nine herbs and nine poisons.</i>

222
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,260
<i>Have the person take it.</i>

223
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,080
<i>Wait until the person's bones</i>

224
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,240
<i>are as if they were smashed by a heavy hammer,</i>

225
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,140
<i>and then use your martial skills
to make his meridians flow in reverse.</i>

226
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:58,656
<i>It is dangerous and must not be disturbed
by outsiders, otherwise…</i>

227
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:22,600
The final battle in Nanjiang

228
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:28,000
was settled after Wutu was taken by Jialin.

229
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,520
Who would have thought that the King
of Xunnan would be so embarrassed and angry

230
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,560
that he wanted to kill our military adviser,
the Star-picking Master, to offer to Heaven.

231
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,980
The ghost-faced general on his horse

232
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,439
charged into the army of ten thousand enemies.

233
00:25:43,439 --> 00:25:47,600
It was like water entering the vast ocean
or meat offering to a group of beasts.

234
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,240
There seems no return for him.

235
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,679
Just at this most critical moment,

236
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:57,160
the sky cracked and a golden dragon descended.

237
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:01,219
With one roar, Xunnan army was so frightened
that they discarded the armor and helmets.

238
00:26:01,219 --> 00:26:05,199
They were trembling and yelling
for the saint to forgive them.

239
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:08,220
It turns out that the person
who always wore the ghost mask,

240
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,680
is the Emperor of Jialin,

241
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,016
Cheng'an.

242
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,768
Your Majesty.

243
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,680
From now on,

244
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,519
you are not only
the ghost-faced general in Nanjiang,

245
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,400
but also the ghost-faced emperor of Jialin.

246
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,599
Just pretend that the person who made a pact
with you to live and die together,

247
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:43,440
never existed.

248
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:47,079
Since I'm destined to leave,

249
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,279
please allow me to decide for myself,

250
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,512
to add this merit,

251
00:26:53,088 --> 00:26:55,480
to the person I've sworn to be loyal to.

252
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:00,440
I have been confused all my life.

253
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:02,680
The only thing I've accomplished

254
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,799
is to be utterly loyal to Jialin
and die for it.

255
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:09,680
Fortunately, at least in this regard,

256
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,599
I didn't disappoint my father and brothers.

257
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:30,240
Did you all know?

258
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:35,359
Did she order you to hide the truth

259
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:38,419
before she left

260
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:41,120
just to give me a glory
that doesn't belong to me

261
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,160
to stabilize this country?

262
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,440
So what if they saw it?

263
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,599
- Sister.
- Even if many people saw it,

264
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:53,152
as long as we want,

265
00:27:53,152 --> 00:27:54,432
the person behind the ghost mask,

266
00:27:56,256 --> 00:27:57,440
can be anyone.

267
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,759
- No.
- You are the Emperor.

268
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,880
You should understand
her intentions in this letter.

269
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,736
Yu.

270
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,759
Yu.

271
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:52,400
Yu.

272
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,408
Yu.

273
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:00,384
Quickly. Ask the Imperial Physician to come.

274
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,488
Quickly!

275
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,680
<i>What is this?</i>

276
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:30,599
<i>Amnesia Powder.</i>

277
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:31,680
<i>Senior brother,</i>

278
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,160
<i>why did you make this?</i>

279
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,319
<i>Sometimes, love</i>

280
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,496
<i>is too burdensome.</i>

281
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,279
<i>When you have no choice,</i>

282
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,599
<i>you may need it.</i>

283
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,960
This is the third time

284
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,728
I stay here.

285
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:25,440
The first time is

286
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,200
when you were poisoned.

287
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,079
I stayed here for three days and three nights.

288
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,279
But I don't know why,

289
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,640
I just felt

290
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,160
you would definitely be fine.

291
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,480
You

292
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,720
would definitely get better.

293
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:52,960
Back then,

294
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,759
I was not so worried.

295
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:01,160
I'm just angry.

296
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,232
I want

297
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:06,400
to destroy everything

298
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,720
to protect you.

299
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:17,759
The second time is

300
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:21,279
when you were severely burned.

301
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:25,079
I could not stay with you

302
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,599
like before.

303
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:33,920
My heart then

304
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,000
was even more exhausted than my body.

305
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:40,240
In a sudden,

306
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,000
I-I felt that I had collapsed.

307
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,119
I didn't want to do anything.

308
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,240
I was unwilling to do anything.

309
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,279
This is the third time.

310
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,200
I-I

311
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,888
feel

312
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:32,079
that I won't be able to stay with you.

313
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,512
I don't know

314
00:33:41,956 --> 00:33:44,292
whether you can hear me.

315
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:47,360
However,

316
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,279
you probably don't want to listen to me.

317
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:56,079
I have always

318
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,440
thought we

319
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:03,240
relied on each other for life.

320
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,159
We could never bear to part from each other.

321
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:10,760
But now it seems

322
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,480
we are more

323
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,639
like nemesis.

324
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,360
Let past grievances go.

325
00:34:54,519 --> 00:35:01,239
Let past grievances go.

326
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:35,328
Make way.

327
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,928
Make way.

328
00:36:50,976 --> 00:36:52,060
Princess.

329
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,239
It's so cold.

330
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,360
Why is it so cold in the capital?

331
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,480
The hand-warmer can't help.

332
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:08,320
I should have stayed in my comfortable house.

333
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,740
Why did I wait for Master Yuanhui

334
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,880
to go to Qingcheng Temple?

335
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,380
Are you alright, Princess?

336
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,512
What's happening?

337
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,512
Princess.

338
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,920
Something serious happened, Princess.

339
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,064
Princess.

340
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:00,599
Be careful, Princess.

341
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,719
It wasn't me.

342
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,160
It's the old woman
who suddenly ran into the horse.

343
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,184
The horse was startled

344
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,679
and got her severely injured.

345
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:13,248
There's blood.

346
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:19,920
Isn't it plain to see?

347
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:24,359
The winter in the capital is unbearable.

348
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:27,419
As soon as they see a wealthy person,
they try to swindle money.

349
00:38:27,419 --> 00:38:30,640
They even specifically chose
this road to Qingcheng Temple,

350
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,360
hoping to meet some naive and wealthy pilgrim.

351
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:38,304
However, I…

352
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,920
Why are you grabbing my clothes?

353
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,379
- I…
- Let go.

354
00:38:52,379 --> 00:38:53,472
Let go.

355
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,119
Chu.

356
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,280
There's no naive wealthy pilgrim.

357
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:18,620
But every pilgrim
is willing to accumulate good karma.

358
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,712
Princess.

359
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:21,632
C-Could

360
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:25,696
you

361
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,400
please go

362
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,424
as fast as you can…

363
00:39:35,364 --> 00:39:40,055
<i>♫ Under the setting sun in dusk ♫</i>

364
00:39:42,276 --> 00:39:48,075
<i>♫ I travel far for thousands of miles ♫</i>

365
00:39:48,075 --> 00:39:55,045
<i>♫ Playing the zither under the moonlight ♫</i>

366
00:39:56,259 --> 00:40:02,431
<i>♫ The drinks won't let me forget ♫</i>

367
00:40:03,396 --> 00:40:09,384
<i>♫ The longing I write down for you ♫</i>

368
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:16,040
<i>♫ Our fate is written on paper ♫</i>

369
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,339
<i>♫ Just like the strongest wine ♫</i>

370
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:23,754
<i>♫ There's no escape for destiny ♫</i>

371
00:40:24,676 --> 00:40:30,760
<i>♫ Looking back, I see you waiting ♫</i>

372
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:37,928
<i>♫ Our lives are filled with joy and sorrow ♫</i>

373
00:40:37,928 --> 00:40:44,863
<i>♫ The longings crystalize
into a bright galaxy ♫</i>

374
00:40:44,863 --> 00:40:52,680
<i>♫ You turned around quietly
and closed the marriage book ♫</i>

375
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:58,280
<i>♫ Asking how many stars there are in the sky ♫</i>

376
00:41:24,516 --> 00:41:30,088
<i>♫ The longing I write down for you ♫</i>

377
00:41:31,652 --> 00:41:37,256
<i>♫ Our fate is written on paper ♫</i>

378
00:41:37,256 --> 00:41:41,290
<i>♫ Just like the strongest wine ♫</i>

379
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,232
<i>♫ There's no escape for destiny ♫</i>

380
00:41:45,796 --> 00:41:51,848
<i>♫ Looking back, I see you waiting ♫</i>

381
00:41:51,848 --> 00:41:58,888
<i>♫ Our lives are filled with joy and sorrow ♫</i>

382
00:41:58,888 --> 00:42:06,085
<i>♫ The longings crystalize
into a bright galaxy ♫</i>

383
00:42:06,089 --> 00:42:13,352
<i>♫ Gently I stroke the zither,
waiting for a passerby like you ♫</i>

384
00:42:13,956 --> 00:42:20,116
<i>♫ Turns out you are my inextricable destiny ♫</i>
