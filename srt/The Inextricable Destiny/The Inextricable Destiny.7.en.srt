Yes.

Didn't he just hurt He Jiuling?

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,580
I have already thought about it.

If my master thinks that Rong Yu is not destined to be saved by him, I'll kneel in front of her door to beg her.

If that's still not enough, I'll make it three days.

Father, why aren't you saying anything?

171
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:30,160
Do you want Jiuling to get married to counteract their bad luck?

172
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,700
All right.

173
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,320
All the betrothal gifts were selected by Young Master himself earlier.

174
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,000
Now they have all been sent here.

175
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,880
Thank you.

176
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:56,159
Heshan. Heshan.

177
00:12:57,324 --> 00:12:58,680
Heshan.

178
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,368
How…

179
00:13:07,368 --> 00:13:09,419
How is Rong Yu doing?

180
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,299
You want him to get better, too. Right?

181
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:18,760
You want him to get better, too. Right?

182
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,240
Heshan, I have a way.

183
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,440
Let's go.

184
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:13,900
Miss He, you are really nice to Young Master.

185
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,800
I'm not nice to him.

186
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,260
No, it's not like that.

187
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,580
I always thought you liked to bully him.

188
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,640
But now everyone has given up on him.

189
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,040
Only you are still willing to save him.

190
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,560
I believe in his judgment.

191
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,220
I also believe in what he said.

192
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,240
He said you wouldn't harm him.

193
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,092
Rong Yu,

194
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,719
I'm sorry.

195
00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:22,720
It's all my fault. I'm sorry.

196
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,219
This is the direction to Mount Wuhua.

197
00:15:49,219 --> 00:15:52,039
They won't run far. Chase quickly.

198
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:06,120
Heshan, the guards have caught up.

199
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,440
What should we do?

200
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,959
Avoid the main road and go into the forest first.

201
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,080
See if we can avoid them.

202
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,868
Dismount.

203
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,112
Search this place.

204
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,000
After them!

205
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,140
Young Master is over there. Quickly!

206
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,816
It's not safe here.

207
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:00,100
We have to leave as quickly as possible.

208

Don't be afraid.

220
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,300

I told you.

238
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,860
At least keep this far from me.

239
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:36,480
I will get angry if you come over again.

240
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,820
Look. Shameless. So shameless.

241
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,559
Go away.

242
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,860
M-Madam.

243
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,740
Do you have any places that we can stay?

244
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,200
Do you have any places that we can stay?

245
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,140
My son and daughter are not at home.

246
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,180
You guys can stay here.

247
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,200
But…

248
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,340
Madam, look, my hand is injured.

249
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,680
He is supporting me.

250
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:23,900
Have some water first. I'll clean the place up for you.

251
00:22:26,884 --> 00:22:28,740
Drink more.

252
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,964
Drink it up.

253
00:22:29,964 --> 00:22:33,059
Don't think about drinking my drool in the future.

254
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,979
He doesn't even know when he's thirsty.

255
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,720
The Best Young Master of Jialing has turned into a big fool.

256
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,059
The Best Young Master of Jialing has turned into a big fool.

257
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,280
The Amnesia Powder can also make people stupid, in addition to depriving them of the ability to love?

258
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,680
The Amnesia Powder can also make people stupid, in addition to depriving them of the ability to love?

259
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:51,032
Senior Brother, this is all your fault.

260
00:22:51,032 --> 00:22:53,340
Senior Brother, this is all your fault.

261
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,920
You don't even know how to go to the toilet, do you?

262
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,620
No, don't drink anymore.

263
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,540
I won't teach you that.

264
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,160
All right, I will teach you if it's a must.

265
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,119
Here, drink some water.

266
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,704
[He Mansion]

267
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,020
Chenzhou.

268
00:23:49,668 --> 00:23:51,692
Where are you going?

269
00:23:51,692 --> 00:23:53,620
I have to find them myself.

270
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,852
All roads to Mount Wuhua have been guarded.

271
00:23:57,852 --> 00:23:59,580
How else do you plan on finding them?

272
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,459
I'll dispatch more people and track them personally.

273
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:09,360
Father, Jiuling's taking Rong Yu away is a big deal.

274
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,599
How can you not be anxious?

275
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:15,279
What's the use of being anxious?

276
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:19,540
Your sister will do the things she insists on, no matter what.

277
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,459
Your sister will do the things she insists on, no matter what.

278
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:25,800
If you stop her this time, she will think of a way to do it again.

279
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,580
If you stop her this time, she will think of a way to do it again.

280
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,080
Don't you think it's strange?

281
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,720
She clearly dislikes Rong Yu very much and can't wait to clear all her relations with him.

282
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,560
She clearly dislikes Rong Yu very much and can't wait to clear all her relations with him.

283
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,680
But this time, she suddenly behaves so abnormally.

284
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:47,119
I'm afraid something is hidden beneath this.

285
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,780
I'm afraid something is hidden beneath this.

286
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,099
Are you a sticking plaster? Can you stop sticking around me?

287
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:58,899
Are you a sticking plaster? Can you stop sticking around me?

288
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,656
Did you have a fight?

289
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,340
Cherish what you have, miss.

290
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,660
Your boyfriend is handsome and treats you well.

291
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,720
There's no need to fight.

292
00:25:14,979 --> 00:25:16,720
The quilt was aired recently.

293
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,020
Your hand is injured. I'll help you spread it.

294
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,480
No need. Just leave it to m…

295
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:25,560
my boyfriend.

296
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,220
With such a fairy-like appearance, he must be a young master of nobility.

297
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,199
How can he do such work?

298
00:25:30,199 --> 00:25:33,080
Let me do it instead.

299
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,320
By the way, I made dinner for you.

300
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,140
It's in the kitchen.

301
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,999
When you come back after eating, I'll have this place sorted out.

302
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:41,340
When you come back after eating, I'll have this place sorted out.

303
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:44,119
Thank you, madam.

304
00:25:46,312 --> 00:25:47,800
Let's go have dinner.

305
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,932
One hand.

306
00:26:08,932 --> 00:26:13,800
Yes, put them together. Good, like this.

307
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,439
Pick it up like this.

308
00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:18,936
Watch me.

309
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,020
It's okay.

310
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,580
Don't rush. Take your time.

311
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,400
Eat it. Right.

312
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,360
Eat it.

313
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,060
Put it in your mouth.

314
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,480
Your own mouth.

315
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,079
Put it in your own mouth. Rong Yu...

316
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:17,719
The conditions are limited, so don't think about having a bath and sleeping in separate beds.

317
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,680
The conditions are limited, so don't think about having a bath and sleeping in separate beds.

318
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,580
The conditions are limited, so don't think about having a bath and sleeping in separate beds.

319
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,459
Bear with it for one night.

320
00:27:23,459 --> 00:27:26,040
Take off your shoes and go to bed.

321
00:27:30,639 --> 00:27:33,172
Shoes.

322
00:27:33,172 --> 00:27:35,060
Take off your shoes.

323
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,020
Take your shoes off.

324
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:54,244
Go to bed.

325
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,464
Lie down.

326
00:28:07,739 --> 00:28:09,856
Cover yourself with the quilt.

327
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,939
Well, Rong Yu.

328
00:28:24,939 --> 00:28:26,620
I really doubt the person who would rather die than submit at the inn was really you.

329
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:30,100
I really doubt the person who would rather die than submit at the inn was really you.

330
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,119
If those ladies who desperately long for you but are too shy to speak up

331
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:34,220
If those ladies who desperately long for you but are too shy to speak up

332
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,840
were here now, they would definitely eat you up.

333
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,480
were here now, they would definitely eat you up.

334
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,839
How did you become so silly?

335
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,659
Then again, since you woke up, you haven't said anything.

336
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:53,140
Then again, since you woke up, you haven't said anything.

337
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,740
Then again, since you woke up, you haven't said anything.

338
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,359
Is your throat okay?

339
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:00,620
Rong Yu, open your mouth.

340
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,992
Speak.

341
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:05,200
Speak up.

342
00:29:24,499 --> 00:29:26,496
You're a pig.

343
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:33,279
You are a pig.

344
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:42,599
You are a pig.

345
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:48,519
It's really good that you are alive.

346
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:50,799
As long as you can be awake like this, I am satisfied.

347
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,060
As long as you can be awake like this, I am satisfied.

348
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:56,580
Thank the heavens, I didn't go too far.

349
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:01,219
It's okay that you don't know how to drink or eat.

350
00:30:01,219 --> 00:30:02,680
It's okay that you don't know how to drink or eat.

351
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,960
As long as I, He Jiuling, can find food and water, I won't let you starve to death.

352
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,200
As long as I, He Jiuling, can find food and water, I won't let you starve to death.

353
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,919
It's not a big deal that you can't understand what I say.

354
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,720
It's not a big deal that you can't understand what I say.

355
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,079
We can learn from the beginning.

356
00:30:16,939 --> 00:30:19,259
When we reach Mount Wuhua, I'll get my master to help you detoxify.

357
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:22,419
When we reach Mount Wuhua, I'll get my master to help you detoxify.

358
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:26,599
Then you'll be the shining Star-picking Master again.

359
00:30:28,196 --> 00:30:29,352
What are you doing?

360
00:30:29,352 --> 00:30:33,788
My brilliant life is spoiled by you.

361
00:30:33,788 --> 00:30:35,000
I knew a long time ago that I couldn't marry this kind of man.

362
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,160
I knew a long time ago that I couldn't marry this kind of man.

363
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,219
I'm the one who suffers, whether he's stupid or not.

364
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,400
Get up if you're awake.

365
00:32:00,219 --> 00:32:01,759
Put on your shoes.

366
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:05,360
Let me see if my hand is getting better.

367
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:11,780
I forgot you can't understand me.

368
00:32:22,739 --> 00:32:25,060
You understood what I said?

369
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,450
Get the teapot. I want to drink water.

370
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:40,680

372
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:50,286
♫ Sunset, dusk, and the setting sun ♫

373
00:32:51,507 --> 00:32:57,306
♫ Traveling thousands of miles away ♫

374
00:32:57,306 --> 00:33:04,476
♫ Appreciating the music of the zither and and the moon in the middle of the night ♫

375
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:11,962
♫ How many times will the drinks not let me forget? ♫

376
00:33:12,627 --> 00:33:19,615
♫ Picking up the pen and feeling lovesickness come true ♫

377
00:33:19,615 --> 00:33:25,271
♫ Fate is noisy on paper ♫

378
00:33:25,271 --> 00:33:29,670
♫ The strongest wine is the most unforgettable ♫

379
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:33,807
♫ Love is so deep that there is no escape ♫

380
00:33:33,807 --> 00:33:39,991
♫ Looking back, you are, waiting for me ♫

381
00:33:39,991 --> 00:33:47,059
♫ Have you ever looked back on the joys 
 and sorrows of the years? ♫

382
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:54,494
♫ The longing crystalizes into frost and brilliant stars ♫

383
00:33:54,494 --> 00:34:01,911
♫ You quietly turned around and closed 
 the marriage book with your own hands ♫

384
00:34:01,911 --> 00:34:08,411
♫ Smiling and asking how many stars there are 
 in the world tonight ♫

385
00:34:33,747 --> 00:34:40,719
♫ Picking up the pen and feeling lovesickness come true ♫

386
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:46,487
♫ Fate is noisy on paper ♫

387
00:34:46,487 --> 00:34:50,831
♫ The strongest wine is the most unforgettable ♫

388
00:34:50,831 --> 00:34:54,827
♫ Love is so deep that there is no escape ♫

389
00:34:54,827 --> 00:35:01,079
♫ Looking back, you are, waiting for me ♫

390
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:08,119
♫ Have you ever looked back on the joys 
 and sorrows of the years? ♫

391
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:15,580
♫ The longing crystalizes into frost and brilliant stars ♫

392
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:23,187
♫ Gently I stroke the zither, waiting for a passerby like you ♫

393
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:30,047
♫ Turns out you are my inextricable destiny ♫
