<i>[The Inextricable Destiny]</i>

2
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,368
<i>[Episode 18]</i>

3
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,619
If only Hongzao was here,

4
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,239
you could keep each other company.

5
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,580
This horse is quite obedient.

6
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,760
I'll teach you how to ride tomorrow…

7
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,136
Sorry.

8
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,040
I'm not who you wanted to see.

9
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,480
Why would you come if you knew
you weren't welcome?

10
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,319
Do you think I'm both deaf and blind,
knowing nothing at all?

11
00:02:07,136 --> 00:02:08,160
I came here

12
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,599
to talk to you, if that's okay.

13
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,599
Chengbi, you're actually mute, aren't you?

14
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,700
Your predecessor didn't talk much,

15
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,040
almost like a mute.

16
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,720
He went home to visit his family

17
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,800
and never came back,

18
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,840
as if he never existed.

19
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,800
You killed Lord Song, didn't you?

20
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,439
Thank God.

21
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,360
I wished him dead.

22
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,159
There was a blade's mark

23
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,840
on Lord Song's carriage.

24
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,960
Not many people in the capital use blades.

25
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:20,768
As for your blade,

26
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,000
when you decided to use a blade,

27
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,560
Qingxing asked me to design it as a gift.

28
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,719
I've modified it so it would be more

29
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,479
suitable for a woman to use,
and I can recognize it.

30
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:34,920
My spy near the Regent's mansion reported

31
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,400
that someone broke into the mansion tonight.

32
00:03:37,248 --> 00:03:38,280
He Jiuling.

33
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,680
It was also your men, wasn't it?

34
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,580
What do you want?

35
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,620
Arrest me like you did before?

36
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,380
If I wanted to do that,

37
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,759
I would've done it long ago.

38
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,264
So you're playing with me?

39
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,220
Do you enjoy seeing me

40
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,319
acting like a clown?

41
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:57,840
If so,

42
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,600
it wouldn't hurt to kill you.

43
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,919
He Jiuling, don't you get it yet?

44
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,399
Whatever you want to do, I can help you.

45
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:06,520
Help me?

46
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,520
Your family is like a watchdog
for Lord Zhongyong. Helping me?

47
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:14,304
I'm not my family,

48
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,480
nor am I the Regent's man.

49
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,800
I'm only myself.

50
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,839
I just want to atone for my sins.

51
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,648
Do it.

52
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,384
Why did you stop?

53
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,240
Do you think I'm scared?

54
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,120
You know it too.

55
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,519
Whether it's you, me, or anyone else,

56
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,160
at that time, none of us were capable

57
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,940
nor could we change the outcome,

58
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,000
could we?

59
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:20,560
Young Master, where are you going?

60
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,620
Young master, it's dark. Where are you going?

61
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,980
I can send someone to escort you.

62
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,040
No need.

63
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,420
No need to bother, Your Highness.

64
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,639
I can take care of the Young Master.

65
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,000
That's fine too, but it's getting late,

66
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
and there might be tigers
and wolves outside the tent.

67
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,839
You should be careful.

68
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,808
<i>I would like to see</i>

69
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,959
<i>who wants to take my life.</i>

70
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,079
Why are you out here alone
in the middle of the night?

71
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:17,160
What if something happens?

72
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,600
My eyes are a bit red, aren't they?

73
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,360
Maybe I'm just tired.

74
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,940
It's so late,

75
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,140
so let's go back and rest.

76
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,079
We have to go to the hunting ground tomorrow.

77
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,448
Tomorrow,

78
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,176
don't go to the hunting ground.

79
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,140
Did you forget?

80
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,680
the Emperor gave me a bow and arrows

81
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,439
and said he wanted to see me shoot a wild boar.

82
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:46,976
Don't go.

83
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,616
Okay, okay.

84
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,560
Do you want me to fly a kite with you?

85
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:57,320
Then I'll fly a kite with you first tomorrow,

86
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,959
and I'll teach you how to ride a horse.
And the day after tomorrow I'll…

87
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:01,959
Don't go the day after tomorrow either.

88
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,560
Rong Yu, what… what's wrong with you?

89
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,104
I'm not quite sure myself.

90
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,160
But could you just not go?

91
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:20,440
You haven't told me yet,

92
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,079
why are you here alone?

93
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,839
I'm afraid Uncle

94
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,859
would be angry at you if he knew

95
00:07:28,859 --> 00:07:30,500
you were running around.

96
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,160
He's an elder.

97
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,860
If he's angry with me,

98
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,240
I won't take it to heart.

99
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:38,940
Your family is my family.

100
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,440
I will be good to him,

101
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,160
and I will work hard to get him to forgive me.

102
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,208
Good morning, Young Master.

103
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,060
Madam said,

104
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,400
you stayed up late watching her
before going to sleep,

105
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,920
so she asked me not to wake you up.

106
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,616
Where is she now?

107
00:08:15,616 --> 00:08:17,680
She was just called over

108
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,220
by the young miss of the Lord's house,

109
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,639
who should be called Princess Xihe now.

110
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,864
Young master.

111
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,919
Mrs. Rong.

112
00:08:52,544 --> 00:08:53,600
Mrs. Rong.

113
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,879
Why don't you play a tune?

114
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,440
I'm sorry, I don't know how to.

115
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,919
If there's nothing else,

116
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:02,919
I'll take my leave.

117
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,608
Wait,

118
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:09,600
as a noblewoman of a Jialin family,

119
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,880
not knowing even this most basic skill

120
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,960
is really shameful.

121
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,980
Our ancestor, the Emperor,
established a school for girls,

122
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,900
so that girls could be proficient
in poetry, music, and zither.

123
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,099
Mrs. Rong.

124
00:09:21,099 --> 00:09:22,460
You couldn't draw before.

125
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,780
And now you can't play the zither.

126
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,639
You must be able to do something.

127
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,540
Poetry, song, painting, music,
and the art of the lute.

128
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,799
I can't do any of those things.

129
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,879
So if there's any related event,

130
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,820
don't bother inviting me.

131
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,800
If you can't, you can learn.

132
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,800
A woman's face is the face of her father
and brothers before she gets married.

133
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,779
And after marriage, it is the face
of her husband's family.

134
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:44,600
Playing with swords is not something
that can be presented on stage.

135
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,008
Do you think you will be called
onto the battlefield in the future?

136
00:09:47,776 --> 00:09:49,680
Since you're staying in the capital,

137
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,160
in the gatherings of madams and young ladies

138
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,340
if you're unable to do anything,

139
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,679
wouldn't you look stu--

140
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,016
Like a fool?

141
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,080
Try twisting Mrs. Rong's hand a little.

142
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,740
She was disabled for a while
before she got married.

143
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,700
I don't know if she can still play the zither.

144
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,039
If she can, I, as a princess, will help her.

145
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:14,220
After the hunting trip,
I will arrange for her to learn

146
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,399
with my six or seven-year-old cousin.

147
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,520
Poetry, song, painting, music,
and the art of the lute

148
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,820
are just like swords, sticks,

149
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,520
spears, axes, hooks, and forks.

150
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,000
There is no difference in their value.

151
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:26,624
What kind of person a woman wants to become

152
00:10:26,624 --> 00:10:28,320
is not up to anyone to criticize.

153
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,480
As for the face of the father
and husband's family,

154
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,600
why don't they earn it themselves

155
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:36,919
but rely on you to do it?

156
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,639
What are we going to do?

157
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,240
They started to fight immediately.

158
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,279
Indeed.

159
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,300
They didn't

160
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,240
have much face yesterday.

161
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,879
Others let you win deliberately.

162
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:51,060
Did they?

163
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,416
What?

164
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,544
Let go, I am a princess now.

165
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,120
I dare you to disrespect me.

166
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,840
Yesterday I told them what dignity means.

167
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,799
It means not to make
others uncomfortable arrogantly.

168
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,020
If you didn't understand that,

169
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,380
I don't mind teaching you again.

170
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,039
Just like you tried to teach me
how to play the zither today.

171
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:12,180
Let go. Let me go.

172
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,600
Mrs. Rong, you…

173
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:17,000
I just want to have tea with Miss Jiang alone

174
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,699
to resolve the issue

175
00:11:18,699 --> 00:11:20,700
that she is always unhappy to see me.

176
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,848
If you want to play the zither, go ahead.

177
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:23,960
I…

178
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,960
How…

179
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,900
I advise you to behave.

180
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,320
In front of so many people,

181
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,120
don't lose your dignity as a princess.

182
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,824
Wait.

183
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:36,480
The Emperor and the Regent are here.

184
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,880
He Jiuling won't do anything to her.

185
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,240
But if you offend her,

186
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,739
she would definitely not mind

187
00:11:42,739 --> 00:11:44,240
making a scene for others to laugh at.

188
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:48,000
Chengbi.

189
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,840
She drank some tea with hallucinogens,

190
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,799
but the effect only lasts
for the time of one incense stick.

191
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:58,880
I will be back in time.

192
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,959
Keep an eye on her.

193
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:01,024
Be careful.

194
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,519
Young Master.

195
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,159
Why are you so anxious to find her?

196
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,704
This place is full of women.

197
00:12:12,704 --> 00:12:13,824
Master Rong.

198
00:12:13,824 --> 00:12:14,912
Let's not stay here, shall we?

199
00:12:14,912 --> 00:12:16,020
Isn't that Master Rong?

200
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,984
Young master, and what could
possibly happen to Madam?

201
00:12:18,624 --> 00:12:19,744
Young master.

202
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,472
Master Rong.

203
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,240
Is Master Rong looking for He Jiuling?

204
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,660
He Jiuling and Princess Xihe

205
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,960
have been gone for a while.

206
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,240
Young master, young master.

207
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,480
Young master, where are you going?

208
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,976
Young master.

209
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,064
Wait.

210
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:49,879
Young master.

211
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,559
What are you doing?

212
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,080
Your Highness,

213
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,719
His Majesty bestowed a new horse today,

214
00:13:58,719 --> 00:13:59,979
and the young master came to try it out.

215
00:13:59,979 --> 00:14:01,200
Trying out the horse?

216
00:14:04,768 --> 00:14:05,888
Young master,

217
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,680
this is a hunting ground.

218
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,159
There are wild beasts roaming around,

219
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,699
and swords have no eyes.

220
00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:12,240
I don't want you to get hurt.

221
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:16,519
Young master, young master.

222
00:14:20,704 --> 00:14:21,824
It's noisy.

223
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:27,000
For your safety,

224
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,019
I'll have someone escort you back.

225
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:31,168
Servants!

226
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,039
Yesterday, His Majesty
granted me a new position.

227
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,419
So what?

228
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:37,480
It's higher than yours.

229
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,279
Your Highness.

230
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,000
Could you slow down a bit?

231
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,959
My master is not a skilled rider,

232
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,000
and he can hardly keep up.

233
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,320
Your Highness, why are you stopping?

234
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,919
My master's Turk horse can hardly move.

235
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,456
Your Highness,

236
00:16:07,456 --> 00:16:09,120
why are you running so fast again?

237
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,799
My master can't keep up.

238
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,080
The Regent is back.

239
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,960
I came to count the game for Your Highness.

240
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:31,799
Just now, a few lords came back

241
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,360
with only a few chickens.

242
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,159
And His Majesty is having fun.

243
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:38,639
I don't have anything here, scram.

244
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,600
Wipe your drool.

245
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:07,839
I didn't drool. You're fooling me.

246
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,400
Well, I must have seen it wrong.

247
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:16,000
Sorry, I fell asleep while scolding you.

248
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,860
However, judging by your

249
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,880
sincere apology,

250
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:21,920
I won't blame you for the time being.

251
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:26,380
So that was the illusion you saw.

252
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,488
What did you say?

253
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,304
Nothing.

254
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,720
Chengbi, let's go.

255
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:38,540
She was savagely scolded by me just now.

256
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,160
Just a paper tiger, why acting tough now?

257
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,880
So refreshing.

258
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,359
Why am I here?

259
00:18:17,312 --> 00:18:18,360
Rong Yu.

260
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,519
Slow down a bit.

261
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,880
I'm not running.

262
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:24,359
Rong Yu, be careful not to fall.

263
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,720
Where have you been?

264
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,319
I was just drinking tea with the ladies.

265
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,000
There's nothing to worry about, right?

266
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,688
Really?

267
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,119
What? Don't you trust me?

268
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,280
On the contrary, you're running around all day.

269
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,839
Do you know how dangerous it is?

270
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,519
<i>Forget it, I'll find an opportunity later.</i>

271
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,160
Jiuling, come back to sleep.

272
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,839
Do you want this?

273
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,096
How about this?

274
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,640
Have some more of this.

275
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,760
Rong Yu,

276
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,039
do you have any idea
how furious I am these days?

277
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:35,039
I don't know what to do with you.

278
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,824
Speak frankly.

279
00:21:37,824 --> 00:21:40,039
Are you sent by God to punish me?

280
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,100
Have some tea.

281
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,920
Following the Regent all day long,

282
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,960
don't you get tired?

283
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:57,720
What are you talking about?

284
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:02,359
Nothing.

285
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:06,880
What's there to argue with you?

286
00:22:08,064 --> 00:22:09,080
Have some more dishes.

287
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,960
How dare this Li Yuhan still play the zither?

288
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,600
The day before yesterday,
everyone was gossiping

289
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,040
that her zither playing was not in tune,

290
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,360
and that she should
restrain here and elevate there.

291
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,860
It's so embarrassing.

292
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,300
She puts on a face like she's the best,

293
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,079
looking down on everyone.

294
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,519
Finally, someone looks down upon her.

295
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:27,584
Exactly.

296
00:22:28,128 --> 00:22:29,260
Speaking of which,

297
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,600
the zither skills of Young Master Rong

298
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,920
were exceptionally beautiful.

299
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,119
It's a pity now.

300
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,256
Such a pity.

301
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,200
Have some tea.

302
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:42,079
Did you use to play the zither?

303
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,199
Are you talking about what we're hearing now?

304
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:48,340
I think she sounds terrible.

305
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,720
And she even missed some notes.

306
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:56,119
Maybe I would do better.

307
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:00,840
Even if you could,

308
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,039
I have no idea when I could actually hear it.

309
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:05,799
Young Master, Madam.

310
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:09,536
During these past few days of hunting,

311
00:23:09,536 --> 00:23:10,800
His Majesty has gotten some nice things

312
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,140
and is distributing them.

313
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,320
Other people have left and you
were nowhere to be seen,

314
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,880
so I was sent to invite you
to receive your rewards.

315
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,880
Thank you, sir.

316
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,839
I'm sorry. I haven't been able
to obtain the military symbol.

317
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,119
It wasn't supposed to be easy.

318
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:31,680
Besides,

319
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,960
others are watching the Regent's Mansion.

320
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,960
Young master,

321
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,400
isn't this rabbit cute?

322
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,176
Look, it's been hungry for a while.

323
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,759
Come on, hurry up and feed it.

324
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:02,100
The person monitoring
outside the Regent's Mansion

325
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,200
was sent by Yan Lie.

326
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:04,840
A few days ago at the hunting grounds,

327
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,160
he even offered to help me.

328
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,680
In order to restrain that old scoundrel,

329
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:11,319
I've been fostering the Yan family
to turn against him.

330
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,640
I've instigated so many times in front of him

331
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,359
and it's already made him
suspicious of the Yan family.

332
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,300
Stealing the military symbol

333
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,800
has alarmed him.

334
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,679
If he finds out Yan Lie is monitoring
the Regent's Mansion,

335
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:26,319
despite Yan Lie's intentions,

336
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,519
the Yan family will be in danger.

337
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:31,279
What a pity.

338
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:36,096
If Your Majesty want to use Yan Lie,

339
00:24:36,832 --> 00:24:37,920
after this matter,

340
00:24:38,496 --> 00:24:39,920
you can take him under your command.

341
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,119
But you hate the Yan family the most.

342
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,759
I still do.

343
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:55,200
But I've learned to understand

344
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:57,440
the meaning of having no choice

345
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:00,599
when things change unpredictably.

346
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,039
And I've also learned how to survive in hatred.

347
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:08,759
Don't push yourself too hard.

348
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:11,400
No matter what,

349
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:14,799
the situation now is much better than before.

350
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,480
I count on you to resolve
many matters out there.

351
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,260
You must protect yourself

352
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,519
and be very careful.

353
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,424
Understood.

354
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:30,680
By the way, He Jiuling,

355
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,480
with Rong Yu like this now,

356
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,279
isn't it too hard for you?

357
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,759
Him?

358
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:43,440
He might actually be my lucky star.

359
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,600
If you want to leave him in the future,

360
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,640
I can help you.

361
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,119
When the He family fell into misfortune,

362
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,319
he saved me from the water and fire.

363
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:56,480
I know you are a person
who takes kindness seriously.

364
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:59,079
But keep this in your heart too.

365
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,400
You never know when you might need it.

366
00:26:09,088 --> 00:26:16,256
<i>[Rong's Mansion]</i>

367
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,780
Someone from the pharmacy just came by.

368
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,664
They said they'd found the Celestial Grass.

369
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,240
Where?

370
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,416
Outside the city, in Jing Mountain.

371
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:39,712
That's far away.

372
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:43,920
It doesn't matter.
I have to go however far it is.

373
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,880
Why can't I see through
the future of the Regent?

374
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,759
Even the stars are blurred.

375
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,400
There's not a single useful clue.

376
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,799
What's going on?

377
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,220
Could it be that he has experts
by his side changing his destiny

378
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,480
that I know nothing about?

379
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,000
Young master.

380
00:27:20,512 --> 00:27:21,536
It's getting late.

381
00:27:21,536 --> 00:27:23,360
Don't you have to buy Lotus cakes for Madam?

382
00:27:23,904 --> 00:27:25,240
If you don't go now, they will be sold out.

383
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,400
You came back a bit later than usual today.

384
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,200
They are still hot.

385
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,480
It will always be hot in the future.

386
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,400
It's okay.

387
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,799
I just said it casually.

388
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:44,680
It's tastier when it's hot.

389
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,079
It's even better than the one
you love to eat in Xicheng.

390
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,160
Isn't it?

391
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,599
If you like it, eat more.

392
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,080
By the way, Rong Yu,

393
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:09,319
I have something to discuss with you.

394
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,720
I need to find a herb

395
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,079
called Celestial Grass.

396
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:16,540
It's freshest only after it rains.

397
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,380
So if it rains tonight,

398
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,039
I will go to Jing Mountain.

399
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:23,519
This way, I can get up early
to pick up the medicine tomorrow.

400
00:29:27,872 --> 00:29:28,896
Come on.

401
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,032
Let's go.

402
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:35,400
I've taken out some summer clothes for you.

403
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,440
If it's hot tomorrow,

404
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,599
let Zhanping change it for you.

405
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,540
And this sachet,

406
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,759
I just made it,

407
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,660
and the smell is a bit strong,

408
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,599
but it is for repelling mosquitoes.

409
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:49,860
Even if you think it smells bad
when you sleep at night,

410
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,640
don't ever take it off.

411
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:54,959
I also smoked your quilt with herbs.

412
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,039
How long will you be gone for?

413
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,960
I'll return tomorrow night.

414
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:04,512
It's only for one day.

415
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:06,112
There's nothing to worry about,

416
00:30:06,784 --> 00:30:07,872
right?

417
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:17,960
But I still feel uneasy.

418
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,519
Then I'll go with you.

419
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,319
I'd be more worried that way.

420
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,460
Rong Yu, Rong Yu.

421
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,160
This annoying habit
of dragging things out of mine

422
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,720
is all your fault.

423
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,100
You're too bothersome

424
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,352
and too worrying.

425
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,279
I was never

426
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,160
like this before.

427
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,960
It's my fault.

428
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,400
It is. I blame you.

429
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,640
But this time,

430
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,160
let me go with you.

431
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:56,992
Alright. I hear you.

432
00:30:57,728 --> 00:31:01,160
Don't worry, Chengbi and Wu Ritan are with me.

433
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:02,816
When you come back,

434
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,759
we will move to another house.

435
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:16,680
It seems

436
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:19,720
I have a family again.

437
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,300
Tan, slow down.

438
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,900
We have already collected the medicine.

439
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,119
It is because we have got it
that I am afraid it will lose its efficacy.

440
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,300
Besides, look at yourself.

441
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,119
You are obviously more anxious
to return to the city than anyone else.

442
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,920
I'll go fetch some water. You guys keep eating.

443
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,840
Keep an eye on the herbs.

444
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,000
<i>It's Regent's men.</i>

445
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,639
<i>Traveling with such few people</i>

446
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,639
<i>is really too abnormal.</i>

447
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,719
After what happened with the Yan family,

448
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,119
I don't really trust the people

449
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,519
around me now.

450
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:08,519
Who knows when they will betray me?

451
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:12,679
Now that the Chen family
has asked to go to Yanzhou

452
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,800
and the Yans have been demoted to Shu,

453
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,020
I am not planning

454
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,520
to promote the Left and Right Generals anymore.

455
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,960
It's safer to keep everything

456
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,679
in my own hands.

457
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,800
Moreover, in the hunting ground,

458
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,740
I clearly felt that someone
was trying to harm me.

459
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,920
The Yan Family also started
to frequently oppose me,

460
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,719
but nothing happened in the end.

461
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,680
I really don't know what to make of this.

462
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,320
Sir, is it possible
that your divination was wrong?

463
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,416
Impossible.

464
00:35:45,088 --> 00:35:47,584
The only mistake was the inclusion of Rong Yu.

465
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,720
<i>This voice…</i>

466
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,719
The fate of a person related
to Astrology can't be predicted.

467
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,660
His appearance must have

468
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,640
interacted with the incident
in the hunting ground.

469
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,480
If I could use the star chart,

470
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,599
I would be able to predict more things.

471
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,880
I see.

472
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:15,760
I will need to ask Lord Rong for more advice

473
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,559
to ensure the safety of me and my family.

474
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,200
Of course.

475
00:36:19,808 --> 00:36:22,559
As long as I am the Regent,

476
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:25,920
whatever you need, just ask.

477
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:28,000
Not to mention one He family,

478
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,199
even if there are two or three,

479
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:31,000
if they dare to stand in my way,

480
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,079
I will destroy them.

481
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,920
He Jiuling had the nerve to poison my son,

482
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:44,280
and I will let the He family pay the price.

483
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,762
