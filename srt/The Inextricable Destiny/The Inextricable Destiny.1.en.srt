Over here, over here!

00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,160
- I'll take this one. 
 - This is the most popular one.

8
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,939
Here, here! Take a look.

Don't fight with me. This is mine.

00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,080
The new drawing of Master Rong.

12
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,460
- Do you want it? 
 - Yes.

13
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,540
- Do you want it? 
 - Yes.

14
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,819
You guys have a good taste.

15
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:19,719
Rong Yu is so good-looking.

16
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:21,479
Look at his pretty eyes.

17
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:24,199
- Rong Yu. 
 - He is. I'll give you a discount.

18
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,600
Okay, okay.

19
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,540
Take care.

20
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,860
- Fantastic! 
 - Am I crazy? Or is the world crazy? He's just a pale student.

21
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,500
- Fantastic! 
 - Am I crazy? Or is the world crazy? He's just a pale student.

22
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,180
I could take down three with one punch.

23
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,860
But he's so popular.

24
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,420
I guess it's my fault.

25
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,640
I wasn't in the capital for so many years.

26
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,959
That's why the He's have been so low-key.

27
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:46,880
Anyone can surpass the three brothers of my family.

28
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,390
How is he the Best Young Master?

29
00:02:57,379 --> 00:02:59,280
Report! General, the third child of yours is outside the barracks.

30
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,400
Report! General, the third child of yours is outside the barracks.

31
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,040
But he brought a woman with him.

32
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,879
The battalion commander sent me to report to you.

33
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,724
He Qiuting?

34
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:13,460
What a scoundrel.

35
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,839
Why is it so spicy? Give me the candied haws.

36
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:31,239
No way.

37
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,080
Why do I feel it's okay?

38
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,660
You must have eaten too many bugs on Mount Wuhua.

39
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,900
You must have eaten too many bugs on Mount Wuhua.

40
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,180
What are you doing?

41
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,119
- Whose food are you eating? 
 - Dad.

 - Dad.

43
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,380
Answer me, you scoundrel.

00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,199
Dad! Dad!

45
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:57,460
You visited me on Mount Wuhua last year.

46
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,360
How can you not recognize me?

47
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,180
My dear.

48
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,759
Come on, come down.

- Dad. 
 - My sweetheart.

50
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,880
I'm glad you're back.

51
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,739
I've missed you so much.

52
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:16,580
Come on, let me take a look.

53
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:19,140
You really have changed a lot.

54
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,419
You look different every year.

55
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:22,940
If you didn't come back soon, I really wouldn't have recognized you.

56
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,199
If you didn't come back soon, I really wouldn't have recognized you.

57
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:30,100
Master told me that I had perfectly inherited her mantle, and she didn't have anything else to teach me.

58
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,580
Master told me that I had perfectly inherited her mantle, and she didn't have anything else to teach me.

59
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,480
So she let me come down the mountain.

60
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,859
But I always feel like she's fooling me.

61
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,320
I don't care about that at all.

62
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,900
I don't care if you're a good doctor or if your martial arts are high enough.

63
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,639
I don't care if you're a good doctor or if your martial arts are high enough.

64
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,379
As long as you are cured, you can come back.

65
00:04:47,179 --> 00:04:48,879
Dad.

66
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:51,920
I can't believe you hit me like that.

67
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,539
What's wrong with hitting you?

68
00:04:55,539 --> 00:04:56,800
You deserved it.

69
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,100
I told you to practice your skills properly.

70
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,480
- If you had practiced well, how could my kick hurt you like that? 
 - Exactly.

71
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,880
- If you had practiced well, how could my kick hurt you like that? 
 - Exactly.

72
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,319
This is a warning for you, isn't it?

73
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:05,639
A warning?

74
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,099
Aren't you going to be a Jinwu guard next year?

75
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,360
If you don't practice well, you will be a joke.

76

If you don't practice well, you will be a joke.

77

What do you want to eat? I'll take you to get some treats.

79

- I want something expensive. 
 - Okay,

 - Okay.

 - Okay.

Let's go.

86
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,720
Wait. You don't need to come.

87
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,060
Go feed the donkey.

- Right over there. 
 - I feel like I'm a muleteer.

 - Okay, Mr. He.

Reluctant, aren't they?

104
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:32,960
- You look beautiful, my girl. 
 - Pretty, right? Have a look.

105
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,372
So cute.

106
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:38,639
Are you thinking about when I get married?

107
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,820
When you weren't home before, I missed you terribly.

108
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,380
When you weren't home before, I missed you terribly.

109

Silly girl.

115

But once she is married, it seems she can never come back.

- It smells so wonderful. 
 - It's so fragrant.

00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,519
It smells so good.

144
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:33,159
Those meat buns are looking amazing.

145
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,040
So many meat buns.

146
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,296
Look at that bun.

147
00:08:37,296 --> 00:08:39,264
They look so good.

148
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,020
I don't even dare to dream about them.

149
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,779
There are actually meat buns.

150
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:46,799
This kind of person is so compassionate.

151
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:49,039
Yes. And I heard it was a girl with kind eyebrows and kind eyes.

Yes, and I heard it was a girl with kind eyebrows and kind eyes.

Yes, and I heard it was a girl with kind eyebrows and kind eyes.

154
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:54,860
That's like a Bodhisattva descending to earth.

155
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,639
Thanks to her, we have been saved.

156
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:57,959
Thanks to her, we have been saved.

157
00:08:57,959 --> 00:08:59,320
Yes.

158
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,240
I heard the relief fund has already arrived, but why haven't we seen any trace of it?

159

I heard the relief fund has already arrived, but why haven't we seen any trace of it?

160
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:07,160
Yes. Tell me about it.

161

Look! That's the carriage of the kind person.

162
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,120
It was her who bought so many buns.

163

When she went upstairs just now, I took a secret glance.

She looked just like a fairy from heaven.

How could you see through her veil?

167
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:31,020
I can't see anything.

168
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:33,759
She might be ugly.

169
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:36,379
I think we should go.

170
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:39,079
If someone sees us, we'll be doomed.

171
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,519
I see you already.

172
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:45,280
If she was wearing a veil, she didn't want you to see her face.

173
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,180
If she was wearing a veil, she didn't want you to see her face.

174
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,960
- Miss. 
 - Call me Great Aunt.

175
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,700
Great Aunt. Great Aunt.

176
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,260
Pretty or not, it's her own business.

177
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,680
Pretty or not, it's her own business.

178
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,940
- It's not for you to judge. 
 - Yes.

179
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,039
And you.

180
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,539
How dare you harass the guest?

181
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:05,380
- Great Aunt, I didn't. 
 - Yes.

182
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,340
Get out of here. Come back.

183
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:13,259
Bring a pot of hot water to my room.

184
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:15,592
Understood. Let's go.

185
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,800
I smell butterfly orchid.

186
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:42,320
It seems that this girl is quite unique.

187
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,759
It seems that this girl is quite unique.

188
00:10:56,896 --> 00:10:58,364
[Wu's Bun Shop]

189
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,680
Miss, you gave us buns in the city.

190
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,820
You must be a kind person.

191
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,760
Please give us some money too, so that we can get through the flood.

192
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,999
Please give us some money too, so that we can get through the flood.

193
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:23,240
Yes, exactly.

194
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,840
Money, we need money.

195
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,160
You are a kind person. Could you give us more money?

196
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,420
Money, we need money.

197
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,480
If you don't give us money, we won't leave today.

198
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,560
Right, we won't leave.

199
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,679
- And you can't leave either. 
 - Right.

200
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:35,284
We are not leaving.

201
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,460
Brothers, we have money now!

202
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,940
- So much money. We are rich now! 
 - Can you let us pass now?

203
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,420
We want to see if there are any other valuable items in the carriage.

204
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,800
We want to see if there are any other valuable items in the carriage.

205
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,100
- Let's go, let's go. 
 - You greedy, insatiable people!

206
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,879
If you dare to step forward, my whip will be merciless.

207
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:21,940
If you dare to step forward, my whip will be merciless.

208
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,620
- Who are you? 
 - Where are you from?

209
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,659
- Go back home. 
 - Little girl, go back home.

210
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,420
You two. How did you get bullied by these useless guys?

211
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,060
You two. How did you get bullied by these useless guys?

212
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,820
Boundless kindness is the same as indulging evil.

213
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,940
Boundless kindness is the same as indulging evil.

214
00:12:37,819 --> 00:12:39,040
Greed knows no bounds.

215
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,100
The money box, give it back to them.

216
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,299
The money box, give it back to them.

217
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:43,560
Little girl, why are you interfering?

218
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,799
Little girl, why are you interfering?

219
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
By virtue of my dharma name, Wukong, I can send you to the West Heaven.

220
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,940
By virtue of my dharma name, Wukong, I can send you to the West Heaven.

221
00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:54,839
- Brother. 
 - Brother.

222
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,460
- Are you okay? 
 - You actually poisoned me!

223
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,240
Are you okay, Brother?

224
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:05,240
What did you do to me?

225
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,160
Have you ever heard of rejuvenation?

226
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,760
After a little over ten days, you will have to depend on someone else to pee.

227
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,979
After a little over ten days, you will have to depend on someone else to pee.

228
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:15,039
- That's horrible. 
 - So?

229
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,459
Anyone else want to try?

230
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:21,679
Who? You! Come! Try it!

231
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:23,780
Give it back to them. Give it back to them.

232
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,220
- No! 
 - Here's the antidote.

233
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,120
- Brother. 
 - Brother.

234
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,684
Get lost!

235
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:32,659
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

236
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:34,940
- Run! 
 - Run! Run!

237
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,840
Thank you, Miss, for your help.

238
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,416
Don't mention it.

239
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,300
Firstly, when I see something like this, I can't just stand by.

240
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,200
Firstly, when I see something like this, I can't just stand by.

241
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,959
Secondly, I have tasted the buns given to the disaster victims by your young miss.

242
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,060
Secondly, I have tasted the buns given to the disaster victims by your young miss.

243
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,859
What? Miss?

244
00:13:51,859 --> 00:13:54,920
- Where are you going? 
 - Shangzhou.

245
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,900
Shangzhou? The flood is so severe in Shangzhou, and there are so many bandits along the way.

246
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,859
Shangzhou? The flood is so severe in Shangzhou, and there are so many bandits along the way.

247
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:03,220
You can't even handle a few men.

248
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,240
I fear you will be devoured without leaving even the bones.

249
00:14:08,359 --> 00:14:10,379
Young Lady in the carriage…

250
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:12,360
- Who are you calling a young lady? 
 - I just came down from Mount Wuhua.

251
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,659
Why don't we go together?

252
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:18,020
The world is full of chaos.

253
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,500
I see your men here are rice buckets. looking good but useless.

254
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,600
I see your men here are rice buckets, looking fine but useless.

255
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,499
I see your men here are rice buckets, looking fine but useless.

256
00:14:21,499 --> 00:14:23,240
What did you say?

257
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:26,160
Why don't you let me escort you instead?

258
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,739
Otherwise, I wouldn't be He Jiuling.

259
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,580
By the way, I'm He Jiuling, the daughter of the He family in the capital.

260
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,396
By the way, I'm He Jiuling, the daughter of the He family in the capital.

261
00:14:34,396 --> 00:14:36,440
Miss, you can rest assured.

262
00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:47,359
I'll go get my horse. Wait a moment.

263
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:49,519
The Butterfly Orchid perfume you're using is quite unique.

264
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,040
She said her name was He Jiuling.

265
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,639
Young Master, she seems to have mistaken you for a lady.

266
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:57,940
Our trip to Shangzhou requires us to keep my real identity a secret.

267
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,959
Our trip to Shangzhou requires us to keep my real identity a secret.

268
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:01,859
Since the rumors are wrong, just let her think what she wants to.

269
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,300
Since the rumors are wrong, just let her think what she wants to.

270
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,319
Since the rumors are wrong, just let her think what she wants to.

271
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:06,968
Yes, sir.

272
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,960
Why hasn't the disaster relief fund issued by the court arrived yet?

273
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,199
Why hasn't the disaster relief fund issued by the court arrived yet?

274
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,380
Yes, it's been so long.

275
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,820
Yes, it's been so long.

276
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,639
- Not even a shadow of it. 
 - I'm going to ask for directions.

277
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:23,080
Yes, indeed.

278
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,779
They're killing our chance to live.

279
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:26,880
Yes, how are we supposed to survive?

280
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,380
We can't survive like this.

281
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,360
Yes, what should we do?

282
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,340
- Here, this is for you. 
 - Thank you.

283
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,440
- Here. 
 - Thank you, kind person.

284
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,440
You're our savior. Thank you so much.

285
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,880
We have food now, we have food.

286
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,260
Thank you, kind person. Thank you.

287
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,220
Miss He, are you not feeling well?

288
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,880
- I just suddenly felt a little tired. 
 - Thank you, kind person.

289
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:57,819
Come.

290
00:15:57,819 --> 00:15:59,479
Young Master, I've got it.

291
00:15:59,479 --> 00:16:01,360
We're an hour away from Shangzhou.

292
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,420
If we hurry and make our way, we'll get there before nightfall.

293
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,340
If we hurry and make our way, we'll get there before nightfall.

294
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,799
- Thank you. 
 - Here, this is for you.

295
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,079
- Thank you. 
 - Don't choke.

296
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,840
We can rest here tonight and set off in the morning.

297
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,304
Thank you.

298
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:33,980
The relief silver was not washed away by the flood after all.

299
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,140
Someone interfered with it.

300
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,080
Once we arrive at Shangzhou, we should be able to investigate clearly.

301
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,440
Once we arrive at Shangzhou, we should be able to investigate clearly.

302
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,456
Young Master.

303
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:50,040
Young Master, the doctors in this town have mostly been called to Shangzhou.

304
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,500
Young Master, the doctors in this town have mostly been called to Shangzhou.

305
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,579
The few that are left are taking care of patients with severe illnesses.

306
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:54,979
The few that are left are taking care of patients with severe illnesses.

307
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,399
If she finds out that I am not her so-called "Young Lady," will she be upset?

308
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:15,320
If she finds out that I am not her so-called "Young Lady," will she be upset?

309
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,100
Who's there?

310
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,240
I smell Butterfly Orchid.

311
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,240
Are you there, Young Lady?

312
00:17:38,739 --> 00:17:41,059
I know why I felt uncomfortable.

313
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:42,600
Living rough for the past few days, my period is all mixed up.

314
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,359
Living rough for the past few days, my period is all mixed up.

315
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:46,459
I didn't prepare for anything.

316
00:17:48,499 --> 00:17:51,039
Do you have any menstrual materials?

317
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,700
Young Master.

318
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,200
Young Master.

319
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,540
Heshan.

320
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,000
Do you know where we can buy…

321
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,600
Buy what?

322
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,500
Nothing.

323
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:36,480
Did I bring two unworn undergarments?

324
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,039
Yes, Young Master.

325
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:39,880
Get them and ask the shopkeeper for some clean cotton.

326
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,220
Get them and ask the shopkeeper for some clean cotton.

327
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,179
If they don't, go outside and buy some new cotton clothes.

328
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:44,900
If they don't, go outside and buy some new cotton clothes.

329
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,920
Also, find a set of needles and thread.

330
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,720
Yes, Young Master.

331
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,799
Who should I give them to?

332
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,240
Me.

333
00:20:45,219 --> 00:20:46,719
After this town, it's Shangzhou.

334
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,160
After this town, it's Shangzhou.

335
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,200
Let's go our separate ways here.

336
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,200
Miss He, aren't you going to Shangzhou?

337
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,800
Yes.

338
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,700
But I'm not feeling really up to traveling.

339
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,140
But I'm not feeling really up to traveling.

340
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,219
I won't hold you back.

341
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:02,020
Sister, don't forget about the promise we made for the Qixi Festival.

342
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,759
Sister, don't forget about the promise we made for the Qixi Festival.

343
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,800
Also, the brown sugar water was very good.

344
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,859
Sister, you are so talented.

345
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:15,039
I've never used something so comfortable…

346
00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:19,500
Then, Miss He, we should bid farewell for now.

347
00:21:40,705 --> 00:21:42,689
[One month later]

348
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,000
It's not that I don't want to help you

349
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,800
but the Rong family's mansion is even harder to get into than our General's mansion.

350
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,460
There's a guard every three steps and a lookout every five. Besides…

351
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,180
- Take a look! 
 - What are you doing?

352
00:22:01,659 --> 00:22:03,780
Let's leave. Quickly.

353
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,460
How did we run into her today?

354
00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:08,640
Besides, after my investigation, Rong Yu's courtyard is deep within the Rong mansion, hidden like a treasure trove.

355
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,740
Besides, after my investigation, Rong Yu's courtyard is deep within the Rong mansion, hidden like a treasure trove.

356
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,360
Besides, after my investigation, Rong Yu's courtyard is deep within the Rong mansion, hidden like a treasure trove.

357
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,380
Besides, after my investigation, Rong Yu's courtyard is deep within the Rong mansion, hidden like a treasure trove.

358
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,400
Even if my martial arts skills are good, I couldn't break in and steal your marriage letter.

359
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,140
Even if my martial arts skills are good, I couldn't break in and steal your marriage letter.

360
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,120
If you can't get in his house, can you get him?

361
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,300
Just grab him and beat him up first.

362
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,900
You think I didn't think of that?

363
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,500
I would have if I could.

364
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,140
Miss He.

365
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,900
Has anyone been charging you protection fees lately?

366
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,139
There hasn't been anyone since you helped me.

367
00:22:32,139 --> 00:22:34,480
Here's some new tea for you.

368
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,560
- No need, no need. 
 - But…

369
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,000
We haven't finished what you gave us last time.

370
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,639
This is for your tea, thank you.

371
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:42,120
- But… 
 - Jiuling. Jiuling.

372
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,039
He paid me for a cup of tea.

373
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:46,740
Maybe I can disguise myself as a junior servant and sell myself into the Rong Mansion.

374
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,060
Maybe I can disguise myself as a junior servant and sell myself into the Rong Mansion.

375
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,700
I can lurk there for about a year or a couple of months.

376
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,040
This way, I should be able to get close to Rong Yu.

377
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,500
You're useless.

378
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,219
I'm willing to sell myself for you, yet you're still lecturing me.

379
00:22:55,219 --> 00:22:57,519
I'm willing to sell myself for you, yet you're still lecturing me.

380
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,760
Thank you for your bad idea.

381
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,559
I'm grateful, but no.

382
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,419
Miss He, you're here.

383
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,780
These fruits were picked this morning, very fresh.

384
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,840
These fruits were picked this morning, very fresh.

385
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,960
I'll pack some for you.

386
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,039
No need. Pay up.

387
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:16,579
- Boss, here. 
 - No, I can't accept it.

388
00:23:16,579 --> 00:23:18,256
Jiuling.

389
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:21,980
Jiuling, I've at least done one thing for you.

390
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,460
The bottle of medicine you asked me to add to Rong Yu’s rice in batches every day.

391
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,680
The bottle of medicine you asked me to add to Rong Yu’s rice in batches every day

392
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:29,012
I did it.

393
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,739
I couldn't get close to the kitchen, but I've been pouring the right amount into the trough in the backyard on time.

394
00:23:31,739 --> 00:23:34,299
I couldn't get close to the kitchen, but I've been pouring the right amount into the trough in the backyard on time.

395
00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:35,699
I'll poison those horses that Rong Yu uses to pull the cart.

396
00:23:35,699 --> 00:23:38,159
I'll poison those horses that Rong Yu uses to pull the cart.

397
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,519
How about that, am I cruel?

398
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,500
He San, from now on, we are strangers with the same parents.

399
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,039
He San, from now on, we are strangers with the same parents.

400
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:47,880
You don't know me, and I don't know you either.

401
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,080
Wait. I wasn't the one who set up your marriage.

402
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,360
Wait. I wasn't the one who set up your marriage.

403
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,080
Why are you mad at me?

404
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,239
Besides, this Rong Yu is unparalleled in wisdom and talent.

405
00:23:56,239 --> 00:23:58,059
His appearance tops all over the country.

406
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:00,440
I've been observing him these days, and…

407
00:24:03,459 --> 00:24:05,100
His wisdom is mediocre and he has a pale face.

408
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,419
His wisdom is mediocre and he has a pale face.

409
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:08,159
He doesn't deserve you at all.

410
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,900
That's right. The husband of He Jiuling must be someone who gallops across the battlefield

411
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,520
That's right. The husband of He Jiuling must be someone who gallops across the battlefield

412
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,600
and conquers the mountains and the sea.

413
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,960
and conquers the mountains and the sea.

414
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,419
He can't be a freeloader who only lives on the royal grain.

415
00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:18,732
Yes.

416
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,100
I will be breaking the marriage myself.

417
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,076
You can take a rest.

418
00:24:23,076 --> 00:24:26,980
I don't need to rest. Tell me your plan and I'll help.

419
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,232
A'Tan.

420
00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:35,828
Jiuling.

421
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,504
Let's go.

422
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:44,684
What do you think?

423
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,120
Well done.

424
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,040
The horse's coat of hair has indeed become much brighter.

425
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,400
The horse's coat of hair has indeed become much brighter.

426
00:24:51,739 --> 00:24:53,524
I'll ride it first.

427
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,052
Be careful.

428
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,939
Jiuling, why are you running away by yourself?

429
00:25:00,939 --> 00:25:04,219
He Jiuling, be careful.

430
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,500
- Excuse me. 
 - Coming.

431
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:41,452
Young Master.

432
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,200
Did she cause trouble again?

433
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,540
Did she cause trouble again?

434
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,380
Almost. Mr. He didn't come to the house to investigate, but Miss He came herself.

435
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,359
Almost. Mr. He didn't come to the house to investigate, but Miss He came herself.

436
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:53,659
Almost. Mr. He didn't come to the house to investigate, but Miss He came herself.

437
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,820
Heshan.

438
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,459
Go ahead.

439
00:26:08,459 --> 00:26:09,764
Yes.

440
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:54,800
I thought there was one post every three steps and one sentry every five steps.

441
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,120
I thought there was one post every three steps and one sentry every five steps.

442
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,760
He San, are you blind?

443
00:27:00,739 --> 00:27:03,140
How can I go down?

444
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:27,519
What's the meaning of this?

445
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,380
I should have asked Yu to pay Jiuling a visit when she left the mountain.

446
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,240
I should have asked Yu to pay Jiuling a visit when she left the mountain.

447
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,380
But as you know, the Astrology Festival is approaching,

448
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,799
But as you know, the Astrology Festival is approaching,

449
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,480
and there's no time for anything else.

450
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,000
I didn't have the time to mention the fact that Jiuling is back.

451
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,480
I didn't have the time to mention the fact that Jiuling is back.

452
00:28:01,459 --> 00:28:03,839
There's no rush at this moment.

453
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,860
Who is there?

454
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,488
Who is hiding there?

455
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,219
- Stop there. 
 - General He.

456
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,540
Where are you going?

457
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,824
General He.

458
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,576
Rong Yu.

459
00:28:54,219 --> 00:28:56,060
A little thief broke into your house, and I was just about to go after them.

460
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,900
A little thief broke into your house, and I was just about to go after them.

461
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,519
General He, you're a guest in our house.

462
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,100
We can't trouble you with such a minor matter.

463
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,680
Order someone to search the house carefully and you must catch the little thief.

464
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,088
Order someone to search the house carefully and you must catch the little thief.

465
00:29:07,088 --> 00:29:08,656
Yes.

466
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,140
You wish.

467
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,100
You want to catch me?

468
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,299
Well, you can try.

469
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:46,939
With your poor skills.

470
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,912
Ling'er, you're back.

471
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,500
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

472
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,239
- It's nothing, just hungry. 
 - Are you sure?

473
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:16,100
Don't always mess around with Qiuting outside.

474
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,979
This morning, Mr. Song came to complain to me that his nephew was at the brothel.

475
00:30:18,979 --> 00:30:21,500
This morning, Mr. Song came to complain to me that his nephew was at the brothel.

476
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,352
The brothel?

477
00:30:23,352 --> 00:30:25,499
What's wrong with the brothel?

478
00:30:25,499 --> 00:30:28,559
You scared him so badly that he doesn't dare to come out.

479
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:32,520
A few days ago, you dressed as a man and walked into the brothel interrupting a good show.

480
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,500
A few days ago, you dressed as a man and walked into the brothel interrupting a good show.

481
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,900
A few days ago, you dressed as a man and walked into the brothel interrupting a good show.

482
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,259
I should blame him for making me see that.

483
00:30:39,259 --> 00:30:40,620
Come on.

484
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,259
It's really strange.

485
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:44,479
This is not the first time you've messed with someone.

486
00:30:44,479 --> 00:30:45,580
But other than this Mr. Song, I wonder why no one else has comes here.

487
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,400
But other than this Mr. Song, I wonder why no one else has comes here.

488
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,200
It means they know they deserve it.

489
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:55,879
Isn't that true?

490
00:30:55,879 --> 00:30:58,320
All right. This matter is over.

491
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,260
This won't happen again.

492
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,560
This is a bunny bun made for you by your sister-in-law.

493
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,759
Try it.

494
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:10,920
Here.

495
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,200
I tried many times, and these are all I made.

496
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,980
I tried many times, and these are all I made.

497
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,119
I didn't even give them to your brother.

498
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,592
Are they cute?

499
00:31:21,592 --> 00:31:22,760
Sister-in-law, you always treat me as a child.

500
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,119
Sister-in-law, you always treat me as a child.

501
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:27,100
But this little rabbit is really cute.

502
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,719
I love it so much that I can't eat it.

503
00:31:29,719 --> 00:31:31,580
I want to keep it.

504
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:34,100
If you won't eat it, I will.

505
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,619
- It's delicious. 
 - I…

506
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,248
Dad.

507
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,704
- Dad. 
 -  Dad.

508
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:49,720
Dad, you're back.

509
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,300
We thought you were going to have a meal at the Rong Mansion.

510
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,980
The Rong Mansion is busy with the Astrology Festival tomorrow.

511
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,740
The Rong Mansion is busy with the Astrology Festival tomorrow.

512
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:01,059
I shouldn't disturb them for too long.

513
00:32:01,059 --> 00:32:02,940
Dad, I want to go.

514
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,439
What are you going to do?

515
00:32:04,439 --> 00:32:06,759
You don't believe in astrology.

516
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,480
What trouble are you going to make?

517
00:32:13,459 --> 00:32:15,899
- How could I? 
 - How could you?

518
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:17,379
You're my daughter.

519
00:32:17,379 --> 00:32:18,260
Once your eyes turn, I know what you're up to.

520
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,240
Once your eyes turn, I know what you're up to.

521
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,044
You're not allowed to go.

522
00:32:26,939 --> 00:32:28,480
By the way, I saw Rong Yu again today.

523
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,800
By the way, I saw Rong Yu again today.

524
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,560
I am more certain.

525
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,499
Such a good man is hard to find.

526
00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:37,720
So, Ling'er, your engagement with him is non-negotiable.

527
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,260
So, Ling'er, your engagement with him is non-negotiable.

528
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,319
I can't let you regret it in the future.

529
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:43,240
He brought it up today. I'm so mad at what happened.

530
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,279
He brought it up today. I'm so mad at what happened.

531
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,380
I don't care if he's the best young master or the young master of the Astrology Pavilion, I just don't like him.

532
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,059
I don't care if he's the best young master or the young master of the Astrology Pavilion, I just don't like him.

533
00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:55,039
I don't care if he's the best young master or the young master of the Astrology Pavilion, I just don't like him.

534
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,060
Stop your nonsense.

535
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,519
I'm not saying nonsense.

536
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,720
Ling'er, as a husband, Rong Yu is incomparable.

537
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,519
Ling'er, as a husband, Rong Yu is incomparable.

538
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:04,399
In terms of character or appearance, no one in the world can beat him.

539
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,499
In terms of character or appearance, no one in the world can beat him.

540
00:33:06,499 --> 00:33:09,619
If you miss him, you won't have another.

541
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,080
Other things, I can listen to you.

542
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,939
But this is not up for discussion.

543
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:21,600
- Ling'er! 
 - Jiuling.

544
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,159
I didn't say anything. How did she get angry?

545
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:25,259
I didn't say anything. How did she get angry?

546
00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:27,800
Zongming, order the kitchen to make a few dishes that she likes and send them to her room, quickly.

547
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,699
Zongming, order the kitchen to make a few dishes that she likes and send them to her room, quickly.

548
00:33:29,699 --> 00:33:31,799
Zongming, order the kitchen to make a few dishes that she likes and send them to her room, quickly.

549
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,100
In the future, at meal times, don't give her a lecture.

550
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,780
In the future, at meal times, don't give her a lecture.

551
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,972
Yes.

552
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,259
Also, you should keep a close eye on her, especially tomorrow.

553
00:33:50,259 --> 00:33:52,840
Also, you should keep a close eye on her, especially tomorrow.

554
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,599
Also, you should keep a close eye on her, especially tomorrow.

555
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:57,800
Don't let her make trouble at the Astrology Festival.

556
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,819
After the Astrology Festival, I will find Mr. Rong

557
00:33:59,819 --> 00:34:01,260
After the Astrology Festival, I will find Mr. Rong

558
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,480
and settle their marriage affairs as soon as possible to avoid further complications.

559
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,720
and settle their marriage affairs as soon as possible to avoid further complications.

560
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,448
Exactly.

561
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,580
But siblings should follow an order.

562
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,719
Her brothers should get married, too.

563
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:14,220
Fortunately, Qingxing is about to return to the capital from the north.

564
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:16,060
Fortunately, Qingxing is about to return to the capital from the north.

565
00:34:16,979 --> 00:34:18,900
I will find a suitable family for Qiuting and him to get the marriage done.

566
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,420
I will find a suitable family for Qiuting and him to get the marriage done.

567
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:24,519
Qingxing isn't likely to object.

568
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:26,119
I object.

569
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:29,000
Objection denied. Eat.

570
00:34:29,439 --> 00:34:30,940
Dad, just because you want Jiuling to get married as soon as possible, you can't treat me so casually.

571
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,220
Dad, just because you want Jiuling to get married as soon as possible, you can't treat me so casually.

572
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,800
Dad, just because you want Jiuling to get married as soon as possible, you can't treat me so casually.

573
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,100
Come on, serve me some soup.

574
00:34:36,979 --> 00:34:39,540
Dad, I'm talking to you.

575
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,759
Look at me.

576
00:34:42,192 --> 00:34:44,320
[He Residence]

577
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:12,980
😚Timing and subtitles brought to you by Seductive Mischievus Team @ Viki.com😉

578
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,139
Come back. Come back.

579
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,240
It wasn't easy for me to get this admission pass from my brothers.

580
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,559
When brothers and sisters work together, their power is invincible.

581
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:28,640
When brothers and sisters work together, their power is invincible.

582
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,859
Letting you out this time will get me a good beating.

583
00:35:30,859 --> 00:35:33,639
Letting you out this time will get me a good beating.

584
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,520
Just wait and see, I will turn the Astrology Festival upside down

585
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,780
Just wait and see, I will turn the Astrology Festival upside down

586
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,960
so that the Rong family begs to break off the engagement.

587
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,179
Otherwise, I won't come home.

588
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:44,950
Be careful.

589
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:47,880
