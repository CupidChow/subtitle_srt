<i>[Episode 19]</i>

3
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,099
Jiuling!

4
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:30,144
Miss!

5
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,779
Miss!

6
00:02:31,779 --> 00:02:33,039
Jiuling!

7
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,919
- Miss!
- Jiuling!

8
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,400
Where might she go?

9
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,800
You go over there. I'll search this way.

10
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,120
Alright.

11
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,479
Jiuling!

12
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,740
Miss!

13
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,960
Jiuling!

14
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,136
Father,

15
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,280
I failed you.

16
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:12,000
I actually mistook an enemy for my family.

17
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,400
I won't do it again.

18
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,599
Wait for me a little longer.

19
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,080
When Jialin becomes

20
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,039
peaceful and stable again,

21
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,639
I will come and join you.

22
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,488
You're back.

23
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,280
Why are you alone?

24
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,620
What?

25
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,280
D-Don't mention this to my young master yet.

26
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,464
I'll search with you again.

27
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,500
Father, you braved the heavy rain this morning

28
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,099
to get a safety charm for me.

29
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:11,380
Things will definitely go well.

30
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,520
Father, don't worry.

31
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,080
Don't forget

32
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,760
that never act like a spoiled kid.

33
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,960
And

34
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,079
Consider the Emperor first
in everything in the future.

35
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,040
I know that, of course.

36
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,240
I have confidence in

37
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,399
winning the Emperor's favor.

38
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,720
Father, Sister.

39
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,600
We have said enough goodbyes.

40
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,740
It's almost noon.

41
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,420
Should we hurry on?

42
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,520
Are you in such a hurry
to send your sister away?

43
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,640
Isn't this because you are in a hurry
to become the queen?

44
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,696
I...

45
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:48,560
The grace of a princess!
The grace of a princess!

46
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,519
My lord, the young madam is back!

<i>[Rong's Mansion]</i>

You!

50
00:05:37,664 --> 00:05:38,752
My lord.

51
00:05:38,752 --> 00:05:39,920
He Jiuling,

52
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,632
you've really gone too far.

53
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,800
Not only that you didn't come back
for the whole night,

54
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,080
but also Yu is missing because of you.

55
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,320
You are the calamity of the Rong's family,

56
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,568
the calamity of Rong Yu.

57
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,040
Calamity?

58
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,579
What are you all standing around for?

59
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:07,000
Everyone get out and search.

60
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,880
Don't return if you can't find him.

61
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,600
E-Everyone out and search.

62
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,460
Miss, shall I get you something to eat?

63
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,959
I'm tired. Just leave me alone.

64
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,759
What about the young master?

65
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,360
How does he have anything to do with me?

66
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:53,000
Boss, we don't need other things.

67
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,740
We just want to use the stove and the table.

68
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,744
Okay.

69
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,288
Princess.

70
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,224
Take a rest first.

71
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:30,960
We've been on the road all day.

72
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,220
The dishes will be served soon.

73
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,000
The taste is not bad here.

74
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,319
Princess, try this.

75
00:07:46,176 --> 00:07:47,264
Boss,

76
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,080
have you seen a lady?

77
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,119
She's about this tall

78
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:51,120
and walked this way.

79
00:07:52,448 --> 00:07:53,568
No.

80
00:07:54,624 --> 00:07:55,648
Thank you.

81
00:08:32,515 --> 00:08:35,954
<i>[Princess of Chu County of Jialin]</i>

82
00:08:37,056 --> 00:08:38,600
Sir, have some tea.

83
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,080
Do you have anything to eat?

84
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,104
Yes.

85
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,519
Master, see if you like this.

86
00:09:04,864 --> 00:09:05,919
Feel free to choose.

87
00:09:18,272 --> 00:09:19,340
Master,

88
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,519
do you think it's too troublesome
to drink tea like this?

89
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,919
Why not take off the hat?

90
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:31,320
Master.

91
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,759
- Why don't you help me up?
- Princess.

92
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,640
- Princess.
- Why didn't you hurry to help me

93
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,039
when you saw me fall?

94
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,128
Are you okay?

95
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,840
Boss, a bun, please.

96
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,928
Okay.

97
00:09:55,744 --> 00:09:56,768
Here you go.

98
00:09:58,688 --> 00:09:59,699
Thank you.

99
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,360
Thank you, master.

100
00:10:04,288 --> 00:10:05,320
Master,

101
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,480
I am not angry

102
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,240
about what you did just now.

103
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,000
I won't punish you or kill you.

104
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,080
Don't be afraid.

105
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,380
Where are you going?

106
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,300
Are you going to walk there? Isn't it tiring?

107
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,040
Why not let me give you a ride?

108
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,864
Or let me see what you look like?

109
00:10:20,864 --> 00:10:21,888
Don't follow me.

110
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:26,959
Who wants to follow you?

111
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,779
There are so many men who want to follow me.

112
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:31,600
Don't push your luck.

113
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,799
You're really leaving?

114
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,720
Stop! Come back!

115
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,360
Why did you get into my carriage?

116
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,960
What are you doing here?

117
00:10:56,768 --> 00:10:57,840
Miss,

118
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,039
have you seen a very good-looking young man

119
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:01,159
when you were on the road?

120
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:04,559
Very good-looking?

121
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:07,240
How handsome is he?

122
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,000
If you don't say how handsome he is,

123
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,440
how do I know

124
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,639
if I have seen him?

125
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,080
You can rarely see a man

126
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,519
as handsome as he is in the world.

127
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,080
Do you think your young master is a peacock?

128
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:22,720
I can barely see a man
as handsome as him in the world?

129
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,240
I've never seen him.

130
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,519
You should look for it on your own.

131
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,639
Prince. Uh.

132
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,660
<i>Look, how insincere he is.</i>

133
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,980
<i>He said he doesn't want me to follow him,</i>

134
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,840
<i>yet he got into the carriage himself.</i>

135
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,200
<i>Are all men in the capital so domineering?</i>

136
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,000
<i>I don't need to choose any more.</i>

137
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,760
<i>A domineering and indifferent handsome man
like him</i>

138
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,919
<i>is all I want.</i>

139
00:11:58,624 --> 00:11:59,712
Master.

140
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:05,000
<i>Why are you playacting?</i>

141
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,920
<i>Do you like withdrawing
when you are chased after</i>

142
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,600
<i>but chasing after her when a lady withdrew?</i>

143
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:12,840
Sorry. Sorry.

144
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,540
Now that we are on the carriage,

145
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,616
just stay here.

146
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,160
It's rather inconvenient to get anywhere

147
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,960
in this desolate place, isn't it?

148
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,000
Those people just now came asking for you.

149
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,540
I kept my mouth shut tight.

150
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,200
I didn't tell them at all.

151
00:12:29,088 --> 00:12:30,208
Thank you.

152
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,539
Don't mention it.

153
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:34,240
Then you may just follow me.

154
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,420
Take me out of this forest.

155
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,080
This is for you.

156
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,740
<i>Actually,</i>

157
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,000
<i>there would come a day</i>

158
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,840
<i>when a man apart from Father gives me money.</i>

159
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,120
<i>And</i>

160
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,260
<i>it's such a cute bunny!</i>

161
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,480
Is it not enough?

162
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,519
Enough. Enough.

163
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,200
Why did they want to find you?

164
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,759
Did you run away from home?

165
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,560
I'm out seeking my wife.

166
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,900
I'd rather not have anyone following me.

167
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,719
You're seeking your wife?

168
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:10,200
I didn't see

169
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,559
you're pretty good at flirting.

170
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,779
You're such a sweet talker.

171
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:14,800
What a coincidence.

172
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,960
I also left home
to look for someone in the capital.

173
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,140
I am looking for a husband

174
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,519
I'm in love with.

175
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,320
<i>Is this the so-called love at first sight
that Father told me about?</i>

176
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,940
<i>Nice voice.</i>

177
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,300
<i>A nice figure too.</i>

178
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,799
<i>And he even gives me money.</i>

179
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,360
<i>Other than not knowing
if he's really good-looking,</i>

180
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,879
<i>he doesn't seem to have any defects.</i>

181
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,559
<i>He's really good looking.</i>

182
00:14:06,624 --> 00:14:07,680
Master.

183
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:09,719
Look at me.

184
00:14:09,719 --> 00:14:11,679
Do I resemble your wife?

185
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,600
Do I?

186
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,840
Miss, respect yourself.

187
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,000
<i>Playact again.</i>

188
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,240
I am quite self-dignified.

189
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,720
That's exactly
why I asked if I resemble your wife.

190
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,060
I'm just joking with you.

191
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,679
Why are you mad though?

192
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,000
Why are you not leaving yet?
Waiting for it to get dark?

193
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:37,320
A bunch of lazy ones.

194
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,399
Master, where are you going?

195
00:14:47,328 --> 00:14:48,600
Leaving the city.

196
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,840
L-Leaving the city?

197
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,280
Turn the cart around.

198
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,279
Why didn't you ask?

199
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:55,960
A bunch of fools.

200
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,480
Master,

201
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,060
this is the first time we met.

202
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,219
Since we are on the same carriage,

203
00:15:14,219 --> 00:15:16,900
how about we get to know each other first?

204
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,048
No need.

205
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,440
In that case.

206
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,940
Let me introduce myself first.

207
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,072
Not necessary.

208
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,679
<i>Man, you've successfully caught my attention.</i>

209
00:15:50,912 --> 00:15:52,360
Miss, eat something.

210
00:15:58,112 --> 00:15:59,168
Miss.

211
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,000
You don't need to worry about me.

212
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:04,159
I'm not hungry.

213
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,519
Has Zhanping returned?

214
00:16:23,456 --> 00:16:24,512
No, he has not.

215
00:16:32,096 --> 00:16:33,184
Get the horse ready.

216
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,180
Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.

217
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,240
Come over here.

218
00:16:37,312 --> 00:16:38,368
Move this away.

219
00:16:38,368 --> 00:16:39,392
Yes.

220
00:16:39,392 --> 00:16:40,460
Put it here.

221
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,536
Yes.

222
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,600
Sir.

223
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,580
Boss,

224
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,360
is there a young lady checking in your inn?

225
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,320
A young lady? No.

226
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,159
Thank you.

227
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,720
This way, please.

228
00:16:57,376 --> 00:16:58,380
Please.

229
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,279
Boss, bring me something expensive to eat.

230
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,120
This is for you.

231
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,168
Okay.

232
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:11,200
Put the snacks there. Hurry.

233
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:18,060
These are homemade.

234
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,319
They are as good as those in the capital.

235
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,079
And they taste differently good.

236
00:17:25,408 --> 00:17:26,496
I don't like sweets.

237
00:17:29,024 --> 00:17:30,144
Take them away.

238
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,120
Prepare some salty dishes for me tonight

239
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,296
to take on the road.

240
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,960
How can someone look so good eating a bun?

241
00:17:50,368 --> 00:17:51,424
Master.

242
00:17:52,224 --> 00:17:53,344
Master.

243
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,680
Look at me.

244
00:17:56,928 --> 00:17:58,048
Aren't I pretty?

245
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:12,359
Master.

246
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:17,480
How could I fall into the same trap twice?

247
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:21,376
You!

248
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,240
<i>His nature is so good.</i>

249
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,119
<i>How could there be such a kind and gentle man
in the world?</i>

250
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,519
Where is he?

251
00:20:53,888 --> 00:20:56,241
<i>♫ Drinking a cup of melancholy ♫</i>

252
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,793
<i>♫ In which love is brewed into pain ♫</i>

253
00:21:01,088 --> 00:21:03,776
<i>♫ Unable to wait for the dark night ♫</i>

254
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,272
<i>♫ With a flickering candlelight ♫</i>

255
00:21:08,448 --> 00:21:10,784
<i>♫ Drinking a cup of vicissitude ♫</i>

256
00:21:12,018 --> 00:21:14,592

257

<i>♫ Hearing you are somewhere across the water ♫</i>

258
00:21:18,848 --> 00:21:21,600

<i>♫ Drink the ups and downs on the journey ♫</i>

260
00:21:25,749 --> 00:21:28,832
<i>♫ Sigh at the wastefulness of life ♫</i>

<i>♫ I can't get over you

266
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,540
<i>Now, you are neither
the Best Young Master in Jialin,</i>

267
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,720
<i>nor the young master of Astrology Pavilion.</i>

268
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,380
<i>You are just Rong Yu.</i>

269
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,880
<i>I just want you to be happy.</i>

270
00:22:02,336 --> 00:22:04,759
<i>♫ With a flickering candlelight ♫</i>

271
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:06,599
<i>I just wanted to make you happier.</i>

00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,459
<i>Then every year on your birthday,</i>

273
00:22:09,459 --> 00:22:11,640
<i>I will accompany my little rabbit lady.</i>

274
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:17,088
<i>♫ Hearing you are somewhere across the water ♫</i>

275
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,776

<i>♫ I can't get over you

279
00:22:42,848 --> 00:22:44,000
It's time to rest.

280
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:48,256
Tomorrow

281
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,759
I will take you back

282
00:22:52,448 --> 00:22:53,600
to Rong's mansion.

283
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,799
Why didn't you go back before?

284
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,380
Wasn't it agreed to come back earlier

285
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,160
and move to the courtyard?

286
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,960
No need for that.

287
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,192
Are you crying?

288
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:27,520
No.

289
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,640
But you are about to cry.

290
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,319
I really don't want to cry.

291
00:23:59,392 --> 00:24:00,440
Don't cry anymore.

292
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,279
What exactly happened?

293
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,992
Tell me.

294
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,940
Nothing happened.

295
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,359
I just got lost.

296
00:24:15,744 --> 00:24:16,839
Lost?

297
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,839
For a moment

298
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,500
I found that I did not recognize

299
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,119
the people around me.

300
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,279
I don't know

301
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,279
the roads around me either.

302
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:37,559
I don't know where to go.

303
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,279
I don't know what to do.

304
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,839
I only know I can't go back anymore.

305
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:49,920
I've lost myself.

306
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,168
Don't worry.

307
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,939
As long as I'm alive,

308
00:24:56,939 --> 00:24:58,400
I won't let you get lost.

309
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,420
Whatever happens to you,

310
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,000
no matter where you are,

311
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,920
I will find you

312
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,839
and then take you back home.

313
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,824
Home?

314
00:25:12,736 --> 00:25:13,760
Yes, home.

315
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:18,000
Do I have a home?

316
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:22,960
Everyone is guilty.

317
00:25:23,936 --> 00:25:25,759
Only you are innocent.

318
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:30,480
But I can't be your family anymore.

319
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,000
There will be no home for me anymore.

320
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,079
It's all my fault.

321
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,720
I didn't protect you.

322
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:06,240
I didn't protect the He family.

323
00:26:08,384 --> 00:26:09,472
From now on,

324
00:26:11,296 --> 00:26:13,319
I won't let others hurt you.

325
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,960
<i>It's okay whoever hurts me,</i>

326
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,720
<i>but why does it have to be the Rong family?</i>

327
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,519
<i>I've tasted the pain of being alone</i>

328
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,359
<i>with all those who loved me</i>

329
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,519
<i>leaving me.</i>

330
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:51,659
<i>But still, in the future,
I have to make you by my own hands</i>

331
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:53,559
<i>a person like me.</i>

332
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,640
<i>Rong Yu,</i>

333
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,440
<i>what should I do?</i>

334
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:03,079
<i>How could I not cry?</i>

335
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,559
Don't cry.

336
00:27:37,696 --> 00:27:38,752
<i>Rong Yu,</i>

337
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,400
<i>the person I least want to hurt is you.</i>

338
00:27:44,064 --> 00:27:45,248
<i>However...</i>

339
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,319
The young master and young madam are back.

340
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:58,640
Go to notify the lord quickly.

341
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,199
The young master is back.

342
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:02,240
Go to notify the lord quickly.

343
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:11,424
Young master.

344
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:19,279
He's fine,

345
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,319
It's good that he's fine. It's good.

346
00:28:24,992 --> 00:28:26,080
Besides,

347
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,559
he can play the zither now.

348
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:34,000
Actually,

349
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,560
he can actually play the zither.

350
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,680
That's great.

351
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,119
Young master will definitely recover soon.

352
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:43,839
Zhanping, go prepare some food,

353
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,200
No need.

354
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,559
I want to go to the pharmacy.

355
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,559
How could there be such a perfect man?

356
00:29:14,944 --> 00:29:16,079
Princess.

357
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:20,679
Hurry. What did you find?

358
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:21,820
It's been found out

359
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,860
the young man you encountered that day

360
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,960
is the young master of the Astrology Pavilion.

361
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,200
No wonder.

362
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,020
I told you

363
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,920
a man so perfect like him
could not be an ordinary person.

364
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:35,232
He was looking up at the stars that day.

365
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:36,320
Yes, but...

366
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,119
the young master of the Astrology Pavilion...

367
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,740
Young master?

368
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,888
So it means

369
00:29:41,888 --> 00:29:43,979
I might become the madam.

370
00:29:43,979 --> 00:29:45,040
Princess, but he's...

371
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,300
My future child

372
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,159
can not only inherit my territory

373
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,880
and my property,

374
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,808
but also inherit the Astrology Pavilion.

375
00:29:51,808 --> 00:29:52,980
Princess, but he's...

376
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,080
Prepare gifts for the Astrology Pavilion.

377
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,599
No.

378
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:58,480
Send gifts to every lord in the capital.

379
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,160
I want them to know

380
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:03,040
I has come to the capital to choose a husband,

381
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,359
not just for fun.

382
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:07,340
The future wife of the young master

383
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,000
is rich

384
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,199
and noble.

385
00:30:11,199 --> 00:30:13,200
Whoever wants to compete with me for him

386
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:15,559
should give up early.

387
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:17,040
Yes, princess. But he is...

388
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,160
Why are you still standing there talking?

389
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,200
Hurry up.

390
00:30:20,032 --> 00:30:21,100
Go now.

391
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,119
Yes.

392
00:30:37,216 --> 00:30:38,480
Princess. Princess.

393
00:30:45,568 --> 00:30:46,640
She comes from the south of the Yangtze River.

394
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,799
Her territory is the richest
in the whole Jialin.

395
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,120
She's the only daughter of Prince Run.

396
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,580
All of the property

397
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,880
will all belong to her.

398
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,620
Anyone who marries her

399
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,820
will attain the highest level in one step.

400
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,120
Right. Right. Right.

401
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,300
Have you received the gifts she sent yesterday?

402
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,720
- Yes.
- Of course.

403
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,860
My annual official salary as a sesame official

404
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,352
is no more than a small gift from her.

405
00:31:16,352 --> 00:31:17,600
That's true.

406
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,920
It's true.

407
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:24,199
I know the Empress Dowager and the princess
have been worshipping Buddha in these years.

408
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:25,840
Before I came to the capital,

409
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,719
I specifically sent people
to get this from the temple.

410
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,680
This one was blessed by Master Yuanhui.

411
00:31:33,056 --> 00:31:34,120
So was this one.

412
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,279
Thank you, sister.

413
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,279
Chuchu,

414
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,319
you're thoughtful.

415
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:42,800
You should just come.

416
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,440
Why did you bring so many things?

417
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,160
I, as an elder,

418
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,920
should be the one preparing gifts for you.

419
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,220
Now,

420
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,539
it's the other way around.

421
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:53,759
Don't say that. I have everything I need.

422
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,559
If you really want to

423
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,319
give me something,

424
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:04,559
please find a good husband for me.

425
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,399
I have received the letter.

426
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,839
I understand your father's intentions.

427
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,300
I will have to choose carefully for you.

428
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,360
No need.

429
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,079
I have someone in mind already.

430
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:23,880
Didn't you just arrive in the capital?

431
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,568
Have you already set eyes on someone?

432
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,680
It can be said that it is a heaven-sent match.

433
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,759
It seems you have already met him.

434
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,640
Which man are you referring to?

435
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,000
I-It's...

436
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:47,600
Rong Yu from the Astrology Pavilion.

437
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,680
Rong Yu?

438
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:50,839
After all the trials and tribulations,

439
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,820
it turns out to be Rong Jiang.

440
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,439
I thought Father was foolish

441
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:56,519
for favoring the Astrology Pavilion.

442
00:32:57,536 --> 00:32:58,592
I never

443
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,480
expected this.

444
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,359
If Rong jiang really can foresee,

445
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,400
it will be very tricky.

446
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:09,400
No wonder it was impossible
to take him down before.

447
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:11,559
I thought I was too weak.

448
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,260
Even fortune

449
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,079
is not on my side now?

450
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,240
No need to think like this.

451
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,359
I have a plan.

452
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:29,856
Destroy the star chart.

453
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,008
Star chart?

454
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,920
Rong Jiang once said,

455
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:35,319
one can seize the initiative

456
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:37,640
by using the star chart for prediction.

457
00:33:38,432 --> 00:33:39,480
You should know

458
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:41,440
doing so will hurt Rong Yu.

459
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,480
I know.

460
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,160
But it is necessary.

461
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,119
No matter it's for the blood feud

462
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,599
or the fate of the country,

463
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:55,160
Rong Jiang and the Astrology Pavilion

464
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,319
must be removed.

465
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,119
I thought of thousands of ways.

466
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,240
But no matter which one I take,

467
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,079
I will definitely hurt him.

468
00:34:07,008 --> 00:34:08,440
I have no other choice.

469
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,360
He Jiuling, you...

470
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:14,639
Before taking action,

471
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,079
give me some time, please.

472
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,480
Let me do something for him.

473
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,719
Even if my debts to him

474
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,000
are never paid off,

475
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,239
I only want to atone for my sins
to the best of my ability.

476
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:34,432
He said he went to find his wife.
It turns out he did have a wife.

477
00:34:34,432 --> 00:34:35,619
In fact, the young master...

478
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:37,040
In fact, it is not normal

479
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,159
if he doesn't have a wife, is it?

480
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,576
It's my fault.

481
00:34:40,576 --> 00:34:42,099
If I could come to the capital earlier,

482
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:43,239
would any other woman marry him?

483
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,144
It's Father who won't let me go.

484
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,168
Princess.

485
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,700
Princess what? Why are you talking so much?

486
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,000
Be careful of your tongue being cut.

487
00:34:53,248 --> 00:34:54,272
Yes.

488
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,519
I am a princess.

489
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,280
I am a dignified princess of Jialin.

490
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,079
He has a wife, so what?

491
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:04,719
Who can compete with me?

492
00:36:05,888 --> 00:36:07,072
Yu.

493
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,864
Uncle.

494
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:16,280
I heard that you can play the zither now.

495
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,919
If you can remember how to observe the stars,

496
00:36:19,919 --> 00:36:20,920
that would be even better.

497
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,240
It will help
if you visit the star chart frequently.

498
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,920
I will ask the Imperial Physician to come
in a few days.

499
00:36:34,144 --> 00:36:35,200
Yu,

500
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,472
you have lost weight.

501
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:40,768
How did you lose so much weight

502
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:43,159
after hunting?

503
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,399
How did He Jiuling take care of you?

504
00:36:46,399 --> 00:36:48,020
She can't even handle such a small thing.

505
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,320
She takes care of me very well.

506
00:36:57,559 --> 00:36:59,159
Why are you looking at me like this?

507
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:02,719
You should take good care of yourself, uncle.

508
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:04,719
Don't always worry about me

509
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,840
and the Astrology Pavilion.

510
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:08,920
Both He Jiuling and you

511
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:11,440
are very important to me.

512
00:37:17,715 --> 00:37:22,406
<i>♫ Under the setting sun in dusk ♫</i>

00:37:24,627 --> 00:37:30,426
