[The Inextricable Destiny]

2
00:01:31,495 --> 00:01:34,421
[Episode 15]

3
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,592
Your brother sacrificed himself
to entrust you to Rong Yu.

4
00:01:38,592 --> 00:01:41,040
They want you to live a normal life.

5
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,680
If I were your family,

6
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,719
I wouldn't want you to wade into this again.

7
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,519
If you decide to refuse,

8
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,560
I will understand.

9
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,239
Indeed, I bear a burden.

10
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,879
My only burden is

11
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,719
why Your Majesty entrust this

12
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,920
to a common woman like me.

13
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,260
Because you belong to the He family.

14
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,344
I've verified that

15
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,220
the letter convicting the He family

16
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,439
was forged by Lord Zhongyong.

17
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,719
Those who wouldn't betray Jialin

18
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,319
would certainly be the He family.

19
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,479
Only Your Majesty

20
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,360
know

21
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,719
our loyalty.

22
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,879
I'll make sure everyone sees it

23
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,599
one day.

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,240
I never let go of the desire to avenge
for my family.

25
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,439
Just now, Your Majesty also said

26
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,960
I am from the He family.

27
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,640
Since my father and brothers have passed away,

28
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,560
the responsibility to cleanse the loyal court

29
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:53,120
and protect the country and Your Majesty

30
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,599
falls upon me.

31
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,159
A deposed Emperor.

32
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,439
A female general.

33
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,239
We are compelled by circumstances.
With arduous paths ahead,

34
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,400
I don't know

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,280
how far we can walk together.

36
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,639
I will

37
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,520
do my utmost.

38
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,120
I have nothing to offer you,

39
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,180
but only one hundred secret guards
Father left for me.

40
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,680
You can dispatch them at will.

41
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,919
Some hid in the palace,

42
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,080
others outside of it.

43
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,840
No one knows of their existence.

44
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,940
- All, listen.
- Yes.

45
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,008
From now on,

46
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,960
the one by my side

47
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,800
will be your new master.

48
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,879
Her words

49
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,919
are my words.

50
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,720
- Understood.
- Spread out to investigate.

51
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,759
Yes.

52
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,460
It was you that killed your father

53
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,400
and brothers.

54
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,319
We did not collude with the enemy.

55
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,759
I didn't collude with Xunnan, either.

56
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,160
Xunnan?

57
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,439
I don't know about Xunnan.

58
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,980
Rather than seeking revenge on me,

59
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,700
you'd be better off ending your own life.

60
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,439
You are the real culprit.

61
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,560
It's you who brought about the death of

62
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,839
- your entire family!
- Shut your mouth.

63
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,680
Jiuling,

64
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,279
it's so nice to see you.

65
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,328
What?

66
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,620
Every time when I miss you,

67
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,720
you will appear.

68
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,759
So nice.

69
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,480
Yes.

70
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:43,319
Every time

71
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:46,040
you will appear when I am sad.

72
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,780
No.

73
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,360
I don't mean sad.

74
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,399
I mean, I miss you.

75
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,220
it's getting dark.

76
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,040
Why did you come here?

77
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,720
I bought some pastries for you.

78
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,659
What about you?

79
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:15,399
Why are you here alone so late?

80
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,060
I had the young lord take me out of the palace
to buy this.

81
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,480
You like it.

82
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,820
You've learned to do things on your own.

83
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,759
Why didn't you have them sent to your house?

84
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,660
What if you got lost?

85
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,960
How would you find home?

86
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,699
I won't. I remember the way to the shop

87
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,040
and the way to the Astrology Pavilion.

88
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,800
and the way to pick you up home.

89
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,960
You see, haven't I

90
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,439
picked you up for home?

91
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,920
Let's go home.

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,299
Your Highness.

93
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:11,839
We've rushed for several days and nights
to get here.

94
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,540
You've been staying outside
for almost six hours.

95
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,879
The night wind is cold.

96
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,640
Please take care of yourself.

97
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,439
Let's find an inn to rest first.

98
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,540
The books and the pens are all here.

99
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,379
The little turtles folded by the children

100
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:10,600
for you last time after school

101
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,839
are also here.

102
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,112
Everything's prepared.

103
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,220
It's a festive season.

104
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,279
Many shops outside are closed.

105
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,680
Why do you still have to attend classes
in Astrology Pavilion?

106
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,500
It's not a class.

107
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,560
It's just that the teacher gathered

108
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,300
the little disciples with no home to return

109
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,039
together to study the characters
they learned before.

110
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:29,340
Actually,

111
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,920
it's up to young master whether to go or not.

112
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,800
Then, Rong Yu, let's not go

113
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,120
to the Astrology Pavilion today.

114
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,159
Last night,

115
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,659
the wind blew all night.

116
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:39,260
It's still very gloomy now.

117
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,120
It's probably going to rain.

118
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,140
Right, young master. You can barely remember

119
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,459
anything from class.

120
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:46,759
We might as well stay at home.

121
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:52,000
No, we need to go.

122
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,440
Young master, you've changed.
You don't take advice anymore.

123
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,300
I want to work harder

124
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,859
and to understand more things.

125
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:02,599
So that I can protect you in the future.

126
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:03,620
Jiuling,

127
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,200
it's not only cold outside,
it's also dangerous.

128
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:08,600
You know it's dangerous, huh?

129
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,559
Well then, I'll take you
to the Astrology Pavilion today.

130
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,360
Let's go.

131
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:20,799
- You can leave now.
- Yes.

132
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,520
Yu,

133
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,600
are you going to the Astrology Pavilion?

134
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:29,000
There are classes today.

135
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,620
Zhanping, be careful
and stay close to the young master.

136
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,600
The capital city has been unstable recently.

137
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,480
Yes.

138
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,039
Yu, you can go ahead.

139
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,000
I need to speak with He Jiuling.

140
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,960
You can wait for me in the carriage.

141
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,200
Today, I will take you
to the Astrology Pavilion.

142
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,104
You are now

143
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:45,979
more persuasive than me.

144
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,720
I have taken care of him for so many years.

145
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:51,240
You flatter me.

146
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,360
There's nothing to be flattered of.

147
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,460
No matter in the past or the present,

148
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,200
whether he understands or not,

149
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,959
Yu has always

150
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,559
been sincere to you.

151
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,000
This is really ironic.

152
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,159
My lord.

153
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:08,360
Yesterday,

154
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,599
after you left the palace,

155
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:11,200
you didn't return until late at night.

156
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,080
Where did you go?

157
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:17,840
Do I have to say?

158
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:21,824
Could it be that

159
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:25,780
- there is something unmentionable?
- No.

160
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,000
Since there isn't,

161
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,860
why did you send back the carriage
that was supposed to take you,

162
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,200
and dismiss your attendants to return home?

163
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,600
You stayed out alone.

164
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,600
In this capital city,

165
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,780
where and what

166
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,679
could make you stay out until late night?

167
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,039
I went to see my father.

168
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,760
Since on the Eve of minor Chinese New Year,

169
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,600
I am alone at home anyway.

170
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,940
I might as well go to visit my father,

171
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,919
my older brothers and sister-in-laws,

172
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,159
and spend the festival with them.

173
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,159
Is this too much?

174
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,960
There is no need for you to go alone though.

175
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,620
I know you don't like my family,

176
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,520
so I didn't want to let the people in the house

177
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,679
know where I was going.

178
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,260
And since it was supposed

179
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,720
to be an evening of reunion,

180
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,360
why let everyone go to the cemetery with me

181
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,840
and bring bad luck back home?

182
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,559
So I just let them all go back first.

183
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:30,080
If you think
my words and deeds are inappropriate,

184
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,399
it won't happen again next time.

185
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,328
You can go now.

186
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,480
Yu has been waiting for you for a long time.

00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:05,399
- Is it cold?
- No, it's not.

189
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,960
It's so cool.

190
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,960
Just now you've been in the carriage?

191
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,159
If you lie to me,

192
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,200
I won't talk to you anymore.

193
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:54,919
Just kidding.

194
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:04,300
Do you know what is danger

195
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,480
that you mentioned earlier?

196
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:09,519
It's like you falling into the lake last time.

197
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,260
I don't know why you fell into the lake
to catch fish last time.

198
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,919
Who on earth told you that nonsense?

199
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,880
In the future, no matter what others say,

200
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,120
you must not listen.

201
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,352
Did you get it?

202
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,240
Then tell me.

203
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,679
Who are others?

204
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:41,100
Except for Lord Rong,

205
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,440
Zhanping,

206
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,720
and Heshan,

207
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,240
other people are considered as others.

208
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,519
How about you?

209
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,919
As for me,

210
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:52,960
you should not listen to me either.

211
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,919
Actually

212
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,399
I am a liar.

213
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:06,799
Just like I lied just now.

214
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:09,719
In the future,

215
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:12,080
I am going to tell you a lot and a lot of lies.

216
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,039
You are not others.

217
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,200
You're not like

218
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,159
Uncle, either.

219
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:29,639
What's the difference?

220
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,000
The

221
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:38,080
d-difference

222
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:42,420
is

223
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,279
that you are mine.

224
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,600
Rong Yu, who did you learn that from?

225
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,620
Tell me, did you learn it
when you were in the Astrology Pavilion?

226
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,480
Did you eavesdrop on others reading a novel?

227
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,740
If

228
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,560
your facial expression
just now could be a little angrier

229
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,720
and a little meaner,

230
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,960
it might not be so funny.

231
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:06,120
I won't be angry with you.

232
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,799
Nor will I be mean to you.

233
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,919
I'm also yours.

234
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,800
I'm yours.

235
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,600
So in the future, I will only listen to you.

236
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
Okay?

237
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,679
Young master, we've arrived.

238
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,600
Young madam.

239
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:58,600
Young madam, why is your face so red?

240
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,960
It may be because it's a little stuffy
in the carriage.

241
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,639
Is it stuffy in this weather?

242
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:09,680
My face is frozen from being outside.

243
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,580
Well, then why don't you go in quickly.

244
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,219
I can walk back on my own.

245
00:17:15,219 --> 00:17:17,020
I can also wander around a little

246
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,039
and meet my good friend, Wu Ritan.

247
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,759
It's raining. It's raining.

248
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,728
Hurry up!

249
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,319
It's raining.

250
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:29,504
Zhanping.

251
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,800
Zhanping.

252
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,192
Young master.

253
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,839
It's raining.

254
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,000
Right. Young master, the young madam said
it was going to rain, and it really rains.

255
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,600
Could it be that after spending so much time
with young master,

256
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,920
she also learned to predict the future?

257
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:56,799
- But how could I…
- Umbrella!

258
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:59,440
I know, young master.

259
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,520
When you finish writing the characters,

260
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,080
if it's still raining,
I'll go to fetch the umbrella.

261
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,119
Jiuling didn't take an umbrella.

262
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,740
Right.

263
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,679
The young madam didn't take an umbrella
when she left either.

264
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,680
- Luckily, the rain isn't heavy.
- I'll ask someone to send it right now.

265
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,440
Young master, wait for me.

266
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,920
I know

267
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,400
about things happened in Xunnan,

268
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,400
you had no choice.

269
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,759
Even if you really want to save me,

270
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,720
you can't change the outcome.

271
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:36,279
Even though I am a king now,

272
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,920
and hold a high position,

273
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,504
but everything

274
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,279
can't be turned back.

275
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:49,400
I came to Jialin this time

276
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,640
to save your father and brothers.

277
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:52,960
But I didn't expect…

278
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,680
Ling, the only thing I can do right now

279
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:02,799
is to take you away.

280
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:07,279
A-Away?

281
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:09,960
I can help you to revenge.

282
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,440
Whatever you want, I can give you.

283
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,060
If you want to play freely
in the bamboo forest,

284
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,960
just do it.

285
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,119
If you want to be your little bully again,

286
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,319
then go ahead.

287
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,720
in Xunnan, as long as I'm there to protect you,

288
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:24,920
no one would dare to hurt you anymore.

289
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,359
As for such a depressing place

290
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,700
and this kind of marriage,

291
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,840
I don't want you

292
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,039
to bear it for another day.

293
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,900
Master Rong has done a lot for you.

294
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,799
I will find a way to cure him.

295
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,400
Go to Xunnan with me, okay?

296
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,240
What are you hesitating about?

297
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,759
My young lady. It hurts. It hurts.

298
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,520
Look at you. You're already a grown-up

299
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,624
and all you know is to play.

300
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,640
But isn't it a holiday?

301
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,699
Why can't you leave me alone? Stop nagging.

302
00:21:00,699 --> 00:21:02,980
You're annoyed by my nagging?
I'm about to spank you.

303
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,199
It's a holiday.

304
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:06,160
I'm happy. You're happy too, right?

305
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,920
When you see Yuhan later, don't let her know

306
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,200
that you didn't come home last night.

307
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:12,440
She doesn't mind. I don't care.

308
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,759
He Jiuling.

309
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:22,260
I heard from Yuhan that she's doing well.

310
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,599
I didn't expect
that she can even keep a lover now.

311
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,800
That man in the dark clothes

312
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,960
is definitely not Rong Yu.

313
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:31,100
They were just standing and talking.

314
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,759
How did he become a lover?

315
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:34,920
Why don't you stand by me?

316
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:38,000
Let's go over to find out.

317
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,960
What are you hesitating about?

318
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,040
Don't go, sister.

319
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,160
Miss He.

320
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:48,039
No, it's Mrs. Rong.

321
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,839
It's rare to see you.
My brother and I came to greet you.

322
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,680
Who is this?

323
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,319
You don't need to know.

324
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:56,720
Long time no see.

325
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,720
You are still

326
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,140
so rude.

327
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,640
You experienced a great catastrophe
not long ago.

328
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,640
But it didn't teach you how to behave.

329
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,200
You have crossed the line, sister.

330
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,000
- You dare to hit me?
- I don't.

331
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,819
It seems like you do.

332
00:22:15,819 --> 00:22:17,360
A daughter of a criminal

333
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,380
doesn't learn to be low-key, but so arrogant.

334
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,840
I need to know today

335
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,200
who this man is.

336
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,488
Who is so blind?

337
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,160
- Jiuling, I got the umbrella for you.
- Rong Yu.

338
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,880
It's not raining anymore.

339
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,599
Right.

340
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:42,680
Master Rong.

341
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,408
Master Rong.

342
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Master Rong.

343
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:51,040
Young Master, when I just parked the carriage,

344
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,239
I accidentally splashed the lady

345
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:53,440
with mud.

346
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:56,640
What can we do?

347
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,360
Can I ask the young master
of the Astrology Pavilion

348
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,039
for compensation?

349
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,920
Okay, I won't compensate you.

350
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,096
You…

351
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,600
A dress is no big deal.

352
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,260
But Master Rong,
your wife is meeting a man on the street.

353
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,920
I think this is a big problem.

354
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:15,552
Why are you looking at me?

355
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,979
Oh, you're a man.

356
00:23:19,979 --> 00:23:21,088
What?

357
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,219
Your voice is so loud.

358
00:23:23,219 --> 00:23:24,399
Your voice is so deep.

359
00:23:24,399 --> 00:23:25,920
Indeed, you're a real man.

360
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,500
Sorry, I didn't recognize you.

361
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,400
Rong Yu, what nonsense
are you fool talking about?

362
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,860
And you, why are you laughing?

363
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,439
What did you just call Rong Yu?

364
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:35,880
What?

365
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,219
A fact that everyone in the capital knows

366
00:23:37,219 --> 00:23:38,300
can't be spoken out?

367
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,339
Fool, fool, fool.

368
00:23:40,339 --> 00:23:41,799
You have married a silly husband.

369
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,800
- Jiuling.
- This is called taking action.

370
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,079
Ling, no fighting.

371
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,340
Long time no see,

372
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,020
Miss Jiang's mouth

373
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,680
is still so ineffective.

374
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,960
Dare you hurt me!

375
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,040
Your neck is injured.

376
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,319
You'd better to see a doctor.

377
00:23:58,319 --> 00:23:59,480
Hurry up.

378
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:01,480
Why are you messing with her?

379
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,040
- Let me tell you.
- Ling.

380
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,096
Are you OK?

381
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:11,160
I'm fine. Don't worry.

382
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,808
Who are you?

383
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:18,400
H-He is

384
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:20,720
my senior brother.

385
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:23,939
Don't you still need to return to
the Astrology Pavilion?

386
00:24:23,939 --> 00:24:24,992
What about you?

387
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:27,559
My senior brother and I
have something to discuss.

388
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,760
I will wait for you.

389
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,880
Today,

390
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,759
don't you have to go to Astrology Pavilion
to practice writing?

391
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,279
I have taken leave from the teacher.

392
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:40,960
Then I'll send you back first.

393
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,079
I will go with you.

394
00:24:47,168 --> 00:24:50,036
[Juya Tavern]

395
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,260
Have you eaten?

396
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,560
Not yet.

397
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,880
Then I'll get you something to eat.

398
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,960
What do you want to eat?

399
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,400
You know that I'm not picky.

400
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:03,240
Then I will get you something fresh.

401
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,000
I haven't eaten yet.

402
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:09,600
Didn't you just have a bowl

403
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,759
of golden thread noodles this morning?

404
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,740
Zhanping urged you to eat a chicken egg
but you couldn't.

405
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,920
How come you haven't eaten yet?

406
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,960
I haven't eaten for lunch.

407
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,880
What is the time now?

408
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,559
Alright then.

409
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,672
What do you want to eat?

410
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:34,839
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

411
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,920
Rong Yu, are you really hungry?

412
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,520
Okay, okay, I'll take it
that you're craving something.

413
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,839
I'll get some snacks for you.

414
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,272
Do you still remember me?

415
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:03,759
It seems like you truly don't.

416
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:07,320
You're no longer

417
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,799
the once Best Young Master in Jialin.

418
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,960
I don't know

419
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,160
what turned you into what you are now.

420
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,640
In theory

421
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,640
you shouldn't be like this.

422
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,480
It's supposed that Ling and I owe you.

423
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:23,559
You helped her.

424
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:24,576
You saved her life.

425
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,272
I thank you

426
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,232
with a cup of tea instead of wine.

427
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,799
No matter whether
we are thanking you or owing you,

428
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:42,119
we cannot repay with Ling's lifetime.

429
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,119
What do you want, the supreme status,

430
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:47,900
or wealth,

431
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,760
or anything else?

432
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,280
I can even promise

433
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,319
to cure you.

434
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:56,200
Young master, do you understand what I mean?

435
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,968
If you don't understand, it doesn't matter.

436
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,119
It's not necessary to get your agreement.

437
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,160
Who are you?

438
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,559
Who am I?

439
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,640
If I have to say,

440
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,760
consider me as

441
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,599
the person who is going to take your wife away.

442
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:31,136
Let me have a look.

443
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:32,800
No.

444
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,752
Rong Yu.

445
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,160
Why is the water splashed everywhere?

446
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,160
Why is your hand red?

447
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,319
Burned?

448
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:49,420
Boss, bring a basin of cold water!

449
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,720
- Here it comes.
- Zhanping.

450
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,160
Zhanping, come over here quickly.

451
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,479
The tea is not very hot. It should be fine.

452
00:27:58,479 --> 00:28:00,280
It may be no big deal for others.

453
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,640
His weak body might even get a scar.

454
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:04,799
Let me check.

455
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,496
Did you have a fight?

456
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,759
Do you think we could fight?

457
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:18,380
Indeed, sometimes

458
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,080
he is a bit temperamental like a child.

459
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,420
Don't mind him.

460
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,559
I won't.

461
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:29,140
What happened?

462
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,272
The young master got a burn.

463
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,800
Here.

464
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,040
I will first use ice water to cool him down.

465
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,039
- Go back and apply the cooling ointment.
- Okay.

466
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,799
Zhanping, take the young master back home.

467
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,880
No.

468
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,679
If you don't go back home
and apply the cooling ointment,

469
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,400
you won't be able to sleep
at night because of the pain.

470
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:55,960
If you go back, I will go back.

471
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,900
I will go back later.

472
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,519
Then I will also go back later.

473
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,559
Rong Yu, you said you would listen to me.

474
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,416
I…

475
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,160
You can't take care of yourself,

476
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,339
I don't blame you.
I ask you to go back and apply the medicine,

477
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:19,580
it's for your good.

478
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,599
You don't listen, either.

479
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,440
Zhanping, take the young master back.

480
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:28,660
Young master, let's go back first.

481
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,640
Look, young madam is already angry.

482
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,480
Let's go, young master.

483
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,079
Young madam will go back soon.

484
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:37,920
- Really?
- Of course.

485
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,128
Let's go.

486
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:44,359
Will you really go back later?

487
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,599
You're not lying?

488
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:48,820
I won't lie to you.

489
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,960
But you said in the carriage

490
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,400
that you're a liar.

491
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,679
- I…
- I'll wait for you at home.

492
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:56,459
I only listen to you.

493
00:29:56,459 --> 00:29:58,519
Can you please not lie?

494
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,000
Okay.

495
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,299
Let's go, young master.

496
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:05,060
Young master, let's go.

497
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,000
Just go.

498
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:11,720
Just go, young master.

499
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,240
Here we go.

500
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:22,100
It's said that when Lord Song had an accident,

501
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,500
somebody forced Lord Song's sedan to stop.

502
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,920
But we don't know who it was.

503
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,560
The drug that made
Lord Song's driver unconscious

504
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,760
comes from the imperial concubines.

505
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,260
It is only used in the palace,

506
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,640
not attainable by ordinary people.

507
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,039
The one who could get this drug

508
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,620
must be someone from the royal court

509
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,720
who is closely related to royal family.

510
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:41,680
Revenge on New Year's Eve.

511
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:46,920
Who has a grudge against him?

512
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,720
Who is the most possible suspect?

513
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:50,979
The most possible suspect

514
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:52,920
should be the orphan of the He family.

515
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,140
Just now Lord Rong

516
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,920
also sent someone to report to me.

517
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,980
He Jiuling went to the pastry shop

518
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,280
in the west of the city that night

519
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,480
to buy pastries.

520
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,380
They have witnesses and physical evidence.

521
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,240
The young master can also testify that.

522
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,939
However,

523
00:31:04,939 --> 00:31:06,500
if she left the palace

524
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,199
to the west
and then went to the east of the city

525
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,620
to kill Lord Song,

526
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,839
and then returned to the Rong's mansion,

527
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:14,039
I don't think she had enough time.

528
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,699
The lass from the He family

529
00:31:15,699 --> 00:31:17,280
can't stir up any trouble.

530
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,780
All her family is dead.

531
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,440
No one would help her.

532
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:24,599
- Let's go to the Ministry of Justice first.
- Okay.

533
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,200
Father, I…

534
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:34,784
Father.

535
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:42,624
Are you very tired?

536
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,416
Yes.

537
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,032
He is very dependent on you.

538
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:50,368
Yes.

539
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:52,880
Between him and me,

540
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:55,559
it's like a knot that can't be untied.

541
00:31:58,519 --> 00:31:59,839
Father,

542
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:01,200
my brothers

543
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,640
and sister-in-laws are all dead.

544
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,440
If it weren't for him,

545
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,759
I might not have been able to hold on at all.

546
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,119
We should look forward,

547
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,079
because there is light on the road ahead.

548
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,960
But what if the future road

549
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:23,119
is a darker abyss?

550
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,119
Would you dare to move forward?

551
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,359
Because of Rong Yu.

552
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:34,720
He's there.

553
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,928
He needs me.

554
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:38,656
Relies on me.

555
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:41,140
This makes me feel

556
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,440
there is still light in life.

557
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:48,519
Senior brother,

558
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:51,960
you want me to leave with you.

559
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:54,119
I can't.

560
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,688
Is it because of him?

561
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,480
Yes.

562
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,279
And no.

563
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,000
You said I could be like before,

564
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,240
and do whatever I want to do.

565
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,839
But the little sister of Mount Wuhua

566
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,880
and the little bully of the capital,

567
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,200
can never live like before.

568
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,160
I must repay what Rong Yu has given to me.

569
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,720
As for the deep hatred,

570
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,920
I must avenge it myself.

571
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,400
The He family was raided and beheaded.

572
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,519
I don't know who did it.

573
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:42,440
But if you want to stay here
to revenge by yourself,

574
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,599
do you think you really can?

575
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:45,559
Yes, I can.

576
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:48,928
Indeed,

577
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:51,400
now in Nanjiang,

578
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,800
you are already a well-known

579
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,856
Left General.

580
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,799
But in my heart

581
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:58,720
you are always the little sister

582
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,020
who doesn't know anything

583
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,359
and is protected by Master and me.

584
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:10,800
Who doesn't want to be the little sister

585
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,960
who knows nothing

586
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,679
and is protected by Master and you?

587
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,519
I didn't expect

588
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,199
one day

589
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,920
I would have to make my way in the place

590
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:26,119
where I was born

591
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,760
and raised.

592
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,264
I thought

593
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:37,540
I could always be that

594
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,000
ignorant little girl.

595
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,280
If you have already made the decision,

596
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,880
I respect you.

597
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,599
If one day you are tired.

598
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:51,159
I will help you.

599
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,599
But Master Rong

600
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,300
is a noble master

601
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,520
born with a silver spoon.

602
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,040
He will never be the same

603
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,920
as you and me.

604
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,220
He can only become

605
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,920
your weakness on the road to revenge.

606
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,960
I understand.

607
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,840
That's okay.

608
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,440
I will wait for your good news in Xunnan.

609
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:16,719
Next time you miss me,

610
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,599
I will come immediately.

611
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:24,080
Leaving you alone here,

612
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,480
I'm really worried.

613
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,480
Before I leave,

614
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,312
I will leave you a highly skilled maid

615
00:35:29,312 --> 00:35:30,368
to protect you.

616
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,280
I don't need others to protect me.

617
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:35,559
Just let me do this for you.

618
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,040
When you want to write to me,

619
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,359
you can hand it to her directly.

620
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,960
It is safer than giving it to others.

621
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:46,159
Alright.

622
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:50,048
You asked me about the Amnesia Powder

623
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:52,079
when I was in Nanjiang.

624
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:55,399
I was under house arrest at the time,

625
00:35:55,399 --> 00:35:56,639
and I didn't have the chance to answer.

626
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,320
The nine-section worm beetle
you added in the medicine,

627
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,100
can indeed inhibit

628
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,400
the activity of the poison.

629
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:06,240
But it will also slowly

630
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,760
damage a person's organs.

631
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,400
I tried to come up with a solution.

632
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,039
I don't know whether it could work or not.

633
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:27,241
♫ Under the setting sun in dusk ♫

634
00:36:29,462 --> 00:36:35,261
♫ I travel far for thousands of miles ♫

635
00:36:35,261 --> 00:36:42,231
♫ Playing the zither under the moonlight ♫

636
00:36:43,445 --> 00:36:49,617
♫ The drinks won't let me forget ♫

637
00:36:50,582 --> 00:36:56,570
♫ The longing I write down for you ♫

638
00:36:57,686 --> 00:37:03,226
♫ Our fate is written on paper ♫

639
00:37:03,226 --> 00:37:07,525
♫ Just like the strongest wine ♫

640
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:10,940
♫ There's no escape for destiny ♫

641
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:17,946
♫ Looking back, I see you waiting ♫

642
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:25,114
♫ Our lives are filled with joy and sorrow ♫

643
00:37:25,114 --> 00:37:32,049
♫ The longings crystalize
into a bright galaxy ♫

644
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:39,866
♫ You turned around quietly
and closed the marriage book ♫

645
00:37:39,866 --> 00:37:45,466
♫ Asking how many stars there are in the sky ♫

646
00:38:11,702 --> 00:38:17,274
♫ The longing I write down for you ♫

647
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:24,442
♫ Our fate is written on paper ♫

648
00:38:24,442 --> 00:38:28,476
♫ Just like the strongest wine ♫

649
00:38:28,886 --> 00:38:31,418
♫ There's no escape for destiny ♫

650
00:38:32,982 --> 00:38:39,034
♫ Looking back, I see you waiting ♫

651
00:38:39,034 --> 00:38:46,074
♫ Our lives are filled with joy and sorrow ♫

652
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:53,271
♫ The longings crystalize
into a bright galaxy ♫

653
00:38:53,275 --> 00:39:00,538
♫ Gently I stroke the zither,
waiting for a passerby like you ♫

654
00:39:01,142 --> 00:39:07,302
♫ Turns out you are my inextricable destiny ♫
