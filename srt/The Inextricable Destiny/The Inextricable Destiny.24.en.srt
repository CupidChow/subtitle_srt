00:01:25,156 --> 00:01:31,460
<i>[The Inextricable Destiny]</i>

2
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,368
<i>[Episode 24]</i>

3
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,584
Rong Yu.

4
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,379
Once we get on the official road,

5
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,280
His Majesty and I will need
to travel day and night.

6
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,040
You're a fortuneteller.
There's no need for you to hurry.

7
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,840
I've arranged for you to trail behind
with the supplies and forage.

8
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,496
I don't need that.

9
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,576
That was an order.

10
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,799
I'm a fortuneteller,

11
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,448
not your soldier.

12
00:02:08,448 --> 00:02:09,472
You…

13
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,920
I'm saying please.

14
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,952
Young master.

15
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:22,560
Young master, I'm late.

16
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:31,120
<i>In the third year of Chengyuan, the young
Emperor personally led the expedition</i>

17
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,180
<i>and after three months of fierce battle,
four cities were retrieved.</i>

18
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,719
<i>Both sides suffered heavy losses
and rested for several days.</i>

19
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,800
When I was at my wits' end,

20
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,959
I heard the clicking sounds of hooves

21
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,280
breaking the silence of the night.
General Yan led his troops

22
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,840
and charged out from the gorge,

23
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,240
which crushed the souls
of those Xunnan soldiers.

24
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,679
They only managed to hold on
for less than 15 minutes

25
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:03,940
before leaving everything

26
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,560
and running away.

27
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,959
I later found out

28
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,080
that there weren't that many people at all.

29
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,140
800 soldiers shouted as loud as they could

30
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,200
and sounded like 8000 soldiers.

31
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,000
It was Rong Yu's idea.

32
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,800
Chengbi, bring some wine.

33
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,320
Tell me.

34
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,712
Why?

35
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,439
Why would she like Rong Yu?

36
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,400
I don't know.

37
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,808
You don't know?

38
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:02,784
I don't.

39
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,768
Who would believe

40
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,439
that someone would love an idiot

41
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,400
and give up everything for him?

42
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:21,319
I can't believe I lost to an idiot.

43
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,464
Your Majesty.

44
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,519
Let's return to Xunnan.

45
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,199
We won't win.

46
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,120
The He family was wiped out.

47
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,680
There are no generals in Jialin.

48
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,160
With the Regent rebelling,
this is the perfect timing.

49
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,199
We must fight.

50
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,920
All we did was lose some cities to Jialin.

51
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,680
Why do you all think I can't make a comeback?

52
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,800
Why can't win this world

53
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,160
and take away my girl?

54
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,519
You keep telling me to return to Xunnan.

55
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,759
You work for me, not He Jiuling.

56
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,560
Do you think they are the perfect match?

57
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,000
I've never thought that way.

58
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,080
It's Rong Yu.

59
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,240
The master of the Astrology Pavilion, he…

60
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,168
He is strange.

61
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,800
Strange how?

62
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,459
Where did this handsome god come from?

63
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:43,959
There's a raging war. You should have chosen
a better place to descend to earth.

64
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,079
With your looks, ordinary merchandise
cannot match you.

65
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,959
I'm trying to find a gift.
The warmer, the better.

66
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,040
Once we cross this threshold,

67
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,079
everything will be safe and sound.

68
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,839
Once we endure this disaster,

69
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,600
every inch of land in Jialin

70
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,279
will be ours again.

71
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
He Jiuling.

72
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:20,160
What do you want to do

73
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,400
when the war in Nanjiang is over?

74
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,560
I will appoint you as the general.

75
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,759
Like your father, the Great General.

76
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,639
I will kill whoever opposes that.

77
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,000
You can do it too.

78
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:37,580
You shall strut freely in the capital,

79
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,040
defend yourself,

80
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,000
and be the little overlord again.

81
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,840
No, I won't be a general,

82
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,199
nor will I be an overlord.

83
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,360
After I've cleared my family's name,

84
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,399
I'll go back to the small house I bought

85
00:06:52,096 --> 00:06:53,152
in the town of Nanjiang.

86
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,160
Won't you stay in the capital?

87
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,280
What about Rong Yu?

88
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,680
I know you still have feelings for him.

89
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:19,439
If you leave,

90
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,639
it will be the real end for you two.

91
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,519
When I was in Mount Wuhua, I was a loser.

92
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,700
I wasn't good at martial arts
or medicine making.

93
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,319
But now, I've learned a lot.

94
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,120
So the feelings for someone

95
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:44,279
will be forgettable if you try hard enough.

96
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:49,780
Is that so? I feel like you are taking
advantage of my lack of experience

97
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,959
and making things up.

98
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,920
Your Majesty, Your Majesty.

99
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,600
Your Majesty, there's been a report.

100
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,000
Advisor Rong was kidnapped
from a shop in Nanjiang city.

101
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
By whom exactly?

102
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,439
I'm not sure. Only a token was left.

103
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,160
Rong Yu.

104
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,360
Aren't you afraid that I will kill you?

105
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,008
You won't.

106
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,704
Naive.

107
00:08:28,704 --> 00:08:30,759
I am an old and cruel woman.

108
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:33,900
You could have killed me,

109
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,120
but instead, I was kidnapped.

110
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,200
You're quite smart.

111
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,559
They say you've been out of your mind
for five years, and only just got better.

112
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,399
If you recognize me, you might as well
tell me what you want.

113
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,304
What do I want?

114
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,580
You don't need to go back
to He Jiuling anymore.

115
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,559
From now on, you will follow me.

116
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,048
You know He Jiuling?

117
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,960
Didn't my unworthy disciple mention me to you?

118
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,224
Unworthy disciple?

119
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:04,960
Now I know who you are.

120
00:09:06,496 --> 00:09:07,520
That's good.

121
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,839
Since you've already married my disciple,

122
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,320
and resigned from your position
as the Master of the Astrology Pavilion,

123
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,060
just forget about the past.

124
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,759
From now on, you are one of us at Mount Wuhua.

125
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,960
- Madam.
- Talk less.

126
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:20,879
Follow me.

127
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:22,039
Madam.

128
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,120
Shut up.

129
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,900
I can't stand you people
from the Astrology Pavilion.

130
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,340
You cast the most venomous divinations
and behave in the evilest ways.

131
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,080
You're clearly cursing me in your heart,

132
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,200
yet you call me Madam.

133
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,460
Enough with the hypocrisy, I'm not buying it.

134
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,879
- That's not true.
- Just be quiet.

135
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:39,904
Follow me.

136
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,399
I told you to follow me.

137
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,620
Do you not want to join Mount Wuhua,

138
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,000
and become my disciple's husband?

139
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,240
Alright then, I'll go settle
the score with He Jiuling.

140
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,856
It's Master.

141
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,600
I've never met anyone as difficult as you.

142
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,699
It would take you three months

143
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:48,000
to go up Mount Wuhua. I'm tired.

144
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,039
We're heading to Mount Wuhua?

145
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,600
Let's go.

146
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,680
Why are you so cold?

147
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:03,500
You're already cold before I've done anything.

148
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,540
Your body is freezing.

149
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,720
Are you made of paper?

150
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,200
Take this.

151
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:31,776
This pill looks very precious.
I can't accept it.

152
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,799
Of course, it's precious.

153
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:35,960
It took three months
to refine this Rejuvenation Pill.

154
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,540
If I could have healed
you with cheaper medicine,

155
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,039
I wouldn't have given you this. Take it.

156
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:52,512
Eat it.

157
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,679
Thank you, Madam.

158
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,600
Do you want it back?

159
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,559
I told you to eat it. Eat it!

160
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,000
I'll ask He Jiuling to reimburse me.

161
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,060
My clever disciple.

162
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,100
She won't be the one at a loss.

163
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,760
Why did she choose
such a useless husband like you?

164
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,864
Madam…

165
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,688
Fine.

166
00:12:26,688 --> 00:12:28,559
Let's rest here.

167
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:31,760
But going back is not an option.

168
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,768
Stay put.

169
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:35,616
Since it's already decided,

170
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,039
I'll go collect some firewood.

171
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:39,960
Stay put.

172
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:21,559
I thought Master would
make it difficult for you.

173
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,600
Guess I was wrong.

174
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,000
If you wanted to find me, just come.

175
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,520
Why put on such a show?

176
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,120
I looked everywhere for you.

177
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,779
I was annoyed.

178
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:52,980
My proud disciple from Mount Wuhua

179
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,760
stooped so low as to marry
a stinking man from the Astrology Pavilion.

180
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,559
Couldn't you have found someone better?

181
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,180
Marrying someone from the Astrology Pavilion
is one thing,

182
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,100
but you chose the worst one.

183
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,219
You really failed

184
00:14:03,219 --> 00:14:04,519
my teachings all these years.

185
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,279
I'm not related to him anymore.

186
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,168
What do you mean?

187
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,039
We're divorced. We're no longer a couple.

188
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,840
You. Why didn't you say
you were not a couple earlier?

189
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,180
I was going to.

190
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,700
But you didn't want to hear it.

191
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,744
What?

192
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:33,080
Eat something even if you're angry.

193
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:35,000
Although this was cooked…

194
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,799
- by… by you.
- I won't eat it.

195
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,799
No. What are you doing?

196
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,984
I'm so pissed off.

197
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,639
Ling, I know what happened in these years.

198
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:50,720
It's all in the past.

199
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,480
Alright.

200
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,600
Stop pretending to be tough. I understand.

201
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,592
Some pain

202
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,759
will always be there.

203
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,360
Ever since you went down the mountain,

204
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,639
I have been roaming the world
ignorant of worldly affairs.

205
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,699
I thought your Senior Brother,
had his clever mind and a perceptive heart.

206
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:17,360
He's good at hiding and planning every step.

207
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,440
And you have the support of your family

208
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,240
and all the skills of Mount Wuhua.

209
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,540
Even if you can be a bit willful,

210
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,880
you will never be at a disadvantage.

211
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,759
I didn't expect that when I
finally heard about you,

212
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:30,519
it was in such a state.

213
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:32,896
Master.

214
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,320
Seeing you and your senior brother
fighting with swords and spears

215
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,519
makes me sad too.

216
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,559
So I went to him first.

217
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,100
He was nice to me, yes.

218
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,759
But he is no longer as obedient as before.

219
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,672
As you know,

220
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,399
your Senior Brother has always been stubborn.

221
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:53,620
Once he is determined on something,

222
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,559
no one can change it.

223
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,039
I came to see you when I couldn't persuade him.

224
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:02,440
I might be useless,

225
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,980
but it's better than when your
family was in trouble,

226
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,080
and you had to struggle on your own.

227
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,519
How can you be useless?

228
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,080
As long as someone is still thinking of me,

229
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,559
I am very content.

230
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,400
But I…

231
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,039
I got here too late.

232
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:31,220
Why did you become a female general?

233
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,240
I just want you to be

234
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,579
an innocent little disciple.

235
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:36,440
You've suffered in these years, Ling.

236
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:40,280
When you left,

237
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,780
I thought about giving you a miraculous pill

238
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,000
or an amulet to wear.

239
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,320
But then I thought,

240
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,040
I have already given you

241
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,519
the most precious thing in Mount Wuhua.

242
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,320
You know you were born
with a strange early aging disease.

243
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,912
When normal people live for ten years,

244
00:16:58,912 --> 00:17:00,919
you might have already finished this life.

245
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,360
Fortunately, you were destined to meet me.

246
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,060
I took you to Mount Wuhua.

247
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,179
Five years ago, everyone thought
your illness had been cured.

248
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:12,440
But the truth is, you have been
surviving on medicine.

249
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,100
I used my life's greatest skill

250
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,839
to make a medicine called Pipa Zui.

251
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,460
As long as this medicine is in your body,

252
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:23,160
whether it's a strange disease,
severe illness, or external injuries,

253
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,399
as long as it doesn't harm your core,

254
00:17:25,399 --> 00:17:28,640
Pipa Zui will heal you at the fastest speed.

255
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,300
Battles are always full of dangers.

256
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,880
This is perhaps the amulet I gave you.

257
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,200
No wonder I could recover
from injuries several times.

258
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:41,559
Why have you never taught me
the method to make this medicine?

259
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,960
This Pipa Zui can be considered

260
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,140
the king of all medicines.

261
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,799
It needs years of accumulation

262
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:53,119
and countless heavenly treasures to nourish.

263
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,119
Most importantly, the catalyst
for this medicine has already been lost.

264
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,079
The one I gave you is the only
piece that was successful.

265
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:03,759
It will not be reproduced in the future.

266
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,119
When you left the mountain, I told you.

267
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,800
I've taught you everything there is to teach.

268
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,359
Now, think about it. I didn't lie, did I?

269
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:16,799
Yes, it's already in my body.

270
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:20,359
Well, you have nothing to fear.

271
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,440
Since you're already a general,

272
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,559
become a Goddess of War for me.

273
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:29,056
Yes.

274
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:35,160
<i>After several days of hard battle,
the fight for the last city is intense.</i>

275
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:44,759
Nothing bad will happen, right?

276
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,400
If something happens, what can I do, I…

277
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,920
Report.

278
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,039
Your Majesty, General He has won.
Malan Slope has been retrieved.

279
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,799
Good, I will host a celebration for her.

280
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:09,960
Ling is fighting hard outside,
and you're here drinking tea.

281
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,160
No wonder Ling doesn't want you.

282
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,272
Why aren't you talking?

283
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,079
I don't have anything to defend myself.

284
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,279
I've never been good at horse-riding,
archery, or spear skills.

285
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,440
That's not my point.

286
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:31,519
I'm asking why you don't seem to care at all.

287
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,760
If nothing unexpected happens,

288
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,599
it's a victory.

289
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:37,960
What if something unexpected happens?

290
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,200
Do you have some prejudice

291
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:00,832
against the Astrology Pavilion?

292
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,059
Let's not talk about prejudice or not.

293
00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:05,599
Are you guys not casting divination anymore?

294
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:08,920
That's all we can do.

295
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,440
Previously, there was a master of swordsmanship

296
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,160
who also liked to sit
and drink tea with my father.

297
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,359
The master asked my father
the same question you just mentioned.

298
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:22,176
And?

299
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,000
She was one of the best masters out there,

300
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,024
almost without any opponent.

301
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,760
But every time an enemy came to take revenge,

302
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,440
she would come to my father for a divination.

303
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,359
She was afraid of accidents
and treasured her life a lot.

304
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:46,720
She often asked for divination,
one after another.

305
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:51,160
Father always got the same result,
so he got fed up.

306
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,728
In the end, he never did divinations

307
00:20:54,592 --> 00:20:55,744
or returned her letters again.

308
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,010
See, see?

309
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,300
This is exactly what you people
from the Astrology Pavilion do.

310
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,079
You're always looking down upon others.

311
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:05,820
Interfering when you feel like it,

312
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,280
and discarding people when you're done.

313
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,260
Always capriciously directing others' lives,

314
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,200
thinking you're some kind of god.

315
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,480
- Madam.
- I'm not done.

316
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,860
You speak of fortune
and fate however you please,

317
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,680
never giving others a chance to choose.

318
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,760
Because of your words,

319
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,520
my life with the previous Emperor
was disrupted.

320
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,319
Do you find it fun and interesting?

321
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,640
Master.

322
00:21:30,016 --> 00:21:31,020
Master.

323
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,440
Ling, quickly, give me a turn.

324
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,839
I'm glad you're not hurt. That's my disciple.

325
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:42,039
We did a surprise attack,
so it wasn't that hard.

326
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,620
I heard that these past few days,
my master has been bothering you.

327
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,799
I'm really sorry.

328
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,319
How can it be a bother? We were just chatting.

329
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,960
And thank you for the tip
about a surprise attack on Malan Mountain.

330
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,504
You're welcome.

331
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,039
Master, let's go. Let's not chat with him.

332
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:09,440
I haven't finished yet.

333
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,320
Tonight, the Emperor is
hosting a victory banquet.

334
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,400
Would you like to join me?

335
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,096
I won't.

336
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:20,800
If you don't go, there won't be any wine.

337
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,856
Wine?

338
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,872
Let's go.

339
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,400
Young Master, the story about the sword master
you were just talking about,

340
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,720
is it unfinished?

341
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,240
Perhaps leaving it unfinished
is the right thing to do.

342
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,400
A sword master.

343
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,240
There weren't many out there back then.

344
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:48,240
I guess…

345
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:52,839
Young Master, the sword master
you mentioned wouldn't be…

346
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:58,520
Brothers, come on.

347
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,519
Come on, brothers.

348
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:08,380
Gentlemen, we just need to completely
drive Xunnan out of Nanjiang,

349
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,160
and then we can return to the capital.

350
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,079
Who says Jialin is running out its luck?

351
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:15,720
Who says we are bound for no return?

352
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:20,599
Everyone present bravely
joined me on the battlefield.

353
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,640
We shared life and death these past few months.

354
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:27,200
Cheng'an will never forget.

355
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,688
Fill it up, fill it up.

356
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,704
Come on, come on.

357
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,008
Let's have another one.

358
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,888
Come on.

359
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,552
Drink till we're drunk.

360
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,200
Drink, drink.

361
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:45,824
Come on, come on.

362
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,920
So tone-deaf.

363
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:01,640
Why is it so tone-deaf?

364
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,760
Does it hurt?

365
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,472
Sorry, on the day of great victory,

366
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,552
we should be happy.

367
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,160
A kiss will make it all better.

368
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:17,720
Why did you run so far?

369
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,480
My dear, I want a hug.

370
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:26,624
You're drunk.

371
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:29,888
The most?

372
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,288
Yes.

373
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,176
The most…

374
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:38,200
I like Rong Yu the most.

375
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,599
I like him the most, most of all.

376
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,359
I like him when he is silent.

377
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:53,839
I like him when he is silly and dazed.

378
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,640
I like him when he sits,

379
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:59,160
smiles at me,

380
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,599
and runs toward me.

381
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,480
He always clings to me.

382
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,799
He peels chestnuts for me.

383
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,440
He says to me,

384
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:33,039
"My lady, in this life,
I will only listen to you."

385
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,799
But I've lost him.

386
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,960
And he won't come back.

387
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,359
I didn't want to burn his Astrology Pavilion

388
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,960
or destroy his star chart,

389
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,119
but I had to.

390
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,440
But who knows that?

391
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:07,160
It makes me sadder than anyone.

392
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,832
My dear.

393
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,720
I miss you so much.

394
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:13,408
I know.

395
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,039
I know you had to do it.

396
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,920
It really hurts.

397
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:05,319
<i>Ling, seeing you stronger
and braver than before,</i>

398
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,440
<i>I can rest assured.</i>

399
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,240
<i>Regarding this deadly battle,</i>

400
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,120
<i>I am still a mortal being.</i>

401
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,760
<i>And I couldn't bear to see you
and your Senior Brother</i>

402
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,720
<i>waving swords at each other.</i>

403
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,799
<i>So, I decided to leave.</i>

404
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,400
<i>It's always easy to meet but hard to part.</i>

405
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:28,759
<i>I won't say goodbye to you face to face.</i>

406
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:30,880
<i>Take care.</i>

407
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:37,880
General He. General He.

408
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:44,040
Last night everyone was drunk
at the victory feast. You left early.

409
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,340
I thought you might want to rest more
and skip this meeting.

410
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,300
I knew there was important business today,

411
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,079
so I went to bed early yesterday.

412
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:52,960
Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty.

413
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,759
It seems the Master doesn't like me very much.

414
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,599
I didn't offend you or bother you, did I?

415
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,712
General He, not at all.

416
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,540
Yes, Ling, don't overthink.

417
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,839
Let's talk business quickly.

418
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,640
Speaking of Wutu City,
it will be our last battle

419
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,920
and the hardest one.

420
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,540
Rong Yu, you've been studying
Wutu City for a while now.

421
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,039
Can you share your findings?

422
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,880
Let's discuss together how to break through.

423
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:36,720
Wutu City is the main base of Xunnan.

424
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,699
Therefore, they have been strengthening

425
00:31:39,699 --> 00:31:42,519
the city and amassing weapons for a long time.

426
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,839
The city is now

427
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,080
easy to defend and hard to attack.
So a hard attack is not advisable.

428
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,919
But we still have to attack.

429
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,559
Stagnation or choosing to hold our forces

430
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,640
will have a significantly negative impact

431
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,799
on us in terms of provision or morale.

432
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,480
We might as well mount a decisive attack.

433
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,000
After all, we cannot wait for Xunnan
to voluntarily relinquish Wutu.

434
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:07,599
Xunnan, of course, will not give up.

435
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:11,200
But now they have suffered successive defeats,
their morale is declining.

436
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,759
They urgently need a victory
to boost their morale.

437
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:16,880
They desperately need to seize a city
to prove themselves.

438
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,140
With Your Majesty in Nanjiang,

439
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,920
Xunnan will undoubtedly
choose to attack this city.

440
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,360
Should we quickly fortify the city?

441
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,824
- Otherwise…
- Not really.

442
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,260
We should, on the contrary,
expose our vulnerabilities.

443
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,440
Leak the information to the Xunnan army,

444
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,240
make them think we are overconfident,

445
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,312
and they will take the initiative to attack.

446
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,984
Why is that?

447
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:39,919
Lure them into striking as defense,

448
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:40,992
and we will

449
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:43,680
defend as attack.

450
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,820
Knowing that this is a crucial battle,

451
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,179
Xunnan will definitely send their best troops

452
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:51,639
to attack our Nanjiang City,

453
00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:54,480
which leaves Wutu relatively unguarded.

454
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,319
I think Your Majesty can command someone
to take half the troops

455
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:01,079
and ambush around the Tongguan area.

456
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,800
Wait when Wutu is vulnerable,

457
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,240
and we can seize it in one fell swoop.

458
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:07,500
And the remaining half of the troops

459
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,799
will hold Nanjiang when Xunnan attacks.

460
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,768
This battle will be

461
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:15,799
a matter of life and death.

462
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:20,040
<i>Ren Yinxiao and I come from the same sect.</i>

463
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,519
<i>We are bound to have this fight.</i>

464
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:24,040
<i>Your Majesty,</i>

465
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,559
please let General Yan
take the troops to Tongguan,

466
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,319
and I will stay here to defend
Nanjiang against the enemy.

467
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:30,724
<i>[Nanjiang City]</i>

468
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,260
I want to talk to your general.

469
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:46,439
I will go by myself without any troops, okay?

470
00:33:46,439 --> 00:33:47,720
- Your Majesty, please reconsider.
- Shut up.

471
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:51,359
May I?

472
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:54,359
I don't have anything to say to you.

473
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,680
- Ling.
- Don't call me that.

474
00:33:57,759 --> 00:33:58,912
You are not worthy.

475
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:02,319
Does it really have to be this way between us?

476
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,640
Since the day you planned to target Jialin,

477
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,880
you should have known

478
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,400
that we can never be sect brothers and sisters.

479
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,039
Why are you so obsessed?

480
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,519
I've wanted to pull you out

481
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:18,599
from this dirty morass of Jialin.

482
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,040
The entire He family was executed.

483
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,800
And you are still working for Jialin.

484
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,440
Jiang Hesen was executed.

485
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,440
But what about the Yan family?
And the Rong family?

486
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,280
I promise you.

487
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,780
All the people who have
wronged you in the past,

488
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,260
I won't let a single one get away.

489
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,740
I can help you with those
you can't bring yourself to kill.

490
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,900
Is that the reason
why you insult Jialin's princess

491
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,719
and invade our land?

492
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,680
This is nothing but an excuse
for your wild ambitions.

493
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,540
You've never been content
with being the unknown

494
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,440
Ren Yinxiao on Mount Wuhua.

495
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,159
You've always wanted to be the King of Xunnan.

496
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:01,159
I didn't want this either.

497
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:04,519
I was wrong about you.

498
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:08,079
I didn't realize you had such great ambitions

499
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:10,599
and the determination to be a world conqueror.

500
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,920
Senior Brother,

501
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,760
this is the last time I call you that.

502
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:21,056
From now on,

503
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:26,320
you and I are nothing but enemies.

504
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,639
March!

505
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:48,352
Let's go!

506
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:48,964
<i>[Nanjiang City]</i>

507
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:31,599
Chengbi, what are you doing here?

508
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:37,600
Let's go and find the young master. Come.

509
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,920
Hurry, hurry.

510
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:41,056
This way, hurry.

511
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,400
It's victory. But why can't I see anything now?

512
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,920
Young master, it's Chengbi. Chengbi is back.

513
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,599
She's seriously injured.

514
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:20,416
Heshan, go find a doctor.

515
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,304
Yes.

516
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:29,664
Let's go.

517
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,519
Chengbi, what are you doing?

518
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,920
Young master, run.

519
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:53,119
Young master, run.

520
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:05,664
Enough.

521
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:17,840
If your target is me,

522
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:20,840
don't hurt the innocent.

523
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:27,679
Great. Yan Lie made it.

<i>♫ Our fate is written on paper ♫</i>

539
00:41:35,912 --> 00:41:39,946
<i>♫ Just like the strongest wine ♫</i>

540
00:41:40,356 --> 00:41:42,888
<i>♫ There's no escape for destiny ♫</i>

541
00:41:44,452 --> 00:41:50,504
<i>♫ Looking back, I see you waiting ♫</i>

542
00:41:50,504 --> 00:41:57,544
<i>♫ Our lives are filled with joy and sorrow ♫</i>

543
00:41:57,544 --> 00:42:04,741
<i>♫ The longings crystalize
into a bright galaxy ♫</i>

544
00:42:04,745 --> 00:42:12,008
<i>♫ Gently I stroke the zither,
waiting for a passerby like you ♫</i>

545
00:42:12,612 --> 00:42:18,772
<i>♫ Turns out you are my inextricable destiny ♫</i>
