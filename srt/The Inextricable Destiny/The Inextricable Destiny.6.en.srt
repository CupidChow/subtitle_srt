1
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,320
How come He Girl is here?

2
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:17,080
I heard you were going to Hanshan Temple

3
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:18,960
I came here to take you

4
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,360
Eating is only for the two of us

5
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,119
Dinner

6
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:25,960
Step back.

7
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,639
Maybe we can still be friends

8
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,039
How

9
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:37,360
Non.

10
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:44,759
Friends

11
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:46,880
Yes.

12
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:48,639
Guest officer

13
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,479
Something to eat

14
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,600
Ask for braised pork

15
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:52,639
Add more ginger.

16
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,399
No shallots

17
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:55,639
Next, sauté another vegetable

18
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:56,919
Take another altar of wine

19
00:02:57,679 --> 00:02:57,960
All right.

20
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:01,880
Look at this boy

21
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,240
I wanted to invite you to eat something good

22
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:05,279
Now only in this place

23
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,080
Do it.

24
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,839
Light eyebrows

25
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:09,559
What to see?

26
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,240
I've never seen anyone beautiful

27
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:13,119
Who looked there

28
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,800
I'm not saying you're beautiful

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,839
I mean...

30
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,160
So I don't want them

31
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,080
See what I look like

32
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:29,679
You...

33
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:31,759
You are too patient

34
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:32,720
Eat a peanut.

35
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,000
Can eat so well

36
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:36,800
That sort of thing

37
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,600
I'm too lazy to pick up

38
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,199
Wait.

39
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:43,839
Wait.

40
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:53,160
You...

41
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:02,000
On the way to Shangzhou

42
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:05,119
A bag of chestnuts is delivered in the evening

43
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:08,360
You actually picked it up.

44
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,279
Rong Yu

45
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,320
You really are a good person.

46
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,799
Help me protect myself

47
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,720
But I've done so much

48
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,040
Something that embarrasses you

49
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,519
Today

50
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:32,040
I am sincere

51
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,160
I'll say a word to you.

52
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:35,839
Excuse me.

53
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,799
Say something wrong

54
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,799
Seems Rong Yu is more wrong

55
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:47,160
So forgive each other.

56
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,799
Can you forgive me

57
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,239
As the owner of the astrology room

58
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,200
Every day

59
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:43,760
Looking at the stars in the astrology room

60
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:45,679
It should be boring

61
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,920
Contrary to what He Girl thinks

62
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,040
Rong Yu thinks that astrology

63
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:51,959
Very interesting.

64
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:54,160
Everyone's destiny

65
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,799
Everything is written in the vast starry river

66
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,000
Or at a glance

67
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,239
Or zigzag

68
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,839
Or sad or happy

69
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,839
Rong Yu can experience it once

70
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,000
Apparently sitting in the yard

71
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,279
But he seems to have experienced it

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,760
Countless reincarnations

73
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,320
For example

74
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:16,839
For example...

75
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,000
So let me tell you

76
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,200
The story of the first emperor

77
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,079
La vie de Xianhuang

78
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,160
Can we tell the secret history of the palace

79
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,959
It doesn't hurt the kids

80
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:35,359
Yes.

81
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,040
I was banned from home

82
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,440
For a moment.

83
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm in a bad mood

84
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,079
I don't want to eat anything

85
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:48,200
I don't want to play anything

86
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,480
Thanks to a book of words

87
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,559
Support me until now

88
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,959
What he says

89
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,279
They are also children and girls

90
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,839
Just this person

91
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,679
Nothing new

92
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,679
I always seem alone

93
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,480
You see you see

94
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,160
I keep it on me whenever I want.

95
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,640
As long as you love it

96
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,200
Will definitely come out

97
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:15,320
Borrow your good words

98
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,040
You don't mean...

99
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,799
Do you want to tell the story of Xianhuang

100
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,600
So let's talk quickly

101
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:28,200
So, because of the prophecy of the astrological pavilion

102
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,000
Xianhuang got married

103
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,760
Those who don't like it are queens

104
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,079
And the true beloved

105
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,079
But she has become a quality for Jialin

106
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:35,559
Tenez Neng et Xianhuang

107
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,760
The idea of ​​being together

108
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,440
After all this hard work

109
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,839
Finally, there is one

110
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,119
The end of the river

111
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:45,000
And Xianhuang is also depressed for life

112
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:47,600
What is this?

113
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,440
Did I hear a ghost story

114
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,279
Your astrology room

115
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,200
Why is it so harmful

116
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,799
Fille de Feng Ming

117
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,920
The first queen is waiting

118
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:57,679
The astrology room just did

119
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:58,519
Things to do

120
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:00,559
It's me countless times

121
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,959
Return to the Emperor Star of the First Emperor

122
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,119
Will also tell him

123
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:03,920
Same result

124
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,160
I do not like it.

125
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:10,079
Although I shouldn't say that

126
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:11,839
But I'm still going to say

127
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,600
This emperor was too helpless

128
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,559
Here is the dish.

129
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,440
Guest officer is slow to use

130
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:42,599
You're going to drink.

131
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,760
How can Xuan Xing be without wine?

132
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,239
But last time

133
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,119
You're drunk.

134
00:08:55,239 --> 00:08:56,599
No need to drink so much this time.

135
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,039
One bowl will be enough.

136
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:04,280
Drink a bowl with me

137
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:05,000
How are you?

138
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:07,880
You want me to drink

139
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:11,080
All right.

140
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,919
Wait a second.

141
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,440
I still have something to say

142
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,440
Rong Yu

143
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,080
I just apologized to you

144
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,200
But I didn't say thank you

145
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:33,159
THANKS.

146
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,960
Always help me protect myself

147
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:37,440
To know you

148
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,719
It's me, He Jiuling, who is lucky to live

149
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,239
Until next time, I'm afraid

150
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:49,239
Things are bad

151
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,359
I can not talk.

152
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:53,960
Hope your visit to Hanshan Temple

153
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,239
Shun Shun Li

154
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,960
Be happy every day

155
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,080
Turns out I'm catching up today

156
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,400
Lantern Festival in this city

157
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,719
Let's play together

158
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,080
Let's go.

159
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,479
There won't be any chance later

160
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,000
You go-y.

161
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:48,559
How how.

162
00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:14,559
It hurts?

163
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:16,640
Take it.

164
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,640
THANKS.

165
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:21,159
It comes from our general house.

166
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,159
Unique Jin Chuang Medicine

167
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:31,799
THANKS.

168
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:34,719
Am I disturbing you.

169
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,039
That's not embarassing.

170
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:38,679
A question?

171
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:40,080
You are a great man

172
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,640
How is it made like tofu

173
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:43,159
A large piece turned green when touched

174
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,039
Crispier than our girls

175
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:46,400
You're crispy, just crispy

176
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,640
You are hiding

177
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,400
Such a big thing flies

178
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,000
Don't you see

179
00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:52,400
I don't know how to hide

180
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,520
I'll hide later

181
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,919
Later

182
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,760
What will it be used for later?

183
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,840
You always laugh

184
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:11,400
Every time I'm angry

185
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:13,159
You laugh when you want to hit someone

186
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,239
It's so irritating

187
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:21,119
Laugh if you are happy

188
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:31,679
As the owner of the astrology room

189
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,799
Rong Yu often needs to laugh

190
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:36,599
Or to soothe the heart

191
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:38,799
Or to resolve the malice

192
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,799
Rarely because of oneself

193
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:43,559
Not like you.

194
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:45,440
Can do whatever you want

195
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:47,559
Cry when you are sad

196
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,080
Laugh when you are happy

197
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:51,880
You will fight if you are wronged

198
00:13:52,479 --> 00:13:53,200
What do you want?

199
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,039
Go fight

200
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,200
See that you exist like this

201
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,719
Will make me feel

202
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,200
I still live in this fireworks on earth

203
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,880
Can be pyrotechnic

204
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,280
Most instantly

205
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:13,039
This evening

206
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,080
Rong Yu is very happy

207
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,880
Is really happy

208
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,039
Remember I just

209
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:22,320
I told you this story

210
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:24,840
The one who is the first emperor

211
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:29,080
You said he didn't take it

212
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,799
In Rong Yu's opinion

213
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:32,520
Fei Ye

214
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:36,359
Is the emperor of Jialin

215
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,359
Also married for Jialin

216
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,479
The only thing that went wrong

217
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,159
The year of sixteen

218
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:45,359
For the first time I saw this man.

219
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,599
Should learn to step back

220
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,239
Learn to let go

221
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,200
Instead of despairing

222
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,239
Hold on to her.

223
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,559
Such

224
00:14:57,359 --> 00:14:58,960
This person can be one forever

225
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,359
Innocent and pure little girl

226
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:04,280
Take one.

227
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,520
It's different.

228
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,799
But a completely happy life

229
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,479
You mean...

230
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:22,719
A heart dies

231
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,479
Better than two misfortunes

232
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,400
Thank you, He girl, for sending me this journey

233
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,280
We...

234
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,719
Do not worry.

235
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:45,520
I wouldn't give it to you if I knew.

236
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,960
But it's good

237
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,960
Nobody's heart dies

238
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,400
And there is no misfortune for two

239
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,039
Nobody needs to be sad

240
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:02,159
There's no point in me keeping this.

241
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:02,919
For you

242
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,159
You don't want to throw it away

243
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:12,119
THANKS.

244
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,080
Rong Yu

245
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,760
Don't lose your temper with me.

246
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:42,919
Later

247
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,799
I'll hide later

248
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,400
You just said the same thing

249
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,400
You're not dead yet

250
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:04,280
The sword you stabbed me before

251
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,040
I always remember

252
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,400
It's a narrow road

253
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,920
Who are you

254
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,119
I still remember that sword

255
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,239
You deserve it too.

256
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:13,239
Tuer Rong Yu

257
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,000
Kiss my ass.

258
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:16,880
Do not touch it.

259
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:04,119
He Girl.

260
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:04,599
Rong Yu

261
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:06,839
I thought that as long as you die

262
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,880
I didn't expect an extra funeral

263
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:14,160
Who buried who is not necessarily

264
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,199
You still have a hard mouth

265
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:18,439
See how I break your hands and feet

266
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,800
Tell you that life is better than death

267
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,479
Leave her alone.

268
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,079
What you want is my life

269
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,160
I give you my life

270
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,560
Why should I cope?

271
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:30,400
Give them life

272
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:32,079
Kiss my ass.

273
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,239
He Jiuling

274
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,520
He Jiuling

275
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,280
Band of beasts

276
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:43,400
I killed you.

277
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:05,839
Have I changed the wrong life

278
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:11,359
It's me who doesn't do it well

279
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,479
By the way

280
00:19:16,199 --> 00:19:16,920
I can't get rid of it.

281
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,760
Tiansha Lone Star's life board

282
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:21,319
Even if you let go

283
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,640
Loved one

284
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:28,760
Leave me too

285
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,839
Speaking of Jialin's first son

286
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:13,239
Rongzi is peerless

287
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,239
Legend similar to an immortal

288
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,040
To say that the boy who chooses the stars

289
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,520
Although there is power in heaven

290
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,839
How could it be his own life

291
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,319
Impossible to divine

292
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,719
It's just that the so-called people are easy to overcome themselves

293
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:32,880
I have to say it's extremely sad

294
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:35,160
Barely a month ago

295
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:37,239
Kangneung Kouchi murdered

296
00:20:37,439 --> 00:20:39,920
I haven't woken up until now

297
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:47,880
Lord Yung.

298
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:00,920
Is dead

299
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,000
Better to live than to die

300
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,119
Already thinking

301
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,640
If you don't say it yet

302
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,800
What did you do to Rong Yu?

303
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,959
I let you survive

304
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,000
I can't die

305
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,800
Did your astrology room not believe in life?

306
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:21,000
I knew someone had poisoned

307
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,800
Why should I do it myself

308
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,920
I've said it hundreds of times

309
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,000
I didn't poison him.

310
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:35,319
I don't know which hero is

311
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,040
This good thing for me

312
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,439
You...

313
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,000
Lord Yung.

314
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:46,439
Do such dirty things

315
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,599
Don't get your hands dirty

316
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:02,239
Taiyu

317
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,839
What is Rong Gongzi's diagnosis?

318
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:07,680
Everyone at Taitai Hospital

319
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,839
Everything is now in Rongfu

320
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,400
But this poison

321
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:12,280
They have never seen

322
00:22:12,439 --> 00:22:13,119
Never seen

323
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:14,640
How can I solve it

324
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,479
In my opinion,

325
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:20,199
I fear someone else will be poisoned

326
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,479
Someone else

327
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:26,680
How can there be anyone else

328
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:27,800
Who was it?

329
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,520
Having such a quarrel with Rong Yu

330
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,839
To put him to death

331
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:38,719
The nine spirits

332
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,239
How are the Nine Spirits?

333
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:44,280
What happened to Rong Yu

334
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,640
We haven't told him yet

335
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,800
The body always recovers

336
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,239
Just...

337
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,119
Just the left hand

338
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:27,959
I will do it.

339
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,439
I used this month's monthly money

340
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,079
I bought it for you.

341
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:31,560
So many beautiful hair accessories

342
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,000
You see...

343
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:32,839
Does it look good or not

344
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,160
Come.

345
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,359
Try to put it on.

346
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:43,959
You see...

347
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,640
How beautiful it is

348
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,239
Don't paint two small leather ropes every day

349
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,040
Not like a girl at all

350
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:52,959
You see...

351
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,239
How pretty it is.

352
00:23:58,199 --> 00:23:58,599
Everyone thought

353
00:23:58,719 --> 00:23:59,719
Are you a boy

354
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,680
The nine spirits, you see?

355
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,640
Does it look good or not

356
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:14,520
He San

357
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:16,160
I'm a little hungry.

358
00:24:16,439 --> 00:24:17,719
I'll find something to eat

359
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:49,160
Board

360
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:50,800
Big Brother

361
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:54,040
What will you do after saying the nine spirits

362
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,000
She is so strong

363
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,520
How can you stand to become like this

364
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,319
If I go there

365
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,839
Go early

366
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:05,079
It's my fault.

367
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:06,199
It's my fault.

368
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:12,920
The girl became like this

369
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:15,640
Rong Yu

370
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:19,640
I don't know when I'm going to wake up

371
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,199
If I didn't wake up

372
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
What should Linger do?

373
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:34,880
Take a step and watch a step

374
00:25:39,479 --> 00:25:39,760
By the way...

375
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:41,040
You two...

376
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,280
Don't feel uncomfortable when you see Linger

377
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:45,959
You are uncomfortable

378
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:47,560
She doesn't feel well either.

379
00:25:48,439 --> 00:25:49,239
Especially you...

380
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,920
I always wanted to make her happy

381
00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:55,800
Today

382
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,119
I can't help it today

383
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:00,920
Board

384
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,920
Don't let Uritan

385
00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:04,359
Go out with the spirit and relax

386
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:05,920
It's better than that.

387
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:07,280
So much at home

388
00:26:10,439 --> 00:26:10,760
All right.

389
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:11,800
Yes.

390
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,119
But I have to talk to him

391
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,479
Don't leave her in front of Linger

392
00:26:19,199 --> 00:26:20,239
Always lift Rong Yu

393
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:21,359
Yes

394
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,800
Yes.

395
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:31,680
What's wrong with the owner of Shaoguan

396
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:32,760
Yes.

397
00:26:38,439 --> 00:26:38,920
It is...

398
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,479
What is going on?

399
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,079
It is...

400
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,079
It is...

401
00:26:45,199 --> 00:26:45,520
How is it...

402
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:47,000
Are there signs of sobriety

403
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,800
Too cold this winter

404
00:26:49,239 --> 00:26:50,560
Cold stagnation in the body

405
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:53,119
Shaoguan owner's pulse is weak again

406
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:55,520
Before finding a solution

407
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,479
The old husband suggested

408
00:26:56,719 --> 00:26:58,680
Move the owner of Shaoguan to You Hot Spring

409
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,079
Zhuangzi with an earth dragon

410
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,040
Daily bath spring can practice body

411
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:02,839
And better

412
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Get through this winter

413
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,359
I have work.

414
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:10,839
Everyone comes back first

415
00:27:11,239 --> 00:27:12,400
No need to come to Rongfu every day

416
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,280
Yes

417
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:15,839
Yes

418
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:33,199
Closing the display screen

419
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:35,040
You dress your son

420
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:36,520
Move to another yard now

421
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:37,880
Yes

422
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:48,119
Come.

423
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,439
Miss He.

424
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,319
These are not satisfactory

425
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:17,640
I have another one here

426
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,800
The treasure of the town store

427
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:20,680
Wait a bit.

428
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:25,199
Is your whisk no good?

429
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,959
Why are you thinking about changing weapons

430
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,439
Not good.

431
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,839
Soldiers are not bloody

432
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:32,239
Even lighter and more beautiful

433
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,040
Can't protect himself

434
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,079
What's the point of asking?

435
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,359
Miss He.

436
00:28:38,239 --> 00:28:38,599
You see...

437
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,599
Short thorns

438
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,000
Small and light

439
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:42,560
Ideal for girls

440
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:43,160
You see...

441
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,439
Is also inlaid with agate stone

442
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:49,000
Show it to other guests

443
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,319
Miss He.

444
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:53,000
You said you wanted something.

445
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:55,640
Knife

446
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,479
Knife

447
00:28:57,199 --> 00:28:58,560
Eighteen weapons

448
00:28:58,599 --> 00:28:59,400
Nine long and nine short

449
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:00,359
The knife is short

450
00:29:00,959 --> 00:29:02,800
Of course you have to choose a knife to break the enemy and kill

451
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:05,479
I am really sorry

452
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,920
We Wuyuan Pavilion

453
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:08,479
Mainly with Kyung-chung's son

454
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:08,959
To do business

455
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:11,199
A weapon like a knife

456
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,920
It's indecent.

457
00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:15,000
Miss He.

458
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,359
You look good

459
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:18,040
They are all shops here

460
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:18,839
Me

461
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:22,839
But the knife is too heavy

462
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:24,520
Your hands

463
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,000
I won't always be like this

464
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,560
I can't afford it today

465
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,680
There's always a day when I can afford it

466
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,479
You have to give it to me in a moment

467
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,560
Choose a better weapon

468
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,319
Come back.

469
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,239
You are afraid of her.

470
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:45,959
I am not afraid.

471
00:29:46,479 --> 00:29:47,760
I agree with Rong Gongzi

472
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,599
Don't look for her

473
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,520
You're talking to trash

474
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,239
What agreement to make

475
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,239
Really?

476
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:51,520
You go-y.

477
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:52,160
Sister.

478
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,040
The nine spirits

479
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,000
Let go of Atan first.

480
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,239
The quarrel between us

481
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:15,040
It has nothing to do with her.

482
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,359
As long as you don't resist

483
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,760
I won't move it.

484
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:21,040
If you care about things in the palace

485
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:23,479
So think a little.

486
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,079
His own mouth

487
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:25,079
Why does it stink?

488
00:30:26,439 --> 00:30:28,439
All this virtue is so crazy

489
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:41,920
Struck!

490
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,359
Non...

491
00:31:02,239 --> 00:31:02,880
The nine spirits

492
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:05,640
Let me go.

493
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:06,199
Do not move.

494
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:07,520
Non...

495
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,560
The nine spirits

496
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:12,920
The nine spirits

497
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:13,520
Do not move.

498
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,640
Don't hit the beast

499
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,880
Don't move, Atan.

500
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:18,280
You don't even care about yourself

501
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:19,319
Can control others

502
00:31:19,719 --> 00:31:20,959
Get rid of it later

503
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,199
Hanging on Caichikou

504
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,599
I don't think his mouth is hard

505
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,319
That

506
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:52,000
Rong Yu

507
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:01,239
Rong Yu

508
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,839
Rong Yu

509
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,040
Rong Yu

510
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,560
Rong Yu

511
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,680
Is all alone

512
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:33,719
You thought he would be...

513
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:34,760
Protect yourself every day

514
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:37,359
What did you say?

515
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,199
Was injured and poisoned

516
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:42,520
Unconscious for over a month

517
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,719
You just married him

518
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,079
That's what happened

519
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:46,680
You really are a funeral star

520
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:53,040
What did you say?

521
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:53,880
How

522
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:55,239
You don't understand people

523
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:00,959
You give me

524
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,719
She was left without a whip

525
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,640
I'm afraid she won't succeed

526
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:04,479
Up

527
00:33:24,239 --> 00:33:24,599
Come.

528
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,680
Give me all.

529
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:29,839
Broke these bones

530
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,479
My hand is not right

531
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:35,079
Broke the bones of this body

532
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:37,520
My life should not be

533
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,479
You're not crazy.

534
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,520
You are a mad dog

535
00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:41,880
It's not working yet.

536
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,239
Walk.

537
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:50,479
The nine spirits

538
00:33:52,439 --> 00:33:53,760
Why are you so stupid

539
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:55,680
Your hands

540
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,599
And your hands?

541
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,599
Atan

542
00:34:00,719 --> 00:34:02,199
Take me home.

543
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:05,160
I have something to ask dad

544
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:12,959
Doctor

545
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,120
You touch gently.

546
00:34:14,479 --> 00:34:15,040
Gently.

547
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,479
It's orthopedics.

548
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:17,479
Can't be light

549
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,520
He San, I can take it

550
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:20,719
Are you calling dad?

551
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,520
Called

552
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,280
Tape, tape, tape.

553
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,719
Let your hand down

554
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:25,159
It's not

555
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,159
See an old man

556
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,280
What about Rong Yu?

557
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,239
Is he awake now?

558
00:34:29,439 --> 00:34:30,000
Where is he?

559
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:31,120
What else?

560
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,239
Rong Yu can't tolerate Yu

561
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:35,120
You tell dad

562
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,040
Who beat you like that?

563
00:34:37,439 --> 00:34:38,479
Dad reminds you

564
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,679
Is Rong Yu poisoned?

565
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,479
I asked them

566
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:42,560
They all say there isn't one.

567
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,399
Dad, tell me

568
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,080
I will listen to the truth

569
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,439
Dad talks about your hand

570
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,239
My hands are fine

571
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,159
I know.

572
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,520
You all care about me.

573
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,760
I've also been careful recently

574
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:01,719
I'm afraid my hands are lost

575
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:03,959
But my hand...

576
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,639
Even if he is disabled

577
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,520
I will never shed a tear

578
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,239
But if...

579
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,760
Rong Yu, he can't wake up anymore.

580
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:14,959
Don't say my hand is lost

581
00:35:15,879 --> 00:35:17,560
Even if I die 10,000 times

582
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:21,439
I can't be relieved

583
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:24,719
Linger

584
00:35:25,439 --> 00:35:26,560
Linger, listen to dad

585
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:28,639
Do not Cry

586
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,159
Shall we heal the wound first?

587
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:31,439
Listen daddy

588
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,600
Listen daddy

589
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,840
What do you want to know in a moment

590
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:36,000
Dad tells you

591
00:35:36,439 --> 00:35:37,840
Dad says okay

592
00:35:38,479 --> 00:35:38,800
Be wise.
