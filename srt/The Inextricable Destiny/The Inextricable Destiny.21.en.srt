Regarding how to destroy the star chart,

4
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,799
I have some ideas.

5
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:47,080
But I still need Your Majesty's help.

6
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,128

7
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,880
I want to set the Astrology Pavilion on fire,

8
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,640
but it is bustling with people.

9
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,760
So when I take action,

10
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,500
I want Your Majesty to make

11
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,560
most of the fortunetellers leave.

12
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,560
You want me to find a way

13
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,680
to create a distraction, right?

14
00:02:03,264 --> 00:02:04,319
Yes.

Be it the early Astrology Festival

As for how to burn it down, I will find a way.

18
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,552
That's easy. We have a perfect excuse.

19
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:17,472
What?

20
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,560
The birthday banquet.

21
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:21,200
I will use the excuse of praying for blessings

22
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,620
and summon all the fortunetellers
into the palace.

23
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,039
It's not very logical,

24
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,780

So, I can't perform with you

41

the right to speak?

64
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:23,380
What do you mean by 'dump'?

65
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,440
Luckily, someone told me
he had a problem with his brain.

69

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,600
What should we do now?

86
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,160
Should we inform the officials

87
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,800
that you'd be playing the zither alone,
or should we just not go?

88
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,216
Of course, he will go.

89
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,024
It was confirmed, so why wouldn't he go?

90
00:05:33,536 --> 00:05:35,399
Will the Young Master perform alone?

91
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:40,759

every once in a while,

101
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:30,600
I've even put on weight.

103
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,639
I won't say anything else.

104

105
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,340

Chu finally has finally come around.

107
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,019
But, moving forward,

108
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:47,560
you must not use your status
to bully He Jiuling.

109

Regardless of whether she has done wrong,

110
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,240
I will always back her up.

111
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,720
I only had one confrontation with her.

112
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,639
How did you come
to know about it, Your Majesty?

113
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,040
Did you really bully her?

114
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,904
I…

115
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,540
Her family members are spies,

116
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,020
and she's a wicked person.

117
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,360
What happened in the He family
is the adults' business.

118
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,680
Don't say these things again in the future.

119
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:17,240
I know. I won't bully her again in the future.

120

And that Rong Yu.

121
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:23,759
You should also be more
tolerant of him in the future.

122
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,839
Don't have conflicts with him, understood?

123
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,820

125
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,660

We can start the banquet.

127
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,500
I heard that later in the banquet,

128
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,320
you and Rong Yu will perform a duet.

129
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,680

Why does the Empress Dowager still not know

135
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,940
that I'm not planning to go on stage?

136
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,040
Wasn't He Jiuling supposed to handle this?

137
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,540
If I get called up later,

138
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,120
I won't know what to do.

139
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,920
It would be so embarrassing.

140
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:20,960
He Jiuling, she did it on purpose.

141
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,840
Your Highness, should we go and explain it
to the Empress Dowager?

142

146
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,360
If I go and tell her such disappointing news,

147
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,780
would she still be in a good mood?

148
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,140
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Besides,

149
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,799
she just gave me a hint,

150
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:41,440

bullying Rong Yu again.

What a great dancer.

185
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,224
She's good.

186
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,640
Nice.

187
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:22,656
Good.

188
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:27,060
Very good.

189
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,759
What a fantastic dance.

190
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:33,519
I really didn't expect
such a big surprise today.

191
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,279
Come, reward her.

192
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,480
- Yes.
- Princess.

193
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,300
Let the Princess change

194
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,420
and come back for the reward.

195
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,200
So it was the Princess.

196
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,320
Truly a stunning sword dance
with extraordinary charisma.

197
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,519
Rumor has it that the Princess is getting
married into the Astrology Pavilion.

198
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,880
I can tell the young master
has recovered quite well.

199

These two are truly a match made in heaven.

200
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:01,500
Indeed.

201
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,519
From where I see it,

202
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,260
everyone has amnesia.

203
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,200
Did they all forget about Rong Yu's wife?

204
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,260
It may take some time to get changed.

205
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,759
How about rewarding Rong Yu first?

206
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:17,824
I see.

207
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,248

As their Madam,

224
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,720
it's not impossible for you
to secretly start a fire.

225
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:06,240
But the star chart is heavily guarded.

226
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,300
Directly burning it holds a great risk,

227
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,680
and the chances of success are not high.

228
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,240
It would be better to create chaos.

229
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:18,500
First, let your people start a fire
outside the Astrology Pavilion,

230
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,839
disturbing the entire place.

231
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,560
Even if the guards of the star chart
do not leave to put out the fire,

232
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,440
they will lower their guard when you appear.

233
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,839
When you reach the door of the star chart room,

234
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:29,640
<i>[Star Chart Room]</i>
make them leave to put out the fire.

worth being sad about.

Lord Rong, we will take my leave.

339
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,179
After seeing the Star Chart Room on fire,

340
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:21,000
Madam tried to put out the fire with us.

341
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,100
Then the fire became too big to control,

342
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,559
so we ran to get help…

343
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:29,240
Then I lost consciousness
after inhaling some smoke.

344
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,319
I don't know what happened afterward.

345
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:34,319
I didn't know that the Madam
was trapped in the Star Chart Room.

Go.

349
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,560
- No way.
- Zhanping.

350
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,360
- There's no way that the Madam did this.
- Quickly, go.

351
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,840
If you take her away, you'll be killing her.

352
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,840
I leave Rong Yu in your hands.

353
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,319
Quickly. Go.

354
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,640
What? He Jiuling, she…

355
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,704
What did the doctor say?

356
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,008
His life isn't in danger.

357
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,440
But he doesn't wake up.

358
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,256
It's because

359
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,000
he doesn't want to.

360
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:14,816
He doesn't want to?

361
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,799
You came here today

362
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,559
not just to see Rong Yu, right?

363
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,980
The little Emperor

364
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:31,080
has handed over complete authority
of Changye's gold and silver mines to me.

365
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,039
I am about to leave for Changye.

366
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,039
Before I leave, I want you
to help calculate my fate.

367
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,279
The Star Chart has been destroyed.

368
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:44,880
With Yu seriously injured,

369
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:49,480
the Astrology Pavilion

370
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,279
will collapse and fall.

371
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,048
In this situation,

372
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,799
I have no mood

373
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,119
to make divinations.

374
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:05,600
Even if I could,

375
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,599
it would be hitting my own signboard.

376
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,559
I hope Your Highness can forgive me.

377
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,359
Lord Rong, your health…

378
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:19,680
Don't worry.

379
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,440
That disaster left by the He family.

380
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:26,656
I will be fine

381
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,680
until I see her die.

382
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,939
Burning my Astrology Pavilion…

383
00:31:32,939 --> 00:31:34,240
Burning my Astrology Pavilion…

384
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:37,119
How dare she?

385
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,079
Why would she do this all of a sudden?

386
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:42,880
Could it be…

387
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,440
I should have noticed her abnormality
in the previous days.

388
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,599
She must have known

389
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:54,799
that I wanted to exterminate the He family.

390
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:59,799
You and I have always
been cautious in our dealings,

391
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,920
even the little emperor does not know,

392
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,000
so how did she find out?

393
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,920
What does it matter now?

394
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,799
The most important thing

395
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,160
is that she deserves to die.

396
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,759
The young one made Yu dumb.

397
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:24,384
And the old one

398
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:27,920
made the excuse to go to Nanjiang
and broke off the engagement.

399
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,080
There is not a single good person
in the He family.

400
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,799
They should pay for their sins
with their lives for Yu.

401
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:42,100
Lord Rong, I…

402
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,480
I was wrong to be soft-hearted.

403
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,640
My fault led to the current disaster.

404
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:51,219
When she came back,

405
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,260
I should have disregarded Yu's feelings

406
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:56,240
and let her die with the He family.

407
00:32:57,359 --> 00:32:58,680
Just because of such a woman,

408
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,728
Yu

409
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,119
is unwilling to wake up

410
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:07,519
and even more unwilling to live.

411
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,496
Very good.

412
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,559
Very good!

413
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:24,896
She will pay

414
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:27,240
with a miserable death.

415
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,839
I want her torn into pieces.

416
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:32,000
I want to burn

417
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:34,559
her bones to ashes.

418
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:36,960
Lord Rong,

419
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,459
that troublemaker has no one now.

420
00:33:40,459 --> 00:33:42,880
No one will know if we kill her.

421
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,040
Rest assured, before I go to Changye,

422
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,960
I will have someone take care of this matter

423
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:51,480
and avenge your anger, Lord Rong.

424
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,519
Master, some fortunetellers
have come to see you.

425
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,816
Master.

426
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,184
Master.

427
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,776
Take it slow.

428
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:01,719
<i>I should have noticed her abnormality
in the previous days.</i>

429
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,080
<i>She must have known that I wanted

430
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,260

431
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,299
<i>No one will know if we kill her.</i>

432
00:35:14,299 --> 00:35:16,980
<i>She will pay with a miserable death.</i>

433
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,199
<i>Torn to pieces, burned to ashes.</i>

434
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,536
Young master.

435
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,079
Hurry, help me out.

436
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,896
Young master.

437
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,816
Young master.

438
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:31,959
<i>♫ Under the setting sun in dusk ♫</i>

439
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:39,979

00:36:39,979 --> 00:36:46,949
