Miss, please.

00:02:16,324 --> 00:02:19,580
What do the numbers on this pass mean?

10
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,119

13
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:29,280
One number for each person. Make sure you hold on to it.

14
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,600
With so many people, the odds of being called out should be small. Right?

15
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,040
With so many people, the odds of being called out should be small. Right?

16
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,239
When the sun rises from the Earth, it affects all beings.

The sun sets down on Earth.

20
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,399
We enter the world of yin.

21
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:24,919
In autumn, yin and yang fight.

22
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,119
In winter, yang hides in the strongest yin.

23
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:27,460
When the long night ends, the sun rises again.

24
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,520

All things are visible.

26
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,040
It is the manifestation of the South.

27
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,319
Good!

28
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:39,400

- Sage… 
 - Miss.

30
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,380
You're here for the Star-picking Master. Right?

00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,740
How can you tell?

32
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,920
The girls coming here, ten out of ten are here for him.

00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,020
Let me tell you. The most popular images in the capital are all from my hands.

This is my unpublished work, extremely valuable for collection.

47

You will definitely thank me after seeing it.

48
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:38,040
I thank you now.

49
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,639
- Do you look down upon my painting skills? 
 - Not at all.

50
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,300
I'm giving it to you for free but you refused.

51
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,720
To think that I, Xiaoyao, who was invincible in the painting world,

52
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,279
- would be reduced to this. 
 - Just shut up!

53
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,140
The ninth divination, is no war on the frontier.

54
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,840
The tenth divination, is peace and health in the country.

55
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,380
Great!

56
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,140
What's wrong?

57
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:20,200
Do you all think Rong Yu is a celestial being?

58
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,400
Of course.

59
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,680
I rely on him to eat.

60
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,660
He personally selects the diviners.

61
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:30,079
- I advise you to change professions tomorrow. 
 - Why?

62
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,560
Because today, I am going to make him a laughingstock.

63
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,519
Tomorrow, the Astrology Pavilion will deliver the results to your home.

64
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:40,860
Why do we have to wait until tomorrow?

65
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,260
What?

66
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,820
Who is that? What is she doing?

67
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,144
What are you up to?

68
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,420
- What's up with this person? 
 - Yes.

69
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,519
I've never seen her before.

70
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,799
Could it be that the young master of the Astrology Pavilion is not capable enough that he needs someone else to do it?

71
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,820
Could it be that the young master of the Astrology Pavilion is not capable enough that he needs someone else to do it?

72
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,240
Or maybe you need time to investigate them to fabricate and make up some divination?

73
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,240
Or maybe you need time to investigate them to fabricate and make up some divination?

74
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,360
Or maybe you need time to investigate them to fabricate and make up some divination?

75
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,040
Who are you and why are you making a scene?

76
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,460
Don't be scared.

77
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,520
What's there to be afraid of?

78
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,180
I am not doing anything.

79
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,299
What is she doing?

80
00:06:25,299 --> 00:06:27,000
Could it be that nowadays Jialin people can't even speak in public?

81
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,179
Could it be that nowadays Jialin people can't even speak in public?

82
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:31,720
How disappointing.

83
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:37,072
It's fine.

84
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:40,284
Everybody step back.

85
00:06:44,179 --> 00:06:45,820
Miss, waiting for tomorrow is not for me.

86
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,820
Miss, waiting for tomorrow is not for me.

87
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,480
The fate, fortune, and calamity of someone should only be known by the person himself.

88
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,859
The fate, fortune, and calamity of someone should only be known by the person himself.

89
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:55,279
If I cannot reveal it in public, why should everyone sit here in vain?

90
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:58,040
If I cannot reveal it in public, why should everyone sit here in vain?

91
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,980
Who said that everyone doesn't want to reveal their divination to everybody?

92
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,639
Who said that everyone doesn't want to reveal their divination to everybody?

93
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,460
I am willing to let everybody see my fate.

94
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,539
I am willing to let everybody see my fate.

95
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:12,639
What? What is happening?

96
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:16,319
I heard that the young master of the Astrology Pavilion is very gifted.

97
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,279
I heard that the young master of the Astrology Pavilion is very gifted.

98
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,100
Stop hiding it and tell me my fate so that everyone can see.

99
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,199
Stop hiding it and tell me my fate so that everyone can see.

100
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:25,219
Stop hiding it and tell me my fate so that everyone can see.

101
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:28,540
- How about it? 
 - If not chosen, no divination.

102
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,160
This is the rule set at the Astrology Festival every year,

103
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,620
This is the rule set at the Astrology Festival every year,

104
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,800
not something you can break with a single word.

105
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,440
What if everyone asks our young master to practice divination?

106
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,800
What if everyone asks our young master to practice divination?

107
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,260
What if everyone asks our young master to practice divination?

108
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,340
Exactly.

109
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,020
- Why should she have a divination? 
 - Yes.

110
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,620
She doesn't even know the rules.

111
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,460
Well, it's easy.

112
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,819
- You. 
 - How can she do that?

113
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:51,260
- Such a troublemaker. 
 - Did she just grab them?

114
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,920
Come on, take this rule-breaker

115
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,399
- and… 
 - I am following the rules here.

116
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,079
Number 48.

117
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:04,260
Number 48, anyone?

118
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,304
- Who, who is it? 
 - Number 48. Not me, not us, right?

119
00:08:06,304 --> 00:08:08,979
Number 48, right? Over here.

120
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:11,680
It's me. I can't believe I got chosen.

121
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:17,344
Look at me.

122
00:08:17,344 --> 00:08:19,680
Who is number 48?

123
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,480
He-He-He Jiuling.

124
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,380
Very good.

125
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,480
It's me.

126
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,480
He Jiuling.

127
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,339
I followed the rules, right?

128
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:33,560
You, you, you…

129
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,900
What about me?

130
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,620
Who else wants to claim this number 48?

131
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,879
If there is, bravely step forward.

132
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:51,000
It seems that I am the chosen one.

133
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,659
Then please, Young Master.

134
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:54,879
Miss He, what do you want to prognosticate?

135
00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:00,759
Of course, it's my marriage fate.

136
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:12,672
Well, please...

137
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,699
Miss, tell me your birth date.

138
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:18,020
In the sixth year of Zhenyuan era, December 22nd.

139
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,820
In the sixth year of Zhenyuan era, December 22nd.

140
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,240
It's Jiuling again. She's always like this.

141
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,264
Look at her.

142
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:30,660
Why aren't you saying anything?

143
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,840
How is the prognostication result?

144
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,320
Do you need to look so long?

145
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,579
Could it be that you can't see it?

146
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:42,440
The proficiency of the Young Master of the Astrology Pavilion is just so-so.

147
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,320
The proficiency of the Young Master of the Astrology Pavilion is just so-so.

148
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,220
What's the difference between you and those who fish for fame?

149
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,200
This makes me question the standard of your Astrology Pavilion.

150
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,180
Don't talk nonsense.

151
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,000
What did I say wrong?

152
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,519
I have seen the result.

153
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,720
However, Miss He, could you let me confirm it again?

154
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,159
However, Miss He, could you let me confirm it again?

155
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,679
How?

156
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:10,399
It's presumptuous of me, but can Miss He come close to the tent so that I can touch the top of your head?

157
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,740
It's presumptuous of me, but can Miss He come close to the tent so that I can touch the top of your head?

158
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,480
It's presumptuous of me, but can Miss He come close to the tent so that I can touch the top of your head?

159
00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:21,384
Sure.

160
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,140
Why do I smell butterfly orchid?

161
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,659
Forget it.

162
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:28,899
If you tell the truth that our marital fate is not good, I will let you go today.

163
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:30,919
If you tell the truth that our marital fate is not good, I will let you go today.

164
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,360
If you tell the truth that our marital fate is not good, I will let you go today.

165
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,880
If you dare to take advantage of me saying anything good about it,

166
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,760
If you dare to take advantage of me saying anything good about it,

167
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,320
I will let you, the Star-picking Master fall into pieces today.

168
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,879
I will let you, the Star-picking Master fall into pieces today.

169
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,176
Miss He.

170
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,576
My apologies.

171
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,200
Rong Yu,

172
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,860
you know me.

173
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,200
Although we have not formally met,

174

 - Heshan.

Is the marital state with Miss He not good?

281
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,940
I did not see her marital fate.

282
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,060
Why not?

283
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,279
She is your fiancée after all, isn't she?

284
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,820
Because I saw...

285
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,712
that four years later,

286
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,699
she will die in Jialin.

287
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,680
How is that possible?

288
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,380
When the old proprietor arranged this marriage, did he not figure this out?

289
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,220
When the old proprietor arranged this marriage, did he not figure this out?

290
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,240
Her fate is peculiar.

291
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,480
It's normal that you can't figure it out just from her birthday.

292
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,000
Even I was only able to discern it vaguely.

293
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,160
If Miss He can only live for four years, Young Master, wouldn't you…

294
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,100
If Miss He can only live for four years, Young Master, wouldn't you…

295
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:12,419
As divination scholars,

we see the signs and the images not to comply with fate

we see the signs and the images not to comply with fate

299
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,000
but to strive for another way out of this destiny.

but to strive for another way out of this destiny.

301
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,940
A noble son comes from a poor family, and the sick must strive for survival.

302
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,020
A noble son comes from a poor family, and the sick must strive for survival.

303
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,439
Faced with extreme situations, they must experience severe pain to survive.

304
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:31,859
Faced with extreme situations, they must experience severe pain to survive.

305
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:34,140
Aren't all people in the world...

307
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,400
Young Master, you wouldn't possibly be considering…

308
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,200
Young master, you wouldn't possibly be considering…

309
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:50,932
I'm not considering,

310
00:19:51,499 --> 00:19:53,599
I have to…

311
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,740
Even if this path is difficult, I have to change her fate against nature.

312
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,779
Even if this path is difficult, I have to change her fate against nature.

313
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:02,240
Even if this path is difficult, I have to change her fate against nature.

314
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:06,000
Jiuling, it seems you really stirred things up at the Astrology Festival yesterday.

315
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Jiuling, it seems you really stirred things up at the Astrology Festival yesterday.

316
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
No wonder the Rong Mansion sent someone early in the morning.

317
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,119
They couldn't wait.

318
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:15,240
- Really? 
 - Yes, the moment Lord Rong arrived, I ran over to call you.

319
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,560
- Really? 
 - Yes, the moment Lord Rong arrived, I ran over to call you.

320
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,619
It's worth getting beaten up yesterday.

321
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:21,200
Get up and get dressed.

322
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,539
Rong Yu seems like a weak guy but he's quick to take action.

323
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:24,980
Rong Yu seems like a weak guy but he's quick to take action.

324
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,199
Yes, after all, you have been Rong Yu's fiancée for more than a decade.

325
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:28,639
Yes, after all, you have been Rong Yu's fiancée for more than a decade.

326
00:20:28,639 --> 00:20:30,640
Lord Rong should compensate more when the time comes.

327
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,780
We can't lose out on this.

328
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
- Hurry up. 
 - Okay.

329
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,780
What did you say?

330
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,559
How could this happen?

331
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:51,360
Did Rong Yu get hurt?

332
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,240
Fortunately, Rong Yu wasn't hurt.

333
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:56,600
But I heard it was the Cheng family seeking revenge.

334
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,260
But I heard it was the Cheng family seeking revenge.

335
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,859
You mean Cheng Ji?

336
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,660
Brazen and shameless.

337
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,559
They are a family of thieves and prostitutes.

338
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,400
If Rong Yu hadn't found out the location of the thirty million silver disaster relief fund,

339
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,480
If Rong Yu hadn't found out the location of the thirty million silver disaster relief fund,

340
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,540
I'm afraid the Cheng family would still be spreading rumors now,

341
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,439
I'm afraid the Cheng family would still be spreading rumors now,

342
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:18,980
saying that the silver transporting caravan was swept away by a flash flood.

343
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,799
saying that the silver transporting caravan was swept away by a flash flood.

344
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,800
They frittered away the life-saving money of disaster victims behind the emperor's back.

345
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,440
They frittered away the life-saving money of disaster victims behind the emperor's back.

346
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,360
Punishing them to do hard labor in the borderlands was already a great favor from the emperor.

347
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,620
Punishing them to do hard labor in the borderlands was already a great favor from the emperor.

348
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:34,300
They dared to run back from the northwest to take revenge.

349
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,528
These days, even rats dare to challenge cats.

350
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:39,000
These days, even rats dare to challenge cats.

351
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,719
If it hadn't been for the emperor's kindness in the first place, there wouldn't have been yesterday's incident.

352
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:43,360
If it hadn't been for the emperor's kindness in the first place, there wouldn't have been yesterday's incident.

353
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,080
Something huge happened yesterday.

354
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,420
I wish I had gone with you.

355
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,119
Today, I brought some gifts to express my gratitude.

356
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:51,360
If it weren't for Jiuling, those people would have probably already taken Rong Yu's life and escaped without a trace.

357
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,759
If it weren't for Jiuling, those people would have probably already taken Rong Yu's life and escaped without a trace.

358
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:55,460
If it weren't for Jiuling, those people would have probably already taken Rong Yu's life and escaped without a trace.

359
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,799
I wouldn't be able to sit here and talk calmly to you.

360
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,460
I wouldn't be able to sit here and talk calmly to you.

361
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,000
Jiuling is indeed a blessed kid.

362
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,279
Jiuling is indeed a blessed kid.

363
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,659
She is a lucky kid indeed.

364
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,380
But I'm a little confused.

365
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,920
The gang riding Rong Yu's horse almost fled outside the bridge. Suddenly, something went wrong with the horse.

366
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,500
The gang riding Rong Yu's horse almost fled outside the bridge. Suddenly, something went wrong with the horse.

367
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,600
The gang riding Rong Yu's horse almost fled outside the bridge. Suddenly, something went wrong with the horse.

368
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,160
I must say it's a little suspicious.

369
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,179
I must say it's a little suspicious.

370
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:21,699
It's me! It's me!

371
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:26,319
Why are you out here when there are guests at home?

372
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:28,380
You were wondering about the horses. Right?

373
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,519
It was me who…

374
00:22:32,219 --> 00:22:34,040
What did you do?

375
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,800
I made a small achievement.

376
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,480
And I'm a bit excited.

377
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,248
Speak quickly.

378
00:22:41,248 --> 00:22:43,539
I have been persistently feeding medication from He Jiuling

379
00:22:43,539 --> 00:22:45,120
I have been persistently feeding medication from He Jiuling

380
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,539
to the war horses at the Rong Mansion every day.

381
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:48,720
That's why the horses became weak and drowsy fainting at critical moments.

382
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,920
That's why the horses became weak and drowsy fainting at critical moments.

383
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,916
That's true.

384
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,280
What did you feed the horses? Tell me.

385
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,732
I…

386
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,440
General He, don't be mad now.

387
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,919
- Are you crazy? 
 - I'm about to take the spring exam. Right?

388
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:07,880
I want someone to credit me for a meritorious deed.

389
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,740
It seems that my gratitude gift was too little.

390
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,599
After the afternoon meal, I'll send someone over.

391
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,420
I'm undeserving of your praise.

392
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,919
Truly undeserving.

393
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:20,120
Now that we have agreed on the important matters…

394
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,519
Now that we have agreed on the important matters…

395
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:22,880
I'm going to return home.

396
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,999
Please take a look at the list of betrothal gifts.

397
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:25,520
Please take a look at the list of betrothal gifts.

398
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,020
Our Astrology Pavilion will send them over once we've calculated the best day this month.

399
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,259
Our Astrology Pavilion will send them over once we've calculated the best day this month.

400
00:23:29,259 --> 00:23:30,600
- As for the day of the engagement, that will be up to you. 
 - All right.

401
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,540
- As for the day of the engagement, that will be up to you. 
 - All right.

402
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:37,240
Isn't he here to call off the engagement?

403
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:40,516
Why are you here, too?

404
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,740
Look at your messy hair!

405
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,860
What on earth are you doing out here? Go.

406
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,388
Go back.

407
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,620
Lord Rong, I'm sorry for my way of teaching my daughter.

408
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,560
I'm embarrassed.

409
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,800
Rong Yu calculated that the outcome of our marriage was not good.

410
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,440
Rong Yu calculated that the outcome of our marriage was not good.

411
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,639
Father…

412
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:02,920
- You! 
 - We must cancel this marriage!

413
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,859
Rong Yu hasn't mentioned anything like that to me.

414
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:14,260
He must have forgotten to tell you.

415
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,959
But it's the same if I tell you.

416
00:24:15,959 --> 00:24:17,200
He Jiuling…

417
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,319
What nonsense are you talking about?

418
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:21,499
You…

419
00:24:21,499 --> 00:24:22,799
How dare you avoid me!

420
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,339
You hide from me?

421
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,659
I'll teach you a lesson today,

422
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,744
You rebellious girl!

423
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:35,179
- You'll see! 
 - General, don't act rashly.

424
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:43,400
If it was indeed calculated by Rong Yu, he would definitely not hide it from me.

425
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,060
If it was indeed calculated by Rong Yu, he would definitely not hide it from me.

426
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:48,400
And as for visiting the General's Mansion this time to discuss the marriage,

427
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,459
he mentioned that Miss He had strongly requested it yesterday.

428
00:24:50,459 --> 00:24:52,880
he mentioned that Miss He had strongly requested it yesterday.

429
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,200
I didn't.

430
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,560
How could I possibly let him propose marriage?

431
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,120
As for the matter of marriage, if you find it so hard to speak, then I understand.

432
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,480
As for the matter of marriage, if you find it so hard to speak, then I understand.

433
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,559
As for the matter of marriage, if you find it so hard to speak, then I understand.

434
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,720
It seems we're on the same page.

435
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,219
I will wait for you at my house.

436
00:25:06,219 --> 00:25:07,460
The sooner it is settled, the better. You must act quickly.

437
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,408
The sooner it is settled, the better. You must act quickly.

438
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,720
Crap.

439
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,788
A misunderstanding.

440
00:25:14,788 --> 00:25:17,200
This must be a misunderstanding,

441
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,840
A misunderstanding?

442
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:27,340
Didn't Miss He see what was going on and pretend to cause trouble at the Astrology Festival

443
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:34,340
to draw these assassins into chaos and then, disregard your own safety and save Rong Yu?

444
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,880
I thought you cared a lot about him.

445
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,820
I thought you cared a lot about him.

446
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,400
Miss He, don't worry.

447
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,620
I won't let Rong Yu do you wrong.

448
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,999
Lord Rong, this is a big misunderstanding.

449
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:48,900
I didn't pretend to cause trouble. I was really…

450
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,972
He…

451
00:25:58,972 --> 00:26:01,100
Let me ask one more question.

452
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,560
Are you wearing Rong Yu's cloak?

453
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,640
Are you wearing Rong Yu's cloak?

454
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:09,560
Well…

455
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,900
This cloak is made from the fur of the snow mountain silver fox.

456
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,580
Not only is it extremely rare and expensive,

457
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:19,440
moreover, it was a fox hunted by the emperor himself and then given to Rong Yu.

458
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,780
I couldn't possibly not recognize it.

459
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:25,000
I don't know what to say to you.

460
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,760
I provide you with whatever you need, but why are you stealing other people's clothes?

461
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,620
I provide you with whatever you need, but why are you stealing other people's clothes?

462
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,160
You…

463
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,064
Dad.

464
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,199
I didn't steal it.

465
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:34,340
Rong Yu did me wrong.

466
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,520
Enough with your nonsense.

467
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,520
I will leave now.

468
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,419
Lord Rong,

469
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:44,520
please don't take to heart what my daughter just said.

470
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,068
please don't take to heart what my daughter just said.

471
00:26:46,068 --> 00:26:47,820
I'm going to discipline my children so I won't keep you.

472
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,280
I'm going to discipline my children so I won't keep you.

473
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,720
Of course.

474
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,820
Miss He is good-hearted.

475
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,839
General He, do not blame her too much.

476
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:57,340
I'll take my leave.

477
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,796
Please.

478
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,459
- Zong Ming. 
 - Here.

479
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:05,700
- See Lord Rong out. 
 - Yes, Master.

480
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,340
Lord Rong.

481
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,579
Stupid girl.

482
00:27:10,579 --> 00:27:12,160
Where are you?

483
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,939
You dare to hide.

484
00:27:13,939 --> 00:27:14,960
Stop hiding.

485
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,380
What a foolish girl.

486
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,219
- Don't run. 
 - Dad, it's a misunderstanding.

487
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,340
Father, a misunderstanding.

488
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,880
Come here.

489
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,079
Kneel down.

490
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:26,340
Stop covering for her!

491
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,980
- Dad. 
 - Are you still going to cover for her?

492
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,239
- Don't run. 
 - Easy.

493
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:31,600
- Stop. 
 - It hurts so bad.

494
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,400
- Stupid girl. 
 - Stop right there.

495
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,160
Jiuling, you better run.

496
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,680
- Just run. 
 - Stop.

497
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:43,539
Stop shouting. Stop it.

498
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:46,200
- Have some mercy. 
 - Shut up.

499
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:58,619
Dad was merciless.

500
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:02,880
Now that I think about it, since you came back from Mount Wuhua, it's been almost two months.

501
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,080
Now that I think about it, since you came back from Mount Wuhua, it's been almost two months.

502
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,880
Now that I think about it, since you came back from Mount Wuhua, it's been almost two months.

503
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,880
And I've taken more beatings for you in these two months than in the past 16 years.

504
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,600
And I've taken more beatings for you in these two months than in the past 16 years.

505
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,299
Look. Here.

506
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:13,540
Here, and here.

507
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:17,140
A man who's never been beaten cannot be considered a true man.

508
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:20,419
A man who's never been beaten cannot be considered a true man.

509
00:28:20,419 --> 00:28:22,096
That makes sense.

510
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,216
Wait.

511
00:28:26,216 --> 00:28:28,539
I am going to take the spring examination soon and I can't afford to break legs now.

512
00:28:28,539 --> 00:28:31,279
I am going to take the spring examination soon and I can't afford to break legs now.

513
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:41,464
So what are you going to do now?

514
00:28:41,464 --> 00:28:44,279
So what are you going to do now?

515
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,179
I'm working on it.

516
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,540
Judging by his looks the other day, his eyes were dodging when he looked at me.

517
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,399
Judging by his looks the other day, his eyes were dodging when he looked at me.

518
00:28:55,399 --> 00:28:57,600
He is obviously very scared of me.

519
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,040
I guess he wasn't really trying to marry me.

520
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,380
I guess he wasn't really trying to marry me.

521
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,360
I was wrong to not make it obvious that I hate him

522
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,979
I was wrong to not make it obvious that I hate him

523
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:08,499
and he now has a misunderstanding.

524
00:29:08,499 --> 00:29:10,620
Since he misunderstood, we should have a good talk.

525
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,460
Since he misunderstood, we should have a good talk.

526
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,059
If you're going to talk to him, what are you doing with a knife?

527
00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:18,379
If you're going to talk to him, what are you doing with a knife?

528
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,108
Just playing with it casually.

529
00:29:27,534 --> 00:29:32,476
[Astrology Pavilion]

530
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,100
What did Miss He write that made you so happy?

531
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:43,580
She wants to see me.

532
00:29:44,739 --> 00:29:46,500
You have to go then.

533
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,779
During the two months back to the capital, you and Heshan have been cleaning up things caused by Miss He.

534
00:29:50,779 --> 00:29:52,680
Only once, Heshan didn't act in time and Lord Song reported it to the General's Mansion.

535
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,200
Only once, Heshan didn't act in time and Lord Song reported it to the General's Mansion.

536
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,320
And that Third Young Master He comes to our Rong Mansion to climb the wall whenever he likes.

537
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,520
And that Third Young Master He comes to our Rong Mansion to climb the wall whenever he likes.

538
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,720
You should talk some sense into her. 
 [To Rong Yu]

539
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,939
You should talk some sense into her. 
 [To Rong Yu]

540
00:30:02,939 --> 00:30:05,639
Every day, you have so much to do but you still need to pay attention to her.

541
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:08,359
Every day, you have so much to do but you still need to pay attention to her.

542
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:13,420
Not to mention she saved me from danger a few days ago, it's my duty to protect her.

543
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,599
Not to mention she saved me from danger a few days ago, it's my duty to protect her.

544
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:17,000
If I can do it for a lifetime for her to remain an innocent girl, I will be contented.

545
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,019
If I can do it for a lifetime for her to remain an innocent girl, I will be contented.

546
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:21,000
If I can do it for a lifetime for her to remain an innocent girl, I will be contented.

547
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,940
Why should she change?

548
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,420
It's just hard for you and Heshan.

549
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,820
We're not afraid of hard work, as long as we can help you out.

550
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,039
We're not afraid of hard work, as long as we can help you out.

551
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,860
I'll go prepare the outfit for the appointment.

552
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,939
The emperor sent a few new gifts from the Silk Pavilion a few days ago.

553
00:30:35,939 --> 00:30:37,460
No need.

554
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,099
Our engagement hasn't been settled.

555
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:42,560
Meeting privately will ruin her reputation.

556
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,759
She doesn't understand, but I have to behave.

557
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,532
She doesn't understand, but I have to behave.

558
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:47,360
During the previous trip to Shangzhou, I had already offended her a lot.

559
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,680
During the previous trip to Shangzhou, I had already offended her a lot.

560
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,239
I can't make another mistake this time.

561
00:30:52,239 --> 00:30:55,279
She is known as a little bully of the capital.

562
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,000
But she is still an innocent girl.

563
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,160
Master, you are the one who cares.

564
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:12,820
Hiding away from me again.

565
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,840
I knew it. He is very afraid of me.

566
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,460
I knew it. He is very afraid of me.

567
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,144
Look.

568
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:20,439
Perhaps your letter was so aggressive that he's scared to come out.

569
00:31:20,439 --> 00:31:21,560
Perhaps your letter was so aggressive that he's scared to come out.

570
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,279
Perhaps your letter was so aggressive that he's scared to come out.

571
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:28,199
Don't forget, the idiotic young master from Lord Zhongyong

572
00:31:28,199 --> 00:31:29,660
Don't forget, the idiotic young master from Lord Zhongyong

573
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,660
was scared by your letter of challenge a while ago and still doesn't dare to come out.

574
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,340
was scared by your letter of challenge a while ago and still doesn't dare to come out.

575
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,480
He moved the toilet to his room.

576
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:41,780
What are you waiting for?

577
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,559
Send another letter.

578
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,159
He is a weak chicken who can't fight, so why would you scare him?

579
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,299
He is a weak chicken who can't fight, so why would you scare him?

580
00:31:53,299 --> 00:31:55,199
Be gentle this time and coax him a little.

581
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:57,880
Be gentle this time and coax him a little.

582
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,319
What? He's a man. Why would I do that?

583
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:03,959
Just be gentle.

584
00:32:03,959 --> 00:32:06,260
Come on.

585
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,380
As the saying goes, the moon is on the top of the willow, and the agreement is after dusk.

586
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,440
As the saying goes, the moon is on the top of the willow, and the agreement is after dusk.

587
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,760
Tomorrow evening, see you by the bridge.

588
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,079
Agreed?

589
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,060
[Rong Yu]

590
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,159
Master Rong, I think about you and dream about you insanely.

591
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:55,259
Master Rong, I think about you and dream about you insanely.

592
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,419
I wonder if I could have the honor to meet you?

593
00:33:18,739 --> 00:33:20,372
Master.

594
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,620
There must have been ten. Right?

595
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,319
I've delivered ten letters. Right?

596
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:38,540
Is this not enough gentleness?

597
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,340
I've even scented the paper.

598
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:45,079
I used all my life's talents to write the ultimate invitation verses.

599
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:47,080
I used all my life's talents to write the ultimate invitation verses.

600
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,260
Is that not sincere enough?

601
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,400
Maybe Master Rong really has something to do.

602
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,580
How busy can he be that he can't even come out for a chat?

603
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,480
How busy can he be that he can't even come out for a chat?

604
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:01,359
He always says he's looking at the stars.

605
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:04,699
Looking at the star chart in the daytime and gazing at the stars at night.

606
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:07,680
I think he is just evading and making excuses.

607
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,060
He has no idea of the consequences when I lose my temper.

608
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,079
Where are you going?

609
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,599
If the mountain won't come to me, I will come to the mountain.

610
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:16,320
If he doesn't come to me, I'll come to him.

611
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,600
Today, I have to butcher him…

612
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:23,040
Butcher the chicken from the kitchen and make soup for Dad tonight.

613
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,659
Butcher the chicken from the kitchen and make soup for Dad tonight.

614
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,100
Big Brother, are you here to see the horses, too?

615
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,620
We are here to collect the horses.

616
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:36,700
When you just came back from Mount Wuhua,

617
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,780
Father has booked a few fine horses from the Turks, preparing to give them to you.

618
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,980
Father has booked a few fine horses from the Turks, preparing to give them to you.

619
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,240
They finally arrived today.

620
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,760
Dad.

621
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,239
I was wrong.

622
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:45,899
I shouldn't have been ignoring you.

623
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:52,719
However, you and Qiuting have nearly killed the fine sweat-blood horses of the Rong family and Father felt really bad.

624
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:56,239
So, he is planning to send the horses to the Rong family.

625
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,260
What?!

626
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,860
They are Turk horses that can travel thousands of miles in a day.

627
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,040
You guys are planning to let Rong Yu use them to pull a cart?

628
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,239
It's better to let Third He do it.

629
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:10,940
If they weren't better than their horses, we wouldn't be able to send them as a gift.

630
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,140
If they weren't better than their horses, we wouldn't be able to send them as a gift.

631
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,540
It's all because of your doing.

632
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,739
Father. Big Brother.

633
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,159
What are you doing?

634
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:21,000
She looks even angrier now.

635
00:35:22,979 --> 00:35:24,300
It's nothing.

636
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:28,740
It's just that Father is planning to compensate Rong Yu with the Turk horses that were supposed to be yours and Jiuling's.

637
00:35:29,299 --> 00:35:32,140
- What?! 
 - Feed it more grass fodder. Okay?

638
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,920
All right.

639
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,519
You've always wanted others to give you credit. Right?

640
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:39,259
The Ministry of Justice approved and you should report there tomorrow.

641
00:35:39,259 --> 00:35:40,780
Until the spring examination, you will report daily to me and read files.

642
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:43,240
Until the spring examination, you will report daily to me and read files.

643
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,339
What?!

644
00:35:48,419 --> 00:35:49,599
Look.

645
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:50,660
Isn't that Jiuling?

646
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,019
He Jiuling!

647
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:54,579
Let's leave. She's not easygoing.

648
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,004
Here you go.

649
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,272
Come again.

650
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,000
Take a look.

651
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,700
Look at this shameless girl.

652
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,190
- All right! 
 - What a wild girl.

653
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:10,504
- Keep coming. 
 - No problem.

654
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,772
Miss He.

655
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:28,100
Miss He.

656
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,440
Miss He.

657
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,040
You and I must have also quite the bond.

658
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,640
I've missed you so much after not seeing you for a few days.

659
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,020
You must have a lot to say to me after seeing the booklet.

660
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,839
We are kindred spirits, and there's no need to pretend.

661
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,460
You and I?

662
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,680
When did we become kindred spirits?

663
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,360
When the Star-picking Master was ambushed, the way you leaped in front of the arrows…

664
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,480
When the Star-picking Master was ambushed, the way you leaped in front of the arrows…

665
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,320
All of the people in the capital know about your unrequited love for him.

666
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,440
All of the people in the capital know about your unrequited love for him.

667
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,400
I have seen many ups and downs, but I praise your deep affection.

668
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,920
I have seen many ups and downs, but I praise your deep affection.

669
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,720
I haven't settled accounts with you about the erotic paintings.

670
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,379
How dare you gossip about my feelings for Rong Yu?

671
00:37:00,379 --> 00:37:01,960
I'll beat you until you can't speak.

672
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,440
Well...

673
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,920
Even if I didn't say it, these people would think the same.

674
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,440
Even if I didn't say it, these people would think the same.

675
00:37:12,779 --> 00:37:15,360
Is it that obvious?

676
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:18,780
You know perfectly well what happened.

677
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,579
If you want to save someone, just save them.

678
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:24,000
Why the hugs and embraces?

679
00:37:34,499 --> 00:37:36,980
So that's what happened.

680
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,180
You really are capable.

681
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,800
I wonder which woman in the world does not want to hold Young Master Rong in her arms.

682
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,760
I wonder which woman in the world does not want to hold Young Master Rong in her arms.

683
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,620
But you were able to do it, and in front of so many people too.

684
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,860
But you were able to do it, and in front of so many people too.

685
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:51,059
That sight was so thrilling that I wanted to draw it.

686
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:53,240
That sight was so thrilling that I wanted to draw it.

687
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,700
All that overflowing love, you can't hide it.

688
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,680
All that overflowing love, you can't hide it.

689
00:37:57,159 --> 00:38:01,039
I don't…!!!

690
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:07,184
If you don't believe it, let it be.

691
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:09,380
Now...

692
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,920
I need to talk with you about another matter.

693
00:38:12,579 --> 00:38:15,100
The erotic paintings.

694
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,360
Did you finish reading so quickly?

695
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,720
The next volume is not ready yet.

696
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,740
Wait a bit, just a bit.

697
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,140
The capital does not allow the sale of such things.

698
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,099
Have you printed or sold any?

699
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:26,019
Confess quickly or I will beat you up.

700
00:38:26,019 --> 00:38:27,900
Confess quickly or I will beat you up.

701
00:38:28,399 --> 00:38:30,499
I didn't draw it, and I didn't sell it.

702
00:38:30,499 --> 00:38:31,580
Then what are you hiding?

703
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,539
Nothing at all.

704
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,059
This noise.

705
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:37,080
Is it a print?

706
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,779
I really don't have it.

707
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:43,960
- If you don't confess,  I'll have you meet the official! 
 - No, no!

708
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,499
- If you don't confess,  I'll have you meet the official! 
 - No, no!

709
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:48,820
You're so unfair.

710
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,720
You read it but you don't want others to read it. Is that it?

711
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,200
Besides, the Star-picking Master is not your husband.

712
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,500
Why are you so overly protective?

713
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,700
If you talk nonsense again, I'll beat you up.

714
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,728
Here you go.

715
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:10,530

716
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:13,300
Senior Brother.

717
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,390
♫ Sunset, dusk, and the setting sun ♫

718
00:39:22,511 --> 00:39:28,310
♫ Traveling thousands of miles away ♫

719
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:35,380
♫ Appreciating the music of the zither and and the moon in the middle of the night ♫

720
00:39:36,594 --> 00:39:42,566
♫ How many times will the drinks not let me forget? ♫

721
00:39:43,731 --> 00:39:49,719
♫ Picking up the pen and feeling lovesickness come true ♫

722
00:39:50,635 --> 00:39:56,475
♫ Fate is noisy on paper ♫

723
00:39:56,475 --> 00:40:00,974
♫ The strongest wine is the most unforgettable ♫

724
00:40:00,974 --> 00:40:04,789
♫ Love is so deep that there is no escape ♫

725
00:40:04,789 --> 00:40:10,995
♫ Looking back, you are, waiting for me ♫

726
00:40:10,995 --> 00:40:18,063
♫ Have you ever looked back on the joys 
 and sorrows of the years? ♫

727
00:40:18,063 --> 00:40:25,598
♫ The longing crystalizes into frost and brilliant stars ♫

728
00:40:25,598 --> 00:40:33,015
♫ You quietly turned around and closed 
 the marriage book with your own hands ♫

729
00:40:33,015 --> 00:40:39,515
♫ Smiling and asking how many stars there are 
 in the world tonight ♫

730
00:41:04,851 --> 00:41:10,423
♫ Picking up the pen and feeling lovesickness come true ♫

731
00:41:11,787 --> 00:41:17,491
♫ Fate is noisy on paper ♫

732
00:41:17,491 --> 00:41:22,025
♫ The strongest wine is the most unforgettable ♫

733
00:41:22,025 --> 00:41:25,867
♫ Love is so deep that there is no escape ♫

734
00:41:25,867 --> 00:41:32,083
♫ Looking back, you are, waiting for me ♫

735
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:39,223
♫ Have you ever looked back on the joys 
 and sorrows of the years? ♫

736
00:41:39,223 --> 00:41:46,620
♫ The longing crystalizes into frost and brilliant stars ♫

737
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:54,187
♫ Gently I stroke the zither, waiting for a passerby like you ♫

738
00:41:54,187 --> 00:42:01,251
♫ Turns out you are my inextricable destiny ♫
