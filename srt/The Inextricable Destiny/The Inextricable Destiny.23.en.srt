00:01:25,188 --> 00:01:31,620
<i>[The Inextricable Destiny]</i>

2
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,468
<i>[Episode 23]</i>

3
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,959
Why do you think that the bandits
have anything to do with me?

4
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,560
Someone ambushed you in the hunting ground.

5
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,000
This has never happened.

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,079
Does it also have anything to do with me?

7
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,640
You know everyone in this palace,
except for Wang Dequan,

8
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:52,860
are old servants from the previous emperor.

9
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,400
The rest were all brought by you.

10
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,159
How did I pull them down

11
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,159
without anyone knowing?

12
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,040
What about the military token?

13
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,720
Ever since you became the Regent,

14
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,360
the He family was wiped out,

15
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,620
and the Yan family was sent to Sichuan

16
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,120
after the hunt.

17
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,199
Which of them didn't want it?

18
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,360
Why do you think it's me?

19
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,639
You're my uncle.

20
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:20,759
Your Majesty, there's no need to quibble.

21
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,360
But you should know about the He family.

22
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,020
I'm more concerned about

23
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,560
these risky and unpredictable situations.

24
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,819
Are you admitting

25
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,680
that the entire He family was framed by you?

26
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:38,700
Your Majesty seems unwell recently.

27
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,560
Just rest in the palace from now on.

28
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,000
You don't need to worry about other things.

29
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,120
You want to put me under house arrest?

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,024
No.

31
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,872
I'm just

32
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,700
trying to share your concerns.

33
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,120
How… How dare you?

34
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,912
Guards!

35
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,928
Where are the guards?

36
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,848
Guards!

37
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,584
You bastard!

38
00:03:07,584 --> 00:03:08,608
Your Majesty,

39
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,439
you know how to curse now?

40
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,480
I was too kind.

41
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,599
I made the bird believe it had strong wings.

42
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:22,160
Since you think you are an eagle,
I'll cage you,

43
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,264
so you know

44
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,719
you're just a caged bird.

45
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,984
Rong Yu,

46
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,340
you said I'm not your destined one,

47
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,039
and I'm not in your marriage line.

48
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,780
Then, why is it that no matter
how much we wander

49
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,000
or even if we are thousands of miles apart,

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,360
I still married you

51
00:03:43,008 --> 00:03:44,128
and fell in love with you?

52
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,080
Isn't this fate?

53
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,736
I can't imagine a future like that

54
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:52,920
with anyone else except you.

55
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,159
Being a general is fine.

56
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,800
The future General Rong.

57
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:57,536
Your little General Rong.

58
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,260
What if she is a girl?

59
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,140
We'll spoil her endlessly.

60
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,620
Not to mention ten years, not even for a day,

61
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,159
will we let her leave us to suffer
in Mount Wuhua.

62
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,944
Thinking about our little General Rong
or little Miss Rong

63
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,520
just makes my heart sing.

64
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:17,280
Usually, it's you who runs to me.

65
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,160
Can I finally be the one
to reach out to you this time?

66
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:27,160
Normally, I don't
give second chances to people.

67
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,120
But for you,
I'm willing to give countless opportunities.

68
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,680
I've already come running to you.

69
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,600
If you still love me,

70
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,900
just reach out your hand,

71
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,859
and I am willing to give you all my love

72
00:04:41,859 --> 00:04:43,800
and sincerity for the rest of my life.

73
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,328
What if I tell you that

74
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,048
I don't like you anymore?

75
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,380
Then why did you rush into the fire to save me?

76
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,519
The fire was so intense.

77
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,200
I couldn't even escape myself.

78
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,220
Why did you do it?

79
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,240
I wouldn't hesitate to save anyone

80
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,616
in the Astrology Pavilion.

81
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,279
I couldn't just stand by

82
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,224
and watch someone die in front of me.

83
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,560
But…

84
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,759
Since you are so upright and honorable,

85
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,920
why did you go to all the trouble

86
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,120
to eliminate everyone who was harmful to me?

87
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,544
What I did was just to help the Emperor

88
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,160
to eliminate the villains as fast as possible.

89
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,399
I didn't put too much thought into it.

90
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,879
School's over! School's over!

91
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,040
Master, tonight I want to pray for
the Astrology Pavilion.

92
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,319
Could you tell me what to say?

93
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,319
Okay. Go play.

94
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,944
Thank you, Master.

95
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,839
Let's go. Let's go play.

96
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,224
Okay.

97
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,040
When I was sick and confused,

98
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,016
I only recognized you.

99
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,959
That must give you false hopes,

100
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,879
but that was just illusion.

101
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,824
He Jiuling.

102
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,488
Why do you think

103
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,600
I would still love you

104
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,928
after knowing you burned my Astrology Pavilion?

105
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:47,199
Madam was running to put out the fire, right?

106
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:48,928
That's right.

107
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,720
Right?

108
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:07,279
Your Highness,
now that the Emperor is not doing too well.

109
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:10,060
As the mainstay of Jialin,

110
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,576
please give me more guidance in the future.

111
00:07:13,152 --> 00:07:14,180
Please.

112
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,744
- Master, the young lord is back!
- This is…

113
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,816
Min.

114
00:07:18,816 --> 00:07:19,968
Father.

115
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,680
Father.

116
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,536
What happened?

117
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,560
Master Rong said he won't see you anymore.

118
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,944
All these things are yours.

119
00:07:39,456 --> 00:07:40,512
You can take them away.

120
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,199
If you don't want them,
I'll have someone throw them away.

121
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,800
Zhanping.

122
00:07:50,176 --> 00:07:51,220
I--

123
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,224
Just stop talking.

124
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,279
I don't know how to face you now.

125
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,519
Master Rong treats you so well.

126
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,839
Why did you hurt him like this?

127
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,624
If you're going through something,
you can tell us.

128
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,560
Do you understand how important
the Astrology Pavilion is to him?

129
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,448
Forget it.

130
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,840
Here's the money Master Rong prepared for you.
You should leave.

131
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,472
No.

132
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:17,000
Does he have any other messages for me?

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,519
No. Nothing.

134
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:21,879
You should leave.
If you don't, I will have to drive you away.

135
00:08:32,128 --> 00:08:33,219
Stop pretending. It's not working.

136
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:35,200
Master Rong and I will never trust you again.

137
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,448
I see.

138
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,200
Then tell him to take care.

139
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,619
I won't bother him anymore.

140
00:08:46,619 --> 00:08:48,320
Don't say these hypocritical words.

141
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,976
You are the worst person ever. Just leave.

142
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,799
Xun-Xunnan humiliates us like this.

143
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,600
My sister is still waiting for us to save her.

144
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,679
Father, raise troops.

145
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:08,896
Nonsense!

146
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,859
How can we go to war so rashly?

147
00:09:10,859 --> 00:09:13,060
This is a blatant provocation.

148
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,780
Are we supposed to let Ren Yinxiao be insolent?

149
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,200
Should we let my sister die in a foreign land?

150
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,520
When I left,

151
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:22,919
my sister was still locked in the courtyard
of that useless prince.

152
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,440
She couldn't even have a decent meal.

153
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,360
If we don't hurry up and take actions,

154
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,200
we might have to collect her body, father.

155
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,736
I…

156
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,919
I'll write a letter to Ren Yinxiao.

157
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,539
What good will this letter do?

158
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:40,020
It's clear they're not afraid of us.

159
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,240
Otherwise, they wouldn't behave this way.

160
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,799
Do you know what it means to raise troops?

161
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,039
Do you know
what preparations are needed for a war?

162
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,480
War is a two-sided conflict,

163
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,799
and we can't just jump into it
because of one person.

164
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:00,360
But-but she's your daughter.

165
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,624
She's also my sister.

166
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,540
She's been given the title of princess.

167
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,360
She now represents Jialin.

168
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,959
What do you know about

169
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,639
diplomacy and court matters?

170
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:15,872
You are right.

171
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,919
I don't know anything about it,

172
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:21,759
but I know that you are afraid.

173
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:23,739
Before you do anything,

174
00:10:23,739 --> 00:10:25,519
you always go to the Astrology Pavilion
to ask Lord Rong.

175
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,360
You are always cautious, timid, and careful.

176
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,279
How can you achieve anything significant?

177
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:32,928
You…

178
00:10:59,328 --> 00:11:00,420
Anything else?

179
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,420
That's enough.

180
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,496
Okay.

181
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,440
Are you blind?

182
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,559
Even you dare to bully me now?

183
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,448
He Jiuling.

184
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:49,568
What happened?

185
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,240
You don't hate me now.

186
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,104
I do.

187
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:57,159
It's just that I'm not in the mood right now.

188
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,680
He Jiuling,

189
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,279
I have something to tell you.

190
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,799
I don't believe a word you say.

191
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:17,639
King of Xunnan is not that kind of person.

192
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,559
How do you know he's not that kind of person?

193
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:27,279
If you slander others again,

194
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,039
I'll teach you a lesson.

195
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:40,832
I just remembered that…

196
00:12:41,632 --> 00:12:42,739
Sir.

197
00:12:42,739 --> 00:12:44,480
You two are old acquaintances, aren't you?

198
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,960
Back when he was Prince Yong,

199
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,696
he even proposed in the Palace.

200
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,879
Although he couldn't marry you,

201
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,320
you two are at least friends.

202
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:02,200
He's really lucky.

203
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,639
You two are at least friends.

204
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:08,800
He Jiuling,

205
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,600
there's no one who can help my sister now.

206
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,480
If possible, can you help me

207
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,520
to save my sister?

208
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,679
Sitting here to brew tea for you

209
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:18,680
is through gritted teeth.

210
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,360
How dare you trouble Miss He?

211
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,960
Here you go, Sir.

212
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,559
- I'm sorry.
- Please.

213
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,399
In the past, my sister and I

214
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,960
have done a lot of bad things to you.

215
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,000
I always feel sorry.

216
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,440
I truly apologize and will do whatever it takes

217
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,120
to make it up to you.

218
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:48,039
Apologize?

219
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:50,320
Do you really think an apology
can fix everything?

220
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,820
Stop pretending like you don't know
what's going on here.

221
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,832
Tan.

222
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,679
I can write a letter to inquire about
the situation for you,

223
00:14:10,688 --> 00:14:12,768
but there's not much else I can do.

224
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,736
Even if that's the case,

225
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:24,440
you're the only person to help me.

226
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,860
My apology just now was sincere

227
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,919
from the bottom of my heart.

228
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,320
If you need my help in the future

229
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,559
with anything,

230
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,180
or even help you overturn the case,

231
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,279
you can come to me at any time.

232
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,559
No need.

233
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:38,624
No.

234
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,000
I will keep this in my heart forever.

235
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,600
You and Rong Yu are

236
00:14:58,919 --> 00:14:59,968
very alike now.

237
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,519
if it were the previous you

238
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,200
Before, you would have laughed

239
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,080
and scolded me

240
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,799
for being in this situation,

241
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,440
but now you're willing to

242
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:16,840
sit with someone you don't like

243
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,039
and even offer me tea.

244
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,600
As much as I hate to admit it,

245
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,879
you and Rong Yu are actually a good match.

246
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:30,519
What a fool.

247
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:31,840
Are you trying to make others mad on purpose?

248
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,799
Jiuling, let's go.

249
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,784
He Jiuling.

250
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:45,920
Can I…

251
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,840
Can I be your friend?

252
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,519
We will never be friends.

253
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,000
Get out! All of you get out.

254
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,960
Cheng'an, it's me.

255
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,856
Cheng'an.

256
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:04,800
Sister.

257
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,359
I knew you would be okay.

258
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,900
Cheng'an, I'm not just skilled in

259
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,160
praying to the Bodhisattva for help.

260
00:17:17,664 --> 00:17:18,816
Trust me.

261
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,576
In times of crisis,

262
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,799
I can protect you too.

263
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:25,000
<i>[Jiang's Mansion]</i>

264
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,176
You lied to me, right?

265
00:17:27,552 --> 00:17:28,576
The matter of the He family,

266
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:31,240
has nothing to do with our family, right?

267
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,039
Otherwise, why wouldn't I know anything?

268
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:37,152
For such a thing,

269
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,880
do I need to tell you about it
loudly and clearly?

270
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,072
How about now?

271
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,480
Why are you telling me all this now?

272
00:17:47,392 --> 00:17:48,420
If you wanted to keep it from me,

273
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,240
why couldn't you keep it from me forever?

274
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:55,360
Because in the future,

275
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:58,319
the one sitting on the throne

276
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:00,576
will be you.

277
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:07,960
How can you say such rebellious things?

278
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,240
Isn't your current position powerful enough?

279
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:13,839
Min, it's not about whether
this is enough or not.

280
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,580
If I hadn't rid the He family of Nanjiang
back in the day,

281
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,920
would our family have the status it has now?

282
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:25,800
If I don't stand at the highest position now,

283
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,680
will our family have a way out?

284
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,880
Min, it's time for you to know.

285
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,160
I don't want to hear you say these things.

286
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,319
I only know that when the He family was there,

287
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,599
our life was just as good.

288
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,319
Why do you have to reach for so high?

289
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,440
What about now?

290
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:49,200
Isn't the most important thing now
should be to save my sister?

291
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,680
My sister is still waiting for us to save her.

292
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,960
Now is the crucial moment.

293
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,000
I won't allow anyone or anything
to ruin my plan.

294
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,072
Not even your sister.

295
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:03,440
So, are you saying that

296
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:07,119
you only care about your future and goals,

297
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,299
and you are okay with my sister

298
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:13,024
being bullied, self-destructing in Xunnan?

299
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,200
After a while, I will think of a way out.

300
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,759
So you really going to do this?

301
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,519
I can't believe that,

302
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,039
at this time, my closest family is actually

303
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:32,720
more indifferent than the one I have hurt?

304
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,088
Stop right there.

305
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:43,119
Do you think I'm not worried or care about Lin?

306
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,640
There's been no turning back.

307
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,039
Min, you don't want to ruin our whole family,
do you?

308
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,584
I don't know.

309
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,504
I don't know anything.

310
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:57,536
I just wish you hadn't told me all this today.

311
00:19:57,536 --> 00:20:00,240
- Min.
- Don't push me anymore, father.

312
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,008
A stranger.

313
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,720
Princess Xilan.

314
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:00,768
General He.

315
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,952
Lord Jiuling.

316
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:45,892
<i>[Imperial Study]</i>

317
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:58,624
- He Jiuling.
- Your Majesty.

318
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,319
Hurry up. We'll probably be discovered soon.

319
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:03,328
Jiuling, I…

320
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:07,776
Assassin!

321
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,319
You guys go first, I'll stay behind. Go!

322
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,728
- Go.
- There's an assassin!

323
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,440
Master Rong.

324
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:33,760
Zhanping.

325
00:22:36,352 --> 00:22:37,400
What's wrong?

326
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,599
Get the horses ready to meet General Yan.

327
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,240
Let go of the Emperor!

328
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,640
All of you, go away!

329
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,359
He-He Jiuling.

330
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:23,648
Move.

331
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,680
Could it be that it's always been you?

332
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,640
The Royal Palace is full of our people.

333
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,199
It's impossible for you to escape.

334
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:36,880
You're seeking your own death.

335
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:38,799
We'll wait and see

336
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,080
who will suffer the consequences.

337
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,039
He Jiuling, you'll die.

338
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:45,120
Rebel.

339
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,760
He Jiuling.

340
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,200
You rebels dare to kidnap His Majesty.

341
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,980
He Jiuling, tell them to drop
their weapons quickly.

342
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,400
I'll beg my father to spare your life.

343
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:07,776
Jiuling.

344
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,920
Your Majesty,

345
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,712
we need to wait.

346
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:15,080
He Jiuling, I'm begging you.

347
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,559
Are you still persisting?

348
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,419
Kill them all.

349
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:19,720
- Stop.
- No.

350
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:21,600
His Majesty is still among them.

351
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,696
Shoot.

352
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,400
Stop. Everybody stop.

353
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,360
Jiuling.

354
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:10,912
About the He family,

355
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:13,559
I've asked my father.

356
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,120
I'm very sorry.

357
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,480
I can't do anything for you.

358
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,464
I…

359
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,480
If I…

360
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,440
have known earlier,

361
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:29,599
I would've stopped my father.

362
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:37,400
If it had never happened,

363
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,096
could we…

364
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,200
Could we have been friends?

365
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,119
It's better if you don't tell me the answer.

366
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,319
Because next time,

367
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:13,039
I-I will definitely do better

368
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,384
than…

369
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:19,296
than Master Rong,

370
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,056
and even better

371
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,480
than anyone.

372
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,039
He Jiuling,

373
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,599
I like you.

374
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,140
Min.

375
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,640
Lord Zhongyong. Lord Zhongyong.

376
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,664
Min.

377
00:26:50,848 --> 00:26:51,904
Min.

378
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,519
Min.

379
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:27,740
In the third year of Chengyuan

380
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:32,980
Lord Zhongyong, Jiang Hesen sows chaos in
the Palace and conspires to harm the Emperor.

381
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:37,179
Now apprehend his accomplice. Minister of
the Ministry of Justice, Wang Tongren.

382
00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:39,424
Minister of the Ministry of Rites, Li Mu.

383
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:42,640
Imperial Academy Scholar
Zhao Zhen and Jiang Shengtian.

384
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,240
Those who do not comply
will be executed immediately.

385
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,296
By the Emperor's order,
strip the nobility from Jiang Hesen…

386
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:52,320
Min.

387
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,400
and execute him at noon at Liudaokou

388
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,680
to serve as a warning
and an example for all to see.

389
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,840
Investigation reveals
the Great General He Liang

390
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,100
was framed by treacherous men
in colluding with the enemy case.

391
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,199
Now restore General He Liang's position

392
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:11,740
and confer the noble title of Lord Protector.

393
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,599
Now there is only one request
I wish for the Emperor's grace

394
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:15,616
What is it?

395
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,519
Can my merits offset the past wrongs
of Rong Jiang and Astrology Pavilion?

396
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:24,599
Restore He Chenzhou's
military supervisory position.

397
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:28,559
Confer his wife as the second rank lady with an
honorary title conferred by imperial mandate.

398
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,339
<i>[Grave of the Great General He Liang]</i>
Restore He Qingxing as General of the Household.

399
00:28:32,339 --> 00:28:36,420
Confer his wife as the third rank lady with an
honorary title conferred by imperial mandate.

400
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,640
Proclaim to the world, so that all may know.

401
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:57,220
<i>[Grave of the Great General He Liang]</i>

402
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,304
Our He family's

403
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,359
grievance has been redressed.

404
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:33,039
<i>[Astrology Pavilion]</i>

405
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,759
I'm preparing to select
the next master for the Astrology Pavilion.

406
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,680
Master, we should take it slow.

407
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,580
No need to be so eager to select a successor.

408
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:55,080
We have to prepare for the astrology festival

409
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,360
and also need to improve
our divination tutorial.

410
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,799
And we need to recruit new fortunetellers.

411
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:02,319
There's just so much to do.

412
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:04,939
We don't want to rush into anything.

413
00:30:04,939 --> 00:30:07,680
And like the astrology festival,
there's no need to find others to take over.

414
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,740
Others might think

415
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:13,020
the master has left us.

416
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,120
Yes, Master.

417
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,168
Yes, Master.

418
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,456
Your Majesty.

419
00:30:22,528 --> 00:30:23,616
<i>[Xuanzheng Hall]</i>

420
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,000
Xunnan invades.
Nanjiang is in urgent need of help.

421
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,912
We lost Fanzhou.

422
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,500
All thirty thousand soldiers
in Wutu City fell in battle.

423
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,799
No surviving soldiers from
the Chen family who defended the city.

424
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,312
What did you say.?

425
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,264
You're so reckless.

426
00:30:54,592 --> 00:30:55,679
That's not right.

427
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:56,720
You are wrong.

428
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,359
How can you act like this?

429
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,064
What did you say?

430
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,216
How could this happen?

431
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,880
Why did Xunnan attack Jialin?

432
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:20,000
Senior brother must have been manipulated
by someone.

433
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,799
I have to find him.

434
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:22,848
Don't be impulsive.

435
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:25,439
Even if he is being controlled,

436
00:31:25,439 --> 00:31:27,160
what can you do by yourself?

437
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:30,039
And if your senior brother
really wanted to attack Jialin,

438
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,304
what can you do about it?

439
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:43,960
I shall lead the troops personally.

440
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,500
Your Majesty, please don't.

441
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,540
No way.

442
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,120
Your Majesty, you can't do that.

443
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,059
Your Majesty, please think twice.

444
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:53,140
The royal family is in decline now.

445
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,080
If Your Majesty leaves,
there will be no roots left in Jialin.

446
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,700
There will be no one to hold down the fort
in the capital.

447
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,880
It's hard to avoid
the previous Regent's situation.

448
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,839
Yes, Your Majesty.

449
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,179
Please think twice, Your Majesty.

450
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:08,599
Then, who do you think can go to Nanjiang?

451
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:11,000
T-T-This…

452
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,980
Jialin has just quelled the internal conflict.

453
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,799
And then Xunnan is harboring ulterior motives.

454
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:20,640
I can't protect the General of the Left
from being wiped out.

455
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,400
Do I also have to watch my General of the Right

456
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,400
and thousands of soldiers

457
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,920
die in Nanjiang without
being able to return to their homeland?

458
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,920
Your Majesty,
I have to say something disrespectful.

459
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:33,640
What can you do
even if you lead the troops in person?

460
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:36,459
All of our best Jialin commanders
are already in Nanjiang.

461
00:32:36,459 --> 00:32:39,240
The best ones were already
wiped out by the Regent.

462
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,820
If there's no commander like He Liang
to lead the troops to kill the enemy,

463
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,119
it's no use.

464
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:48,100
I think we should send someone to negotiate
with Xunnan as soon as possible.

465
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,680
Try to minimize the losses with the least cost.

466
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,264
Your Majesty.

467
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,799
If there is no commander
like my fathers and brother,

468
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,160
I wonder if I can fight for Your Majesty.

469
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,680
T-T-This…

470
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,799
This is absurd.

471
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,860
She's just a small commander.
How can she take on such a responsibility?

472
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,888
Besides,

473
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,620
she and Ren Yinxiao are friends.

474
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,640
They often communicated
when they were in Nanjiang.

475
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:22,240
Who knows if they will…

476
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,559
The He family just got acquitted.
How dare you say that?

477
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,759
Ren Yinxiao is my senior brother.

478
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:31,296
This is true.

479
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:33,539
That's all the more reason to avoid suspicion.

480
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:35,699
You did contribute
to settling the internal conflict,

481
00:33:35,699 --> 00:33:38,039
but this is a different time.

482
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,000
But I am also from Jialin.

483
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,699
Protecting the people of Jialin
and defending the Jialin

484
00:33:44,699 --> 00:33:46,480
is the inherent responsibility
of the He family.

485
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:48,599
I never forget that.

486
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:51,799
Your Majesty, do not trust people lightly.

487
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:55,780
The matter of the Regent
should serve as a lesson.

488
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,299
Your Majesty, please think twice.

489
00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:00,439
Your Majesty, please think twice.

490
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:01,600
All of you, shut up.

491
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,968
He Jiuling.

492
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,016
If you meet on the battlefield,

493
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,159
would you really dare to fight
against Ren Yinxiao?

494
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,679
My sword will always target Jialin's enemies

495
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,320
and will never show mercy.

496
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,679
Okay.

497
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,060
I grant your request to fight.

498
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,360
You will be the commander of our army.

499
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,360
Go with me to Nanjiang.

500
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:30,080
- Your Majesty. No.
- No!

501
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,260
Absolutely not! Your Majesty!

502
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,760
Your Majesty, you can't do this.

503
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,420
Absolutely not!

504
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,448
Why not?

505
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:40,839
He Jiuling risked her life to bring me
from the deep palace to this hall.

506
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:43,920
Her loyalty is greater than any of you.

507
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,679
Before returning to the capital,
she was the top martial general of Nanjiang.

508
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,280
Every time He Liang marched,
she was by his side.

509
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,160
Every time there was a victory,
her name was in the report.

510
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,320
Whoever doubts her,

511
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,880
will be treated as a remnant of
the Jiang family.

512
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:02,440
Your Majesty, there has never been
a female commander in history,

513
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,199
let alone fighting together with the Emperor.

514
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:07,800
The master of the Astrology Pavilion is here.

515
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,232
Your Majesty.

516
00:35:20,416 --> 00:35:23,280
Your Majesty, at this critical moment,
it is risky to act rashly.

517
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,239
Why not listen to the opinion
of the Astrology Pavilion?

518
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,000
Yes, that's right.

519
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:30,752
Your Majesty.

520
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,152
The result predicted by Rong Yu is

521
00:35:33,152 --> 00:35:37,472
this journey is very dangerous.
It's extremely ominous.

522
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,079
T-This…

523
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,060
So, as I said, the best plan now is

524
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,480
to withdraw troops and negotiate.

525
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,040
But if we don't go,

526
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,960
the result predicted is
that there will be no chance of survival.

527
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:54,360
What should we do? It's a tough decision.

528
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:56,480
Your Majesty, this…

529
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,480
this requires further
discussion and consideration.

530
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:03,760
But making He Jiuling the commander
is absolutely not possible.

531
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,660
If Xunnan knows this,

532
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,519
they will laugh at us.

533
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:11,080
If a woman can do

534
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,719
what a man can't,

535
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:19,880
shouldn't it be more laughable for this man?

536
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:27,639
Incompetence is laughable.

537
00:36:28,768 --> 00:36:31,599
Incompetence, stubbornness,

538
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,159
and humiliating a woman

539
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:36,079
are laughable.

540
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,600
Am I wrong?

541
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,912
You guys

542
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,599
have read so many books,

543
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:51,559
but haven't comprehended as well as the young
master who has not even entered the temple.

544
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,000
He Jiuling, after hearing Rong Yu's words,

545
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,679
do you still dare to go?

546
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:03,264
Of course.

547
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,368
Nice.

548
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:08,840
That's perfect.

549
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,199
Then I will make you the real General He.

550
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:21,920
This time, it's not you who are sheltering me.

551
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,440
But it's me, Xuanyuan Cheng'an,

552
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:25,320
and you, He Jiuling,

553
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,220
being like the ancestors of

554
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:30,112
the Xuanyuan and He families,

555
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,288
sharing life and death with each other.

556
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:43,831
<i>♫ Under the setting sun in dusk ♫</i>

557
00:37:46,052 --> 00:37:51,851
<i>♫ I travel far for thousands of miles ♫</i>

558
00:37:51,851 --> 00:37:58,821
<i>♫ Playing the zither under the moonlight ♫</i>

559
00:38:00,035 --> 00:38:06,207
<i>♫ The drinks won't let me forget ♫</i>

560
00:38:07,172 --> 00:38:13,160
<i>♫ The longing I write down for you ♫</i>

561
00:38:14,276 --> 00:38:19,816
<i>♫ Our fate is written on paper ♫</i>

562
00:38:19,816 --> 00:38:24,115
<i>♫ Just like the strongest wine ♫</i>

563
00:38:24,115 --> 00:38:27,530
<i>♫ There's no escape for destiny ♫</i>

564
00:38:28,452 --> 00:38:34,536
<i>♫ Looking back, I see you waiting ♫</i>

565
00:38:34,536 --> 00:38:41,704
<i>♫ Our lives are filled with joy and sorrow ♫</i>

566
00:38:41,704 --> 00:38:48,639
<i>♫ The longings crystalize
into a bright galaxy ♫</i>

567
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:56,456
<i>♫ You turned around quietly
and closed the marriage book ♫</i>

568
00:38:56,456 --> 00:39:02,056
<i>♫ Asking how many stars there are in the sky ♫</i>

569
00:39:28,292 --> 00:39:33,864
<i>♫ The longing I write down for you ♫</i>

570
00:39:35,428 --> 00:39:41,032
<i>♫ Our fate is written on paper ♫</i>

571
00:39:41,032 --> 00:39:45,066
<i>♫ Just like the strongest wine ♫</i>

572
00:39:45,476 --> 00:39:48,008
<i>♫ There's no escape for destiny ♫</i>

573
00:39:49,572 --> 00:39:55,624
<i>♫ Looking back, I see you waiting ♫</i>

574
00:39:55,624 --> 00:40:02,664
<i>♫ Our lives are filled with joy and sorrow ♫</i>

575
00:40:02,664 --> 00:40:09,861
<i>♫ The longings crystalize
into a bright galaxy ♫</i>

576
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:17,128
<i>♫ Gently I stroke the zither,
waiting for a passerby like you ♫</i>

577
00:40:17,732 --> 00:40:23,892
<i>♫ Turns out you are my inextricable destiny ♫</i>
