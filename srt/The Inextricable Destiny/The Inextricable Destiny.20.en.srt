00:01:26,035 --> 00:01:31,748
<i>[The Inextricable Destiny]</i>

2
00:01:31,748 --> 00:01:34,674
<i>[Episode 20]</i>

3
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,080
Madam has spent

4
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,500
several days in the pharmacy,

5
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,460
and our young master just wants

6
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,619
to see if she is okay.

7
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:05,060
He's not going to cause any trouble.

8
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,319
Can't you let him in?

9
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,599
Come on, let's have a match, let's fight.

10
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,319
Chengbi, come in for a moment.

11
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,879
I want to take a nap.

12
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,140
Go check on the bug box for me.

13
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,620
We're supposed to dispense some herbs
in the next couple of days,

14
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,919
and we need to keep a close watch.

15
00:03:03,072 --> 00:03:04,192
<i>Ling.</i>

16
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,920
<i>It's been months since we saw each other.</i>

17
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,280
<i>I wonder if you're doing well in Jialin.</i>

18
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,719
<i>I've finished all my business in Xunnan,</i>

19
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,319
<i>and the only thing I'm worried about is you.</i>

20
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,840
<i>Just like what I've said before,</i>

21
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,639
<i>if you're tired and weary,</i>

22
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,399
<i>I can help you.</i>

23
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:21,580
<i>Let me help you write.</i>

24
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,008
<i>Just like when we were on Mount Wuhua.</i>

25
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,160
<i>Thank you, Senior brother.</i>

26
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,639
<i>Best, Your Senior brother, Ren Yinxiao.</i>

27
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,080
<i>Come on. Reach for it again.</i>

28
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,280
<i>You...</i>

29
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:39,744
<i>How can you...</i>

30
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,896
<i>Are you mad?</i>

31
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,000
<i>Wait.</i>

32
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,152
<i>Stop right there.</i>

33
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,439
Based on the Young Master's pulse,

34
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,680
I can't say there has been much improvement.

35
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:24,900
He's still unable to read or write,

36
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,079
and he can't understand complex words,

37
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,519
which means his mental condition
is still impaired.

38
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,120
Playing the zither should be
considered as muscle memory,

39
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,560
just like many musicians can play
even with their eyes closed,

40
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,119
and the tune flows smoothly.

41
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:40,192
The reason is simple.

42
00:04:40,704 --> 00:04:42,240
They are so familiar with it

43
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,680
that the body has memorized the movements.

44
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,399
So it's not surprising
that the Young Master can play the zither.

45
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,640
But no matter what,

46
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,560
being able to play the zither is a good thing.

47
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,568
Indeed.

48
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,759
Lord, the Princess has come to visit.

49
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,340
The gifts sent by the Princess a few days ago

50
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,639
were too precious,

51
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,060
and I heard it was only
for the Astrology Pavilion.

52
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,199
I was just about to send someone to return it.

53
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,399
I didn't expect the Princess to come in person.

54
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,820
Once I send out a gift,

55
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,480
it's impossible to take it back.

56
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,879
Besides, it was specially prepared
for the Astrology Pavilion.

57
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,720
If Your Highness wishes to have a divination,

58
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,920
just send a notice.

59
00:05:29,376 --> 00:05:30,539
Lord Rong.

60
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,160
Has no one told you

61
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,820
that my visit to the capital this time

62
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,120
is actually to choose a husband?

63
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,759
Sir, the zither you ordered
for the Young Master has arrived.

64
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,800
Rong Yu likes the zither.

65
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,279
Did we bring any to the capital this time?

66
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,740
Yes, we did. It's the Dragon Chant.

67
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,940
Deliver it to the Astrology Pavilion later.

68
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,024
Yes.

69
00:05:49,984 --> 00:05:51,040
Lord Rong.

70
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,899
I guess I have

71
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:54,560
made myself pretty clear.

72
00:06:00,448 --> 00:06:01,504
Yu.

73
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,040
Uncle.

74
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,799
I will introduce you.

75
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:11,820
This is...

76
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,896
I know her.

77
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:15,940
You know her?

78
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,360
I have seen her before.

79
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,160
Young Master, do you know who I am?

80
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,920
But we didn't exchange names last time, right?

81
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,120
Perhaps you were curious about me too?

82
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,459
I saw her on her way to the capital.

83
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:32,959
She said she was looking for her husband.

84
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,248
You remembered such a thing quite clearly.

85
00:06:39,104 --> 00:06:42,180
She will stay for dinner tonight, you...

86
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,680
Uncle, I need to practice
my calligraphy tonight.

87
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,940
I won't disturb you.

88
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,976
I will skip dinner.

89
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,199
Zhanping, let's go.

90
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,240
Master Rong, I...

91
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,200
With the Celestial Grass.

92
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,680
Rong Yu will definitely get better.

93
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,816
Please.

94
00:07:30,336 --> 00:07:31,360
This way.

95
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,480
Here.

96
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,560
Let him try it.

97
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,639
Like the last time.

98
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,000
Take it over a few days.

99
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:50,680
Young Master, can you still...

100
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,340
Eat it?

101
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,472
Water.

102
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,584
Young Master, should I...

103
00:07:55,584 --> 00:07:57,759
Zhanping, water.

104
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,879
This is the character I recently learned.

105
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:36,560
You're always in the pharmacy.

106
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,440
You never come out, even for meals or sleep.

107
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,960
So I didn't have the time to show you.

108
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,399
No need.

109
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,679
If the tutor says it's right,

110
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,480
then it's right.

111
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,919
There are still things in the pharmacy
that I haven't organized.

112
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,320
I have to go now.

113
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,220
If you feel uncomfortable these days,

114
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,759
you can ask Zhanping to find me.

115
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,320
Can't I go?

116
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:06,880
What?

117
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,840
Can't I come to find you?

118
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:11,919
Why have you suddenly changed?

119
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,808
Rong Yu.

120
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,240
If one day,

121
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,120
I mean, if,

122
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,840
I did something to hurt you,

123
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:29,039
would you still do this,

124
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,136
hold on to me?

125
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,240
Young Master, the Princess is here.

126
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,672
I won't see her.

127
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,680
So this is where Young Master Rong lives, hmm?

128
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,440
It does look unique.

129
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:07,879
Who's this?

130
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,159
This must be He Jiuling.

131
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,360
Wait, you.

132
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,840
Our Princess is looking for you.

133
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,120
Sorry, but I have things to do.

134
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,240
You're a maid in the Rong family, aren't you?

135
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,440
You seem to have quite an attitude.

136
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,500
I have been standing here for quite a while,

137
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,672
and I'm tired

138
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,159
Your Highness, this is our Madam.

139
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,840
Madam?

140
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,799
She looks pretty worn out

141
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,400
and doesn't seem very dressed up.

142
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,679
I thought she was a maid
responsible for cleaning.

143
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:52,519
Sorry. My mistake.

144
00:10:54,016 --> 00:10:55,040
It's okay.

145
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,560
Your Highness, our young master
is about to rest.

146
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,799
So he isn't resting yet.

147
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,080
Our young master is resting already.

148
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:03,840
What about all these things?

149
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,440
For food and beverages,
just hand them directly to Lord Rong.

150
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,440
As for the boat ride,

151
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,360
our young master is ill and should not travel.

152
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,020
Your Highness, you don't need to visit anymore.

153
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,240
Please leave the way you came.

154
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,560
Let's go.

155
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,720
Your Highness, our young master is resting.

156
00:11:20,224 --> 00:11:21,344
Your Highness.

157
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,620
I have an order from the King

158
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,100
to not allow anyone to bully you.

159
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,200
I can teach her a lesson.

160
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,560
She just said a few words.

161
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,840
Why fuss over such small things?

162
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,840
What Rong Yu has is so little.

163
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,832
If one day

164
00:11:36,832 --> 00:11:38,559
I have to leave him,

165
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,240
and someone else can be by his side
to care for him and love him,

166
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,480
I would always be grateful.

167
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,740
Right now, I am thinking

168
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,360
about how to take the next step.

169
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,184
This can't wait.

170
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,440
Get out of my way.

171
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,480
All of you, move.

172
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,760
I want to see your King.

173
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,860
Who's causing a commotion?

174
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,240
Me, the son of Jialin's Lord Zhongyong.

175
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,480
So it's the young lord.

176
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,720
Didn't we already send someone
to escort you out?

177
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,639
With all this going on, how could I leave?

178
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:15,459
My sister traveled thousands of miles
to Xunnan for a political alliance,

179
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:17,140
not to be kept as a prisoner.

180
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,159
This is outrageous.

181
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:21,960
Breaking into the palace is a crime
punishable by death.

182
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,900
You, you people of Xunnan humiliated us.

183
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,200
Aren't you afraid that Jialin
will raise an army against you?

184
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,240
There's nothing to be afraid of.

185
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,900
Xunnan has never been afraid of anyone.

186
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,900
Blame Princess Xihe for provoking
someone that she shouldn't have.

187
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,220
Also, Young Lord, you don't
need to come anymore.

188
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,659
Our King is not in the palace,

189
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:43,744
and he won't see you either.

190
00:12:44,384 --> 00:12:45,504
Please leave.

191
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,440
<i>Lately, I've been constantly
reminded of the past.</i>

192
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,240
<i>Mount Wuhua, Master,</i>

193
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:55,039
<i>and you.</i>

194
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,320
<i>Even though you're all still here,</i>

195
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,400
<i>I'm so afraid</i>

196
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,440
<i>that one day, even you will disappear.</i>

197
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,759
<i>Senior brother, I miss you.</i>

198
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,664
Is it true?

199
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,360
The Ministry of Rites is sending Rong Yu

200
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,540
to perform music with me
at the Empress Dowager's birthday banquet?

201
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,100
Yes, now every afternoon, the Young Master

202
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,519
will make time to practice with Your Highness.

203
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
Fortunately, before coming here,

204
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,640
my mother forced me
to learn the pipa for half a year.

205
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,320
So this was the plan.

206
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,219
Bring me my pipa.

207
00:13:29,219 --> 00:13:30,460
Your Highness,

208
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,960
there's no pipa.

209
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:34,639
You've brought the Dragon Chant zither.

210
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,500
Why isn't my personal pipa here?

211
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,840
Your Highness said

212
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,740
our royal mansion can't have
you and the pipa at the same time.

213
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,700
So, the Lord has given them all away.

214
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,039
Then buy one.

215
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:46,280
Also,

216
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,420
I am now

217
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,360
a music enthusiast.

218
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,399
- Understood?
- Yes.

219
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,464
Go quickly.

220
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:07,440
Has anything happened with the Lord Zhongyong?

221
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,240
No, the entire capital has been calm recently.

222
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,280
Master Rong,

223
00:14:26,048 --> 00:14:27,260
from now on, every afternoon,

224
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,080
I'll be here practicing the zither with you.

225
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,440
If you don't say anything,
I'll take it as your consent.

226
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:39,840
What should we do
at the Empress Dowager's birthday banquet?

227
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,659
I'm pretty good at playing the pipa.

228
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:44,840
Anything will do.

229
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,220
Young master, don't be silent.

230
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,200
If you don't want to hear
what the Princess has to say,

231
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
just nod.

232
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:01,679
Have you got any ideas about the collaboration?

233
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,340
If you find it hard to choose,

234
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,440
I've chosen for you.

235
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,759
This banquet is for everyone
to enjoy the music,

236
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:11,260
so there's no need to choose a difficult piece,

237
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,320
right?

238
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,600
You're so agreeable.

239
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:27,639
How about "Little Lotus Flower"?

240
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,759
This piece is both festive and simple,

241
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:32,800
and I'm very familiar with it.

242
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,039
Would you like to hear it?

243
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,480
Some parts weren't perfect,

244
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,940
but the main thing is that this pipa is new.

245
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,519
I'm not used to playing it.

246
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,200
What do you think of my playing?

247
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,440
It's okay, just say it.

248
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,536
Different strokes for different folks.

249
00:16:37,536 --> 00:16:38,639
I can accept it all.

250
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,380
What you mean

251
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,840
is that I played pretty well, right?

252
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,576
Your Highness.

253
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:00,279
Your Highness, why are you running away?

254
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:02,440
I need some fresh air.

255
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,100
Are we going back to the young master?

256
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,144
No, we're not.

257
00:17:06,144 --> 00:17:08,339
Now that I've come out,
going back would make people laugh.

258
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,504
Let's go home.

259
00:17:14,016 --> 00:17:15,072
Give it to me.

260
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,839
I'm going back to practice all night.

261
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:43,960
Miss, I need you.

262
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,584
What's the matter?

263
00:17:51,616 --> 00:17:52,704
Let's go.

264
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:01,400
Miss He, please come in.

265
00:18:14,656 --> 00:18:15,776
Senior brother.

266
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,728
Your Majesty.

267
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:21,680
I plan to see you tomorrow.
Why did you come early?

268
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,419
Chengbi told me that you
were stopped outside the city,

269
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:25,820
almost got caught and taken
to the Ministry of Justice.

270
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,020
Your hand was injured.

271
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,040
How could I be at ease?

272
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,800
If I can't handle such small matters,

273
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,960
what kind of King of Xunnan would I be?

274
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:32,864
And it's not serious either.

275
00:18:32,864 --> 00:18:35,000
I just haven't been riding
a horse for a long time,

276
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,119
and my hand has become vulnerable.

277
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:38,540
There was no need to rush.

278
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,759
I sent you a letter a few days ago
and you have already arrived.

279
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,680
Well, someone did say she missed me.

280
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,400
How can a King be so capricious?

281
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:48,920
If you were treated as a spy
and kept in prison,

282
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,480
I'd like to see what you'd do.

283
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,680
I'll just wait for my junior sister to save me!

284
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:56,240
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

285
00:19:01,312 --> 00:19:02,799
You don't have to tell me.

286
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,680
You're not having a good time here.

287
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:08,599
But you couldn't help but tell me.

288
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,640
So something big must have happened,

289
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:13,000
which is why I rushed over so anxiously.

290
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,519
Ling, what on earth has happened?

291
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:22,359
It turns out

292
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:23,760
that Jialin's Astrology Pavilion

293
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,420
Is not just for show.

294
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,680
They really have powers.

295
00:19:28,512 --> 00:19:29,600
That's why

296
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,039
I need to destroy the star chart first.

297
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,599
This way, Rong Jiang alone won't be any threat.

298
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:36,400
My plan is

299
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:40,039
to make the new antidote
and give it to Rong Yu,

300
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:43,599
before I go inspect the Astrology Pavilion.

301
00:19:44,736 --> 00:19:45,799
This is not like you.

302
00:19:47,712 --> 00:19:48,799
What do you mean?

303
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:50,880
Hesitant.

304
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,279
Is it because of Rong Yu?

305
00:19:59,552 --> 00:20:00,608
Ling.

306
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,639
Sometimes, you can't be too soft-hearted.

307
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:05,060
Rong Yu is a member of the Rong family.

308
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,079
No.

309
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:10,016
Rong Yu is Rong Yu, and the Rong family
is the Rong family.

310
00:20:10,016 --> 00:20:11,159
They are different.

311
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:12,160
How?

312
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,339
If he finds out that you used
the medicine to harm him,

313
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,780
would he still depend on you
and be nice to you the same as now?

314
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,060
His resentment towards you

315
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,799
is bigger than that of Rong Jiang.

316
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,760
From the moment the medicine went wrong,

317
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,880
it was destined that you two
would be enemies in this life.

318
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:33,240
Of course, the matter of the medicine

319
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,880
was greatly my fault.

320
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,120
I am not forcing you.

321
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,799
If you really can't do it,

322
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,460
let me.

323
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,039
I will avenge my own grievances.

324
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,440
I want to cure him

325
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,119
at least while his family is still here,

326
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,599
even if that family

327
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:57,400
is nothing more than a mirage.

328
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:01,079
It is the only thing I can do for him now.

329
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,200
Of course, you can seek your revenge.

330
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:07,480
You also mentioned that the Astrology Pavilion
can really make predictions.

331
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,160
Every force in the capital

332
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,799
is looking for those responsible for killing
the rebellious officials and traitors.

333
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:17,320
Have you ever thought that one day,

334
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,528
Rong Jiang will use the star chart

335
00:21:19,168 --> 00:21:20,519
and find out about everything you've done?

336
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,679
For me,

337
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:26,400
your safety is the most important thing.

338
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,039
I've passed the fear of death long ago.

339
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:34,759
What about those who are still alive?

340
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,380
Those who are alive?

341
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,559
Our master and me.

342
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:39,160
Don't you think we'd be sad?

343
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,360
You never visited the Astrology Pavilion.

344
00:21:44,032 --> 00:21:46,359
If you go there now
to investigate the star chart,

345
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:48,480
this unusual behavior of yours

346
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,079
is bound to arouse suspicion.

347
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,900
When the star chart is destroyed,

348
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,799
wouldn't you be the first suspect
in Rong Jiang's eyes?

349
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:56,480
Besides, you poisoned Rong Yu.

350
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,400
With so many things happening in the capital,

351
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,459
even if he can't confirm it,

352
00:21:59,459 --> 00:22:00,900
he certainly won't keep you alive.

353
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,079
but I am the easiest access to the star chart.

354
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,400
An investigation doesn't
necessarily need easy access.

355
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,599
I can send people to help you.

356
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:12,200
Once we find out what the star chart is

357
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,980
and how to destroy it,

358
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,808
I'll leave things to you.

359
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:19,200
This way, you can avoid any suspicion.

360
00:22:22,752 --> 00:22:23,808
Okay.

361
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,359
Thank you for your help, Senior Brother.

362
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:29,480
There's no need for that between us.

363
00:22:33,088 --> 00:22:34,144
What's the matter?

364
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,528
The night is falling.

365
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,720
It's not 5 p.m. yet.

366
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,359
And you've been here less than an hour.

367
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,759
Indeed, I have a lot to tell you.

368
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,020
But Rong Yu just took the antidote I made.

369
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,199
I worry that he may need me and can't find me.

370
00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:53,559
So I'm a little anxious.

371
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,639
It was me who was always in a rush.

372
00:22:56,639 --> 00:22:57,696
Now,

373
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,808
it's your turn.

374
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,839
I'm sorry, Senior Brother.

375
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,440
I have already arranged everything in Xunnan.

376
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,119
This time, I want to stay in Jialin
for a few more days.

377
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,119
Be careful on the way.

378
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,984
Bye now.

379
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,599
Young Master, don't think too much.

380
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:51,360
Madam has only become distant to you

381
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,440
because she's not in a good mood recently.

382
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:54,939
Don't women always

383
00:23:54,939 --> 00:23:56,120
have a period within a month,

384
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,240
when they like to make a fuss about nothing?

385
00:23:58,528 --> 00:23:59,552
Zhanping.

386
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:04,000
Do you remember the royal
wedding banquet five years ago?

387
00:24:05,216 --> 00:24:06,240
I do.

388
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,959
On our way back to the mansion at that time,

389
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:10,160
you were intercepted by the Madam halfway.

390
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:11,839
In that royal banquet,

391
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,559
the original betrothal

392
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,440
was for him and her.

393
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,680
I was the one who intercepted Jiuling halfway.

394
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,000
She hasn't smiled like that for a long time.

395
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,208
But I...

396
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,720
I always seem to make her cry.

397
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:05,359
Where have you just been?

398
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,880
We just... wandered around the mansion.

399
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,860
The young master is not feeling well.

400
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,039
Not feeling well?

401
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,419
No, not really. It's nothing serious...

402
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:17,759
The room was a little stuffy.

403
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:21,199
When you return to the room later,

404
00:25:21,199 --> 00:25:22,359
open a couple more windows.

405
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,440
I am going to the kitchen
to make some mung bean soup.

406
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,559
<i>Why did you even do all those things?</i>

407
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:01,199
<i>Why did you give them grapes and money?</i>

408
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:03,040
<i>You want to confine me
before we even get married.</i>

409
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,039
<i>Rong Yu, I don't want to marry you.</i>

410
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,620
<i>I thought you were a graceful gentleman,</i>

411
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,780
<i>but you are just a big liar and scamp.</i>

412
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,599
<i>Who would like a liar?</i>

413
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:13,960
<i>Have you never liked Young Master Rong?</i>

414
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,200
<i>No, never.</i>

415
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:26,000
Young Master, Young Master, wake up.

416
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:28,576
Young Master.

417
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,039
Young Master, you seemed
to be having a nightmare.

418
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,216
I'm fine.

419
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,680
I just thought of many things
that I have always remembered,

420
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,599
but hope to forget.

421
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,840
Is Uncle in the mansion?

422
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,792
He is.

423
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:10,976
Good.

424
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:13,824
Go get him

425
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:16,576
and He Jiuling.

426
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:18,799
I've decided to tell her

427
00:27:21,824 --> 00:27:22,920
that I've recovered.

428
00:27:23,936 --> 00:27:25,024
Yu.

429
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:27,199
Are you sure?

430
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:29,599
Have you really recovered?

431
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:31,559
Three thousand books of poetry

432
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:32,720
and countless numerologies,

433
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,336
I remember them all.

434
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,560
Truly, Heaven blesses our Rong Family.

435
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,880
Heaven blesses the Astrology Pavilion.

436
00:27:48,672 --> 00:27:49,839
I am going

437
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:52,520
to tell the world,

438
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,120
invite all the guests,

439
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,439
and let everyone know you're all right.

440
00:27:57,439 --> 00:27:59,920
Uncle, the imminent birthday banquet

441
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,120
should be the biggest event in the capital.

442
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,440
I can't steal the limelight.

443
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,220
Let's not talk about it for now.

444
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,960
Besides, these years have shown
the warmth and coldness of human hearts.

445
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:11,519
I have seen through it after this experience.

446
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,640
Whether outsiders know or not

447
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,780
is not important.

448
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,319
Okay, whatever you say.

449
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:19,639
We'll just wait after the birthday banquet,

450
00:28:19,639 --> 00:28:21,400
and hold a small banquet
for the people of the Astrology Pavilion

451
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,480
to let them know

452
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,920
that their Star-picking Master has returned.

453
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,160
Then I'll go arrange it now.

454
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,816
Thank you.

455
00:28:57,248 --> 00:28:59,000
Don't say that.

456
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,760
I'm just glad you're okay.

457
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,752
I'll go tell Chengbi and Tan.

458
00:29:02,752 --> 00:29:03,920
They've also helped a lot.

459
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,920
He Jiuling.

460
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,219
If you have anything to say,
say it later. I'll leave now.

461
00:29:07,219 --> 00:29:08,440
When we got married,

462
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,279
there was no formal proposal or gift,

463
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:16,880
there was no meeting with the parents,

464
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,200
there were no friends and relatives present,

465
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,400
and there was no wedding dress.

466
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:27,240
Even worse, on that day,

467
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,920
you lost your closest family.

468
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,400
It was the beginning of your nightmare.

469
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:38,799
Where in the world is there
such a terrible wedding

470
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:41,960
and such an unhappy bride?

471
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,712
From where I see it,

472
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:52,880
this isn't right.

473
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,601
<i>♫ The longing I write down for you ♫</i>

474
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,200
You deserve a grand wedding.

475
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,056
He Jiuling.

476
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:09,839
After the Empress Dowager's birthday banquet,

477
00:30:10,528 --> 00:30:13,181
<i>♫ There's no escape for destiny ♫</i>

478
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,480
let's get a divorce.

479
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:27,578
<i>♫ Our lives are filled with joy and sorrow ♫</i>

480
00:30:27,578 --> 00:30:34,304
<i>♫ The longings crystalize
into a bright galaxy ♫</i>

481
00:30:35,104 --> 00:30:42,016
<i>♫ You turned around quietly
and closed the marriage book ♫</i>

482
00:30:42,592 --> 00:30:48,256
<i>♫ Turns out you are my inextricable destiny ♫</i>

483
00:30:53,280 --> 00:31:01,856
<i>♫ Turns out you are my inextricable destiny ♫</i>

484
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:16,480
Okay.

485
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:23,640
How could you say that to Madam?

486
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,440
Is it because of last night?

487
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,459
Should I...

488
00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:30,880
There's really no need for that.

489
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,419
How about we hear what the Madam has to say

490
00:31:32,419 --> 00:31:33,599
and then make a decision?

491
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,160
What's the rush to go
to the Astrology Pavilion now?

492
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,240
<i>[Rong's Mansion]</i>
Madam is the most important.

493
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:41,184
Young master.

494
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,000
Young master, will you listen to me?

495
00:32:00,608 --> 00:32:01,888
Miss.

496
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:06,144
Miss.

497
00:32:07,488 --> 00:32:08,559
Have something to eat.

498
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,640
Let's go and find Senior Brother.

499
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,920
Did he really decide
to break up with He Jiuling?

500
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:35,319
I see how it is.

501
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:38,960
Since Yu has made up his mind,

502
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:41,600
then,

503
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,960
the Astrology Pavilion will be
closer to the Princess's Mansion.

504
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,419
so that those who are bald enough

505
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:51,960
to hold out hopes for marrying the Princess.

506
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,119
Go.

507
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:56,179
Send some supplements
to the Princess's Mansion.

508
00:32:56,179 --> 00:32:57,559
Make sure to attract more attention.

509
00:32:58,304 --> 00:32:59,392
Yes.

510
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,559
I have a rough understanding now.

511
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:08,080
The star chart was a piece of luck
that the Rong family's ancestors acquired

512
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,200
at the founding of the Astrology Pavilion.

513
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,000
There is a room hidden in the Pavilion

514
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,160
that is guarded strictly.

515
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,560
Others are not allowed to approach

516
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,720
or see it in person.

517
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,660
Those who have seen the star chart

518
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,919
wouldn't answer any questions.

519
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:22,000
Everyone was extremely vigilant.

520
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,400
I have sent men to investigate multiple times

521
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,000
and there weren't any results.

522
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,920
Never seen, not allowed to approach.

523
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:32,800
How am I supposed to know
what I need to destroy

524
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,880
when the target is not even clear?

525
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,640
A painting? A book?

526
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,480
Just destroy all of it.

527
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:44,120
Since we don't even know what it is,

528
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,240
let's just burn it all with fire.

529
00:33:48,832 --> 00:33:49,920
I will think about it some more.

530
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:53,519
Do you want me to think of another way?

531
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,759
You have done enough for me.

532
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:02,400
From now on,

533
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,512
I will handle it myself.

534
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:08,128
You are afraid that I will be exposed,

535
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,360
and I don't want to involve you as well.

536
00:34:13,024 --> 00:34:14,199
Besides,

537
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,719
my days as the Madam of the Astrology Pavilion

538
00:34:18,272 --> 00:34:19,424
won't be long.

539
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,400
I need to make good use of it.

540
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,239
Rong Yu said

541
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,800
he wanted a divorce.

542
00:34:33,728 --> 00:34:34,848
Isn't that perfect?

543
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,820
You two should never have been

544
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,640
tied together in this identity.

545
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,800
You two being married was wrong from the start.

546
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,408
That's right.

547
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,800
You don't seem to be very happy.

548
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,760
Ling, I am just worried about you.

549
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:57,860
What you have given to Rong Yu has already

550
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,599
surpassed what you should give.

551
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:01,819
Guilt or indebtedness

552
00:35:01,819 --> 00:35:03,039
shouldn't present like this.

553
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,920
Could it be...

554
00:35:10,752 --> 00:35:13,340
Forget it. Never mind.

555
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,464
Yes.

556
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,679
Yes. Yes.

557
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:22,960
I like him.

558
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:26,140
Do you hear yourself?

559
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,920
I know very well what I am saying.

560
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:33,280
I've tried to fool myself
into thinking otherwise,

561
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:35,960
but I can't.

562
00:35:37,536 --> 00:35:38,599
Indeed.

563
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,780
He doesn't have a single trait

564
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,840
that matches what I usually
find attractive in a person.

565
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,880
He's weak and vulnerable,

566
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:47,880
expensive and troublesome.

567
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,199
Yet, I just like him.

568
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:56,719
I don't know when I started feeling this way,

569
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,280
but now I can't extricate myself.

570
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:03,599
How could you like...

571
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:05,760
someone like him?

572
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,760
He's still poisoned.

573
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,559
Are you talking about the Amnesia Powder?

574
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,079
But no one has ever forgotten
about the affection, right?

575
00:36:18,272 --> 00:36:19,360
This Amnesia Powder

576
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:22,239
should be called Love-sickness.

577
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:27,440
So this is what a lovesick heart

578
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,119
feels like.

579
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,760
In your eyes,

580
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:39,000
he's a fool.

581
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,440
But what I see

582
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,800
is a simple Rong Yu.

583
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:47,320
I've thought about it.

584
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,639
If he can't protect me,

585
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,079
I can protect him.

586
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,320
If he can't do anything,

587
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,840
I just hope

588
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:00,039
he can remain

589
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:02,679
happy and cheerful.

590
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,119
Now, he's detoxified.

591
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:11,559
Senior Brother, he's all well now.

592
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:13,719
He's once again the Astrology Pavilion's

593
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,480
Young Master, who's loved and revered by all.

594
00:37:19,424 --> 00:37:20,544
Ling.

595
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:25,679
I can rest assured now.

596
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,608
Your hand condition.

597
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,760
I'm afraid it will never get better,

598
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:55,000
but that's good.

599
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:58,079
It can constantly remind me

600
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:01,119
that it was not because of guilt

601
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:03,040
or indebtedness,

602
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,480
but the sixteen-year-old He Jiuling

603
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,920
stood in front of him with pure sincerity.

604
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,800
Do you like him that much?

605
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:24,400
That much?

606
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,440
What does that mean?

607
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,960
All I know is I was desperate,

608
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:41,000
especially when I knew

609
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,440
that I had to destroy the Astrology Pavilion

610
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,400
and kill Rong Jiang.

611
00:38:49,715 --> 00:38:54,406
<i>♫ Under the setting sun in dusk ♫</i>

612
00:38:56,627 --> 00:39:02,426
<i>♫ I travel far for thousands of miles ♫</i>

613
00:39:02,426 --> 00:39:09,396
<i>♫ Playing the zither under the moonlight ♫</i>

614

<i>♫ There's no escape for destiny ♫</i>

619
00:39:39,027 --> 00:39:45,111
<i>♫ Looking back, I see you waiting ♫</i>

620
00:39:45,111 --> 00:39:52,279

621

<i>♫ The longings crystalize

622
00:39:59,214 --> 00:40:07,031
<i>♫ You turned around quietly
and closed the marriage book ♫</i>

623
00:40:07,031 --> 00:40:12,631
<i>♫ Asking how many stars there are in the sky ♫</i>

624
00:40:38,867 --> 00:40:44,439

625

00:41:00,147 --> 00:41:06,199
<i>♫ Looking back, I see you waiting ♫</i>

629
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:13,239
<i>♫ Our lives are filled with joy and sorrow ♫</i>

630
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:20,440
<i>♫ The longings crystalize
into a bright galaxy ♫</i>

631
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:27,703
<i>♫ Gently I stroke the zither,
waiting for a passerby like you ♫</i>

632
00:41:28,307 --> 00:41:34,467
<i>♫ Turns out you are my inextricable destiny ♫</i>
