1
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,200
NAMES, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS
AND BUILDINGS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,160
Is this the place?

3
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,440
Yeah.

4
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,800
Let's go inside.

5
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,880
You stay here.

6
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,920
Be on the lookout, and catch her
if she tries to run.

7
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,560
All right.

8
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,080
What the hell?

9
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,360
Let's spread out.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,400
Yell out if you find her.

11
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,120
Okay.

12
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,760
Wow!

13
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,640
Hold on…

14
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,600
What the hell?

15
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,080
That idiot…

16
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,840
Not so brave now, are you?

17
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,640
You think that's funny, you crazy bitch?

18
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,280
What is it?

19
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,680
Over there…

20
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,960
Never mind.

21
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,600
Did you find her?

22
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,800
She must have run away.

23
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,640
Hey, get down here!

24
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,120
Did you find her?

25
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,240
No, she's not here.

26
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,360
Then, why did you call us?

27
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,840
-Wait a second…
-Why?

28
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,840
Why are there four?

29
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
Four?

30
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,320
-What are four?
-The lights…

31
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,240
I just saw Young-suk outside.

32
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,080
Then, there should only be three.

33
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,440
Hey, Young-suk!

34
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,040
Ji Young-suk! Don't play games with us!

35
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,120
Turn off your light!

36
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,000
Let's turn off our lights, one by one.

37
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,440
Moon-hee.

38
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,080
Eun-joo.

39
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,920
Jin-rae.

40
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,920
Are you really Young-suk?

41
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,040
Answer us, you bastard!

42
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,560
Cut it out, you freak!

43
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,720
Fuck, stop it!

44
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,520
Honey…

45
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,760
Honey…

46
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,160
Honey…

47
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,360
POLICE

48
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,760
Hello, ma'am.

49
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,480
It took longer than I expected.

50
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,800
Are the results in?

51
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,480
Your husband's cause of death seems
to be suicide.

52
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,200
There are no signs of murder at all.

53
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,880
But wouldn't he have left a note?

54
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,560
Or at least organized his shoes?

55
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,920
-That's what I'm wondering.
-You…

56
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,280
It's your job to find out what happened--

57
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,800
-How could a healthy man suddenly die?
-You don't know, either! So shut up!

58
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,200
That's my point!

59
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,240
You and I may not know, but your sister
was living with him!

60
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,040
Why isn't she telling us anything?

61
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,880
Your sister must have caused
Chang-soo's suicide!

62
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,360
-What?
-What do you mean?

63
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,520
-So-hee…
-You think I was cheating on him?

64
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,920
Why else would my brother hang himself?

65
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,200
What are you all doing?

66
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,600
Give it a rest.

67
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,520
I knew marrying a girl from
a worthless family would cause trouble.

68
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,960
You scumbags!

69
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,880
You disgusting animals!

70
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,240
You bitch!

71
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,680
Let go!

72
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,000
Let go of her! Let go!

73
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,840
Let go!

74
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,000
Please stop!

75
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,040
So-hee…

76
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,280
So-hee!

77
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,840
So-hee!

78
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,760
HONG SO-HEE IN SURGERY

79
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,920
OPERATION ROOM

80
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,640
Are you Hong So-hee's guardian?

81
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,280
Yes, that's right.

82
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,000
The mother is okay.

83
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,840
But the baby didn't make it.

84
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,000
Come to my place.

85
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,040
Don't worry about me.

86
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,320
You can come to my place!

87
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,120
So-hee!

88
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,960
BO-MEE

89
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,360
Hello?

90
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,760
Is this Ms. Hong So-hee?

91
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,040
Hello? Ms. Hong?

92
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,920
Yes, please go on.

93
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,280
I'm Park Ah-hyung, attorney at law.

94
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,400
An attorney?

95
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,640
These are the files
related to your inheritance.

96
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,520
What is this?

97
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,840
That house is your inheritance.
It's under your name.

98
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,960
Wow…

99
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,440
He never mentioned it to me.

100
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,600
He wanted to wait
until the house was finished.

101
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,000
You said that you found something strange?

102
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,280
Take a look.

103
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,600
One of our employees took this picture.

104
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,920
Chang-soo?

105
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,240
It looks like Mr. Seo, right?

106
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,240
Yes, it does.

107
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,800
The strange thing is,
that was taken two days ago.

108
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,480
Two days ago?

109
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,720
What? You're hiding?

110
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,000
This must be it.

111
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,319
Hold on…

112
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:28,079
What kind of place do you want to live in?

113
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:36,720
I want to remodel a house
in a remote location.

114
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,720
There needs to be a yard
and a swing for our child.

115
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,680
Most importantly…

116
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,440
There should be a flower garden.

117
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,560
I'll even name the garden.

118
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,120
May all of our days be like spring…

119
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,520
So-hee!

120
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,840
Someone must have broken in.

121
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,440
We should clean this up.

122
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,720
This was here?

123
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,280
I'll clean this up. You should go rest.

124
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,400
Sweetie, did you get home?

125
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,560
Dad didn't come to pick me up.

126
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,920
What? He didn't?

127
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,920
So-hee!

128
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,840
Your husband put
a lot of effort into that house.

129
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,200
After all that preparation, what a shame…

130
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,000
-Hye-ran, stop the car!
-What?

131
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,400
Why?

132
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,720
Hong So-hee!

133
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,400
Hey, wait!

134
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Excuse me…

135
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,040
Who are you?

136
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,840
PSYCHIATRIST PARK SANG-WOOK

137
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,200
The surgery department wants my opinion.

138
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,680
Your MRI results are clean.

139
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,560
I've heard your husband
passed away recently.

140
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,480
Could we talk about that first?

141
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,880
After he died, there have been
several strange incidents.

142
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,960
Stress can cause hallucinations?

143
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,960
That's what he said.

144
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,760
He also said it will go away.

145
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,200
I knew it!

146
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,760
Do you really think
it's because of stress?

147
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,280
Do you think you saw a ghost?

148
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,120
I'm not sure.

149
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,520
But it was Chang-soo.

150
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,240
He was trying to say something.

151
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,800
So-hee.

152
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,080
It was definitely him.

153
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,520
So-hee…

154
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,400
Hey, Hong So-hee!

155
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,600
Be careful with it.

156
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,880
First floor, please.

157
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,880
I told you to rest inside!

158
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,240
I'll move one more box.

159
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,000
Have a cold drink.

160
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,360
So-hee, will you be okay on your own?

161
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,200
Just come live with me.

162
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,040
My husband and kids all like you.

163
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,600
Don't worry, I'm not a child.

164
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,320
My husband remodeled this house for me.

165
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:53,040
I should live here for his sake.

166
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,240
Hey, sis.

167
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,680
No, don't bring anything.

168
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,760
It's not a housewarming party.
It's just a family meal.

169
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,920
Okay, drive carefully.

170
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,760
-Welcome!
-Hello!

171
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,680
-Careful, everyone.
-Wow!

172
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,440
It's nice, isn't it?

173
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,680
Should we order some takeout instead?

174
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,160
-Yes.
-Yeah.

175
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,960
It's my turn!

176
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,440
Barley, barley, rice!

177
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,960
Yay, I won!

178
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,320
You can play on the swing outside.

179
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,400
Go play.

180
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,600
Don't run!

181
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,880
It's fine, I don't have
downstairs neighbors.

182
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,800
Right. Run around!

183
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,600
Rascals…

184
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,640
One.

185
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,160
Two.

186
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,600
Three.

187
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,040
Four.

188
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,760
Five.

189
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,160
Six.

190
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,360
Where are you going?

191
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,920
Keep pushing me!

192
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,000
What are you doing there?

193
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,480
Are you hurt?

194
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,520
Do you want me to pull you out?

195
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,760
What was that noise?

196
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,600
Ji-won!

197
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,240
What happened?

198
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,560
Why are you crying? Don't cry.

199
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,960
Park Dong-hyun, did you do this?

200
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,960
No.

201
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,200
Ji-won…

202
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,560
Uncle…

203
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,480
Uncle?

204
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,760
What's wrong?

205
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:33,000
Uncle Chang-soo pulled me in,
and told me he wanted to be free.

206
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,600
-Mom…
-Yeah?

207
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,840
Ji-won lied.

208
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,400
About what?

209
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,120
It wasn't Uncle Chang-soo.

210
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,720
-Who was it, then?
-An older girl.

211
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,680
-An older girl?
-Yeah.

212
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,920
-Rock, paper, scissors!
-Rock, paper, scissors!

213
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,200
-Minus one!
-Minus one!

214
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,440
What is it?

215
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,800
-Is your arm okay?
-Yeah.

216
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,920
Did you really see Uncle last night?

217
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,800
Uncle?

218
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,800
Mom, Uncle's dead.

219
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,120
Was it an older girl, like Dong-hyun said?

220
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,960
I never said that.

221
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,640
What?

222
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,680
You said that you saw her.

223
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,560
When did I say that?

224
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,520
Mom, what's wrong with you?

225
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,280
Mom, Dong-hyun's kindergarten bus is here.

226
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,200
Right.

227
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,440
"CAN YOU PROTECT THEM ALL?"
"YES!"

228
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,680
Hye-ran?

229
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,440
Chang-soo?

230
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,160
Chang-soo…

231
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,560
Say something!

232
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,600
This is our school uniform.

233
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,440
What is this about?

234
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,240
Well…

235
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,440
We don't have enough information
to help you.

236
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,640
Some parents come looking for their kids

237
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,200
because of custody or financial issues.

238
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,880
It's against rules to provide
any information.

239
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,400
I have a class.

240
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,120
Hey…

241
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,240
Excuse me…

242
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,040
-Hey…
-Me?

243
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,680
Do you know her?

244
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,680
Hey, what are you doing?

245
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,000
Who are you?

246
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,200
Leave this house immediately.

247
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,400
You're the one who's trespassing.

248
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,760
Leave, before I call the police.

249
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,040
Take this.

250
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:05,360
If it enters your body,
you'll turn into the living dead.

251
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,680
Remember that.

252
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,680
Don't beg for death later on.

253
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:24,400
The teacher told me that
you're looking for Hyun-joo.

254
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,840
I think my husband hid this picture.

255
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,520
Why would he do that?

256
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:46,720
I thought she might know something
about his death.

257
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,760
What about you, Detective Nam?

258
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,600
I'm also looking for her.

259
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,320
She ran away from home months ago.

260
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,160
Do you know her location?

261
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,160
Hello?

262
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,040
Please excuse me.

263
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,360
-How ridiculous!
-What the hell?

264
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,640
-Look at his face!
-You should have called me!

265
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,640
Don't bullshit me!

266
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,440
-This is you?
-Yeah.

267
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,640
You're both idiots, you know that?

268
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,440
You know her, right? Eun Hyun-joo.

269
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,080
What?

270
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,600
Do you know where she is?

271
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,760
-Who the hell are you?
-Why are you looking for her?

272
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,360
Why shouldn't I?

273
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,080
-You know her, right?
-Fuck this.

274
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,760
Let's go.

275
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,040
-Hold on…
-We're leaving!

276
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,360
Please wait!

277
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,040
-Do you know where she is?
-Fuck, let's just go!

278
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,480
Damn it.

279
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,800
Wait!

280
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,840
Just tell me where she is. You must know.

281
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,920
Where is she now?

282
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Wait!

283
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,320
What the fuck…

284
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,600
It was her, right?

285
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,960
What? I can't hear you!

286
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,960
It was Hyun-joo!

287
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,240
You're right!

288
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,120
Damn it!

289
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,840
-What the fuck?
-What's wrong?

290
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,360
Where the fuck is she?

291
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,040
Are you Jin-rae?

292
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,880
-What the fuck?
-Wait!

293
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,800
Damn it…

294
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,640
Jin-rae, I'm not the police.

295
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,520
What do you want?

296
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,480
You said you wanted to join us.

297
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,920
You?

298
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,560
I'm sorry I lied.

299
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,240
I just want to ask you something.

300
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,800
Take a look at this picture.

301
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,440
I'll even pay you.

302
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,920
Look carefully. Do you know him?

303
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,760
Who is this?

304
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,760
-You really don't know?
-I have no clue!

305
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,080
-Who is it?
-It's my husband.

306
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,480
What the hell?

307
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,520
This is important to me!

308
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,960
You've never blackmailed him?

309
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,440
I've never seen him before.

310
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,480
Is Hyun-joo staying with you?

311
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,760
Why are you looking for her?

312
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,560
She's not with you?

313
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,200
I haven't seen her for a long time.

314
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,800
Wait.

315
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:43,880
What now?

316
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,640
Take this.

317
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,840
It's fine.

318
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:53,920
Just take it.

319
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,200
WARNING

320
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:22,880
Fuck!

321
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,360
What the hell?

322
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,440
What?

323
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,720
What the hell is that?

324
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,200
Fucking hell!

325
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,000
Damn it.

326
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,920
It hurts.

327
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,040
He muttered something.

328
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:40,080
Then, he spat on the ground and left.

329
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,920
It was so creepy.

330
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,000
What is it?

331
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,280
Let's just call the police.

332
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,440
What's this?

333
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,200
CHUNWOLDO TEMPLE

334
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,080
Who are you?

335
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,840
Why are you doing this?

336
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,000
What the hell are you doing?

337
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:36,880
It's already inside you.
Don't step outside the house.

338
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,280
Are you trying to scam me?

339
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,800
You must be behind everything.

340
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,680
Why are you doing this?

341
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:48,640
You must die in there! Die!

342
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,160
So-hee, calm down.

343
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,080
Just calm down.

344
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,560
-Did you check?
-Yes.

345
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,080
Hong So-hee met with the kids,

346
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,520
but she was somewhere else
when they were killed.

347
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,720
Both times,
her cell phone pinged miles away.

348
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,680
-Where you going?
-I gotta check something.

349
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:55,000
I'm fine. Nothing happened.

350
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,600
Really?

351
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,400
Yeah, really.

352
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,600
I'll bring some herbal medicine for you.

353
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,560
Why?

354
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,360
Hello?

355
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,800
Is anyone home?

356
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:13,840
Excuse me…

357
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,640
Is nobody home?

358
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,880
Is someone there?

359
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,600
Who are you?

360
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,960
Are you Eun-joo?

361
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,000
Who are you?

362
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,440
Can we talk a bit?

363
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,000
You know Jin-rae, right?

364
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:57,240
He said you might know where someone is.

365
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,320
Who?

366
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,280
Hyun-joo. Eun Hyun-joo.

367
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,680
Do you know where she is?

368
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,400
Why are you looking for that bitch?

369
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:13,160
What on earth happened?

370
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,520
I did nothing wrong!

371
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,800
She wanted it!

372
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,440
What do you mean?

373
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,080
Are you Hyun-joo?

374
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,560
Hi.

375
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,880
Come in. We're family now.

376
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,760
Oh, wow!

377
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,200
-Welcome!
-Let's go in.

378
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,600
-Drink! Drink!
-Hurry up.

379
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,520
Drink! Drink!

380
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:09,120
Drink! Drink!

381
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,800
Not bad!

382
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,800
Drink! Drink! One more drink!

383
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:20,600
One more drink! One more drink!

384
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,720
Let's drink some more!

385
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,200
Where are you going, bitch?

386
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:10,120
Where do you think you're going?

387
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:19,760
Do you want us to spread the video,
you slut?

388
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,360
Let's go.

389
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:38,600
A while later, Young-suk said that
he saw her go into some house.

390
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:42,280
You went after her to use her again?

391
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,800
That's right.

392
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,280
Family should make sacrifices
for each other.

393
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,560
That's not family!

394
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,120
That's not sacrifice!

395
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,520
Where's Hyun-joo now?

396
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,840
She's still in there.

397
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,000
Where?

398
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,680
The basement of the house.

399
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:38,600
CHUNWOLDO TEMPLE

400
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,600
You must die in there! Die!

401
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:08,840
What's up?

402
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:21,040
Hong So-hee's fingerprints were
found on the umbrella.

403
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,280
Got it.

404
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,040
What are you doing?

405
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,600
THEY WERE GOOD BABY RABBITS.

406
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,160
IT WENT THROUGH UNDER THE GATE.

407
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,720
Me? Why?

408
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:15,920
Over there?

409
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,200
Where did she go?

410
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,040
Park Ji-won!

411
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,320
Ji-won!

412
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:34,560
Answer me, or you're in trouble!

413
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,240
Make way.

414
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,440
Where did she go?

415
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,520
Park Ji-won!

416
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,200
You can't come inside.

417
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:08,800
Eun-joo…

418
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,200
You'll never believe me,

419
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,880
but I didn't hurt Eun-joo.

420
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,080
Are you joking?

421
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,560
I saw it with my own eyes.

422
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,120
I'm telling the truth.

423
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,880
I don't understand it either,

424
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,360
but it wasn't me.

425
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:35,600
You killed those kids as revenge.

426
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,560
You also created a false alibi, right?

427
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:42,040
Hong So-hee, who else could
have done this?

428
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:46,920
Will you still deny it?

429
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,920
-You know her?
-Damn it.

430
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:08,840
It's already inside you.
Don't step outside the house.

431
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,320
HYE-RAN

432
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:48,200
So-hee, Ji-won's gone!

433
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,280
Hye-ran…

434
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,400
Get out of the house!

435
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:54,960
-Hye-ran, Hye-ran!
-Let go!

436
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:58,120
Detective Nam, I have to go home.

437
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,080
-Please let me go.
-What?

438
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,000
My sister needs me.

439
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,040
Are you crazy?

440
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:05,600
-I have to go!
-Let go!

441
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,840
-I have to go home!
-Stay still!

442
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,720
So-hee!

443
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:11,640
SO-HEE

444
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,520
Get a grip!

445
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,760
What are you doing? Are you insane?

446
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,200
Let go!

447
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,000
Let go!

448
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,200
Mom?

449
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:58,320
When did you come down here?

450
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,440
I was worried sick!

451
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:02,800
Well, I…

452
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,480
-What is it?
-It's nothing.

453
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,080
Will you stop scaring me?

454
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,200
Ji-won…

455
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:19,920
Did you really see
Uncle Chang-soo last time?

456
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,400
Was it an older girl?

457
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:29,480
-I don't remember.
-It's okay, tell me.

458
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:32,160
I won't scold you for lying.

459
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,800
It was both.

460
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,920
Uncle Chang-soo said that
he wanted to be free.

461
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:44,680
Then, a scary-looking girl said
we should live together.

462
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:49,480
Why did you tell me
that you don't remember?

463
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:56,360
She said that if I told anyone,
she'd kill you and Dad.

464
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:03,000
I told you not to tell anyone!

465
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:15,200
Ji-won?

466
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:17,560
Ji-won…

467
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,400
Sir?

468
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,880
Where did the woman go?

469
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,960
No one else was in the car.

470
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,560
Hye-ran!

471
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:59,240
Ji-won! Ji-won!

472
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:01,840
-Hye-ran!
-So-hee…

473
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:03,280
Where's Ji-won?

474
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:06,000
She's inside, but this door won't open!

475
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,000
Open up!

476
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:09,600
Open this door!

477
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,680
Open up, now!

478
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:38,080
Hye-ran, Hye-ran!

479
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:39,640
Hye-ran…

480
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,480
Oh, no…

481
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,000
Ji-won…

482
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:08,880
Ji-won…

483
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:29,200
Ji-won.

484
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:31,440
Come here.

485
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,800
We should leave.

486
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,680
No, not Ji-won!

487
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,000
Why are you doing this?

488
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:23,760
You killed Chang-soo, didn't you?

489
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:28,200
What do you want?

490
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:30,320
Hey, wake up!

491
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,880
Are you awake?

492
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:37,080
Are you okay?

493
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:32,640
The weather's great.

494
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:35,760
Do you want me to take your picture?

495
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:44,880
It's all right.

496
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,160
You're very good.

497
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,320
You…

498
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,080
Leave.

499
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:33,520
What are you doing?

500
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,800
Give it back. Give it to me.

501
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,520
Give it back!

502
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:54,200
-What is this?
-Our baby.

503
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:56,240
We're a real family now.

504
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,400
The three of us should live here.

505
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:02,080
I want me and my baby to be happy.

506
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:06,720
Follow me.

507
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:10,600
Look around.

508
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:13,160
This is my baby's nursery! My real family!

509
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:14,600
This house is for them.

510
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,760
You think you're my family?

511
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,920
You fucked a bunch of guys

512
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,080
and you're trying
deceiving me, aren't you?

513
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:24,560
Is this how you betray my kindness?

514
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:28,680
How dare you fuck with me like this!

515
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:35,040
You don't believe me?

516
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,680
I'll show you what's inside my belly.

517
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,480
I'll show you our baby.

518
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,760
If I show you…

519
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,520
will you believe me?

520
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:49,640
What are you doing?

521
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:52,000
If we can't be blessed,

522
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,240
we're better off dead.

523
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,280
It shouldn't grow up like me.

524
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:03,080
Stop!

525
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:04,160
No, stop!

526
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,080
Hyun-joo!

527
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,640
Hyun-joo, Hyun-joo!

528
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:17,480
Hyun-joo!

529
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:27,440
Hyun-joo…

530
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,560
Hyun-joo…

531
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,080
Hyun-joo!

532
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,200
Hyun-joo!

533
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:45,200
Oh, no! Hyun-joo…

534
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:47,680
I'll dial 911!

535
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:49,600
Hyun-joo!

536
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,560
I had nowhere to go.

537
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,640
This is my home.

538
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:00,880
HYUN-JOO

539
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:09,320
The number you have called
cannot be reached…

540
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:16,360
It's not here.

541
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:19,960
Let's wrap it up.

542
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,040
Ji-won!

543
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:55,160
Ji-won, Ji-won!

544
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:32,000
Dad…

545
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:27,040
Hye-ran, Hye-ran!

546
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:28,600
Are you okay?

547
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:30,840
Get up.

548
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:32,640
Let's get out of here.

549
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,240
Give me Ji-won.

550
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:39,240
I'm her mom.

551
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:43,840
Hye-ran…

552
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:54,880
Hye-ran…

553
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:55,880
So-hee…

554
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,360
The three of us should live here together.

555
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:08,560
I want to be happy, too.

556
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,840
You said you'd be my family.

557
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:37,680
We're a real family now.

558
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:39,920
The three of us should live here.

559
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:45,600
I want me and my baby to be happy.

560
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:49,520
Can you live without me?

561
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:54,240
I can't live without you.

562
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:57,280
Don't you believe me?

563
01:18:58,120 --> 01:18:59,480
You don't believe me?

564
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:02,080
I'll show you what's inside my belly.

565
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:03,800
I'll show you our baby.

566
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,320
You'll probably still deny it.

567
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,680
Because you don't want to
be my family at all.

568
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:12,360
Why can't I be happy?

569
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,280
No, Hyun-joo.

570
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,920
Please stop.

571
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:32,720
I'll show you.

572
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:34,480
I believe you!

573
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:38,400
-You don't have to show me.
-Liar.

574
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:40,920
You're abandoning me,, too.

575
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:26,640
I know how hurt you are.

576
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,240
I'll…

577
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:35,240
be your family.

578
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:53,720
Come in.

579
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:56,640
We're family.

580
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:28,920
SPRING GARDEN

581
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:33,520
SPRING GARDEN:
ONE OF KOREA'S TOP 3 HAUNTED HOUSES

582
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,680
SPRING GARDEN BECAME A RESTAURANT,

583
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:49,840
BUT IT CLOSED BECAUSE
OF MYSTERIOUS DEATHS.

584
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:53,080
STRANGE ACCIDENTS KEPT HAPPENING

585
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:57,680
AND THE PLACE BECAME KNOWN AS
A HAUNTED HOUSE
