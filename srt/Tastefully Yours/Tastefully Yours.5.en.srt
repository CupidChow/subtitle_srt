1
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:01,978
TASTEFULLY YOURS

2
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:06,107
-Yes!
-I can't believe it went over.

3
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,109
Wait right here.

4
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,737
Hey!

5
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,865
-I lost all my ddakji.
-What are you doing here?

6
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:16,076
-She won them all.
-I was waiting for you.

7
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,414
For me? Why?

8
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,667
Hey! Let's play again!

9
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,586
-Come on, guys.
-You little punks.

10
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,463
-Run.
-W-What for?

11
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,841
-Wait! Let's play another round!
-Where are you going?

12
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,099
We came far enough.

13
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:24,018
We're good.
They stopped chasing us.

14
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,857
You grabbed my hand first.

15
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,776
That was then. This is now.

16
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,028
I really don't get you.

17
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,032
No, there's no way.

18
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:39,909
Are you sulking?

19
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,704
It's not like you to sulk.

20
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,501
Come on. Don't be like that.

21
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,962
Why are you in such a good mood?

22
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,298
-We didn't even win first place.
-I won them all.

23
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:56,926
What did you win?

24
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,311
From now on,
I'm the ddakji queen of this area.

25
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,652
I don't believe this. This is so annoying!

26
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,530
Are you jealous?

27
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,657
Fine, all right.

28
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,910
Pick one and I'll give it to you.
Which one do you want?

29
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,453
Forget it.

30
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,872
Why are you so irritated?

31
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,415
Why wouldn't I be?

32
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,958
Just accept it.

33
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,127
We lost.

34
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,923
-Do you think that's what this is about?
-Then what is it about?

35
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,341
Forget it.

36
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:39,469
-Tell me. What is it about?
-I said forget it!

37
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,762
Tell me!

38
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:44,807
Apparently, it looks like I have a crush.
Apparently, that's what it looks like!

39
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,144
Have a crush on what?

40
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,654
On you.

41
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,288
I like you.

42
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,002
Then…

43
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,463
you can have all of them.

44
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,661
What the heck?

45
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,288
You two…

46
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,253
Ooh!

47
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,299
What?

48
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,427
-Blood. I'm bleeding!
-Oh, dear!

49
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,311
I think I broke a bone. Damn it.

50
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,314
Is my nose crooked?

51
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,817
TASTEFULLY YOURS

52
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,319
Ms. Mo?

53
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,697
Are you not up yet?

54
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,543
Sleep well.

55
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,394
INTERNAL REPAIRS IN PROGRESS

56
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,271
-It's so heavy.
-Oh, come on.

57
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,397
No, wait. Hang on.

58
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,067
-Keep moving.
-Don't put it down. Just go.

59
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,236
-Watch the door.
-I gripped it wrong.

60
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,822
Whoa…

61
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,202
It looks much better.

62
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,413
This is it.

63
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,208
This is what a fine-dining kitchen
should look like.

64
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,962
I have incredible taste
in interior design, don't I?

65
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,798
-I practically did this for you for free.
-Hey, Chef?

66
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:07,009
-So--
-Oh, gosh. Are you done already?

67
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,011
-Yeah.
-Oh, my.

68
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,347
Is she a ninja or what?
She moves so swiftly.

69
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,723
-Good work, guys.
-Thanks.

70
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,892
That room will take a while to fix.

71
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,018
Will it?

72
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,478
The floor's really old,

73
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,356
so it'll take some time
until it completely dries out.

74
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,317
-It can't be helped.
-Call me if there are any problems.

75
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,402
-I will.
-Okay.

76
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,237
Take care, everyone.

77
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,572
-See you.
-Take care.

78
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:28,656
Bye.

79
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:29,949
-See you.
-Bye.

80
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,286
Goodbye.

81
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,581
Ooh!

82
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,876
Why are you grinning
like you have a screw loose?

83
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,128
Get everything sorted!
We've got to open soon.

84
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:45,381
-She's embarrassed.
-Hey, Chef.

85
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:49,135
So, about yesterday…

86
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,180
What about yesterday?

87
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,976
I mean, I couldn't ask you something
because you looked so busy.

88
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,394
Mmm.

89
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,645
Look here.

90
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,732
You see how there are
four bar stools here?

91
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,110
Should we space them evenly
for complete strangers,

92
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,279
or should we put two closer together

93
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,448
just like a sweet couple

94
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:13,534
that's sitting next to each other?

95
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,869
Couples, my foot.

96
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:17,455
Why would we put the chairs
closer together?

97
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,040
Separate them all!

98
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,709
Separate them?

99
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,127
Wouldn't it be better

100
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:28,257
to place them as if they were a couple?

101
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,597
-What did you say?
-You two.

102
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,682
-Your eyes just met, didn't they?
-Oh, my.

103
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,477
Things are going way too fast.

104
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,189
They used to be at each other's throats
and fought like crazy.

105
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,441
They made such a fuss.

106
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,151
-But suddenly…
-Suddenly…

107
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:48,945
-They kissed!
-They kissed!

108
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,617
Come on. Will you stop it?

109
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,828
Damn you.

110
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,331
Stop with all the nonsense.

111
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,417
Listen up, everyone. I won't repeat this.

112
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,004
What happened yesterday…

113
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,298
was a mistake.

114
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,718
Was it or not?

115
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:17,974
Yeah, it was.

116
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:20,851
Exactly.

117
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,896
So don't get weird ideas
or jump to conclusions.

118
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:26,482
That's forbidden.

119
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,733
No assumptions!

120
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,988
Excuse me?

121
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,076
Is this Jungjae?

122
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,370
-Yeah, I think so.
-What?

123
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:43,708
Hello.

124
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,670
Welcome.

125
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,089
You speak French.

126
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,174
Yes, I can.

127
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,303
Hello.

128
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:56,887
Hello.

129
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,389
He speaks French too.

130
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,558
He speaks French.

131
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,978
How did you find our restaurant?

132
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,523
We had your gimbap
at the food truck festival,

133
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,275
and it was delicious.

134
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,193
I took your business card then.

135
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,945
Oh, I see.

136
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,030
Thank you.

137
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,906
Sometimes,
he seems so learned.

138
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,909
My thoughts exactly. He surprises me.

139
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,953
What are they saying?

140
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,330
I don't get a word.

141
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,749
Thank you so much.

142
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,668
-We'll be counting on you.
-Sure.

143
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,753
Let's go.

144
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,090
-Yes, yes.
-Yes, yes.

145
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,261
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

146
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,471
Say goodbye.

147
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,144
Well? What did she say?

148
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,688
What? Just now?

149
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,899
-Yeah.
-Oh, gosh.

150
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,151
Okay, so…

151
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:57,448
They tried our food
at the food truck festival

152
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,992
and said it was delicious.

153
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,912
So it was just to their taste.

154
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,122
But why did they leave
without ordering?

155
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,083
No, they didn't come to eat.

156
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,127
They wanted to make a reservation
for the day after tomorrow.

157
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,712
We need to turn them down.

158
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,007
At least let me explain
the situation

159
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,009
-even if we end up turning them down.
-Exactly.

160
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,179
They're getting married,
and they want their parents to meet here.

161
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,473
-What?
-How did you know that?

162
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,308
She's just as surprising.

163
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:29,271
The woman's parents are flying in,
but her mom can't eat Korean food,

164
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,981
and neither families
welcome the international union.

165
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,566
Isn't that about it?

166
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,985
-No way.
-Oh, my gosh.

167
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,822
You know how to speak French?

168
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:41,742
The kitchen's not ready yet,
and it's too much pressure.

169
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,412
Hear me out.

170
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,996
If we take that reservation,

171
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,791
we can earn in one day
what we do in a week.

172
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,376
Why should we turn it down?

173
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,254
I get it. It's not just about money.

174
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:57,007
They think
both parents will like our food.

175
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,927
All else aside, consider it
from a customer management perspective.

176
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,345
Yeah, that's right.

177
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,097
Why turn down a great opportunity?

178
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,975
We could use this as an opportunity
to brand ourselves as

179
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,476
Jungjae, the bridge of love.

180
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,021
Yeah. We could host events
as a love bridge

181
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,982
and give couples a chance to kiss--

182
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,068
That topic's forbidden.

183
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,040
Just this once.

184
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,295
Do they think it's easy

185
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,547
to host that kind of event?

186
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,007
Yes, yes.

187
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,592
We get to serve foreigners.

188
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:40,885
Yes, yes.

189
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,470
What's wrong with her?

190
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:46,599
How can it be a mistake?

191
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,396
Of course it was a mistake.

192
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,939
It was a complete mistake.

193
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,483
I mean, come on.

194
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:59,320
Don't we all make such mistakes
at least once in our lives?

195
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,446
-We do.
-Right?

196
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,948
-Am I wrong?
-We do, so often.

197
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,867
-Being born was a mistake in itself.
-Geez.

198
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,869
Everything's a mistake.

199
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:11,290
Let me be brutally honest.

200
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,083
We're both adults.

201
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:17,171
So what if a grown man
and woman's lips touched?

202
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,340
Is that such a big deal?

203
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,799
-I guess not.
-Am I wrong?

204
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,092
Seriously.

205
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,137
You know, when I…
What's that place called? Paris.

206
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,764
When I lived in the 18th arrondissement…

207
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,850
I did it every day.

208
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,769
I kissed someone every single day.

209
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,355
-Oh, wow. You kissed every single day?
-Seriously.

210
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:37,066
Good for you.
That's why you're so fluent in French.

211
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,235
Yeah.
You did such fun stuff every day.

212
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,028
I'm so jealous.

213
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,738
The 18th arrondissement, huh?

214
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,116
-You know…
-What?

215
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,036
I just don't think it was a mistake.

216
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,246
I agree.

217
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,164
I don't think it was a mistake either.

218
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,503
Goodness.

219
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:01,215
Okay then.
Tell me what you think, Choon-seung.

220
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,175
What do you think it was

221
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,469
if it wasn't a mistake?

222
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,012
I think

223
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,765
it was more like

224
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,309
a wrongdoing.

225
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:16,939
Seeing this guy makes me think
it was a huge crime.

226
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,691
This guy made me realize that.

227
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:20,859
Huh?

228
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,737
Swordtip squid tastes better
when you whack it like this.

229
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,781
But what did you whack
me for?

230
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,616
You're so clueless.

231
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,211
Only my fiancé's father
will be attending from his family,

232
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,298
and he only wants Korean food.

233
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,342
But my mom can't eat
Korean food,

234
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,971
and she avoids eating
spicy and salty food.

235
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:54,768
So we're having quite a hard time
finding a restaurant to meet at.

236
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,731
Korean cuisine

237
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,984
that's not spicy or salty.

238
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,403
Not spicy or salty…

239
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,143
Ah!

240
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,579
A mistake.

241
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,248
A mistake…

242
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,669
It makes no sense.

243
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,504
Han Beom-woo?

244
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,847
Mo Yeon-joo?

245
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,184
My gosh.

246
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,062
You look just like her.

247
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,736
Did you drink again?

248
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:30,823
Mo Yeon-joo.

249
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,536
You know, I was really popular in Seoul.

250
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,791
You got a chance…

251
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,046
to kiss someone perfect like me.

252
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,218
How can you call that a mistake?

253
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,013
Take it back.

254
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,975
That's nonsense. It makes zero sense.

255
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,560
It doesn't make sense.

256
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,813
It doesn't make sense!

257
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,607
What do you want me to do then?

258
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,317
You might find me overwhelming.
I get that.

259
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,987
I'm quite good-looking.

260
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:11,947
I'm fit.

261
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,617
I did well in school. I went to Harton.
That says it all.

262
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,995
What about your personality? Hmm?

263
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,373
Your personality
is the worst of the worst.

264
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,211
What about yours then?

265
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,464
Your personality is just as bad.

266
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,758
Yeah, so let's call it a mistake!

267
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,844
What good can come from two
horrible personalities getting involved?

268
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:35,929
I want to get involved!

269
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,974
I want to get madly involved with you!

270
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:52,488
Even if you want to get madly involved,
some things just can't happen.

271
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,741
Why? Why not?

272
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,202
A kitchen is where you cook, not date.

273
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,496
Then we can keep that out of the kitchen.

274
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,457
What do you think this is, a rom-com?

275
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,501
When we're in the kitchen,

276
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,212
I won't say a word to you.

277
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,589
I'll pretend I don't exist.

278
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,132
I'll be invisible.

279
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,093
Say I enter the kitchen, okay?

280
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,220
I'm gone. I'm invisible.

281
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,346
But once I leave?

282
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,847
I exist.

283
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,768
Let me take you out on a date.

284
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,771
Go on a date with me first,

285
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,565
and then decide
whether you want to date me or not.

286
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,943
Although, I'm sure you'll want to.

287
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,113
I'm leaving.

288
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,615
Okay.

289
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,660
It's the day after tomorrow, right?

290
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,663
After serving the customers
the day after tomorrow,

291
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,249
let's go on a date that evening.

292
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,668
Are you even listening to what I'm saying?

293
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,753
Yeah, I'm listening.

294
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,338
-Hey.
-What?

295
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,550
We're going on a date that evening.

296
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,301
I'll show you

297
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,721
what a real date is.

298
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,224
I'll make sure of it.

299
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,116
Good morning.

300
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,325
Hey, yo.

301
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,454
Why are you dressed like that?

302
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,169
Well…

303
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,588
Why do you think I'm dressed like this?

304
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,887
"Jungjae."

305
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,057
I should dress the part
for a fine-dining restaurant.

306
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:48,187
-Also, there are a few more.
-Yeah!

307
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,147
What? We get one too!

308
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,441
-Here.
-Thanks so much.

309
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,944
-What do you think? Aren't they pretty?
-They're pretty. My goodness.

310
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,529
What about me? Where's mine?

311
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,531
You're still here?

312
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,202
Oh, my. Our repairs were done ages ago.
What's the gukbap boy still doing here?

313
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,079
What's gukbap?
I have no idea what that is.

314
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:10,125
That really hurt my feelings.

315
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,419
The food truck battlefield.
Our comradeship.

316
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,504
Did you forget that just like that?

317
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,173
I stacked all those cups and…

318
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,050
Oh, you're that guy.

319
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,343
So when will you leave?

320
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,427
What do you mean?

321
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,095
Once you're a part of Jungjae,
you're forever a part of Jungjae.

322
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,639
Jungjae, our Jungjae!

323
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,266
Do whatever you want.

324
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,353
Are you really going to leave
me out? I know you have one for me too.

325
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,581
Ladies
and gentlemen, welcome aboard Han Air

326
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:53,335
Flight HA511 to Incheon Airport.

327
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,295
We've reached our cruising altitude.

328
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,464
Shall I prepare
your meal, sir?

329
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,548
Yes.

330
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:01,176
Business class passengers only
can choose between two options

331
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,221
from Diamant three-star
French restaurant Le Murir Sapporo.

332
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:07,891
We have the Japanese bento box
and Western frenched rack.

333
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,312
Could I have both the bento box
and the frenched rack?

334
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,107
Oh, sure. I'll prepare them both.

335
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,191
Thank you.

336
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,219
Excuse me.

337
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:46,722
Yes, sir.

338
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:49,850
Will you try it?

339
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,769
It's okay, sir. We have our own--

340
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,866
It's salty and tough, isn't it?

341
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:08,535
Pardon?

342
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,246
In-flight meals are served

343
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,498
at a high altitude
and low barometric pressure,

344
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,208
so we adjusted the salt content.

345
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,628
You shouldn't cook it this way.

346
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,631
Sir, this is an in-flight meal,
so the quality of food--

347
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,051
You said it was from
a Diamant three-star restaurant.

348
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,510
Yes, but--

349
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:28,805
You must follow the manual
down to the last second for this menu.

350
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,683
The amount of sauce, the cooking time,
it's all wrong.

351
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:33,894
What's the matter?

352
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,194
This is my dish.

353
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,320
JEON MIN
LE MURIR

354
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,572
We'll be discontinuing
our in-flight meal collaboration.

355
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:49,076
Please stop serving this menu from now on.

356
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,747
It will only damage
my restaurant's reputation.

357
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,626
Please wake me up when we land.

358
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,966
STREAMSIDE NAMBU MARKET

359
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:10,555
-Here you go. Good day.
-Thanks. Take care.

360
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,891
We should watch a movie
on a day like this.

361
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,810
Do you like a particular genre?

362
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,813
Hey. What are you two doing here together?

363
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,232
Have you decided
to make it official?

364
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:23,068
Let's go elsewhere.
I'm going to buy from another butcher.

365
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,695
I was just kidding. Come on.

366
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:30,742
Can we have some beef brisket for broth
and boneless ribs?

367
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,370
Do you want everything I have here?

368
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,873
Come on, sir.

369
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:40,502
Just give us what we need.
The right amount, okay?

370
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,712
We're serving it to important customers,

371
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,215
so give us the fresh
and good-quality meat.

372
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:48,176
You're not at all like
what you used to be.

373
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,553
He was incredibly rude.

374
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:53,431
He wasn't just rude. He was immature too.

375
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:57,060
He acted like money
would solve all your problems.

376
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,980
He was so obnoxious.

377
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,609
With his hair like this…

378
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,696
"I'll take everything."

379
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,573
Give us the meat already.

380
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,158
Goodness, here.

381
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,242
There you go.

382
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,327
Thanks for gossiping in my presence.

383
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,789
The rude, immature, and obnoxious guy
will be leaving now.

384
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,167
But now,

385
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,003
you've become more human.

386
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:27,591
It's all because he stopped
being a money-grubber.

387
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,509
-Have a good day.
-Thanks. Bye.

388
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,470
You smell more human, I'm telling you.

389
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:35,265
Let's see. One, two, three, four…

390
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:43,940
Is it true?

391
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,025
What is?

392
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:46,943
You know…

393
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,446
Do I smell?

394
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,576
I'm not sure.

395
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,703
Will you shower more often?

396
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,080
No, I mean
what the butcher shop owner said.

397
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,165
Do I…

398
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:02,250
Do I smell more human?

399
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,710
That's what you meant?

400
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,631
You always went on and on about money.

401
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:10,300
Now you seem more sincere,
though sometimes, I don't think you are.

402
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,763
Is that a yes or a no?

403
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,431
Whatever it is, I like it.

404
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,850
It's nice to see.

405
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,186
You just said you liked--

406
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,270
Oh, right!

407
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,522
We have to settle a bill
with the vegetable shop owner.

408
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:27,275
Can you go pay him while you're here?

409
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,652
-Thanks!
-Hey…

410
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,571
What do you like?

411
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,448
What do you like?

412
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:39,996
Gosh, he's so persistent.
He just doesn't let go.

413
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,085
Yeon-joo.

414
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,626
How…

415
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:28,503
have you been?

416
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,432
-Why are you back alone?
-Hey, yo.

417
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,688
-Mo Yeon-joo.
-Get out.

418
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,612
Let's talk. I have something
to talk to you about.

419
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,240
Talk about what?

420
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,451
What is there for us to talk about?

421
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:01,786
How have I been?

422
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:03,788
Great.

423
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:05,707
I've been great.

424
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,625
Are we done? Now leave.

425
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:40,927
Who the heck parked their car
in the middle of the alley?

426
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,433
Hey, no. No. Wait.

427
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:53,440
This is a non-smoking area.

428
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:57,736
The restaurant owner…
…is really particular about it.

429
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,783
You almost would've
had your head cut off just now.

430
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:09,247
The restaurant owner
does what she says, you see.

431
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,960
You can smoke around the corner that way.

432
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,386
I'm back.
Thought I'd be late, didn't you?

433
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,929
-When it comes to work…
-Get over here.

434
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:28,057
-…I'm always on time.
-Come here quick.

435
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,393
-You tell him.
-Goodness gracious.

436
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,771
Someone was just here.

437
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,522
Someone was here? Who?

438
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,651
No one was here!

439
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,069
-Have you lost your mind?
-Have you?

440
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,488
Don't you have work to do?

441
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,655
My point exactly!

442
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,824
We've got work to do.
Pull yourself together.

443
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:47,577
What?

444
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,623
What is it?

445
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:55,543
What--

446
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,379
-Hello. Are you open?
-Oh, hello.

447
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,631
Welcome!

448
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,382
-Yes. A table for how many?
-Two, please.

449
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,092
Two? Come this way.

450
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,196
What?

451
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:25,615
It was his car?

452
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,662
What's he still doing there?

453
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:50,849
Look at that.

454
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,102
We have several times more customers
than we did before all the repairs.

455
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,478
We'll repay the debt in no time

456
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,813
at this rate.

457
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,773
-He's right.
-Let's go home.

458
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:18,626
We start early tomorrow morning,
so don't be late.

459
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,378
-Okay?
-Okay.

460
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,963
-Yes, Chef.
-Yeon-joo.

461
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,759
"Yeon-joo"?

462
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,598
I'm sorry.

463
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,438
Let's talk for a second.

464
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,287
Are you not going home?

465
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,205
-We should go.
-Let's go home.

466
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,458
Goodness gracious.

467
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,627
-Take care.
-I'm off.

468
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,920
Oh, wait. My bag.

469
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,769
-I was right.
-Right about what?

470
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:20,271
I was wondering where I'd seen him before,
and it was from here.

471
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,194
-It is him.
-Right?

472
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,655
Judging from the photo
and their conversation…

473
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,531
It's obvious there used to be something
between them.

474
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,242
What are you on about?
What is this?

475
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,707
AT LE MURIR

476
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,251
What's this?

477
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,671
"Le Murir…"

478
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:45,922
Take a look at this too.

479
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,132
I've been curious about this for a while.

480
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,384
It's all in English.

481
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:55,723
What?

482
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,643
"CIA"?

483
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,228
She's a cop?

484
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,777
I should've said this first.

485
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,321
I was wrong

486
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,365
in every way.

487
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,617
But give me a chance to explain.

488
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,160
Go ahead.

489
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:18,830
I wanted to come.

490
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,667
I wanted to come
all this time…

491
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,960
…but I couldn't.

492
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,922
To come and show myself
before you…

493
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,802
I stayed instead of you.

494
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:35,888
I wanted to make myself known at Murir
and continue your work--

495
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,181
What gives you the right?

496
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,353
It was my choice.

497
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,940
I made the choice to leave Murir.

498
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,027
Are we done talking?

499
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:52,947
Yeon-joo.

500
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,323
Can you please leave?

501
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:57,618
Yeon-joo, I--

502
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:02,582
Our Chef Mo has to go home now.

503
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,255
Sir.

504
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,924
This is the way out.

505
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,429
You said you'd kill us if we came in late.

506
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:18,347
You should leave too, Chef.

507
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:20,808
Goodbye.

508
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:23,436
I missed you.

509
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,399
A lot.

510
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:41,871
Who was it?

511
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:48,628
Who prepared the pufferfish?

512
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:50,880
I…

513
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,509
It was…

514
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,803
It was me.

515
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,021
Do you know what you've done?

516
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,983
With this incident,

517
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:15,279
everything I've built and worked for
went down the drain.

518
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:18,533
Three stars down the drain

519
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,202
and Murir's reputation completely ruined!

520
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,454
All because of you.

521
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,249
All because of you!

522
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:32,088
I'll take responsibility.

523
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,798
I'll take full responsibility

524
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,925
and resign.

525
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,476
It's okay.

526
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,520
It'll be okay.

527
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,287
WE HAVE
IMPORTANT GUESTS TOMORROW

528
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,330
DON'T GET DISTRACTED AND FOCUS

529
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,415
YEON-JOO…

530
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,175
RESERVED FOR SPECIAL GUESTS
ONLY TODAY

531
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,551
PLEASE COME AGAIN ANOTHER TIME!

532
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,986
-Wait. A bit more to the right.
-To the right?

533
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,487
-This way?
-Hang on.

534
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:41,866
Yeah, that's it.

535
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,883
WELCOME

536
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:02,929
Hello.

537
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,892
Hello. Thank you.

538
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,604
Hello.

539
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,694
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you.

540
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:33,417
What's the point
when we can't even communicate? Geez.

541
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,588
Please come this way.

542
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:38,673
Thank you.

543
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,135
-It's going to be okay.
-Yeah.

544
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:47,848
Hey,
it's way more tense than I expected.

545
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,112
Hello.

546
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,781
Hello.

547
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:08,160
We prepared a course that accentuates
what the two cuisines have in common.

548
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,669
Take your time
and enjoy your meal.

549
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,934
This is
an amuse-bouche made by Jungjae.

550
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:18,356
Korean yukhoe, beef tartare,
served on gamtae chips.

551
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,984
Is this it?

552
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,988
-This isn't Korean cuisine.
-Father.

553
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,157
I only eat Korean food.

554
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:35,122
He's not even touching it. What do we do?

555
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:19,500
These are square-shaped dumplings,
pyeonsu, filled with tofu and oysters,

556
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,793
which are your favorites.

557
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,920
It's served with
refreshing beef brisket broth.

558
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:25,840
You'll be able to taste the rich flavor
of the oysters if you eat them together.

559
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:29,844
Please go ahead.

560
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,432
It's Korean food this time.
You should try it.

561
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,602
Come on, just try some.

562
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,896
Father.

563
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,148
Please, enjoy yourself.

564
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,728
It's not bad.

565
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,447
Go. Now.

566
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,537
This is the one.

567
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:41,916
Let's go.

568
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,006
Sir.

569
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:50,799
This is Jungjae's special makgeolli.

570
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,635
I made it myself.

571
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:54,178
SHIN Choon-SEUNG'S
SPECIAL MAKGEOLLI

572
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:56,680
Carbon dioxide is formed
during the fermenting process,

573
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,475
and it clears and refreshes the palate.

574
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,853
So we paired it with an oily dish.

575
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:08,234
Special Korean white wine.
Thank you.

576
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,071
You're going to like it.

577
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,699
Mmm.

578
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,288
Oh, it's delicious.

579
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:24,250
Ooh…

580
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,293
She says it's delicious.

581
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:31,674
How do you say "cheers" in French?

582
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:32,800
"Santé."

583
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,554
Santé.

584
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,432
-Santé.
-Santé.

585
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,977
What a great day.

586
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,228
Indeed.

587
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:45,813
What's the next dish?

588
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,139
Sir.

589
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:22,308
We were told you like samgyetang,

590
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:25,394
so we combined that
with a French-style seafood soup.

591
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:28,105
You combined the two?

592
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:30,733
Yes.
I'm sure it'll be to your liking.

593
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:44,038
My, this is delicious.

594
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:56,050
This is delicious too.

595
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,093
It's delicious.

596
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:01,055
Yes, it's delicious indeed.

597
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,474
We might be from different countries,

598
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:06,810
but I guess everyone's palates
are the same.

599
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:13,776
Dear in-law.

600
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,780
Thank you so much for allowing my son

601
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,907
to marry our precious daughter.

602
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:29,041
He's thanking you
for raising such a beautiful daughter.

603
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:30,292
Ah…

604
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:38,384
She thanked you
for raising a great young man.

605
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:40,803
Thank you.

606
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,013
Thank you.

607
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,393
Let's eat.

608
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,563
-Santé.
-Santé.

609
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,482
-Santé.
-Santé.

610
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:56,068
-Santé, sweetie.
-Santé.

611
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,586
They enjoyed the meal.

612
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:20,592
And these two are perfect together.

613
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:37,317
RESERVED FOR SPECIAL GUESTS
ONLY TODAY

614
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,402
PLEASE COME AGAIN ANOTHER TIME!

615
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:41,029
It was the first meal
that my fiancée's parents both liked.

616
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:44,324
-Thank you so very much.
-Oh, we should thank you.

617
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:49,163
It was truly the best meal
I've ever had in my life.

618
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,959
I really liked it.

619
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:58,714
This is the first time
I've heard my father-in-law say that.

620
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:00,507
He's an incredible gourmet.

621
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,843
He's really famous.

622
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,928
Thank you. Please come again.

623
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:09,558
Sir, you know where to send
the wedding invitation, right?

624
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,977
Sure, I'll send you one.

625
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,732
-All right, let's go.
-Yes.

626
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:18,025
I really enjoyed the food.

627
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,902
Let's go now.

628
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:21,069
Get back safely.

629
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:22,946
-Get home safely.
-Have a safe trip.

630
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,449
-Book them for the wedding dinner.
-See you again.

631
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:26,867
Okay.

632
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,370
Are you hungry?

633
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,455
No.

634
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:35,167
Let's clean up.

635
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:38,295
-Come on.
-One second.

636
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:44,176
So…
…do we clean up and go?

637
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,179
Go where?

638
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,181
Well…

639
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,183
You know.

640
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,018
What we…

641
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:56,438
agreed on.

642
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:57,523
I mean…

643
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:01,777
The… You know…

644
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,904
The date--

645
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:16,875
We're not open today.

646
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,295
I'm here to eat dinner.

647
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:21,797
What's up with you?

648
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,507
This Hanok Village
has lots of famous restaurants.

649
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:26,134
-Go eat somewhere else.
-I told him to come.

650
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,219
What?

651
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:30,180
Sit wherever you want.

652
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,977
I'll finish up and lock up afterward.

653
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,436
You can go home first.

654
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,355
There's too much to do.

655
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:41,775
-You can't manage on your own.
-Right. You'll need help.

656
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:42,901
I'll be fine.

657
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:51,868
-No. I'll stay and help.
-It's fine.

658
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,831
I'll be there by 9 p.m. See you there.

659
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,047
It's good.

660
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,509
It's good even without peperoncini.

661
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:52,429
I'd expect
nothing less from Mo Yeon-joo.

662
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:55,932
Why do you think I cooked for you?

663
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,143
Mmm…

664
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:00,646
To make a point…

665
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:05,400
that even here…

666
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,402
…you're still cooking.

667
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:08,695
Something like that?

668
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:15,827
You probably don't remember,

669
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:19,706
but this is what we used to make and eat
with leftover ingredients.

670
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,834
We ate this hundreds of times.

671
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:27,881
Both you and my food…

672
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,676
…have changed a lot.

673
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,388
So, Jeon Min…

674
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,682
let's never meet again.

675
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,645
I just want you to be well.

676
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:44,773
No. I remember everything.

677
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:48,193
We just ate without even emulsifying it.

678
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,241
The staff meals we ate back then.

679
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,582
I chose to leave Murir--

680
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:03,959
You resent me.

681
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:11,466
Yeah.

682
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:14,761
I did resent you.

683
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:18,974
I resented you.

684
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:21,309
Because you never called after that.

685
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,895
-I told you I had my reasons.
-I don't care anymore.

686
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,397
Yeon-joo.

687
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,275
I don't want to know about you anymore,
and I don't want to resent you.

688
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,195
Do you know how much I loved Murir?

689
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:37,242
I loved and respected every person
in the kitchen.

690
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:40,245
-And for you, I--
-I know.

691
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:43,915
Chef Tatsuo, who you respected so much,
misses you a lot.

692
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:47,419
All this talk doesn't change anything,
so let's just stop.

693
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:50,422
We can go back to those days.

694
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,091
We can change things.

695
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:15,238
Should I have waited and come with her?

696
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:17,699
What, am I bothered?

697
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:18,784
No.

698
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:20,911
Hey, you doofus.

699
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,708
You're really good at being a nuisance.

700
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,126
What took you so long?

701
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,212
What are we going to do?

702
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,006
Do you know what this means?

703
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,051
Be quiet and follow me.

704
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:52,526
Where are we going?
I'm exhausted!

705
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,236
We're almost there.

706
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,822
So this is the kind of date you meant?

707
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,949
No late-night date is complete
without a rooftop.

708
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:00,992
Ta-da.

709
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:05,372
This is rather modest compared
to how you always boast about money.

710
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,208
What? This is modest?

711
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:10,252
It's a rooftop theater.

712
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:12,337
It must've cost a bit.

713
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:16,091
Will you stop worrying about money?

714
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:17,884
I'm Han Beom-woo.

715
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:22,889
You want
to rent my rooftop for free?

716
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:26,393
Yeah, sure, my dear newbie.

717
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:30,605
You know, love isn't easy.

718
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:35,026
I got myself a wife on that very rooftop.

719
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,321
You need to…

720
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,073
…fight for love.

721
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,705
Water. I need water.

722
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:49,624
I know some people here…

723
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,126
…so I pulled some strings.

724
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,672
I like movies where limbs get chopped off.

725
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:57,340
What gets chopped off?

726
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,183
What kind of life did you live?

727
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:48,493
A late-night movie
and a stroll around Hanok Village.

728
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,830
I didn't expect this from you.

729
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:56,626
Did you expect me to take you out
on a private plane or a helicopter?

730
00:54:57,293 --> 00:54:58,670
Though it would be possible.

731
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:02,924
By the way,

732
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,593
do you even remember
what happened in the movie?

733
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,070
Why aren't you asking?

734
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:26,823
About what?

735
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:35,540
You know, about who he is,
what he does, and how I know him.

736
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,255
You know…

737
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,507
…I don't care about that.

738
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:47,427
I'm sure

739
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:50,180
you'll tell me if you want to.

740
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,849
Eventually.

741
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,185
Right?

742
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,192
I'm an orphan.

743
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:05,111
What?

744
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:08,698
I was a baby, so I don't even remember.

745
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:12,702
But apparently, I was abandoned
at a hermitage at the base of a mountain.

746
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:17,207
All I remember of my childhood

747
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:22,045
is the mountain, the forest,
the temple, and monks.

748
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:23,546
That's about it.

749
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:31,471
Then I got older,
and I fell in love with cooking.

750
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:33,973
That's how I made my living.

751
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:39,270
Then I studied at CIA
and ended up in Japan.

752
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:44,150
At Le Murir, which you also know of.

753
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:52,242
That's where I met Jeon Min.

754
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:58,373
I liked him a lot.

755
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,921
It was the first time
anyone had treated me nicely.

756
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:14,639
I see, but…

757
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:20,019
I didn't want to know all that.

758
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:23,440
Anyway, now…

759
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:24,816
…you're broken up.

760
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,156
So…

761
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:33,992
why is he here?

762
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,288
He wants me to come back to Murir.

763
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:53,887
Are you going to go?

764
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:04,939
Why would I go?

765
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,941
Our restaurant's doing so well.

766
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:13,907
Right.

767
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:19,287
We might take over
the entire neighborhood.

768
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:33,968
BAEKSU INN

769
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,509
Where have you been all this time?

770
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:16,344
What are you talking about?
She went to Sapporo?

771
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:17,679
Yeah.

772
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:22,183
Do you think Chef Mo
abandoned us and the restaurant?

773
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:24,811
Neither of you showed up on time,

774
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:26,771
so we were getting ready
to open without you guys.

775
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:28,398
Then I found this in the kitchen.

776
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:33,111
Something urgent came up,
so I'm going to Sapporo.

777
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:36,990
I need you to take over
Jungjae's new kitchen for a while.

778
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:41,661
I'm sorry I only had time
to leave this short note.

779
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:48,042
The flight is at 4:10 p.m.
I'll be waiting.

780
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:16,446
TASTEFULLY YOURS

781
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,698
This means
she doesn't trust us.

782
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,700
I'll show you what I'm capable of.

783
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:21,826
-We can do it!
-We can do it!

784
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:22,994
This isn't cooked properly.

785
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:26,289
He came here to steal all the recipes!

786
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:28,166
We might all go down together!

787
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:31,461
-What the heck?
-Why don't you work with me?

788
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:33,838
Let's look. Let's do whatever we can.

789
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:35,173
Stop.

790
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:37,258
I came because I missed you!

791
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:39,218
He keeps trying to cross the line.

792
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,095
We already crossed the line.

793
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:44,098
