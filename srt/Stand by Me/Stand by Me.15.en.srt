=Episode 15=

3
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,800
So much opium

4
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,080
was brought in through my family's wharf.

5
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,870
Today, I finally met you.

6
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,040
I hope more opium can come into the country

7
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,720
through your family's wharf.

8
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,000
Feng Guanyu!

9
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,950
You're really with the Japanese. You traitor!

10
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,440
Why are you here?

11
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,870
I'm here to see for myself

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,160
if you're really a traitor!

13
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,120
Shoot!

14
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,630
Get him!

15
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,720
Where's he?

16
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,870
Go over there!

17
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,000
Go!

18
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,600
Come here and see if there's opium.

19
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,080
You've ruined my plan.

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,160
Come. Here. Is there any opium?

21
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,550
Am I a traitor?

22
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,240
Where's the opium?

23
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,320
I had it destroyed as it reached the port.

24
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,960
How can I let this thing poison the Chinese?

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,390
Why did you deal with Matsuyama

26
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,960
and kill Li Yaoming?

27
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,160
Here. Look at this.

28
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,160
Li Yaoming was the traitor working for him.

29
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,470
Li tried to kill you.

30
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,800
You'd have done without me.

31
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,030
I can't read this.

32
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,160
I won't fall for it just
because you say so.

33
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,670
OK. Let's go to meet Li Taotao.

34
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,520
She knows Japanese.

35
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,390
Let her tell you if what I said is right.
Let's go.

36
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,880
This is indeed a letter from Li to Matsuyama.

37
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,520
And based on the content,

38
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,160
they've been colluding for long.

39
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,270
You're lying.

40
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,390
Wake up.

41
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,240
I'm one of Anti-traitor Corps too.

42
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,750
I can't joke on this.

43
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,000
I trusted him so much.

44
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,190
How could he lie to me?

45
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,670
Alright. Don't be sad.

46
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,960
Say a bit more.

47
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,080
Maybe he didn't mean to lie to you.

48
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,910
You really suck at this.

49
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,360
I didn't mean to be used on purpose.

50
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,030
When you lied to me,

51
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,000
I didn't blame you.

52
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,600
You should have told me earlier.

53
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,390
Would you trust me if I did?

54
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,480
I managed to draw Matsuyama out.

55
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,510
And you messed it up.

56
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,390
You should have told me your plan.

57
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,720
Then I wouldn't mess it up.

58
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,790
I was doing it for your own good.

59
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,160
And now you're blaming me.

60
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,720
Do you even know how much trouble
you've caused for me?

61
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,110
I was hunted down and had to
jump into the river because of you.

62
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,230
I had to change my plan
and destroy the opium in public

63
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,600
for you hid your identity.

64
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,510
And... I'm not done yet.

65
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,000
You never wipe your shoes' bottom
when you come indoors,

66
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,510
leaving the floor all muddy.

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,230
You make a lot of noise
when you eat and sleep.

68
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,670
I can't fall asleep at all.

69
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,950
Most importantly,
you went to the warehouse alone.

70
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,830
What if you got shot by them?

71
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,760
I was wrong.

72
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,000
Don't make a fool of yourself.
Leave with me.

73
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,480
Matsuyama has escaped.

74
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,670
What if he gets back to you?

75
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,480
Who's started it must finish it.

76
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,110
I...

77
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,790
You're definitely capable of handling this.

78
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,720
Summon all people

79
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,790
to exterminate the Feng family.

80
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,600
Yes.

81
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,720
Besides, Mr. Matsuyama,

82
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,830
a man claiming to be with Feng Guanyu

83
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,000
wants to meet you.

84
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,550
Lu Jinzhong?

85
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,320
Mr. Matsuyama.

86
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,720
Do I need to get the whole Anti-traitor Corps?

87
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,200
No need. I've asked Zhao Qian

88
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,270
to allocate as many people back as possible.

89
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,320
I must kill Matsuyama.

90
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,480
Even his god can't save him.

91
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,600
Confiscate their guns.

92
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,920
Feng Guanyu, do you admit your mistake?

93
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,760
Lu Jinzhong! You traitor!

94
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,070
If it weren't for you,

95
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,790
would this family become like this?

96
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,920
Lu Jinzhong!

97
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,720
Now you're talking.

98
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,040
Why?

99
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,390
I've persuaded you many times.
Did you ever listen?

100
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,270
Why?

101
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,480
You insisted on opposing the Japanese,

102
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,270
making the family fall into this status.

103
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,510
Luckily, I work with Mr. Matsuyama

104
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,920
and save our family assets.

105
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,440
How can the Feng family

106
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,350
have such a coward like you?

107
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,000
Right. You're not afraid of death.

108
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,600
You're a patriotic hero.

109
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,880
But how about the family?

110
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,830
How about the family assets?

111
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,110
You know what? After you die,

112
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,480
I'll let all the newspaper release the news

113
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,200
to tell everyone in Shanghai

114
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,160
you're the traitor.

115
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,720
You can't prove yourself innocent by death.

116
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,110
Lu Jinzhong! You traitor!

117
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,920
Feng Guanyu is so nice to you.

118
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,200
Nice to me?

119
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,600
I treat him as my brother.

120
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,880
But how does he treat me?

121
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,150
For the sake of this guy,

122
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,590
you burned the opium, attacked Matsuyama

123
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,960
and got all of us into trouble.

124
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,790
All of us!

125
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,400
Today I'll terminate the trouble forever.

126
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,440
Lu Jinzhong!

127
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,000
You're still so protective of him by now.

128
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,640
Look what your father told you.

129
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,640
Be careful.

130
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,030
Be careful of others.

131
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,200
And you
brought Huang Weijie home.

132
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,590
You protect him all the time.

133
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,910
You know what I've done

134
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,400
for this family over these years?

135
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,590
So many!

136
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,670
What about him?
What has he done?

137
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,230
He's done so little.

138
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,400
How can he compare with me?

139
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,150
I've come to this family at 17.

140
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,960
I've served you heart and soul.

141
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,000
Feng Guanyu,
why are you people just the same?

142
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,110
How can he list out what he has done now?

143
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,640
Look who's talking.

144
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,280
If you hadn't ruined my plan,

145
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,520
Matsuyama would have been dead.

146
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,880
What do you mean?
Are you blaming me?

147
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,030
Can you use your brain

148
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,320
before you speak and act?

149
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,550
Shut their mouths.

150
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,110
What?

151
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:49,640
