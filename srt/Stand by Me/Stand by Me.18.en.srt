=Episode 18=

3
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,480
Let him go now.

4
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,270
One.

5
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,270
Leave me alone. Run!

6
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:30,800
Two.

7
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,550
Let him go,

8
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,550
or I'll shoot you.

9
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,230
Three.

10
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,480
- Behave well.
- Idiot!

11
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,080
Stupid Chinese people.

12
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,080
Since 1894,

13
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:48,870
you just can't think through

14
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,400
that your only choice

15
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,480
is to bow to the Japanese Empire

16
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,830
and the Yamato people,

17
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,310
and be governed by our powerful country.

18
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,910
Got tough, huh?

19
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,760
You're still trapped here.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,910
Mr. Matsuyama will give you the last chance.

21
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,440
Go and get the whole Feng family

22
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,670
to work with Mr. Matsuyama.

23
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,240
Or you'll both die here.

24
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,960
On your knees.

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,470
We Chinese only kneel

26
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,750
in front of heaven and our parents,

27
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,240
not you bandits!

28
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,320
Good. I'll grant your wish then.

29
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,520
Stop it.

30
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,110
Mr. Matsuyama,
you must know who I am, right?

31
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,600
The daughter of Deputy Mayor Li,

32
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,240
Li Taotao.

33
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,360
Why are you here?

34
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,550
Mr. Matsuyama,
Feng Guanyu is my fiance.

35
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,320
Huang Weijie is my good friend.

36
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,440
Today, I'm here to ask you

37
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,910
to spare their lives.

38
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,520
Mr. Matsuyama,

39
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,630
as long as you let them go today,

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,240
my father can guarantee

41
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,600
all your goods,

42
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,670
whatever it is,

43
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,750
will be safe from customs to sales.

44
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,470
He'll handle everything for you

45
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,750
with no strings attached.

46
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,270
What do you say?

47
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,600
Are you satisfied with this offer?

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,830
But I've never heard that

49
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,030
you and Feng Guanyu

50
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,190
are engaged.

51
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,190
If you have any concern,

52
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,830
we can prepare a wedding right away.

53
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,190
Deal.

54
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,520
I'll wait for your wedding invitation.

55
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,720
When I go to your wedding,

56
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,110
I'll bring the contract with me.

57
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,080
And I can ensure the interest

58
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,520
you two deserve.

59
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:04,830
Well?

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,720
Deal.

61
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,670
Please

62
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,520
wait and see.

63
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,630
OK, then

64
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,470
you can take them away.

65
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:17,550
Go.

66
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,720
Mr. Matsuyama,
please give me a few days

67
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,950
to sort out all resources of the Feng family.

68
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,110
Even if you wanted to get revenge,

69
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,790
you couldn't act recklessly.

70
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,000
Can it be you're with Huang Weijie for too long,

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,040
so you turn stupid too?

72
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,270
Now he's the stupid one.

73
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,920
Shut up! I tried my best to protect you.

74
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,000
Why did you come back?

75
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,350
He drugged me. How can I let him go?

76
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,950
When will you learn to listen to me?

77
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,920
When can you learn to say thank you?

78
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,510
If not for me,
you would have long been dead.

79
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:06,920
- I...
- Stop.

80
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,920
I tried so hard to save you.

81
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,070
Can you talk nicely?

82
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,040
This time,

83
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,720
thank you for saving us.

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,440
We're friends. Don't mention it.

85
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,720
We all want

86
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,160
to kill Matsuyama.

87
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,550
But you can't act recklessly anymore.

88
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,640
You know, where there's life, there's hope.

89
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,270
Yes, rest assured.

90
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,160
I'll keep an eye on him.

91
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,200
You won't run away again right?

92
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,790
(Matsuyama)
Mr. Matsuyama, how can you

93
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,200
release Feng Guanyu?

94
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,670
Can't you see it?

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
He can never

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,320
work with you for real.

97
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,760
He'll cause you trouble.

98
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,880
You must be afraid

99
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,600
of his revenge, right?

100
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,440
No, no, Mr. Matsuyama.

101
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,880
I'm thinking for the sake of your safety.

102
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,550
You know what,
that brat around Feng Guanyu...

103
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,320
Mr. Lu,

104
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,950
are you telling me what to do?

105
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,480
I dare not.

106
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,000
I have my own plans

107
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,440
about Feng Guanyu.

108
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:16,920
Please go back.

109
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,320
Please, Mr. Lu.

110
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,760
Miss Long.

111
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,760
I'm gonna have a drink at Floral Tavern today.

112
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,270
Would you please
do me the honor of joining me?

113
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,480
No, thanks.

114
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,830
Just call me by my given name.

115
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,830
I'm no longer Feng's butler.

116
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,200
Oh I almost forgot that you had betrayed Feng Guanyu

117
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,510
and the Feng family.

118
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,350
Feng Guanyu isn't dead.

119
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,110
You seem disappointed.

120
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,480
I've seen tons of selfish snobs,

121
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,920
but not many of them are as low as you.

122
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,550
How can you say that?

123
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,550
We're both working for Mr. Matsuyama now.

124
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,160
I've just made

125
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,070
the wise choice.

126
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,350
There are differences.

127
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,880
Don't forget that you're Chinese.

128
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,760
As for something, if I do it,

129
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,760
I'll be called ungrateful.

130
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,950
But if you do it, you won't
be accepted by the Lu family's cemetery

131
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,110
after you die.

132
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,670
You're merely lucky to be Japanese.

133
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,880
What the hell?

134
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,390
I must tell Feng Guanyu

135
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,070
Lu Jinzhong's whereabouts.

136
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,720
Mr. Matsuyama doesn't trust me.

137
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,600
You know what,
Feng Guanyu will definitely fight it out with him.

138
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,160
Who's there?

139
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,470
If you kill me,
Mr. Matsuyama won't let you go.

140
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,440
He won't live for long.

141
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,550
What I'm doing is for the sake
of the Feng family and you!

142
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,320
It's you.
You are led astray by Huang Weijie.

143
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,960
As long as I keep the Feng family,

144
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,590
I won't fail your father.

145
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,350
Then I'll send you to see him.

146
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,280
And you can explain this to him.

147
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,440
Lu Jinzhong did all those things.

148
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,550
It's my fault.

149
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,840
It had nothing to do with you.

150
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,400
It was his choice.

151
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,880
He always claimed to protect my family,

152
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,520
but forgot what he should do as a Chinese man.

153
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,280
If the Japanese bring the opium into the country,

154
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,400
numerous families will be ruined.

155
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,520
I get it.

156
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,080
But you've lost everything.

157
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,520
I still have you

158
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,150
and the friends of Anti-traitor Corps.

159
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,400
No worries.

160
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,200
I'll stay by your side forever.

161
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,790
But you can't live well

162
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,640
being with me.

163
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,470
I didn't live well

164
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,640
when I was with you.

165
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,200
You still can regret now.

166
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,640
Don't estimate me.

167
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,400
I'm telling you, I, Huang Weijie,

168
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,710
will be a hero.
