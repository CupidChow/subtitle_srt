00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,120
(Just stay calm and put on a show.)

4
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,080
(I'll force him to tell me his purpose.)

5
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,830
Feng Guanyu.

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Feng Guanyu.

7
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,870
Feng Guanyu.

8
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,910
Don't play dumb.

9
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:07,760
What's this?

10
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,880
Can't keep up the act?

11
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,800
I'm not acting.

12
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,830
I came back already.

13
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,440
Don't you get it yet?

14
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,270
Didn't you say you won't come back
to the Feng family even if you die?

15
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,080
Aren't you still alive?

16
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,030
I'm going to bed.

17
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,670
I was wrong.

18
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,080
What?

19
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,910
You heard me.

20
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,630
I didn't hear you.

21
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,910
Let me ask you.
Are the promotion and raise

22
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,320
you previously agreed
still on the table?

23
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,670
I don't remember those.

24
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,340
I'm still willing to stick
by your side despite that.

25
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,080
Why?

26
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,720
Because I know

27
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,470
you're a good guy.

28
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,600
But at the moment,

29
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,670
I'm not short of bodyguards.

30
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,360
Forget about the promotion and raise,
I'm fine with any job.

31
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,160
You would do any job?

32
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,320
Then, you will

33
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,080
report to the servants' station tomorrow.

34
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,360
What?

35
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,320
I've disposed of all
Ma Wancai's associates.

36
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,110
The person who took over Ma family's
chamber of commerce is quite compliant.

37
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,720
What are you doing? Scrub harder.

38
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,480
If you don't do a proper job,
I'll give you a good whipping.

39
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,640
This is dirty, it needs to be washed.

40
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,700
This needs to be washed too.

41
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,480
This coat stinks so bad,
it needs a proper washing.

42
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,480
If this goes on,

43
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,390
I'll be dead-beat before I find

44
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,760
any information on the opium.

45
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,900
(Le Paris Oriental)

46
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,440
Young Master,

47
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,510
about that recent batch of goods, we...

48
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,510
(That must be something confidential
if he needs to burn it.)

49
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,480
(It might be related to the opium.)

50
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,410
Who told you to come clean up this place?

51
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,830
If you messed up the documents,

52
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,110
I'll give you a good whipping.

53
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,100
Our young master likes cleanliness.

54
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,230
See, it's dusty here.
I'd better wipe it down.

55
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,550
There's no dust here.

56
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,760
Then, I'll go wipe elsewhere.

57
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,020
(Le Paris Oriental)

58
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,350
(Sounds like a restaurant.)

59
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,110
(No matter what it is,
I need to inform Yaoming.)

60
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,270
(He can surely find the clues.)

61
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:39,920
Young Master.

62
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,330
I need to meet someone very important.

63
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,830
It's almost time. Let's go.

64
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,670
Hello, get Li Yaoming for me.

65
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,390
Young Master, why did you call for me?

66
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,303
Change into this.

67
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,920
The last time

68
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,830
you made me change,

69
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,830
I almost died in a church.

70
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,790
You don't want me
to come back this time?

71
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,480
No more nonsense.

72
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,200
Young Master, I'm just a servant.

73
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,510
You should get your bodyguards
to handle dangerous matters.

74
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,720
Feng family's subordinates
are all-rounders.

75
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,230
One needs to be specialized.
I can't do this.

76
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,230
You want to quit?

77
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,480
Young Master, what are you talking about?

78
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:24,270
My job is to serve you.

79
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,480
If you want to quit, you can leave.

80
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,760
I'm risking my neck for money.

81
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,230
I'll go.

82
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,150
Tell me. What do I need to do?

83
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,280
You will carry out
an extremely hard mission.

84
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,306
My insignificant life will end
in your hands someday.
