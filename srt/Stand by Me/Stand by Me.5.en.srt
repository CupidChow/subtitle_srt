3
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,310
I'll go and check on
his letter of repentance.

4
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,630
Are you...

00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,740
(Eye)

6
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,590
Huang Weijie, what are you doing?

7
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,190
I wasn't doing anything at all.

8
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:35,680
Young Master.

9
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,900
(Eye)
[*Be careful+eye=petty in Chinese]

10
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,510
Young Master, I...

11
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,080
Serve him the family punishment!

12
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,760
Huang Weijie.

13
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,120
How bold of you. You...

14
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:50,080
How dare you disrespect the family motto
that master personally penned.

15
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,440
What's this about family motto or whatnot?

16
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,120
It's just a piece of paper.

17
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,120
What's so great about it?

18
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,950
I'll whip you to death!

19
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,950
Come on then. Whip me to death!

20
00:01:59,510 --> 00:01:59,910
I...

21
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:05,720
Do you admit your mistake?

22
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,190
I don't.

23
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,320
At worst, I'll just quit.

24
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,320
Young Master, how much longer
are you going to spoil him?

25
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,390
I'll do it myself.

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,360
Young Master.

27
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,720
Do you admit your mistake?

28
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,110
I'm giving you one last chance.
Admit your wrongdoing.

29
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,190
Young Master.

30
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,360
Feng Guanyu, is that all you've got?

31
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,550
Young Master, let me do it.

32
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,670
Were you wrong or not?

33
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,980
This medicine works best for injuries.

34
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,240
What do you mean by this?
A carrot after stick approach?

35
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,780
Where are you going?

36
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,470
Stop right there.

37
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,550
Without my permission,

38
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,630
you cannot leave the Feng family.

39
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,910
Then shoot me dead now.

40
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,080
You know what those two words

41
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,190
mean to us in the Feng family.

42
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,390
If I hadn't done it myself,

43
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,240
Lu Jinzhong would've beaten you to death.

44
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,260
Feng Guanyu,

45
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,550
a piece of scrap paper
is more important than me!

46
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,670
Stop right there.

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,440
Feng Guanyu, I trusted you ten years ago.

48
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,350
But you still abandoned me.

49
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,390
Now I don't want
to have anything to do with you.

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,160
Your father was right.

51
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,200
You cannot trust anyone.

52
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,720
You...

53
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,390
I followed you through life and death

54
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,390
and you left me to die.

55
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,230
I didn't have a choice.

56
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,230
Didn't have a choice?

57
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,160
How many more times
will you not have a choice?

58
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,950
Young Master, where is Huang Weijie?

59
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,790
He left.

60
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,110
He left? Did you chase him out?

61
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,760
No way. How could you let him leave?

62
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,830
Didn't you want him
to leave the Feng family?

63
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,230
He left. Are you satisfied now?

64
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,070
No, I'll go and drag him back now.

65
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:23,670
Stop right there.

66
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,160
Young Master, this kid must be
trying to escape punishment.

67
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,390
I was too harsh on him.

68
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,480
No. Just think about it, Young Master.

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,390
That traitor is already dead.

70
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,880
How did Long San get information

71
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,950
about you going to the church?

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,790
What do you mean?

73
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,110
Ever since Huang Weijie
came to the Feng family,

74
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,270
we've always been on edge.

75
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,000
I met him ten years ago.

76
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,350
With that dumb brain of his,
he cannot be a spy.

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,140
Then, why would he coincidentally

78
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,920
show up in Ma Wancai's private room?

79
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,550
I think he purposely showed up
to get close to you.

80
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,670
(He can't even kill a person.)

81
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,920
(His marksmanship is terrible.)

82
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,390
(He even went the wrong way
while being hunted down.)

83
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,000
Then, will you

84
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,390
betray me?

85
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,550
What are you going on about?

86
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,510
(Huang Weijie, can I trust you?)

87
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,000
(Do you really want
to leave the Feng family)

88
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,760
(or are you keeping a secret from me?)

89
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,670
(Before I know the truth,)

90
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,950
(don't think about escaping from me.)

91
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:55,270
(Grocery Store)

92
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,230
This injury is lighter than it looks.

93
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,160
Does it still hurt?

94
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,350
I don't really feel anything.

95
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,440
It doesn't hurt as much now.

96
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,640
I told you.
This medicine is really effective.

97
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,770
(This medicine works best for injuries.)

98
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,160
(This bottle of medicine, could he...)

99
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,550
(You know what those two words)

100
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,510
(mean to us in the Feng family.)

101
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,550
If I hadn't done it myself,

102
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,670
Lu Jinzhong would've beaten you to death.

103
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,230
(Could he really have done it
for my own good?)

104
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,320
Weijie, did you manage
to get any information?

105
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,440
The opium

106
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,510
is in Feng Guanyu's hand.

107
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,110
Where did Feng Guanyu move the opium?

108
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,790
(Letter of Apology)
Suburbs, old house, river,

109
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,390
grandfather, grave.

110
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,110
What does this mean?

111
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,510
That's my question.
Aren't you in charge of intelligence?

112
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,480
I can't decipher this for now,

113
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,510
but you have a new mission.

114
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,160
What mission?

115
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,670
Continue infiltrating Feng family

116
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,830
and find that batch of opium.

117
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,200
Are you mentally retarded?

118
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,350
Weijie, you are also aware

119
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,000
that Feng Guanyu is suspicious by nature.

120
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,910
No one else can get close
to him except you.

121
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,520
No way. I just got out of there.

122
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,790
I even got injured.

123
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,200
Besides, Feng Guanyu is ruthless.

124
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:44,960
If I go back there,

125
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,960
he will beat me half-dead.

126
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,710
If I let him...

127
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,280
Don't you welcome your customers?

128
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:57,910
Why are you here?

129
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,880
Lu Jinzhong told you to leave,
so you just left.

130
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,790
Mr. Feng, we weren't expecting you.

131
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,470
Weijie, what did I tell you?

132
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,280
My minor injury is not a big deal.

133
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,710
Since Mr. Feng has personally come here,
why don't you go back with him?

134
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,230
