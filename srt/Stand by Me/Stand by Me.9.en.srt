00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,740

2
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,700
=Episode 9=

3
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,720
Who do you think those people are?

4
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,800
They even impersonate
as the Anti-traitor Corps.

5
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,760
How do you know they're impostors?

6
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,590
They don't even have a badge.

7
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,720
Of course they're impostors.

8
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,830
The Anti-traitor Corps has badges, I see.

9
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,590
You seem to know a lot
about the Anti-traitor Corps.

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,120
I don't know much.

11
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,310
I just heard about them.

12
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,590
(Did I just expose myself?)

13
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,950
(If he knew I'm lying to him,)

14
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,760
(he wouldn't kill me, right?)

15
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,750
(Judging from this kid's reaction,)

16
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,616
(he must be one of
the Anti-traitor Corps.)

17
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,540
(Punish the traitors and eliminate evil.)

18
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,800
(I never took him to be this brave.)

19
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,110
(Huang Weijie, you dummy.)

20
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,270
(He doesn't even realize
he exposed himself.)

21
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,000
(I need to think of a way)

22
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,520
(to get him and the Anti-traitor Corps
off my back,)

23
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,750
(so they won't ruin my plan.)

24
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,320
(Feng Guanyu made Zhao Qian
and Sun Li lie low outside)

25
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,390
(over a blind date?)

26
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,800
(Maybe he really isn't a traitor?)

27
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,440
(But where is that batch of opium?)

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,240
(I need to think of a way to find out.)

29
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,440
What's over there?

30
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,720
What is it?

31
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,390
I read a piece of news today.

32
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,830
It said a traitor got assassinated.

33
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,720
It seems like the work of
the Anti-traitor Corps.

34
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,360
I'm worried for you,
so I'm here to protect you.

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,550
Really?

36
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,630
But what is there for you to worry about?

37
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,750
I'm just another respectable businessman

38
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,470
and haven't done anything treasonous.

39
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,600
You wouldn't suspect me
of being a traitor, would you?

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,600
No, no, no.
How could I possibly suspect you?

41
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,600
I was just thinking.

42
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,000
Since you run a legitimate business,

43
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,360
if President Ma's opium
is really with you,

44
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,440
shouldn't you hand it over
to the Anti-traitor Corps

45
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,080
to save yourself from a lot of trouble?

46
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,720
You aren't with
the Anti-traitor Corps, right?

47
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,550
No, no. How could I possibly be one?

48
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,320
There's no way
I'm part of the Anti-traitor Corps.

49
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,270
Didn't you say I'm brainless?
That's impossible.

50
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,230
I trust you.

51
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,880
You will never lie to me.

52
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,670
Of course, of course.

53
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,600
For you.

54
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,230
For me?

55
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,070
My father gave me this gun.

56
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,110
He hoped that I will use it
to protect the Feng family and myself.

57
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,390
Now,

58
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,390
I'm handing it to you.

59
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,510
This... This is too significant.
It's inappropriate.

60
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,230
- It's fine.
- It's really inappropriate.

61
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,667
- Take it.
- It's really inappropriate.

62
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,904
- Take it.
- It's inappropriate.

63
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,920
- I'm sorry.
- You...

64
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,880
Don't get angry.
I didn't do it on purpose.

65
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,270
- You...
- How about this?

66
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,200
I'll give you something in return.

67
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,230
Okay? This...

68
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,120
(Anti-traitor Corps)

69
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,160
(Crap! I got exposed.)

70
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,720
(The more I don't want to expose you,
the more trouble you cause.)

71
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,160
Incompetent and full of flaws.

72
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,160
Let's go.

73
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,110
Have you done what I told you to do?

74
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,160
As per your instruction,

75
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,200
the opium was transported
to the eastern warehouse.

76
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,920
But we haven't found out
who is Long San's boss yet.

77
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,440
Keep investigating.

78
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,160
Yes.

79
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,200
Young Master,
I would like to remind you again.

80
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,110
We must not get involved
with the Japanese.

81
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,600
Aren't you done yet? Are you even Chinese?

82
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,070
This batch of goods was shipped in
using the Feng family's port.

83
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
We have the responsibility

84
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,070
to stop Japanese's opium
from harming the people.

85
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,350
But you mustn't forget the motto
the master left behind.

86
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,440
Be careful of everything.

87
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,790
My father also said

88
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,480
never be a traitor.

89
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,110
- But...
- Get out!

90
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,110
How many guards are posted
at the eastern warehouse?

91
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,230
We've arranged ten men
to guard it day and night.

92
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,510
Remove these guards tomorrow night.

93
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,790
Then, think of a way

94
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,790
to leak this information to Huang Weijie.

95
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,880
Don't tell him directly.

96
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,920
Young Master, may I ask why?

97
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,600
We'll do it right away.

98
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,230
(Weijie, here's your chance.)

99
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,920
(When the Anti-traitor Corps finds this opium,)

100
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,510
(you will complete the mission.)

101
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,390
(You can finally leave this place.)

102
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,950
(I will face the danger)

103
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,110
(from the Japanese alone.)

104
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,160
No one is on opium guard duty
tomorrow night.

105
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,350
Where is the opium?

106
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,550
The eastern warehouse.

107
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,230
Do you think he heard it?

108
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,640
I don't know.

109
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,720
This won't do. Young Master said

110
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,830
to make sure he heard it.

111
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,040
Come on.

112
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,230
He's here. No one is on opium guard duty
tomorrow night.

113
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,880
Where is the opium?

114
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,230
The eastern warehouse.

115
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,440
Has he heard it?

116
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,510
I don't know.

117
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,070
Come on.

118
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,270
No one is on opium guard duty
tomorrow night.

119
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,160
Where is the opium?

120
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,670
The eastern warehouse.

121
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,390
No one is...

122
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,040
No one is...

123
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,600
No one is on opium guard duty
tomorrow night.

124
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,670
Where is the opium?

125
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,200
The eastern warehouse.

126
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,200
No one is on opium guard duty
tomorrow night.

127
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,520
Where is the opium?

128
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,250
No one is on opium guard duty
tomorrow night.

129
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,550
Come on.

130
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,150
Come on.

131
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,550
No one is on opium guard duty
tomorrow night.

132
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,640
Where is the opium?

133
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,590
The eastern warehouse.

134
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,770
No one is on opium guard duty
tomorrow night.

135
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,000
Where is the opium?

136
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,790
The eastern warehouse.

137
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,350
