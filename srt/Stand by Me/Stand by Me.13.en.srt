2
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,740
=Episode 13=

3
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:32,680
What are you doing?

4
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,000
You...

5
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,830
What's up?

6
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,000
I have a question.

7
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,510
Shoot.

8
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,310
Why is Long San still alive?

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,870
I let her off.

10
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,160
Why did she come back then?

11
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,950
She came back to
thank me for not killing her.

12
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,040
Why?

13
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,190
She's Japanese,

14
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,910
but she is brought up in China

15
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,630
by her Chinese foster parents.

16
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,670
She's forced by the Japanese
to do those things.

17
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,520
She's a poor girl.
I don't want to kill her.

18
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,270
Oh yeah?

19
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,390
Or why would she come back?

20
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,960
Feng Guanyu, are you sure
you're not hiding anything from me?

21
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:32,830
No.

22
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,800
You're not working with the Japanese, right?

23
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,360
Come on.

24
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,960
How can I work with the Japanese?

25
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,830
Don't you lie to me.

26
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,910
If you don't believe me,
I'll have nothing to say then.

27
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,390
(I'll trust you for this once.)

28
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,630
(I promised no lying to you again.)

29
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,160
(But it's more risky than 10 years ago.)

30
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,320
(I can never involve you in this.)

31
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,390
(I didn't expect Long San
would betray Mr. Matsuyama)

32
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,270
(and work with Feng Guanyu.)

33
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,440
(If I tell Mr. Matsuyama this,)

34
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,550
(I'll regain his trust.)

35
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,100
(Mr. Matsuyama)

36
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,780
(Mr. Matsuyama)

37
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,640
Weird.

38
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,350
Where is it?

39
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,350
Yaoming, what are you doing?

40
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,950
Look. This is the evidence.

41
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,760
What... What evidence?

42
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,110
A letter in Japanese.

43
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,320
It dropped from Feng Guanyu's pajamas.

44
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,160
Let me take a look.

45
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,880
Why? You can't read Japanese.

46
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,880
I trusted him.

47
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,600
He's such a liar.

48
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,160
Weijie, calm down.

49
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,760
This may be an ordinary business letter.

50
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,920
Enough defending him.

51
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,350
I'll ask him what's about the letter.

52
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:11,760
Weijie.

53
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,040
(What to do?)

54
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,510
(If Feng Guanyu sees this letter,
I'll definitely be exposed.)

55
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:18,880
(No way.)

56
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,440
OK.

57
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:24,950
Feng Guanyu.

58
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,070
No knocking again.

59
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,110
Feng Guanyu, tell me what this is.

60
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,950
You don't let me see it.
How would I know?

61
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,860
(Mr. Matsuyama)

62
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,230
Is it your letter to the Japanese?

63
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,720
It has the sign of the Feng family.

64
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,600
How did you get it?

65
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,230
I saw it with my own eyes.

66
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,760
It dropped from the pocket of your pajamas.

67
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,480
What do you mean? I don't get it.

68
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,670
Feng Guanyu,
why did you deceive me again?

69
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,950
You're impossible.

70
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,480
Tell me.
Are you colluding with the Japanese?

71
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,720
You always say I don't trust you.

72
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,920
Is this what I get for trusting you?

73
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,790
You're such a perfidious hypocrite.

74
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,550
You're always

75
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,040
so reckless.

76
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,720
How can I not hide this from you?

77
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,110
Weijie, Weijie.

78
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,080
Weijie, don't blame me.

79
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,640
You should blame your innocence.

80
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,280
Justice and heroics are crap.

81
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,710
Whoever pays most is the boss.

82
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,960
I've got to look out for myself.
Money is what really matters.

83
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,030
A friend is the least one
you should trust in the world.

84
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,710
