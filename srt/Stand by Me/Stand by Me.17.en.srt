3
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,500
(Matsuyama)

4
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:34,630
Who are you?

5
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,870
Matsuyama.

6
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,360
Matsuyama, I'm here to kill you.

7
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,400
Matsuyama, get out right now!

8
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,630
Welcome. Welcome.

9
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,670
Mr. Feng, you're a rare visitor here.

10
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,110
I don't understand

11
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,160
why you're so hostile to me.

12
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,240
Like you, I like peace too.

13
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,670
I don't want to see blood shed
and war happening.

14
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,960
Shut your mouth.

15
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,030
Feng Guanyu.

16
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,880
Mr. Matsuyama treats you with courtesy.

17
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,600
How dare you be so rude?

18
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,520
Apologize to Mr. Matsuyama now.

19
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,320
Lu Jinzhong,

20
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,470
since you're willing to be the Japanese's lackey,

21
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,880
I'll grant your wish today.

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,030
Protect Mr. Matsuyama.

23
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,800
- Take him away.
- Yes.

24
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,190
I'll fight it out with you.

25
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:55,800
Go.

26
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,500
(Matsuyama)

27
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,070
(Oh no, there are so many of them.)

28
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,070
(I can't break in anyway.)

29
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,350
(Li Taotao hasn't come yet.)

30
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,440
(Oh right, Li Yaoming once mentioned)

31
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,550
(a pipe linked with the rooftop.)

32
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,200
How are you feeling, Mr. Feng?

33
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,350
Still not yielding, huh?

34
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,640
Everything of the Feng family,

35
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,000
just like this place,

36
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,320
I decide on whether it exists or not.

37
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,000
If I want it destroyed,

38
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,270
it'll be destroyed.

39
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,160
Who's there?

40
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,830
Your papa, Anti-traitor Corps.

41
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,270
Why are you here? Leave!

42
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,510
Huang Weijie.

43
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,720
Since you know it's me,

44
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,320
hurry and release Feng Guanyu.

45
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,760
Otherwise,

46
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,670
I'll shoot you in the head.

47
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,920
Why are you laughing?

48
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,070
Mr. Huang,

49
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,670
I admire your courage.

50
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,230
But isn't it too boring

51
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:17,760
if I just release Feng Guanyu like this?

52
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,230
What do you mean?

53
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,640
Leave me alone. Run!

54
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,040
Stop it.

55
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,880
Believe it or not, I'll kill you now.

56
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,040
Mr. Huang.

57
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,790
I'll give you a chance to save Feng Guanyu.

58
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,790
What do you want?

59
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,590
I want to play a game with you.

60
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,520
I'll count to three.

61
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,520
Let's shoot together.

62
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,440
I'll be shot to death.

63
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,880
Feng Guanyu will die too.

64
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,710
Let's see

65
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,000
which one you want more,

66
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,150
me dying or Feng Guanyu alive?

67
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,320
Who wants to play games with you?

68
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,200
Let him go now!

69
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,790
One.

70
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,000
Leave me alone. Run!

71
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,110
Two.

72
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,440
Let him go, or I'll shoot you.

73
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:10,880
Three.
