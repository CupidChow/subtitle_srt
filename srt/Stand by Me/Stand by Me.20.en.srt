00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,700
=Episode 20=

3
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,230
Mr. Matsuyama, we've searched around.

4
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,510
It's safe here.

5
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,760
How about the couple?

6
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,590
We checked them too. They're unarmed.

7
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:41,800
Yes.

8
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,830
Unexpectedly, I've tried so hard

9
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,400
but I'm still cornered to this stage.

10
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,800
Did you regret this?

11
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,440
I used to think that I was omnipotent.

12
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,760
But now

13
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,830
I can't even protect who I want to protect.

14
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,600
You're not that bad.

15
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,880
What's the point of living then?

16
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,390
You're alive. And that matters.

17
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,000
Congratulations, Mr. Feng.

18
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,830
There's one last step

19
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,160
before we can reach

20
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,750
our cooperation.

21
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,880
Yeah, today,

22
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,830
will you fulfill your commitment?

23
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,320
This is a present for you two.

24
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,080
After the wedding is over,

25
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,030
we can sign the contract.

26
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,630
Our opium

27
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,800
will be transported into China endlessly.

28
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,190
What do you say?

29
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,630
Mr. Matsuyama,

30
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,720
thank you.

31
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,550
You're gonna witness

32
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,960
a wedding you've never seen.

33
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,830
I'm looking forward to it.

34
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,550
Miss Li,

35
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,470
do you take Mr. Feng Guanyu
as your legal husband?

36
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,800
For richer for poorer,

37
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,440
in sickness and in health,

38
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,910
you'll always be with him

39
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,910
until death do you apart.

40
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,910
I do.

41
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,960
Miss Feng,

42
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,520
do you want to

43
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,470
fight with me

44
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,080
out of the encirclement?

45
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,270
I do.

46
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,520
So do I.

47
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,910
Take the body away.

48
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,270
After the wedding,

49
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,640
return it to Feng Guanyu.

50
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,320
There is a towel over there.
Go fetch it for me.

51
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,550
OK, you're the young master.

52
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,880
(Feng Guanyu is such a fool.)

53
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,790
(I must step out at this moment.)

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,510
Weijie.

55
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,160
Huang Weijie. Weijie.

56
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,350
Remember to get me the cure
before 12 o'clock.

57
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,880
Li Taotao has it.

58
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,440
Faked death drug?

59
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:23,060
(Take the body back to
the Li family's place before 12 o'clock)

60
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,160
Hurry.

61
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:26,950
The cure.

62
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,440
If you don't wake up, I...

63
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,230
Feng Guanyu, come on.

64
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,040
Take it.

65
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,070
Matsuyama, you're doomed today.

66
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,200
Hurry!

67
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:09,760
Go.

68
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,880
Feng Guanyu, Feng Guanyu.

69
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,880
I'm sorry.
I couldn't keep my promise back then.

70
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,640
You're injured now. Knock it off.

71
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,110
Then promise me.

72
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,830
- In the future...
- I promise.

73
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,600
I'll promise everything.

74
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,550
Alright. Stop talking.

75
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,200
Go.

76
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,830
We have a deal.

77
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,550
Quiet.

78
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,040
Let me have a quiet moment.

79
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,760
Don't sleep. Hang in there.

80
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,950
Feng Guanyu, wake up.

81
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,600
Feng Guanyu! Feng Guanyu!

82
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,670
Wake up!

83
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,670
Who?

84
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,670
How dare you snore sleeping in my room?

85
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,350
You're awake.

86
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,200
I've spent a day guarding here.

87
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,880
- I was worried about you.
- You...

88
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,230
Thank you.

89
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,520
What?

90
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,320
I said thank you.

91
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,960
What's wrong with you?

92
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,280
Huang Weijie.

93
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,880
There you go.

94
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,400
Go get changed.

95
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,230
Why? I won't do it.

96
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,520
Cut the crap. Just get changed.

97
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,710
We agreed I'd be the young master
and you'd be the bodyguard.

98
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,080
If you hadn't faked death,

99
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,520
I would have never agreed.

100
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,840
You... Wake up.

101
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,400
Wake up. Make it clear.

102
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,350
Huang Weijie, wake up.

103
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,030
- What are you doing?
- Say it. Who'll be the boss?

104
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:01,458
Feng Guanyu.

105
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,520
What's wrong?
Why all the mystery?

106
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
May I join you?

107
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,840
I'll dedicate myself

108
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,080
to the Anti-traitor Corps.

109
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,790
Of course.

110
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,280
Whoever you are,

111
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,520
as long as you're willing to remove traitors
and fight for the country,

112
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,710
you can join us then.

113
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,840
I, Li Taotao,

114
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,000
(swear to remove the traitors and villains,
fight for the country,)

115
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,320
(and revive the nation.)

116
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,440
(I, Feng Guanyu,)

117
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,110
(swear to remove the traitors and villains,
fight for the country,)

118
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,350
(expel all the intruders,)

119
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,790
(and revive the nation.)

120
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,230
(I, Huang Weijie,)

121
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,000
swear the same.

122
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,140
