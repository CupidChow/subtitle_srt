00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,700
=Episode 6=

3
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,510
Lu Jinzhong told you to leave,
so you just left.

4
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,550
Mr. Feng, we weren't expecting you.

5
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,760
Weijie, what did I tell you?

6
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,590
My minor injury is not a big deal.

7
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,910
Since Mr. Feng has personally come here,
why don't you go back with him?

8
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,550
Come back with me.

9
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,360
I'm not going back. Just spare me.

10
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,400
I want to live another day or two.

11
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,160
Mr. Feng! Mr. Feng!

12
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,120
He is just worried about me.

13
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,360
It's not that he doesn't want to go back.

14
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,080
Weijie.

15
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,830
(Grocery Store)

16
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,630
(Calm down.)

17
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,040
(He is easily manipulated
because of his dumb brain.)

18
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,000
(I need to keep him by my side.)

19
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,720
(Otherwise, he will be in danger
no matter where he goes.)

20
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,110
Weijie, have you forgotten your identity
as part of the Anti-traitor Corps?

21
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,160
Have you forgotten your grand ideal?

22
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,600
We must find that batch of opium.

23
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,960
We cannot let it harm the people.

24
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,670
(He is right.)

25
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,600
(Feng Guanyu really treats me
as a friend.)

26
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,390
(Do I have to lie to him again?)

27
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,320
(What do I do if he really
smuggles opium?)

28
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,080
Mr. Feng.

29
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:46,600
Weijie.

30
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,750
Weijie, say something.

31
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,720
Why are you here again?

32
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,190
I think you might have misunderstood me.

33
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,750
I promise that as long as you come back,

34
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,240
I will never hurt you.

35
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,520
No, wait. Be your normal self.

36
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,000
Go back at once.

37
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,910
Although you're normal now,
I'm keeping my word.

38
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,320
I'm not going back
even if you beat me to death.

39
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,670
Fine. Here, take a look at this.

40
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,390
You signed your name on this contract.

41
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,670
If you don't go back,
you'll have to pay indemnity.

42
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,550
Fine. How much do I have to pay? I'll pay.

43
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,600
100,000 silver yuan.

44
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,550
100,000 silver yuan?

45
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,270
Weijie, we still haven't paid
this month's rent

46
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,000
for the store.

47
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,910
You can't be reckless now.

48
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,110
Have you forgotten what you said before?

49
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,440
Have you forgotten our goal?

50
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,190
Be good and go back with Mr. Feng.
That's a good boy.

51
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,630
Don't delay his work.

52
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,830
Fine. I can go back.

53
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,800
But first, you'll have to agree
to a few conditions.

54
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,440
Out with it.

55
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,480
First, I want to be the boss.

56
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,440
Everyone will have to listen to me,

57
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,200
including Lu Jinzhong.

58
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,040
You...

59
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,760
Agreed.

60
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,880
Okay. I'll wake up
when I get up during the day.

61
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,480
I can't stay up late at night.

62
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,830
I must have five days of rest a week.

63
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,880
I also want a raise in salary.

64
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,230
Agreed, as long as you come back with me.

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,390
That's... Did you see that?

66
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,230
He agreed to everything
without a bottom line.

67
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,320
He is obviously getting me into trouble.

68
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,920
Huang Weijie, there's a limit to my patience.

69
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,760
What? Can't keep pretending?

70
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,000
Fine. I'm giving you one last chance.

71
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,230
Before 12 o'clock today,

72
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,920
if I don't see you at the Feng family house,

73
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,670
you'll bear the consequences.

74
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,230
Do you think I'm scared?

75
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,640
Mr. Feng, Mr. Feng!

76
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,320
(Why did he write these down?)

77
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,640
(Could he really be a spy?)

78
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,390
Forget it. Don't feel mentally stressed.

79
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,040
The Anti-traitor Corps
is a voluntary organization.

80
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,070
There are other patriotic youths

81
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,790
who are willing to walk
into the lion's den.

82
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,720
If we find out Feng Guanyu is a traitor,

83
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,440
- we will just...
- Wait.

84
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,260
(Letter of Apology)

85
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,670
(Is he really approaching me
for a purpose?)

86
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,230
(But I asked him myself.)

87
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,300
Young Master, when would you like
to schedule the blind date

88
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,341
with Deputy Mayor Li's daughter?

89
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,350
Not interested.

90
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,550
Even if you're not interested,
you should meet her at least once.

91
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,070
We're up against the Japanese.

92
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,390
It's better to have a backer.

93
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,390
Would I be afraid of the Japanese?

94
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,950
Yes, yes. Our young master is fearless.

95
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,720
But you still have to consider
the chamber of commerce

96
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,830
and the family business
that the master has built.

97
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,160
You schedule it.

98
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,160
Is there anything else?

99
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,640
Someone wants to see you.

100
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,040
H-Huang Weijie.

101
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,790
(Why is he back so suddenly?)

102
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,550
(What is he up to this time?)

103
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,110
Here. Let's have a toast.

104
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,640
What are you doing here?

105
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,640
Then, this toast is for you.

106
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,550
(So spicy.)

107
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,230
Well, the night sky
is so beautiful tonight.

108
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,840
Well, it's fine. Just do what you want.

109
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,080
Well, did you lose weight?

110
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,400
Your clothes seem big on you.

111
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,550
I'm telling you.
You're a really short-tempered person.

112
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,790
You need to change that.

113
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,080
Being short-tempered weakens your health.

114
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,280
What do you really want to say?

115
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,350
I was just on my way to... Don't go!

116
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,460
I'm fine. This little bit of wine

117
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,760
is nothing to me.

118
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,710
You can see yourself out.

119
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,470
