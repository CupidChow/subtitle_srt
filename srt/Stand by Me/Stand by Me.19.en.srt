00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,700
=Episode 19=

3
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,000
What's your plan next?

4
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,630
To kill Matsuyama.

5
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,510
Matsuyama hunkers down now.

6
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,680
It's on full alert outside.

7
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,950
We can hardly stand a chance
if we go in directly.

8
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,590
Guanyu, what's your plan?

9
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,590
Miss Li,

10
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,080
will you marry me?

11
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:59,270
Feng Guanyu,
how can you talk about this now?

12
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,110
(Matsuyama)

13
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,910
I'll marry Miss Li right away.

14
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,320
I hope you can do me the honor

15
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,030
of attending my wedding.

16
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,190
You killed Lu Jinzhong?

17
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,630
Yes.

18
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,670
How could I live up to

19
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,670
my deceased buddies if I didn't kill him?

20
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,880
How can I

21
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,600
make others stay loyal to me?

22
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,520
And how can I

23
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,160
work for you well?

24
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,220
It's worthwhile to pay a little price

25
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:55,270
for gaining your loyalty.

26
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,960
I'd love to attend

27
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,520
your wedding with Miss Li.

28
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,360
But I still want one thing from you.

29
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,670
His life.

30
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,160
Mr. Feng, I'd like to see,

31
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,800
friendship and interest,

32
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,270
how will you choose?

33
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,360
Will you follow your family ethos

34
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,550
and make a right choice?

35
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,030
I'll give you half an hour to say goodbye.

36
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,630
Half an hour later,

37
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,470
I hope you'll get out alive.

38
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,080
If not,

39
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,800
I'll have to

40
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,360
- kill you two myself.
- You...

41
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,600
It won't hurt at all.

42
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,720
Matsuyama is such a pervert.

43
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,480
I didn't expect him

44
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,440
to play this trick.

45
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,880
Save it.

46
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,040
Matsuyama is clearly trying to test you.

47
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,480
We can't escape.

48
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,040
Huang Weijie,

49
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,070
I thought you never admitted defeat.

50
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,510
Why do you look so down?

51
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,040
Or else?

52
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,070
I'll never quit and wait for death.

53
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,160
I'll never let him hurt you a bit.

54
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,550
Since when did you become so irritable?

55
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,000
Sit down and calm down.

56
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,350
Matsuyama let me go

57
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,550
because he wanted the Li family's power.

58
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,320
So, it doesn't matter who Li Taotao marries.

59
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,510
What's important is

60
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
that Matsuyama must attend the wedding

61
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,670
so that our plan can work.

62
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,200
So,

63
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,790
you'll be the groom.

64
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,720
You...

65
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,830
Why are you so garrulous?

66
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,670
Calm down.

67
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,550
I'm not thirsty.

68
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,600
You're thirsty.

69
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,040
This is serious.
Stop messing around.

70
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,230
Feng Guanyu.

71
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,350
Drink it or leave it. It's all over me.

72
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,510
Sounds like you're so clean now.

73
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,440
You used to dry your hand

74
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,040
with your clothes before.

75
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,230
I simply want to enjoy the feeling
of being a young master.

76
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,110
There's a towel.

77
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,000
Go fetch it for me.

78
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,350
OK.

79
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,000
You're the boss.

80
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,040
Take it.

81
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,040
Wipe it for me.

82
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,790
OK.

83
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,040
Is it enough?

84
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,390
If I'm the boss next life,

85
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,480
you'll be my bodyguard.

86
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,640
OK.

87
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,670
Next life, you'll be the boss

88
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,440
and I'll be the bodyguard.

89
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,040
Weijie, can you listen to me once?

90
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,270
Just for once.

91
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,400
OK?

92
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:39,710
Sure.

93
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,840
Huang Weijie, don't, Huang Weijie.

94
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,280
You fool, why didn't you listen to me?

95
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,280
I've gotten smarter.

96
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,200
Huang Weijie,

97
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,760
why didn't you listen to me?

98
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,150
Enough.

99
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,200
No one will fight you anymore.

100
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,280
Weijie.

101
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,670
Mr. Feng.

102
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,030
The answer will be revealed soon.

103
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,590
Don't let me down.

104
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,760
I can't see the sakura in my hometown.

105
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,640
Only your performance

106
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,670
can comfort me.

107
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,670
Mr. Feng,

108
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,550
you don't let me down indeed.

109
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,790
You've already got

110
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,230
what you want.

111
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,550
Can I take his body away?

112
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,670
Sure, but not now.

113
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,880
The Chinese follow certain rituals.

114
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,910
You may hold the funeral

115
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,110
after the wedding.

116
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,230
Take it.
This is my token of kindness.

117
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,520
An half for the wedding

118
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,910
and the other half for the funeral.

119
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,520
