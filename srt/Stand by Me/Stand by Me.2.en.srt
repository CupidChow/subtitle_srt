=Episode 2=

3
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,000
Young Master.

4
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,160
How many shady businesses

5
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,230
is the Feng family involved in

6
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,000
to be able to afford such a nice place?

7
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,510
But this place seems
to have bad feng shui.

8
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,800
You'd better get a master to take a look.

9
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,310
Oh, that's right.
With the living King of Hell here,

10
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,120
ghosts will run away after seeing you.

11
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,550
Another word of nonsense
and I'll send you to the Japanese.

12
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,760
- Let go.
- Let's see how you'll last.

13
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,760
Or perhaps,
I'll send your friend along too.

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,080
Feng Guanyu, what do you really want?

15
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,800
You'll know in a while. Move.

16
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,270
What are you doing?

17
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,550
I'm telling you,
don't kill me to shut me up.

18
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,320
From today onward,

19
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,320
you'll stay by my side as a bodyguard.

20
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,440
Remember to abide by the rules
while in the Feng family.

21
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,800
As long as you don't make trouble,

22
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,240
I can guarantee that no one
would dare touch you.

23
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,320
What did you say?

24
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,030
Have you teased enough?

25
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,880
Who is teasing you?

26
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,720
Ten years ago,
you also said the same words.

27
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,030
In the end, I almost got beaten to death
by ten Japanese ronin.

28
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,080
How dare you give me your guarantee now?

29
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,910
It happened for a reason back then.

30
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,630
It's not that I didn't care about you.

31
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,190
No need to explain.
It's useless to say anything now.

32
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,000
Was it delicious?

33
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,830
Not bad.

34
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,830
From now on,
as long as I have a bite to eat,

35
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,630
you will never go hungry.

36
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:10,240
Feng Guanyu, don't bribe me
with these tiny favors.

37
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,830
I, Huang Weijie,

38
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,670
have never been corrupted
by wealth and honor,

39
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,720
and undeterred by power.

40
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,200
Be your bodyguard?

41
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,830
Rather than being your bodyguard,

42
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,270
I might as well be your young master.

43
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,760
This bed is so soft.

44
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,790
I almost can't get used to it.

45
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,440
That's perfect. This is my bed.

46
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,670
Where do I sleep?

47
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,550
(He said he'll give me a good life.)

48
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,320
(Instead, he's locking me
in a small, black room.)

49
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,550
(What a liar.)

50
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,830
(I can endure this to find the opium.)

51
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,160
What a coincidence.

52
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,720
What's this? Trying to escape?

53
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,830
There's something spooky in your house.

54
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:59,160
Really? Where?

55
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,920
What are you doing out here
with a gun so late at night? Seriously.

56
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,270
Take a guess.

57
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,920
It's late.
You should hurry and go to bed.

58
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,760
You should go to bed too.

59
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,550
I am...

60
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,880
I can't fall asleep so easily
in a new place.

61
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,830
Need some help?

62
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,000
No need.
Just gazing at the moon will do the trick.

63
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,550
Can't sleep, huh?

64
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,270
Then you should do more exercises.

65
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,350
Get up tomorrow morning
and join the others for morning practice.

66
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,350
I'm not going. Are you really
taking me for your bodyguard?

67
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,790
No one can refuse my good intention.

68
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,350
No problem. See you tomorrow morning.

69
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,550
He haunts me everywhere I go.

70
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,550
It won't be that easy to escape.

71
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,480
Five. Six.

72
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,600
Have you found the remaining opium?

73
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,510
Seven.

74
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,110
Not yet.

75
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,040
Do properly.

76
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,040
Hurry up and find it.
Don't let the opium flow into the market.

77
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,390
Feng family will never do anything
that brings harm to the people.

78
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,000
Young Master, Ma Wancai is not a big deal.

79
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,920
It's fine if he's killed.

80
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,480
Making enemies with the Japanese,

81
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,480
- Again.
- might be unfavorable for us.

82
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,390
One.

83
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,160
What's this?

84
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:34,760
Two.

85
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,880
Have your knees started to shake?

86
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,600
Four. Five.

87
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,600
I'm only thinking
for the sake of the Feng family.

88
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,950
The Japanese are powerful.

89
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,270
We must protect ourselves.

90
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,600
I don't want to hear
words like that from you again.

91
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,040
Nine. Ten.

92
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,950
One. Two.

93
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,510
Why is that kid here?

94
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:53,920
Again.

95
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,200
Let him practice.

96
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,070
Five.

97
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,510
Young Master, not just anyone

98
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,550
can be your bodyguard.

99
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,950
I've always handpicked your bodyguards.

100
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,320
This is against the rules.

101
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Rules are dead. Aren't you alive?

102
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,760
Your legs must be steady. Again.

103
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,600
Yes, I understand.

104
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,880
One. Two.

105
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,270
You there. What are you doing?

106
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,040
As a bodyguard of the Feng family,
you must fend off many enemies alone,

107
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,040
must have excellent marksmanship,

108
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,600
and swiftly knock your enemy down

109
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,160
to protect the young master's safety.

110
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,160
You must never hesitate or show mercy.

111
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,510
Most importantly,

112
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,200
Feng family never keeps useless people.

113
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,080
I am a useless person.

114
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,550
Then, you can choose death.

115
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,350
Or useful.

116
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,960
Good. You can go first.

117
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,440
Hey, if I miss,

118
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,520
he won't beat me to death, right?

119
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,960
You can try.

120
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,350
Aim at the bull's eye.

121
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,350
Lower the muzzle when you shoot.

122
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,520
See, I told you I can't do it.

123
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,470
You still have a bullet left.

124
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,590
Come with me.

125
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:30,590
Yes, sir.

126
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:32,840
You...

127
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,046
