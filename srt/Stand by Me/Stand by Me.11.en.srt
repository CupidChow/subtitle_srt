2
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,740
=Episode 11=

3
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,270
You're still awake.

4
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,550
Where did you go?

5
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,830
To take something back.

6
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,270
Did you get it?

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,310
I'll go to bed if nothing else.

8
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,510
No, no, sit down.

9
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,550
Let's get a drink.

10
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,240
Here.

11
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,470
I'll drink myself then.

12
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,110
I lied.

13
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,320
Like what?

14
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,830
Like I've concealed my identity.

15
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,440
Aren't you my bodyguard?

16
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,240
I'm also one of Anti-traitor Corps.

17
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,360
It's my task to kill Mr. Ma.

18
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,080
Coming back to the Feng family too.

19
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,830
Staying by your side too.

20
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,670
And this time, I'm back

21
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,470
also to confirm

22
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,190
whether you're a traitor
smuggling opium with the Japanese.

23
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,670
What's your finding?

24
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,110
You're a good man.

25
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,320
That's what I always believe too.

26
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,190
You're done?

27
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,520
Aren't... Aren't you mad?

28
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,880
You may lash out at me,

29
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,030
or just whip me.

30
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,830
Fine, I'm mad now.

31
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,000
Stay here

32
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,110
for some introspection.

33
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,630
Hurry. Excuse me. Excuse me.

34
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,750
Excuse me.

35
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,950
Mr. Feng.

36
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,760
You have all the journalists in Shanghai here.

37
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,230
What are you gonna announce?

38
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:37,830
Recently, a batch of smuggled opium
has been intercepted at the Feng's wharf.

39
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,270
I don't think any conscientious Chinese man

40
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,480
would let this batch of opium poison his people.

41
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,000
So, I decided

42
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,760
to destroy this batch of opium.

43
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,510
Great! Great!

44
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,550
Awesome! Well said.

45
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,320
Bravo!

46
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,270
- Bravo!
- Well said.

47
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,110
Feng Guanyu!

48
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,390
What's the matter? Just say it.

49
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,950
I understand how you feel.

50
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,000
Are you mad about being suspected
by Anti-traitor Corps?

51
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,270
Your task here has been done.

52
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,760
Why still follow me?

53
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,440
Can you not split hairs?

54
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,000
I've come clean with you.

55
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,480
Feng Guanyu.

56
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,200
Turns out you're Feng Guanyu.

57
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,920
Miss Li, about that day...

58
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,110
It's OK. I'm a forgiving person.

59
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,230
But you, the fake one, are quite interesting.

60
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,000
You've also joined Anti-traitor Corps, huh?

61
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,110
Here's a secret.

62
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,390
I'm one of you too.

63
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,390
Really? What's your code?

64
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,880
The code assigned to me doesn't
sound nice. I didn't take it.

65
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,760
Miss Li, bye.

66
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,670
What's your name?

67
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,880
Starry Boy.

68
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,000
Starry...

69
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,480
Take this.

70
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,040
Feng Guanyu! Wait for me!

71
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,510
Starry Boy.

72
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,260
(Matsuyama)

73
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,550
Where's Mr. Matsuyama?

74
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,320
You destroyed the opium openly.

75
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,950
Mr. Matsuyama thinks

76
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,950
you don't actually want to cooperate.

77
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I wonder whether this is

78
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,510
satisfactory enough for Mr. Matsuyama.

79
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,040
I destroyed the opium

80
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,390
because I was targeted by Anti-traitor Corps.

81
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,950
If I didn't do it,

82
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,950
even if Mr. Matsuyama wanted to work with me,

83
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,720
there would be a lot of trouble.

84
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,920
So, please tell Mr. Matsuyama

85
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,200
this is still the Chinese territory.

86
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,000
There's something you can't do

87
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,480
or have problems doing,

88
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,040
so you turn to people like Ma Wancai.

89
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,440
But now, the Ma's Chamber of Commerce is gone.

90
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,230
You knew Ma Wancai
worked for Mr. Matsuyama

91
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,440
and still killed him.

92
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,230
How can Mr. Matsuyama

93
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,070
trust you and work with you?

94
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,600
I killed him because he smuggled opium

95
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,320
through my wharf without my permission.

96
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,320
I killed him for the sake of the Feng family.

97
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,790
Now, I'm here to meet Mr. Matsuyama

98
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,320
for interest.

99
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,390
Everybody knows that opium is
the most profitable business.

100
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,110
Who doesn't want to make money?

101
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,600
Mr. Matsuyama is right about you.

102
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,480
The Chinese people only care about interest.

103
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,600
For our mutual interest,

104
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,320
I hope Mr. Matsuyama can think about it

105
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,600
and give me a reply.

106
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:28,480
Mr. Matsuyama.

107
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,480
I heard him.

108
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,000
So, what's your decision?

109
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,400
There's an old Chinese saying.

110
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,910
All's fair in war.

111
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,350
Since Feng Guanyu has shown his sincerity,

112
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,320
we may as well see

113
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,790
if he works better than Ma Wancai that idiot.

114
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,520
A batch of opium is arriving in a few days.

115
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,670
If Feng Guanyu does a good job,

116
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,080
I'll meet him then.

117
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:01,670
If he plays any trick...

118
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,880
Yes, sir. What about Li Yaoming?

119
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,470
That fool.

120
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,110
I wanted him to help find the goods
through Anti-traitor Corps.

121
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,840
But he turned Feng Guanyu into a hero instead.

122
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,760
What a foolish traitor! Kill him!

123
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,760
Yes.
