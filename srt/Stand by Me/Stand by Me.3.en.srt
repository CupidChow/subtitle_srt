00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,740
=Stand By Me=

2
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,740
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,830
Huang Weijie, come over here.

4
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:36,230
This...

5
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,760
Is my marksmanship this accurate?

6
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,160
No way, it's impossible. This...

7
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,400
This is absolutely impossible.

8
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,860
(Ma Dachuan)

9
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,270
It's in Japanese.

10
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,520
What's written in here is

11
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,190
where Ma Wancai will meet the Japanese.

12
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,320
He was a spy, Young Master.

13
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,670
You did well.

14
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,100
(Huang Weijie)

15
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,030
(Be Careful)
Be careful?

16
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,750
Be careful of what?
Is there danger here?

17
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,960
What are you doing? Get over here.

18
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,270
Huang Weijie, get ready for a photo.

19
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,880
How did I somehow end up
as a bodyguard for the Feng family?

20
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,960
They said the one I shot dead
was the Japanese's spy.

21
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,630
Which side is Feng Guanyu on?

22
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,470
Where is he hiding the opium?

23
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,000
I need to find a way
to check out his warehouse.

24
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,630
So, Xiaoqiang has defected long ago

25
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,030
to work for President Ma.

26
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,520
This is my responsibility.

27
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,670
This will never happen again.

28
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,080
I don't want to hear that.

29
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,910
I only want the rest of the opium.

30
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,800
The address where Ma Wancai

31
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,550
will hand over the opium
to the Japanese is clearly written here.

32
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,360
Then, hurry up and get to work.

33
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,720
With Xiaoqiang dead,
there isn't a contact person.

34
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,760
The Japanese will certainly
be cautious of us.

35
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,510
If they attack...

36
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,880
Find someone unfamiliar

37
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,350
to lure them out.

38
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,070
Someone unfamiliar?

39
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,600
Feng Guanyu.

40
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,790
I think I'm having a fever.

41
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,510
I need to go to the hospital.

42
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,670
Do you think I can...

43
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,320
You can't.

44
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,350
Someone unfamiliar!

45
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,110
Young Master, get Huang Weijie to go.

46
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,760
What are you talking about?

47
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,830
There's a mission. Go and get ready.

48
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,510
No problem. I promise
I'll complete the mission.

49
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,550
You can't go.

50
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,480
Why can't I go?

51
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,480
Weren't you about to die from illness?

52
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,510
Yes, but once I hear
there's a mission to complete

53
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,270
and to complete it for you,

54
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
I got better.

55
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,000
Hurry up, let's go.

56
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,510
- Don't waste time. Hurry.
- Young Master.

57
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,600
Come on, come on.

58
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,600
A handsome guy.

59
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,350
He really is.

60
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,040
Look.

61
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,230
He is so hot.

62
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:33,760
He's handsome.

63
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,510
No, wait. Who are you?
What are you doing? Get out now.

64
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,000
Stop looking. Come on.

65
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,950
I have a question.
Where did you hide the opium?

66
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,440
What nonsense are you talking about?

67
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,720
Get out. Get out now.

68
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,720
Come on, let's continue.

69
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Stop looking. Come on, let's continue.

70
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,600
They told me to be the contact person.

71
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,040
There is no Japanese people here.

72
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,760
Why did you come in?

73
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,920
I'm worried.

74
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,350
This trivial task
is a piece of cake for me.

75
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,320
I'm worried
you can't complete the mission.

76
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,060
There's a saying that goes

77
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,480
"don't suspect the employed,
don't employ the suspected." Get it?

78
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,510
How would anyone work for you like this?

79
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,510
How could they improve?

80
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,550
None of my subordinates

81
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,880
are as brainless as you

82
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,230
who ran out before
fully understanding his duty.

83
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,640
I just want to contribute, alright?

84
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,720
No more nonsense. Get back to work.

85
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,790
If you're worried, do it yourself.

86
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,550
Fine, I'll go.

87
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,720
I'll protect you.

88
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,230
Okay.

89
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,160
What exactly do you want?

90
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,110
Where exactly did you hide the opium?

91
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,230
No, wait. I really don't know.

92
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,270
Don't play dumb and tell the truth now.

93
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,510
Otherwise, when my boss comes, you'll...

94
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,230
Boss...

95
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,200
How do you appear out of nowhere?

96
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,500
Whoever carries out a task like you do?

97
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,110
Then you can tell me how to do it.

98
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:48,270
No, wait. We really don't have the opium.

99
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,230
Tell the truth.

100
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,670
I remember there's a basement.

101
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,950
There's a basement towards the end.

102
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,550
See that?
This is the efficiency you should have.

103
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:01,950
Let's go.

104
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,480
You all continue. Continue.

105
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,510
Miss Long San, Feng Guanyu
and his men fell into the trap.

106
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:16,070
Everyone knows Ma Wancai traded
on behalf of the Empire of Japan.

107
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,510
The fact that they dared to kill him

108
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,600
means they want to make enemies out of us.

109
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,790
Do you mean to make an example out of him?

110
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,920
We must let the Chinese people here know

111
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,670
who is the true master of this city.

112
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,080
Yes.

113
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,470
Open it.

114
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,640
(Be Careful)
We wasted so much time just for this?

115
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,280
Oh no, we fell into a trap.

116
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,400
