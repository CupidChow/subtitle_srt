=Episode 1=

3
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,460
(Broadway Dance)

4
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,490
Young Master,

5
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,270
I fear tonight is a Hongmen Banquet.

6
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,910
[*Hongmen Banquet: a banquet
arranged for an assassination]

7
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:49,720
You're afraid?

8
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,760
We've confiscated their opium.

9
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,800
What if they play dirty?

10
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,000
Do you think I'm afraid?

11
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,190
No. In Shanghai of today,

12
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,800
who would dare disrespect the Feng family

13
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,510
and disrespect you, the young master?

14
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,720
There's one in here.

15
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,190
This is negligence on my part.

16
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,480
On my life, I guarantee that you will not

17
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,760
be injured in the slightest today.

18
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,360
Move out.

19
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,520
Waiter, bring me a bottle of wine.

20
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,600
Yes, sir.

21
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,830
Welcome, President Feng.

22
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,030
You honor my nightclub with your presence.

23
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,750
About my goods,

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,080
when will Young Master Feng
return them to me?

25
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,600
What goods?

26
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,320
My new shipment of Japanese sake.

27
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,520
Are you sure there are only sake in there?

28
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,520
Sooner or later,
Shanghai will fall into Japanese hands.

29
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,390
Doing more trades now

30
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,030
only ensures a way out for myself later.

31
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,750
As long as you return the opium to me,

32
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,720
you can have a share in this business too.

33
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,630
Feng Guanyu, what are you really planning?

34
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,880
Money is for me to profit.

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,190
It's none of your business.

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,880
What do you mean?

37
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,750
You used my port
to transport Japanese opium.

38
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,110
If the Anti-traitor Corps
finds out about this,

39
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,600
I will be killed for being a traitor.

40
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,830
You just want to do this the hard way.

41
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,000
That should be my line.

42
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,600
I've been searching for you
all these years.

43
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,440
You still remember me?

44
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,950
I thought you were long dead.

45
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,600
Who sent you here?

46
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,920
Why does that matter to you?

47
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,670
Are you going to shoot me?

48
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,270
Don't think I can't do it.

49
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,070
Go ahead.

50
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,270
Young Master, where is that waiter?

51
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,390
He escaped through the window. Find him.

52
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,140
(Grocery Store)

53
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:11,820
(After being in disguise)

54
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,270
(Huang Weijie)
(at the grocery store for so long,)

55
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,550
(I finally got the chance
to kill a traitor.)

56
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,760
(Why did I bump into him?)

57
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,510
(Feng Guanyu killed Ma Wancai.)

58
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,920
(Is he also connected to the Japanese?)

59
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,440
Yaoming, you're finally back.

60
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,070
How come it's you?

61
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,270
Am I not welcomed?

62
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,950
You barge into our store
so early in the morning.

63
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,790
What exactly do you want?

64
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,350
You still haven't told me

65
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,160
the reason you were at 808.

66
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,200
What's it to you?

67
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,350
This is the kindness
I have for an old friend.

68
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,320
Ma Wancai thrashed my buddy's store

69
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,860
and even beat him up.

70
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,640
I wanted to avenge him.

71
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,790
With the skills you have?

72
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,760
I suggest you'd better stop
acting like a hero.

73
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,390
That's still better than
you betraying your buddy.

74
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,270
Come back with me.

75
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,040
Back where?

76
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:23,670
My home.

77
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,350
Sure.

78
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,040
Huang Weijie!

79
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,110
Catch him!

80
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,790
Over there. Get him! Get him!

81
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,670
Stop right there!

82
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,000
Stop running.

83
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,830
Excuse me, please drop me off
at the junction up ahead.

84
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,790
You can't just get on and off
my car as you wish.

85
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,760
How did I end up in your car?

86
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:52,920
Why did you run?

87
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,230
I want to look for my buddy.

88
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,160
I have him.

89
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,790
I helped you save him.

90
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,640
How will you thank me?

91
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,830
Let my buddy go first.

92
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,510
Let him go? Sure.

93
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,000
But you'll have to agree to my condition.

94
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,160
What condition?

95
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,040
Your life, in exchange for his.

96
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,720
(Could he have discovered our identities?)

97
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,070
How about this? Let's play a game.

98
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,600
Let's see who gets more points.

99
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,390
If I win, you let him go.

100
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,440
If I lose,
I'll lay down my life here today.

101
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,720
Fine.

102
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,480
Come on.

103
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,950
Too bad for you, I won. Let him go.

104
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,390
What are you doing?

105
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,550
You tried to trick me?

106
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,520
Your life is mine now.

107
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,710
I'll give you one last minute
to say your goodbyes.

108
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,470
Whatever it is, we completed
the mission to kill Ma Wancai.

109
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,400
It's Feng Guanyu who killed him.

110
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,320
I think the opium is in his hands too.

111
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,790
Why does he want to catch you?

112
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,880
Our identities
haven't been discovered, right?

113
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,200
I don't think so.

114
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,670
Then, you'll go back with him
and find that batch of opium.

115
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,520
But he...

116
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,150
One minute is up. The young master will
get angry if you don't get in the car.

117
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,910
So what if he gets angry?
I'm not done talking.

118
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:29,840
Move.

119
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,350
Let me go. Let me go!

120
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,400
Feng Guanyu, you jerk.

121
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:38,960
Behave.

122
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:40,840
Let me go.

123
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,280
Move.

124
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,710
