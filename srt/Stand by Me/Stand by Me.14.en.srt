00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,740
=Episode 14=

3
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,800
Weijie, don't blame me.

4
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,360
You should blame your innocence.

5
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,000
Justice and heroics are crap.

6
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,440
Whoever pays most is the boss.

7
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,680
I've got to look out for myself.
Money is what really matters.

8
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,760
A friend is the least one
you should trust in the world.

9
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,440
Are you looking for this?

10
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,380
(Mr. Matsuyama)

11
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,520
Stay back.

12
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,360
Just stay away.

13
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,520
Weijie trusts you so much.

14
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,550
But you're actually using him.

15
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,190
He's too stupid. Just as stupid as you.

16
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,960
No idea what's
the right thing to do.

17
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,600
You're the one who doesn't get this saying.

18
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,320
Feng Guanyu, here are two options for you.

19
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,190
Let me go, or...

20
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,550
Or I'll kill him.

21
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,550
Do you think you can get out of here alive

22
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,030
if you kill him?

23
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,360
As long as you let me go,

24
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,520
I'll tell you all you wanna know.

25
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,520
Stay back. Stay back.

26
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,390
Don't... Don't come near me.

27
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,110
Yaoming.

28
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,550
Yaoming! Yaoming!

29
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,800
Yaoming! Yaoming!

30
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,600
Weijie.

31
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,550
Feng Guanyu.

32
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,830
Weijie, listen to me.

33
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,520
Li Yaoming...

34
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,000
He's my best buddy.

35
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,440
Why did you kill him?

36
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,360
Why? Why did you kill him?

37
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,440
That letter was written by
Yaoming to Matsuyama.

38
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,200
He has been using you.

39
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,200
I'll kill you.

40
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,830
Don't make me hurt you.

41
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,350
You've already hurt me a lot.

42
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,510
Calm down. Listen to me.

43
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,480
Li Yaoming has long colluded with Matsuyama

44
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,640
and betrayed you.

45
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,200
He's already dead.
You can totally scapegoat him.

46
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,510
It was so foolish of me to trust you!

47
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,510
You're foolish indeed.

48
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,350
Now you still think he's a friend.

49
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,790
Malarkey!

50
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,440
Let me go!

51
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Let go! Let go!

52
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,760
Don't move!

53
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,070
Sir.

54
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,230
Watch him and don't let him

55
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,670
out of this room before I'm back.

56
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,550
Young Master, where are you going?

57
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,200
I'll meet Long San
and figure out this thing.

58
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,510
Yes.

59
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,830
Let's deal with the body.

60
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,600
We can't just leave it here.

61
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,000
We still have to watch Huang Weijie.

62
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,670
Hello?

63
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,640
Huang Weijie?

64
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:10,550
It's OK. He's tied up.
He can't escape, right?

65
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,670
(Oh no, Feng Guanyu killed Li Yaoming.)

66
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,200
(He'll deal with the Japanese too.
He must be a traitor.)

67
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,920
(Miss Li also asked if he needed help.)

68
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,920
(She must be with Feng Guanyu.)

69
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,160
(What should I do?)

70
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,040
(Well, I must go and take a look.)

71
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,480
(I must see Feng Guanyu
deal with the Japanese for myself.)

72
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,840
Young Master.

73
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,110
Are you all set?

74
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,710
Yes, Young Master.

75
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,760
No worries.

76
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,910
Matsuyama will be done if he comes.

77
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,080
President Feng, it's an honor to meet you.

78
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,710
I'm Matsuyama Yamamatsu,

79
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,150
president of Izakaya.

80
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:17,960
What a good name!

81
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,320
Thank you.

82
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,760
You look so sturdy.

83
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,280
So much opium

84
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,550
was brought in through my family's wharf.

85
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,350
Today, I finally met you.

86
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,520
I hope more opium can come into the country

87
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,200
through your family's wharf.

88
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,470
Feng Guanyu!

89
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,440
