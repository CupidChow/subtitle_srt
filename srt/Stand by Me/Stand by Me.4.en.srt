=Episode 4=

3
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,080
Oh no, we fell into a trap.

4
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,510
Why didn't you bring your gun
on a mission?

5
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,120
You made me change my clothes.

6
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,630
Why didn't you pick it up
after you changed?

7
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,760
I never knew it'd be risky.

8
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:45,870
Follow me.

9
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,080
Where is the car?

10
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,550
Their men must have driven it away.

11
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,080
How do we escape without a car?

12
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,360
You cycle.

13
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,110
I'm not cycling.

14
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,520
You're the bodyguard,
I'm the young master.

15
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,440
- Hurry, hurry.
- Go.

16
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,880
My bicycle! My...

17
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,440
Cycle faster.

18
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,000
I can't cycle anymore.

19
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,190
Stop there!

20
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,270
They're catching up.

21
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,160
Just shoot them.

22
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,670
What if pedestrians got hurt?

23
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,080
Stop running.

24
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,830
Hurry, hurry!

25
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,720
Stop there! Get them!

26
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,190
What now?

27
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,340
They're coming from the front too.

28
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:42,440
Stop running.

29
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,470
Get into the alley.

30
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,520
This way.

31
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,080
Do you know how to cycle?

32
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,910
You do it if you can.

33
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,720
Hurry up and go.

34
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,030
Get them. Stop right there.

35
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,030
Stop running.

36
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,800
Jump down.

37
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,520
I'm not jumping.

38
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:19,880
Jump if you don't want to die.

39
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,550
I don't know how to swim.
I'll die if I jump.

40
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,880
I didn't die, how fortunate.

41
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,390
Remember to bring a gun next time.

42
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,080
Or I won't be able to save you.

43
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,520
This is all your fault.

44
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,520
There's a small house up ahead.
We can hide in there.

45
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,470
Okay.

46
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,800
So dirty.

47
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,630
Is this even habitable?

48
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,270
Why don't we find another place?

49
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,520
My dear young master,

50
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,910
my legs are going to break.
You can leave if you want.

51
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,720
Besides, this is much better than
the place I used to live in.

52
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,790
We're running for our lives right now.

53
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,070
It's good enough to have a roof
over our heads. Just deal with it.

54
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,830
Have you suffered a lot over the years?

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,720
What are you doing?

56
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,950
Didn't you complain it's dirty?
I'm cleaning it up for you.

57
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,640
We'll have a serious talk now.

58
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,480
We went to meet them at the church today

59
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
but fell into a trap.

60
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,550
That means the the letter we found
on the traitor you shot dead

61
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,670
was just a bait.

62
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,720
You suspect there's a spy
in the Feng family?

63
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,920
I told Lu Jinzhong to investigate

64
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,350
but found nothing suspicious.

65
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:04,950
That's good.

66
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,230
Let me ask you.
Why do you want that batch of opium?

67
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,600
Why do you ask about this?

68
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,440
I became the contact person
and almost lost my life.

69
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,440
Can't I even ask about it?

70
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,550
I'm warning you.
Don't get involved in this.

71
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,270
Just behave and stay in the Feng family.

72
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,760
I said that as long as I have
a bite to eat, you will never go hungry.

73
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,200
I'm not a beggar.

74
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,390
I have an able body.
Why should I eat at your house?

75
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,040
Did I say you're a beggar?

76
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,390
Isn't that what you mean?

77
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,760
Get up and clean.

78
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:40,950
Get up.

79
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,550
What are you doing?

80
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:54,760
Applying medicine.

81
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,950
Are you sure this isn't poisonous?

82
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:58,920
I'm not sure.

83
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,350
If you didn't die, then it's not poisonous.

84
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:01,920
You...

85
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,550
People like us

86
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,830
aren't as spoiled as you.

87
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,440
After starving and getting
beaten up a few times,

88
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,920
we'll know what's edible

89
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,480
and which are medicines.

90
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,670
What else do you know?

91
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,880
I know a lot.

92
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,000
Like divination, fortune-telling,
everything.

93
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,920
I don't believe in fate.

94
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,830
Let me tell your fortune.

95
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,320
It's an ominous reading.

96
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm used to a life like this.

97
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,390
How could it not be ominous?

98
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,320
Or maybe, I'll die?

99
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,830
This divination says

100
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,270
as long as you stay away from opium,

101
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,880
you'll live to be 1000 years old.

102
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,320
1000 years?

103
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,000
The Japanese have begun to set me up.

104
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,350
I'll have to ask them
if they'll let me live that long.

105
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,640
You hide away again,
just like you did ten years ago.

106
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,640
My father was very strict
with me as a child.

107
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,670
Those days when I left home

108
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,200
and went wild with you

109
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,480
were the happiest and freest

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,230
time of my life.

111
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,720
Back then, we promised

112
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,390
to go kill Japanese ronin.

113
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,640
My father suddenly
sent someone to look for me.

114
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,830
I was forced into a car.

115
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,720
I only realized after I got home

116
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,000
that my father got betrayed
by the person he trusted most.

117
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,070
And my mother was also...

118
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:11,070
After that, we had to hide our identities
to avoid getting killed.

119
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,390
Father even made "be careful"
as the family motto,

120
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,550
so that I will never trust anyone,
especially friends.

121
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,720
(So there was a reason
he broke his promise back then.)

122
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,720
(He was never a coward.)

123
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,390
(I've wrongly blamed him all this time.)

124
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,080
Why are you bringing up this old story?
I've already forgotten about it.

125
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,000
Everyone, get ready.

126
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,400
Move out and find the young master.

127
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,350
Make sure the young master is unharmed.

128
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,200
Yes.

129
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,280
Young Master, you're back.

130
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,790
How did you get injured?

131
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,110
It's nothing.

132
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,230
Huang Weijie, you failed
to protect the young master.

133
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,440
What do you mean?

134
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,960
Didn't you insist on making me go?

135
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,440
You dare talk back?

136
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,230
Go and kneel in front of "Be Careful".

137
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,030
The family rules cannot be broken.

138
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,880
Drag him there.

139
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,670
I...

140
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,550
Feng Guanyu.
What are you doing? Feng Guanyu!

141
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,910
- Young Master, please take a rest.
- Let me go.

142
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,670
Have you found the opium?

143
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,670
There is a small warehouse
next to the church.

144
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,440
That batch of opium were inside.

145
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,910
I've brought them all back.

146
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,230
You can rest easy now, Young Master.

147
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,030
I got it.
Where is that batch of opium right now?

148
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,080
Due to safety reasons,

149
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,350
I stored them inside the old house
outside the city.

150
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,590
That place is near the river bank
and isolated.

151
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,790
(Letter of Apology)
No one would go there.

152
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,320
(Suburbs Old house)

153
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,790
What should we do with the opium next?

154
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,880
Leave it there for now.
I have my own plans.

155
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,670
(River)
Young Master, there is something I must say.

156
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,150
You're spoiling that kid, Huang Weijie.

157
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,670
His mistakes had been
minor and unintentional,

158
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,110
and he is new.

159
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,960
Even if he broke the rules, it shouldn't
result in any serious consequences.

160
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,910
Isn't this serious enough?

161
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,640
When have you ever gotten injured
over these years?

162
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,670
If he makes another mistake,

163
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,350
I will punish him severely.

164
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,960
I finally found a clue.

165
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,670
I just need to make trouble
and get out of here.
