=Episode 8=

3
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:27,544
What are you looking for?

4
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,040
Where are Zhao Qian and Sun Li?

5
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,400
I gave them another task.

6
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,160
Then why did you bring me here?

7
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,310
You even made me dress up.

8
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,310
You'll know in a while.

9
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,480
Have you ever had western food?

10
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,800
There isn't a single one in here.
Who is going to protect you?

11
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,230
I'll teach you.

12
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,040
Feng Guanyu,
what exactly do you want me to do?

13
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,680
Just do as I do.

14
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,360
I was so thirsty.
This drink is quite tasty.

15
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,110
Fork on your left, knife on your right.

16
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,600
She is here.

17
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,900
Your mission today is to go on a date
with Deputy Mayor Li's daughter in my stead.

18
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,470
Keep in mind that you are to fail,
not succeed.

19
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,390
Don't embarrass me.

20
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,260
You're afraid
I would embarrass you, right?

21
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,550
Then I'll make sure
you're thoroughly embarrassed.

22
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,720
You're the president of the Feng family's
chamber of commerce, Feng Guanyu?

23
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:19,470
That's me.

24
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,000
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I hope we'll get along.

25
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,000
We'll get along fine.

26
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,000
I heard the Feng family
is in the shipping business.

27
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,320
Do you deal with Japanese people?

28
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,880
How is that possible?

29
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,160
We're patriotic businessmen.

30
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,160
We don't do business like those sneaks.

31
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,190
Why do you seem different
from the Feng Guanyu I heard about?

32
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,830
I heard the Feng family only
look at the money when doing business.

33
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,520
I never expected you to have such thoughts.

34
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,720
Can you tell me in detail
what's on your mind?

35
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,670
(How long is this going to go on?)

36
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,830
(What if the Anti-traitor Corps
move in for action?)

37
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,360
(No, I need to make her
so angry that she would leave.)

38
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,320
Let's not talk about that now.

39
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,550
I waited for you for a long time.

40
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,600
Shouldn't you drink a glass as penalty?

41
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,920
What? You were late.

42
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,640
You need to show some sincerity, right?

43
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,440
Hasn't your family taught you any manners?

44
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,880
Fine, I was late.

45
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,270
I'll apologize to you.

46
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,550
(She doesn't react even after that.)

47
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,600
What's this?
You're going to drink on your own?

48
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,510
Don't you know
you need to pour me a glass?

49
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,670
How do they even raise you?

50
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,070
Feng Guanyu!

51
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,110
You...

52
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,600
Heard that? That person is Feng Guanyu.

53
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,830
Feng Guanyu, come with us.

54
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,920
I... What's going on?

55
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,390
He is Feng Guanyu.

56
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,440
What is happening here?

57
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,270
Whatever, just take them both away.

58
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,550
Feng Guanyu, come with us.

59
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,480
Who are you people?

60
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,670
I think they're with Long San.

61
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,720
If they are,

62
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,160
we would be dead by now.

63
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,000
That sort of makes sense.
What other enemies have you made?

64
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,950
Maybe they're here for you.

65
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,110
For me?

66
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,000
It doesn't matter who we are.

67
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,790
Hand over the opium and we'll let you go.

68
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,440
Why should I trust you?

69
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,640
I'm warning you. If you don't cooperate,

70
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,760
we will have to punish you.

71
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,670
Punish?

72
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,110
Are you with the police?

73
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,720
If they keep on asking,

74
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,390
our identities will get exposed.

75
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,110
I think the other one

76
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,440
seems brainless.

77
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,790
Why don't we start with him?

78
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,670
Who are you calling brainless?

79
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,880
You, of course. You're just a lackey.

80
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,350
You don't need to give up your life
for a traitorous capitalist like him.

81
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,510
I really don't know.

82
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,110
And why are you calling him a traitor?
Do you have proof?

83
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,880
No, wait. Why are you

84
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,040
being so submissive?

85
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,950
I'm telling you.

86
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,350
We, the Anti-traitor Corps,
are very clear on this.

87
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,950
He colluded with Japanese
to smuggle opium.

88
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,670
You're with the Anti-traitor Corps?

89
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,920
A real man is not ashamed of his actions.

90
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,230
Yes, we are from the Anti-traitor Corps.

91
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,160
He really seems to know something.

92
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,110
Why don't you question him outside?

93
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,880
I'll stay here and keep an eye on him.

94
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,790
You, follow me.

95
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,480
Sure thing.

96
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,600
We're brother-in-arms at the corps.

97
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,070
Which branch are you from?

98
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,230
It's none of your business.
However, we represent justice.

99
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,440
Hurry up and confess.

100
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,320
I'm a good guy too.

101
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,440
We will not wrongly accuse a good guy
and never let a bad guy get away.

102
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,440
Bad guy?

103
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,720
Have you brought your badge?

104
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,670
What do you mean?

105
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,200
This. There is a name on it, see.

106
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,640
Do you guys have this?

107
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,510
How bold of you.

108
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,600
You dare to fool me in such serious situation.

109
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,160
You... What do you mean?

110
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:56,110
The Anti-traitor Corps
never had a badge to begin with.

111
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,070
No way. How is that possible?

112
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,370
Anyone who joins the corps gets one.

113
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,270
If you guys don't have these,
that means you're...

114
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:07,040
You're all too cunning. That's...

115
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,510
What are you looking at? Let's go.

116
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,550
You two liars.

117
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,960
So, you had Zhao Qian and Sun Li
stand on guard outside.

118
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:40,440
Yes. They were supposed
to handle a huge task today.

119
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,440
What huge task?

120
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,550
I can help you too.

121
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,150
There's no need now.

122
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,520
Who do you think those people are?

123
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,590
They even impersonate
as the Anti-traitor Corps.

124
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,550
How do you know they're impostors?

125
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,400
They don't even have a badge.

126
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,520
Of course they're impostors.

127
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,640
The Anti-traitor Corps has badges, I see.

128
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:14,400
