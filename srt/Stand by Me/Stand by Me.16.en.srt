Are you blaming me?

Can you use your brain

before you speak and act?

9
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,230
Shut their mouths.

Mr. Matsuyama, Lu Jinzhong said

Feng Guanyu had fled.

00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,790
The Chinese are a bunch of losers indeed.

47
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,320
Go and deploy our men in the Feng's territory.

48
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,160
They're doomed.

49
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,160
Yes.

50
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,070
Feng Guanyu,

51
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
eat something first.

52
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,040
You can't grieve until you're full.

53
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:28,920
It's all my fault.

54
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,510
I'm to blame.

55
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,070
Zhao Qian, Sun Li and all those buddies

56
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,880
died because of me.

57
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,200
They were killed because of me!
It's all my fault!

58
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,640
Feng Guanyu,
it has nothing to do with you.

59
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,950
I was too full of myself.

60
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,230
If I hadn't ruined your plan,

61
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,270
Matsuyama might have been killed by you.

62
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,110
If you must blame yourself,

63
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,510
I should be blamed.

64
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,760
I'll kill Lu Jinzhong and Matsuyama

65
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,440
to avenge the buddies.

66
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,830
Feng Guanyu,
do you think you can kill Matsuyama

67
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,950
given your current status?

68
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,350
Enough.

69
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,670
Eat something first.

70
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,510
I'll go with you if you wanna die.

(He's right.)

72
