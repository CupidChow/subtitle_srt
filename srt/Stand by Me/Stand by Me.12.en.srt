00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,740
=Episode 12=

3
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,910
Here, Yaoming, help yourself.

4
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,360
These are your favorite dishes.

5
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,760
It's so flattering.

6
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,310
This is the Feng's place.

7
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,870
I'm eating here and also

8
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,190
wearing his clothes.

9
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,830
No worries. He's good-hearted.

10
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,760
When I was down and out,

11
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,160
he took me in like this.

12
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,950
What's going on?

13
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,310
Mr. Feng, you're back.

14
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,270
Come here. Take a seat and join us.

15
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,760
Guanyu, our grocery store was burned
by the Japanese guys.

16
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,310
He's homeless. So, I let him
stay here for a couple of days.

17
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,470
Yaoming is my buddy.

18
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,550
That makes him your buddy too.

19
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,960
I guess you won't mind it, right?

20
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,830
Whatever.

21
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,960
Here. Here. Take a seat.

22
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,960
Weijie, I feel like Mr. Feng

23
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,190
isn't happy about my stay.

24
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,830
I may just go elsewhere.

25
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,320
No need. Just stay here.

26
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,550
But...

27
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,360
After all, the Feng family is rich.

28
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,470
It doesn't matter if you stay.

29
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,320
Weijie.

30
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,390
(I offer to work with the Japanese)

31
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,630
(in order to find out the ringleader.)

32
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,910
(It'd be too dangerous for Huang Weijie.)

33
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,600
(I finally made him leave.)

34
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,360
(But now he even brought Li Yaoming back.)

35
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,030
(Matsuyama has intended to kill me.)

36
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,440
(I must stay here.)

37
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,520
Mr. Feng, you're still awake.

38
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,320
I can't fall asleep.
So, I'm walking around.

39
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,670
If you feel disturbed,
I'll go back to my room.

40
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:28,800
Sit.

41
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,550
Weijie told me

42
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,390
you were his best friend.

43
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,600
Then you must know him well.

44
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,720
I'm really curious.

45
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,270
You took such a brainless

46
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,390
and impulsive man into Anti-traitor Corps

47
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,160
and made him work for me undercover.

48
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,000
Aren't you afraid that he might die

49
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,600
if he was exposed?

50
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,110
Mr. Feng, we suspected you before,

51
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,030
but we've confirmed

52
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,070
it's only a misunderstanding.

53
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,440
I can tell that you're

54
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,640
not as harsh on Weijie as you said.

55
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,440
How can you kill him?

56
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,830
But rest assured. When I go to bed,

57
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,920
I'll tell Weijie

58
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,160
to be careful with his mouth

59
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,720
and not defy you all the time.

60
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,640
Yaoming.

61
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,670
Weijie, I just mentioned I'd talk to you.

62
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,640
Let's go. Better not disturb Mr. Feng.

63
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,200
Guanyu, don't tell me

64
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,760
you're gonna expel Yaoming.

65
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,760
Forget it,
let's not make things difficult for Mr. Feng.

66
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,000
It's OK.

67
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,760
I have an idea.
Let's be sworn brothers.

68
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,230
Is it appropriate?

69
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,600
How can a man of status like Mr. Feng

70
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,440
be our sworn brother?

71
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,230
What's inappropriate about it?

72
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,920
The enemy of the enemy is a friend.

73
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,510
So, the friend of the friend is a buddy.

74
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,510
From now on, I'll be the eldest brother.

75
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,880
You two decide the rest.

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,270
Idiot!

77
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,230
Feng Guanyu, we're not done yet.

78
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,320
President Feng, thank you.

79
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,510
(Long San? Why is she here?)

80
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,790
Don't mention it.

81
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,270
I'm not here for your gratitude.

82
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,440
(What... What's going on?)

83
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,040
(Feng Guanyu didn't kill Long San.)

84
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,720
(Why are they discussing cooperation?)

85
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,550
What happened?

86
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,510
Feng Guanyu.

87
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,600
Feng Guanyu?

88
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,670
What's about him?

89
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,440
He may be really working with the Japanese.

90
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,160
We're all deceived by him.

91
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,950
What are you talking about?

92
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,440
I saw him dealing with Long San in the study.

93
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,550
Calm down. I'll go and take a look first.

94
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,720
President Feng, please keep your word.

95
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,040
Rest assured. When I kill Matsuyama,

96
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,480
I'll give you a new identity
to tie up loose ends.

97
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,510
OK.

98
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,160
What are you doing?

99
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,480
You...

100
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,320
What's up?

101
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,470
I have a question.

102
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,000
Shoot.

103
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,670
