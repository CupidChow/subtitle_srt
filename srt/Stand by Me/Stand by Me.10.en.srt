3
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,680
I'll introduce him when we get the chance.

4
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,510
- Sure.
- Yaoming.

5
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,160
What are you two doing here?

6
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,680
It's you.

7
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,630
Weijie, let me introduce them to you.

8
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,440
These two are our brothers-in-arm
at the Anti-traitor Corps.

9
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,120
You guys are really from the corps.

10
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,190
Yes, I didn't think you're one too.

11
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,630
You know each other?

12
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,190
We don't just know each other.

13
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,870
I almost got gunned down last time.

14
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,680
That was a misunderstanding.

15
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,360
Why didn't you tell him his code name?

16
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,000
That's right, Yaoming.
Why didn't you tell me my code name?

17
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,550
What is your code name?

18
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,310
His code name is Sunny Boy.

19
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,440
My code name is Windy Boy.

20
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,240
Since you're also part of
the Anti-traitor Corps,

21
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,630
you should have a code name too.

22
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,910
Moony Boy and Starry Boy
are still up for grabs. You can pick one.

23
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,030
I guess I can understand
why you didn't tell me about this.

24
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,600
I think Starry Boy fits you perfectly.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,910
Right, what about that wooden badge?

26
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,667
That's right.

27
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,390
Why do I have a wooden badge
and they don't?

28
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,800
That wooden badge

29
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,470
was especially carved for you
as encouragement.

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,670
You shouldn't have done that.
It almost led to a huge mistake.

31
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,390
But the craftsmanship
on that wooden badge is quite exquisite.

32
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,720
Why don't you find time

33
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,080
to carve one for each of us?

34
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,440
Do you know
how long it takes to carve one?

35
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,240
Anyway, why are you back so suddenly?

36
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,270
I almost forgot.

37
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,190
I overheard that the opium is stored

38
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,600
at the eastern warehouse unguarded.

39
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,600
Eastern warehouse?

40
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,390
Did Feng Guanyu say it?

41
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,270
No, his subordinate said it.

42
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,910
Well done, Starry Boy.

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,520
We'll ambush them
at the warehouse right now.

44
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,000
The credit for taking the lead
for this operation is all yours.

45
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,190
No way.

46
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,080
I can't take all the credits for myself.

47
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,830
I want to share it with Sunny Boy.

48
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,390
Why is there a guard at the warehouse?

49
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,440
Starry Boy,

50
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,110
is there a mistake in your information?

51
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,520
I heard it perfectly clear.

52
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,750
Why is Lu Jinzhong here?

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,750
Mr. Lu.

54
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:08,830
Miss Long.

55
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,470
I never expected
Mr. Lu would return the opium to us

56
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,910
behind President Feng's back.

57
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,670
I only found out today
that no one is guarding the warehouse,

58
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,760
so I immediately contacted you.

59
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,920
Miss Long, after you get what you want,

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,740
please explain it clearly
to your Japanese backers

61
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,550
that the Feng family does not intend
to go against them.

62
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,040
Please ask them not to target us.

63
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,480
I will certainly relay your message.
What about my goods?

64
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,230
Let's move in. Go!

65
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,760
Go, go. Move in.

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,950
Your goods are inside.

67
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,830
Freeze.

68
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,670
I can't believe you set me up, Mr. Lu.

69
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,040
Impossible. They aren't my men.

70
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,040
Can't you see they're also aiming at me?

71
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,270
I didn't expect you
to bring backup, Miss Long.

72
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,040
It's always better to be careful.

73
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,000
You're absolute right.

74
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:14,200
Be careful.
One must always remember these two words.

75
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,350
Take off their masks
and let's have a look at them.

76
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,790
All who stands in my way must die.

77
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:55,790
Kill them.

78
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,510
Get them.

79
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,270
It's Feng Guanyu. Why is he here?

80
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,600
Let's go. Let's go.

81
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,320
It's a good thing I came.

82
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,480
This dummy.

83
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,480
Tell me who is your Japanese boss.

84
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,390
I can spare you some physical pain.

85
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,160
Save it.
Just kill or torture me as you please.

86
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Do you like cherry blossoms?

87
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,320
What do you mean?

88
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,230
I heard Japanese

89
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,480
really love cherry blossoms,

90
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,230
especially when they fall in full bloom,

91
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,110
magnificent yet heartrending.

92
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,390
But I think

93
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,070
you prefer white magnolia.

94
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,670
What are you talking about?

95
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,160
I looked into it.

96
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,200
You may be a Japanese

97
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,200
but you were born here,

98
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,600
and the parents
who raised you are Chinese.

99
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,830
What did you do to them?

100
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,720
I didn't do anything to them.

101
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,510
But do they know

102
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,480
you sell opium for the Japanese

103
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,830
- to harm your neighbors?
- You...

104
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,350
I can give you a chance

105
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:33,950
to live on,

106
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,110
but you have to tell me their names.

107
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,720
If your master

108
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,670
knows you're in my hands,

109
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,440
I wonder if they will still
have faith in your loyalty.

110
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,550
I also can't be sure if they will not
lay their hands on your parents.

111
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,550
Wait.

112
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,940
(Grocery Store)

113
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,950
Feng Guanyu removed the guards
at the warehouse

114
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,480
to hand the opium over to Long San.

115
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,510
He must be a traitor.

116
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,830
But haven't you noticed

117
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,230
that Feng Guanyu saved us?

118
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,040
Maybe you got exposed

119
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,070
and he was just putting on an act.

120
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,440
No way. Since he was willing to save us,

121
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,480
- so he must be a good guy.
- Are you speaking for Feng Guanyu?

122
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:33,590
You don't trust me?

123
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,350
From my observation,

124
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,230
Feng Guanyu isn't that terrible

125
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,000
and would never work with the Japanese.

126
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,840
Did you get blinded by Feng Guanyu?

127
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,110
Do you want to commit crimes with him?

128
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,010
What are you talking about?

129
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:45,880
Stop arguing!

130
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,710
I think the top priority right now is

131
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,590
to figure out Feng Guanyu's goal.

132
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,320
When did we argue?

133
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,030
You're the loudest one.

134
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,790
No matter what it is, something is
definitely up with Feng Guanyu.

135
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,550
We must think of a way

136
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,110
to get those opium out.

137
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,200
Feng Guanyu killed even the Japanese.

138
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,440
He must have a plan.
It's just that I don't know about it.

139
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,150
I think Starry Boy has a point.

140
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,320
Why don't we do this?
Let's split up and act separately for now.

141
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,200
You'll go back to the Feng family
and continue your covert investigation.

142
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,350
Okay. I'll go investigate.
