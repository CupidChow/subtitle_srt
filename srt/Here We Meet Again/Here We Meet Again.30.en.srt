you're selfish.

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,230

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,680
This morning, I couldn't help myself

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,640

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,790
Come on, with this little money,

45
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,430
we can't afford a nanny.

46
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,040
I gave you all my money

47
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,120

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,730
We will.

00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,600
it would be a huge honor

105
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,600
and an incredible blessing!

106
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,800
Yanshi,

107
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,040
would you like to join

108
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,430
our navigation research team?

109
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,270
Yes, of course.

110
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,360
Professor Liang,

111
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,360
to join your team,

112
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,240
does he need lots of work experience?

113
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,190
Relatively speaking,

114
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,430
he may get lots of medical records.

115
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,510
Men of our major

116
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,240
have to know about software

117
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,600
as well as hardware.

118
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,120
You must be familiar
with the process and procedure

119
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,560
of hardware production.

120
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,870
The welding spot, for example.

121
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,600
Dry welding is the biggest problem.

122
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,720
It appears to be well welded,

123
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,360
and it functions normally, too.

124
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,830
But as time passes, it'll get loose

125
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,000
and affect the conducting.

126
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,510
Professor.

127
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,040

00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,870

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,070

00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,040
Professor,

132
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,920
I have to ask for leave

137
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,120
Come in.

138
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,870
Professor Liang,

139
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,270
you wanted to see me?

140
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,480
I got you here

141
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,000

142
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,430
What's Xu Yanshi up to?

143
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,430
Why is he way too busy?

144
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,270
Professor,

145
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,480
you may not know

146
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,870
that his father and his stepmother

147
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,240
had a son, and left the baby with him.

148
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,750
Where's the baby now?

149
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,360
Xu rented a flat

150
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,750
in a nearby community

151
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,120
and hired a nanny.

152
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,000
Xu Yan.

153
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,190
Professor Liang.

154
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,800
Professor,

155
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,920
what's up?

156
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,000
Yanshi,

157
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,680
I got to know

158
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,720
your family condition.

159
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
From this day on,

160
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,510
don't bother about your baby brother.

161
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,070
Send him

162
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,630
to my wife.

163
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
She'll take care of him.

164
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,190
Thank you, Professor.

165
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,120
- OK.
- OK.

166
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,720
- See you.
- Bye-bye.

167
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Xingheng is a company

168
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,600

the Navigation Research Institute.

169
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,120
What a surprise!

170
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,680
You are

171
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,000
the first undergraduate

172
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,510

173
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,270
In the 21st century,

174
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,750
technology is the core competence
of all nations.

175
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,040
Technology

176
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,920
decides how strong a nation can be.

177
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,360
Backwardness gets us beaten.

178
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,870
Science has no boundaries,

179
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,480
but scientists have their own nations.

180
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,680
Hope you'll work hard

181
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,000
in Xingheng.

182
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,870
I will.

183
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,240

for taking care of Chengli.

186
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,160
Don't say that.

187
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,480
Actually,

188
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,870
I have selfish motives, too.

189
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,430
I want

190
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,480

192
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,390

00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,040
am I right?

196
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,040
Professor,

197
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,120
can you call my name correctly

198
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,000
for even once?

199
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,160
OK.

200
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,240
When you get

201
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,480
Xingheng's offer,

202
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,630
I'll call you that.

203
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,720
OK.

204
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,670
I will.

205
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,480
You made the choice

206
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,510
for your own reasons.

207
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,480
At least,

208
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,360
you live up to your family

209
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,550
and your friends.

210
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,240
You just don't

211
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,630
live up to yourself.

212
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,550
I heard you had a five-year contract

213
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,240
with Velin.

214
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,960
OK.

215
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,080
Let's also have

216
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,750
a five-year promise.

217
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,440
In five years,

218
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,150
Xu Yanshi

219
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,720
will join our team

220
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,910
with a brand-new look,

221
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,910
OK?

222
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,390
It's time to leave.

223
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,510
Professor,

224
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,840
I... I should go.

225
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:28,870
OK.

226
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,080
(Here are some latest foreign papers)

227
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,240
(and research materials.)

228
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,480
(Read them when you have time.)

229
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,180
(Xu Yanshi)

230
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,420
(Annual Summary Report, Velin)

231
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,630
Hello, professor.

232
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,750
Yanshi,

233
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,510
we've got

234
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,440
a mission recently.

235
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,600
Quite difficult.

236
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,360
But it's a great chance.

237
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,080
Would you like to come
to watch and learn?

238
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,390
But it'll take up

239
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,870
your Spring Festival holiday.

240
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,150
It's OK.

241
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,200
My holiday starts today.

242
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,670
I'll be there tomorrow.

243
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,480
This is

244
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,000
an incredible opportunity.

245
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,200
If he gives up,

246
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,600
he'll never get a second chance.

247
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,360
And he will

248
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,000
never get a way

249
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,840
to return to the Institute.

250
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,150
I hope you two

251
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,390
can think more carefully

252
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,960
about whether to pass up
this opportunity.

253
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,510
There's still some time

254
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,670
before the interview.

255
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,150
I'll wait for your response.

256
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,080
Professor Liang,

257
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,910
no need to wait.

258
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,240
I will make him go.

259
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,390
You will

260
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,120
still be Xu Yanshi's professor.

261
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,240
Hope you'll take care of him.

(I think)

270
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,240
(he was really proud)

271
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,720
(and he truly wanted)

(In the following five years,)

274
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,030
(every time)

275
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,440
(a satellite was launched,)

276
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,030

277
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,510

278

(I wanted to share this glory)

280
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,030
(with him.)

281
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,510

What's up?

296
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,200
When did it happen?

297
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,670
I get it.

298
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:22,630
There he is.

299
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,670
What are you doing here?

300
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,600
Nothing?

301
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,200
Then I'm going home.

302
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,030
Professor Liang talked to Gui,

303
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,240
saying you rejected

304
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,480
the interview with the Institute.

305
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,320
Gui came to us

306
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,030
to persuade you.

307
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,550
But I think

308
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,440
you must have your own reasons.

309
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,480
Well, here's the thing.

310
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:56,840
Together,

311
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,910
we had a discussion.

312
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,790
We believe

313
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,550
Xiang Yuan

314
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,510
will be your wife.

315
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,150
You won't marry anyone else.

316
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,320
So,

317
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,390
when she's in trouble,

318
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,790
we'll definitely help her.

319
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,080
Thanks.

320
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,510
But stay out of this.

321
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,480
I won't!

322
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,440
Xu Yanshi,

323
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,080
can't you live for yourself just this once?

324
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,030
I made some calls.

325
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,910
Donghe lacks technicians.

326
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,550
Lyu Zeyang leaves
at the end of this month.

327
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,360
Now, they haven't found

328
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,750
a suitable CTO.

329
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,240
Mr. Lai

330
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,000
has been poaching

331
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,120
by all means.

332
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,600
The technology circle isn't that big.

333
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,790
Rumors are everywhere.

334
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,960
You want to help them?

335
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,600
OK.

336
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,870
I'll go with you.

337
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,320
Xu Yanshi,

338
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,200
in terms of technology,

339
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,480
I might not be as good as you.

340
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,240
But remember, bro.

341
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,840
I'm working in the technical department

342
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,270
of Tencent!

343
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,320
They will recruit me,

344
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,790
instead of you!

345
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,630
Go back

346
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,550
to your interview!

347
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,960
Don't be silly.

348
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,960
Xu Yanshi, listen!

349
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,360
I will go to Donghe!

350
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,080

No way.

376

My project can't be suspended.

377
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,350

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,960
Now,

386
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,030
it's hard for us to do projects.

387
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,960
We're short of men

388
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,550
and we fail to recruit any.

389
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,030
So, we can only do

390
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:02,720
some projects

391
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,790
with maximum benefit.

392
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,830
Xiang Yuan,

393
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,160
to be honest,

394
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,160
we stay here

395
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,240
for the sake of this company.

396
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,400
Otherwise,

397
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,000
we would have left with Mr. Yang

398
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,590
to his new company.

399
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,960
Mr. Gu,

400
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,350
I'm polite enough

401
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,110
to call you Mr. Gu.

402
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,880
If you really want

403
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,200
to follow Mr. Yang,

404
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,590
go ahead.

405
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,960
I won't keep you.

406
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,200
By the way,

407
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,880
if any of you wants to resign,

408
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,350
you won't be stopped.

409
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,750
I didn't mean to say this.

410
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,160
But now that Mr. Gu

411
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,070
brought it up,

412
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,350
I'll make a point.

413
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,310
Mr. Yang's resignation

414
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,640
has indeed caused

415
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,550
some big trouble.

416
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,240
But I used to think

417
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,720
our company had some problems.

418
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,240
No offense,

419
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,160
but our employees are getting old

420
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,750
and we can't recruit young men.

421
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,590
Talented and young guys

422
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,920
were wasted.

423
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,440
Those who still stay

424
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,400
get paid but do nothing.

425
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,310
Am I right,

426
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,440
Mr. Gu?

427
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,510
Let me remind you.

428
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:22,830
Now,

429
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,400
I'm the biggest shareholder.

430
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,000
But I'm not

431
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,750
as easygoing as my grandpa.

432
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,000
I've always been desperate.

433
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,920
And I'm used to that.

434
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,400
So, under such circumstances,

435
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,350
I have nothing

436
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,480
to care about.

437
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,200
In the worst case,

438
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,000
I'll apologize to my grandpa

439
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,070
for the bankruptcy thing.

440
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,790
I'll take the blame

441
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,000
and you won't be involved.

442
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,440
So,

443
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,480
if anyone

444
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,680
wants to leave for a new company,

445
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,200
put up your hand.

446
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,640
Mr. Gu,

447
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,000
what do you say?

448
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,000
No one can replace Lyu Zeyang yet.

449
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,310
But now,

450
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,070
you're starting

451
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,310
to expel me.

452
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,440
Xiang Yuan,

453
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,720
did your grandpa

454
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,000
give you such big power

455
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,110
just to make

456
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,350
ridiculous decisions?

457
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,030
Miss Xiang,

576
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,270
Come on.

577
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,880
They're helpful.

578
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,720
Yeah.

579
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,880
But Mr. Li,

580
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,590
we're short of men, too.

581
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,940
(Li)

582
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,000
Hail, Yongbiao!

583
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:54,720
Mr. Li!

584
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,110
I feel

585
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:57,790
as if we hadn't met in this way

586
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:58,920
for a century.

587
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,270
Boss, you have no idea

588
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,720
how hard it was for me

589
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,920
to keep You Zhi in Velin

590
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,030
so that I could come.

591
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,000
Now, You Zhi is

592
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,270
the team leader

593
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,110
of Velin's technical department.

594
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,920
He's leading the new guys.

595
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:10,720
By the way,

596
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,350
umm...

597
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,480
Where's Miss Xiang?

598
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,960
Upstairs.

599
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,790
In the office of vice chairman.

600
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,270
Impressive!

601
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,920
You're more impressive.

602
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,880
You've got a great girlfriend.

603
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,510
But I heard

604
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,440
our group

605
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,590
had been in trouble.

606
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,720
It's said to go bankrupt

607
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,960
and employees may not get paid.

608
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,110
What happened?

609
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,830
If you really

610
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:39,830
can't get paid,

611
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,960
will you still work here?

612
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,550
Yes. Why not?

613
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,440
I'll stay as long as you do.

614
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,790
Then get to work.

615
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,880
Don't bother what others say.

616
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,680
- OK!
- OK!

617
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,480
OK.

618
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,270
Come in.

619
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,160
Why did you come?

620
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,000
I had to.

621
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,640
Donghe is

622
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,790
in such big trouble.

623
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,680
Why didn't you tell me?

624
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,590
Look at your dark circles

625
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,920
from staying overnight.

626
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,160
Umm...

627
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,680
Let's go.

628
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,830
I'll buy you some milky tea.

629
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Milky tea?

630
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,310
You don't want MoMoZhaZha?

631
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:48,270
Then the "dawdle tea".

632
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,640
Don't tease me.

633
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,790
Look at your face.

634
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,750
So rough.

635
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,000
Take this.

636
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,400
Go back home,

637
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,640
have a bath,

638
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,030
and relax.

639
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:03,960
Use the mask.

640
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,480
Then go brain dead and sleep.

641
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,510
Don't think about anything.

642
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,680
You're the leader.

643
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,920
If you break down,

644
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,590
how can you lead us to fight?

645
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,750
Now you complain about me.

646
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,160
Let's go.

647
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,960
I don't dare to complain.

648
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,110
The text sensor

649
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,200
will be Gao Leng's job.

Boss, we just came

651
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,030
and you gave me a job.

652
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,030
How merciless!

653
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:23,960
Quit griping.

654
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,400
Will you take this job?

655
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,350
Yes, yes.

656
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,240
Yes.

657

also wants to resign.

673
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:23,510
Such ungrateful guys!

674
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,480
When the company is in trouble,

675
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,350
they've just left

676
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,350
in an irresponsible way.

677
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,510
What kind of employees

678
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,310
have I cultivated?

679
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,680
What about Gu Changsheng?

680
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,270
He hasn't resigned.

681
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,590
I guess

682
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,880
he's waiting to buy your shares.

683
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:44,110
Let him wait, then.

684
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,750
I've got something to say.

685
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,590
Say it.

686
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,550
A few technicians

687
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,400
from Velin

688
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,400
came to support us.

689
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,440
Wang Qingyi from Tencent

690
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,110
and Zhang Yi from Mingde Technology...

691
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,480
They sent

692
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,000
their resumes,

693
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,750
applying for a job.

694
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,030
What do they want?

695
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,680
They are

696
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,160
friends

697
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,590
of Xiang Yuan and Xu Yanshi.

698
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,880
Good friends, anyway.

699
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,880
Without hesitation,

700
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,590
they dropped their work

701
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,110
and came to help.

702
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,030
Xu Yanshi will have

703
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,070
his interview with the Institute,

704
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,590
right?

705
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,640
Yes, next week.

706
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,750
Ask the archivist

707
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,160
to prepare his file

708
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,110
and let him prepare for his interview.

709
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,550
Don't hold him back.

710
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,030
What about Wang Qingyi and his friends?

711
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,000
Let Xu Yanshi and Xiang Yuan

712
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,750
take care of that.

713
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,960
We can't

714
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,880
interfere with them.

715
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,480
These guys

716
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,110
are really helpful

717
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,830
to Yuan.

718
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,720
Yuan is also

719
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,790
a grateful girl.

720
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,720
Let her

721
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,960
make her own decisions.

722
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,750
I really can't go back.

723
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,550
I resigned.

724
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,790
What on earth do you guys want?

725
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,200
Xu,

726
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,720
instead of saying

727
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,270
we came to help you,

728
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,240
we would rather say,

729
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,920
we came for a new job.

730
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,160
Hearing your girlfriend

731
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,720
is recruiting technicians,

732
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,350
I came to have a try.

733
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,720
But you were just promoted

734
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,270
to be the director.

735
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,550
I quit my job.

736
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,640
My boss kept flirting with me

737
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,030
and taking advantage of me.

738
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,110
I was so fed up.

739
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,440
Then I quit!

740
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,350
What are you laughing at?

741
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,200
And you?

742
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,830
Were you flirted with, too?

743
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,510
Don't tease me.

744
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,920
In my case,

745
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,550
my boss was mean to me.

746
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,270
I had wanted to quit.

747
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,640
Don't bother to say anything now.

748
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,270
The work world...

749
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,880
I've figured it out.

750
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,310
Unless

751
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,000
we work with our friends,

752
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,830
we won't be happy.

753
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,750
What about you?

754
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,270
I'm a different case.

755
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,720
They offered me

756
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,200
a high pay.

757
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,060
(To Xu Yanshi,
Our friendship is way bigger.)

758
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,590
Our friendship is way bigger!

759
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:31,960
Xu.

760
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:33,830
Xu.

761
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,240
(From Zhang Yi, Wang Qingyi,
and Gao Enbo)

762
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,450
(To Xu Yanshi, Our friendship is way bigger.)
Xu.

763
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,440
Now we have

764
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,720
a serious problem.

765
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,720
The funding gap of Donghe

766
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,310
is bigger than expected.

767
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,480
If we still can't get loans,

768
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,480
Donghe may have to go bankrupt.

769
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:58,790
I have the money.

770
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,960
I sold the flight base.

771
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,480
With my savings,

772
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,920
I've got about 40 million.

773
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,480
Jiamian!

774
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,840
Grandpa,

775
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,800
rest for recuperation.

776
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,400
Compared with health,

777
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,960
money is nothing, OK?

778
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,880
We can sell our house

779
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,800
and return to our old flat.

780
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,030
- OK.
- OK.

781
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:40,630
Grandpa,

782
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,360
you rest more for recuperation.

783
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,230
My brother and I
will take care of the company.

784
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,710
As long as Bai.

785
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,710
Yeah.

786
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,920
I heard Mr. Situ was sick

787
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,440
and I came to check up on him.

788
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,280
All I know is

789
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,230
when the fox preaches,
take care of your geese.

790
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,360
Mr. Situ,

791
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,880
you look quite vigorous.

792
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,440
I won't be worried, then.

793
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,800
Yeah.

794
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,400
I didn't know I could still live.

795
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,360
If you came

796
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,590
to mock our company

797
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,630
for declining,

798
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,510
you'd better leave

799
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,880
before it gets dark.

800
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,360
Come on.

801
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,360
I'm visiting you on behalf of Pingshan.

802
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,760
Why do you expel me?

803
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,440
I know

804
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,710
since Pingshan left,

805
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,630
Donghe has been in a difficult time.

806
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,920
But...

807
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,190
Lyu Zeyang and some other men

808
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,840
insisted on following us.

809
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,800
Pingshan is embarrassed, too.

810
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,480
But he didn't have another choice.

811
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,280
Birds of a feather
flock together, after all.

812
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,030
Waste sorting is

813
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,400
sometimes necessary, too.

814
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,760
Well,

815
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,150
Ms. Li,

816
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,800
which dustbin do you deserve?

817
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,920
In this case,

818
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,110
the left one, I guess.
[*The left one is the Hazardous Waste.]

819
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,800
Young men,

820
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,190
don't be so impatient.

821
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,710
Solutions are always more.

822
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,920
None of your business, anyway.

823
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,190
You don't want me to call security, huh?

824
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,320
Mr. Situ,

825
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,320
I should go.

826
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:16,920
Bye.

827
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:25,960
Don't worry.

828
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,920
Just rest for recovery.

829
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,550
Donghe will be back to normal.

(Donghe Group)
Xu Yanshi...

852
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,070
Who's he?

853
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,670
Where did he come from?

854
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,000
Didn't Yang have a rough talk

855
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,400
that no one dared to join us

856
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,630
at this moment?

857
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,320
Why...

858
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,150
Gu,

859
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,960
if they really

860
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,920
solve this problem,

861
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,480
could we not

862
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,320
buy some shares at the lowest price?

863
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,280
Yeah.

864
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,190
If I knew I couldn't get anything,

865
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:35,670
I...

866
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,400
I would have gone to Yang!

867
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,070
Be patient.

868
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,510
Not everyone dares

869
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,000
to take Lyu Zeyang's place.

870
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,320
We all know

871
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,320
that Situ Mingtian

872
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,510
spent so much money

873
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,280
cultivating him.

874
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,000
He was sent abroad
for training and further education

875
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,670
a few times every year

876
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:51,920
and we all witnessed that.

877
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,400
But Xu Yanshi

878
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,320
has no qualifications

879
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,550
or background.

880
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,670
Lai Feibai must be insane.

881
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,760
He wants to cultivate

882
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,230
another Lyu Zeyang.

883
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,510
Isn't it too late?

884
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,070
It's a joke!

885
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,360
It's a serious problem,

886
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,110
but Situ still hasn't learned his lesson.

887
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,510
Sometimes,

888
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,710
he's just overconfident,

889
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,590
and stubborn.

890
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:14,960
Before,

891
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,550
I warned him.

892
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,150
He spent so much money

893
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,800
cultivating a technical talent

894
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:21,920
but he wasn't alert.

895
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,920
Then Yang took away that guy.

896
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,920
Xu Yanshi and his team

897
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,150
have stabilized

898
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,590
our key projects.

899
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,920
And Xu Yanshi is very well-connected.

900
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,550
He just attended

901
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,710
this year's World Internet Conference.

902
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,960
Those who attended it

903
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:49,320
are the greatest technicians
of different companies.

904
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,360
Xu Yanshi	nearly knows

905
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,110
all of them.

906
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,070
Well, you see,

907
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,070
it's quite a small circle.

908
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,280
The female CTO

909
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,510
of Pinghu...

910
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,150
They're in the same circle.

911
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:05,630
When we had a meal together,

912
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,760
they even made fun

913
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,150
of Xu Yanshi and her.

914
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,630
About what?

915
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:12,670
Saying they make

916
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,960
a perfect couple.

917
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,000
They also said

918
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,030
the female CTO

919
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,630
even pursued Xu Yanshi.

920
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:20,760
And this week, they have an appointment

921
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,670
for a meal.

922
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,800
You talked too much, didn't you?

923
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,710
How annoying! Out!

924
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,510
Why are you angry?

925
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,360
Fine.

926
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:29,710
Wait.

927
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,150
I haven't asked you

928
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,590
about the induction of Xu Yanshi yet.

929
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,840
Why didn't you tell me?

930
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,150
I'm not to blame.

931
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,960
Your grandpa approved.

932
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,000
When he gave an order,

933
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,280
I didn't dare to disobey him.

934
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,280
When?

935
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,920
Last week.

936
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,670
Xu Yanshi visited him

937
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,000
in the hospital.

938
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:49,230
He even emptied
your grandpa's chamber pot.

939
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:52,150
But I don't know

940
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,360
what they talked about.

941
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,920
How do I dare

942
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,920
to read your grandpa's mind?

943
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,110
Because you can always read his mind!

944
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,320
Fine, my lady.

945
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,320
I'm getting back to work.

946
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,550
Grandpa,

947
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,760
why did you ask Xu Yanshi

948
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,630
to empty your chamber pot?

949
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,000
Didn't I get you a caregiver?

950
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,510
Could you please

951
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,070
not bother Xu Yanshi with this?

952
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:23,960
No trouble at all.

953
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,710
Xu... Xu Yanshi?

954
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,510
Aren't you

955
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,550
having a meal

956
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,800
with the female CTO?

957
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:33,960
