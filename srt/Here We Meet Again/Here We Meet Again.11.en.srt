28

=Episode 11=

29
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,560
You know what?

30
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,560
Today, I found out

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,430
the sayings were wrong.

32
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,430
When I passed out,

33
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,430
I had clear consciousness.

34
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,000
I just

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,200
had sore and weak limbs

36
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,680
and was kind of numb.

37
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,350
Anyway, I knew what happened.

38
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,150
It's not like that

39
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,150
I didn't feel anything.

40
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,150
Thinking of how I was carried,

41
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,480
I would rather I forgot everything.

42
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,400
Sounds like plots in novels

43
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,350
are deceptive.

44
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,430
Not really.

45
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,630
Oh, I know.

46
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,910
You must be talking about your boyfriend.

47
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,150
Boyfriend who?

48
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,960
The man who carried you here.

49
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,240
He's just a colleague.

50
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,120
He is?

51
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,590
But he's so cool.

52
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,960
Just so-so.

53
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,120
Is he single? Is he?

54
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,590
It's none of your business.

55
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,960
Don't you know

56
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,000
your own condition?

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,780
Bah.

58
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,360
Don't be angry.

59
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,560
Let me tell you what?

60
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,430
He's been single

61
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,190
but he's never had a girlfriend.

62
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,360
I even suspect

63
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,630
that he has some inexplicable disease.

64
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,800
No way?

65
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,750
(Oh, no.)

66
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,520
(He heard me.)

67
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,120
Just keep this between us.

68
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,680
Don't tell anyone else.

69
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,840
Have some water.

70
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,960
I'm not thirsty.

71
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,340
(Chen Shu)

72
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,060
(Li: Picture)

73
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,660
(Ying Yinyin)

74
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,280
(Tommy of Headquarters)
(Two men in Velin had a fight.)

75
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,400
(For a woman, I heard.)

76
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,310
(Quite bloody.)

77
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,960
(Show More)
(That woman ended up in the hospital.)

78
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,750
(The woman in the hospital)

79
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,310
(is the leader
of their technical group.)

80
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,000
(And the other woman is the director
of the sales department,)

81
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
(Chen Shu.)

82
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:43,960
Sweetheart, here.

83
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,400
How does it taste? Sweet?

84
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,050
Mm.

85
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,750
Not so fast. Have it slowly.

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,710
Take your time.

87
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,280
Thanks.

88
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,280
Eat it.

89
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,920
Excuse me, doctor.

90
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:36,920
Hello.

91
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,560
Xiang Yuan's test result has come out.

92
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,480
Please check it.

93
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,390
OK.

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,240
I know this cupcake.

95
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,190
It's hard to buy any.

96
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,160
And it offers no food delivery.

97
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,360
For you, your boyfriend

98
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,950
went that far.

99
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,800
I suddenly feel
the fruit is no longer sweet.

100
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,830
He isn't...

101
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,510
You know what?

102
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,560
He may have some disease.

103
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,000
But he's handsome

104
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,950
and nice.

105
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,310
In general,

106
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,630
he's like a perfect man.

107
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,870
Seriously?

108
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,180
(Chen Shan)

109
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,190
Hello.

110
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:31,720
What's wrong?

111
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,680
It looks so pretty.

112
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,560
It tastes great.

113
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,680
Why didn't you

114
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,510
buy me some cupcakes?

115
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,310
Come on.

116
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,560
- Who's Boss calling?
- It's a famous brand, I think.

117
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:45,950
Looks like

118
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,430
he's very happy.

119
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:48,920
Hello, Miss Xiang.

120
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,430
- Hi, Miss Xiang.
- Hi, Miss Xiang.

121
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,920
- Hello, hello.
- Such beautiful bouquets.

122
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,630
There you are.

123
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,160
Would you like some fruit?

124
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,360
Let me wash some for you.

125
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:56,630
OK. Thanks.

126
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,390
Give me the fruit basket.

127
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,920
You Zhi, give me a hand.

128
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,750
OK. Be right there.

129
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,600
Young lady,

130
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,270
your colleagues are so enthusiastic.

131
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,560
You are a people person.

132
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,600
Not really.

133
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,510
Actually,

134
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,120
I'm a leader.

135
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,680
Nowadays,

136
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,390
being popular isn't
as good as being a leader.

137
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,720
But you don't look like

138
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,830
you've reached an age.

139
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,480
I just look young.

140
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,750
Come on.

141
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,830
Stop joking.

142
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,680
Take the medicine.

143
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,560
Shi Tianyou!

144
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,240
Here.

145
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,600
Get me some hot water.

146
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,310
OK.

147
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,950
Boss, give me the glass.

148
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,430
Thanks.

149
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,000
Thank you.

150
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,630
I'll put it here.

151
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,390
It's OK.

152
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,190
I'll put it here.

153
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:45,830
- OK.
- Thanks.

154
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,040
You're the first employee

155
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,430
who ended up in hospital this year.

156
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,480
The flowers and fruit are from

157
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,270
- the sales department,
- Here, your water.

158
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,430
the administration department,
the HR department,

159
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,270
and our own department.

160
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,630
Everyone wants you

161
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,560
to get better soon.

162
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,190
Thanks to you,

163
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,430
I'm leaving the hospital tomorrow.

164
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,680
What about

165
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,390
Li Chi and Gao Leng?

166
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,750
Gao Leng was taken away by Shu.

167
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,040
He doesn't look great.

168
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,270
And Li Chi?

169
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,040
Only Ying Yinyin insists

170
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,190
that he took sneaky photos.

171
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,800
The police are still working on it.

172
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,720
OK, I get it.

173
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,040
Go back to work.

174
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,560
Don't think I don't know

175
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,160
what you're doing.

176
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,310
Skipping work, huh?

177
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,800
No.

178
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,800
I really miss the time

179
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,870
when we just knew each other.

180
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,120
At that time, when you talked,

181
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,190
you weren't that straightforward.

182
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,830
Go back to work.

183
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,510
Come on,

184
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,630
Miss Xiang.

185
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,950
Now,

186
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,430
you've been wounded.

187
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,950
How about you stay here
for a few more days?

188
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,120
We have the hospitalization allowance.

189
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,630
300 yuan for a day.

190
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,120
It's wasteful if you turn down the money.

191
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,600
Am I right?

192
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,680
- Yeah.
- That's right.

193
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,630
As for business,

194
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,950
don't worry.

195
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,240
When I'm there,

196
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,830
our company won't fail.

197
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,070
Well,

198
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,390
I don't worry even if our company fails.

199
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,750
I just worry about what you could do

200
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,950
if our company fails.

201
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,390
What company

202
00:07:59,390 --> 00:07:59,920
could be so generous

203
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,600
that it can

204
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,920
hire you three again?

205
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,360
What was wrong

206
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,310
with the HR's mind?

207
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,310
Why didn't he

208
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,190
even recruit a circus monkey

209
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,120
that jumped through fire circles?

210
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,430
Am I right?

211
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,830
Am I?

212
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,800
Go, go, go.

213
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,480
- We should go, Miss Xiang.
- Bye-bye.

214
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,630
- Bye-bye.
- Boss, we should go.

215
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,240
Let's go, hurry.

216
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,000
You may go back, too.

217
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,120
I'm OK to be alone.

218
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,670
I think

219
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,960
we'd better hire a circus monkey

220
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,240
that jumps through fire circles.

221
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,750
We're crazy, anyway.

222
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,720
Why don't we make it worse?

223
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,240
(He indoctrinated me.)

224
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,080
It's occupied.

225
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,900
(Nurse Station)

226
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,030
The toilet is occupied.
I'm going to another one.

227
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,390
Today, it's your treat.

228
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,360
I want a Magnum.

229
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:01,750
OK.

230
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,550
If you're late tomorrow,

231
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,510
buy me a Haagen-Dazs.

232
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,870
Not a chance.

233
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,030
Based on your placement exam scores,

234
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,360
as long as you keep working hard,

235
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
you may go to Tsinghua University
on a recommendation.

236
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,360
When you came to high school,

237
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,670
you were exempted
from the entrance examination

238
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,480
as well as

239
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,630
all school fees.

240
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,440
We just want you

241
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,510
to study with no worries.

242
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,030
You have to work hard.

243
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,870
Thank you, sir. I will.

244
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,660
Mm.

245
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,390
Dad.

246
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,030
You're back?

247
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,790
Today, your school started.

248
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,600
I came back to check up on you.

249
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,480
How's everything?

250
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,030
Do you adapt to the new school?

251
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,750
What about you?

252
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,910
Money for your living expenses

253
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,270
of the following months.

254
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,480
Dad,

255
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,080
I don't need this much.

256
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,460
You...

257
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,030
Take it.

258
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,320
You look thinner.

259
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,790
Buy more food for yourself.

260
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,630
Yanshi,

261
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,750
I'm sorry.

262
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,510
Dad,

263
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,870
don't say that.

264
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,480
Fine. I won't.

265
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,200
Take good care of yourself.

266
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
I should go.

267
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,150
Oh,

268
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,270
if creditors come,

269
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,670
pretend you weren't home.

270
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,200
Don't give them the money.

271
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,960
Remember?

272
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,910
Yes.

273
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,550
Dad, leave.

274
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
Or they might see you.

275
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,550
Yanshi, what's up?

276
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,440
Ma'am,

277
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,550
take your money back.

278
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,910
Mr. Zhang.

279
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,080
It's the money we borrowed.

280
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,670
Exactly the number.

281
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,150
Take some oranges.

282
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,240
No, thanks.

283
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,120
- Just take some.
- No, thanks.

284
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,240
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

285
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,030
Sorry to have bothered you.

286
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,360
What a polite boy!

287
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,120
Come on. Enjoy the food and drink.

288
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,720
Excuse me, food for you.

289

OK, OK.

290
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,080

291
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,670

295
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,440
Roast the food on it.

296
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,550
One more drink. Come on.

297

298
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,390
OK, Boss.

299
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,240
Here, enjoy it.

300
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,270
Another food order.

301
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,200
Enjoy the food.

302
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,750
Come on. Drink more.

But don't tease me.

490
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,640
Because whenever you feel bad,

491
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,200
you play this game.

492
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,640

493
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:01,900

00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,830

511
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,590
When will my sweetheart talk to me?

512
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,200
Fighting someone is wrong.

513
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,310
I should apologize to her.

514
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,030
Apology makes me a good man.

515
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:59,350
Honey, I've got a cold.

516
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,420

520
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,000
Look at you.

521
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,350
Did you reject Xu Yanshi

522
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,240
or did he reject you?

523
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,480
Why do you look so dazed?

524
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,480
I'm a patient.

525
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:30,480
Sometimes,

526
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,110
I have a weak chest

527
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,000
and I feel dizzy.

528
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,200
That's very normal.

529
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,070
Come on.

530
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,680
You think I don't know you?

531
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,680
Do you think Xu Yanshi is

532
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,830
a heaven-sent jinx for you?

533
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,110
Not at all. An unlucky man like him

534
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,880
can't be heaven-sent.

535
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,680
Made sense.

536
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,200
Xu Yanshi

537
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,000
really has bad luck.

538
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,680
But over all these years,

539
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,830
it must be the first time

540
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,960
that he has been turned down.

541
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,160
When he rejected girls,

542
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,550
he was tough!

543
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,830
I really didn't expect this.

544
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:03,110
You made him meet his Waterloo!

545
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,680
In real life, how many men have you seen

546
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,200
who are hopeless romantics?

547
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,960
Xu Yanshi can't be one.

548
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,440
If I tell

549
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,200
Zhong Ling and the other girls

550
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,030
that Xu Yanshi confessed love to you

551
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:16,960
but you rejected him,

552
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,590
they would be pissed off!

553
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,830
Even thinking of it makes me excited!

554
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,640
Shall I ask our monitor

555
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,030
when the reunion can be held?

556
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,110
Gather all our classmates!

557
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:24,750
Every one of them!

558
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,440
Are you insane, Xu Yuan?

559
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,240
Why?

560
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,550
You have to keep this very secret.

561
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,640
Don't slip even a single word.

562
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,070
Or I would tell your father

563
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,070
you replaced his pomade with shoe polish

564
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,750
in your Grade 11.

565
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,880
It was your grandpa's shoe polish.

566
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,830
If you also want a beating,

567
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,510
tell him.

568
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,310
I just feel that

569
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,680
I don't know much about him.

570
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,070
Anyway,

571
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,880
I've never had a marriage plan.

572
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,720
This is OK with me.

573
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,110
Oh, I nearly forgot.

574
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,240
You're working in Velin

575
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,030
just to defend

576
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,830
your right to never get married.

577
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,030
That's right.

578
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,550
Why would a woman get married

579
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,590
or be in love?

580
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,640
A woman should be free!

581
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,070
It's getting late. I should go.

582
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,000
So, you specifically came

583
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,920
to pay me a visit?

584
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,720
Specifically?

585
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,960
No, I was sent for an interview.

586
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:20,960
By the way,

587
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,030
I have something to tell you.

588
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:22,790
Umm...

589
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:23,790
I'm getting married.

590
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,590
What?

591
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,960
Calm down. Calm down.

592
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,830
Don't be so excited.

593
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,880
The schedule isn't set yet.

594
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,030
I'll tell you after it's set.

595
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,310
Stay here for recuperation.

596
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:31,880
Wait.

597
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,590
Did someone just say

598
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,510
a woman should be free

599
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:39,200
and should defend her right?

600
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,640
Who said that?

601
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,590
Me.

602
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,960
You never play by the rules.

603
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,790
Now you know

604
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,030
why I never dared to let you count

605
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,590
when we played games in childhood, huh?

606
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,720
Well, your point is true.

607
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,960
But sometimes...

608
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,440
You know what?

609
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,640
It's good to have a man

610
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,310
and for example,

611
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,030
when you have no toilet paper,

612
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:58,680
you don't need to rush out for it.

613
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,880
Thank you.

614
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,070
But I have

615
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,160
a smart toilet.

616
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,160
It has hip cleaning and drying.

617
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,240
And negative-ion disinfection.

618
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,110
When something can be solved by money,

619
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,510
why would I need a man?

620
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,270
When were you in love? Who's he?

621
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:10,960
Have I met him before?

622
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,480
About this,

623
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,640
after you're back in Shanghai,

624
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,000
I'll tell you the whole story.

625
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,590
Wait.

626
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,640
Do you like him?

627
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,550
Yes, I guess.

628
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:24,160
What do you mean guess?

629
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,480
All right, honey.

630
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,640
I must draft the interview in the hotel.

631
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,590
Time's running out. I should go.

632
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,070
(How could I face you in the future?)

633
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,590
How's your relationship

634
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,590
with Li Chi?

635
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,200
I... I'm not sure.

636
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,310
Then do you know anything

637
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,720
about his private life?

638
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,310
No, I don't.

639
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,550
You can think about

640
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,840
whether he has some special hobbies

641
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,190
(Answer: No, I don't.)
in his daily life.

642
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,400
He's a nice man.

643
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,220
(Answer: He's a nice man.)

644
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,400
Oh, I got it!

645
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,320
He usually doesn't flush the toilet.

646
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,070
I'm not familiar with him.

647
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,840
(Answer: I'm not familiar with him.)
Are you familiar with Li Chi?

648
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,070
Not really.

649
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,360
OK. Thank you.

650
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,960
(Answer: Not really.)
Are you familiar with him?

651
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,510
Li Chi, I mean.

652
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:31,880
Not very familiar.

653
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,030
Honey.

654
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,400
Honey, Honey.

655
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,480
I bought you

656
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,840
your favorite sandwich.

657
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,190
Honey,

658
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,320
stop being mad at me, OK?

659
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,280
I'm begging you.

660
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,230
Some bacon in it.

661
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,400
Smells great, Honey.

662
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,000
Honey, listen.

663
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,760
I know I was wrong.

664
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,190
I...

665
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,000
Honey, you... you laughed.

666
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,030
No.

667
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,760
Honey, I know I was wrong.

668
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,630
I was just thinking even if

669
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,320
I had to resign,

670
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:05,920
I wouldn't let

671
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,800
that guy bully you!

672
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,440
Right?

673
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,150
I wouldn't do

674
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,280
that kind of childish thing again.

675
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,480
I swear!

676
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,670
Give me a second chance, will you?

677
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,230
Fine.

678
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,550
Depends on your behavior.

679
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,190
Umm...

680
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,110
Honey.

681
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,160
Here.

682
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:33,960
Honey,

683
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,320
you read my text?

684
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,630
You even bought me the medicine.

685
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,280
You're always the best.

686
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,360
Here, Honey.

687
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,280
The milk tea I bought you.

688
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,230
I queued for two hours

689
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,070
before I got it.

690
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,030
It tastes great.

691
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,280
You want me to get fat?

692
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,920
It just tastes great. Try some.

693
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,760
(Velin)
The woman was way too merciless.

694
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,510
The man loved her so much,

695
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,920
but she rejected him.

696
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,840
The man used to be

697
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,320
Prince Charming in high school.

698
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,480
Doesn't she know

699
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,840
her own condition?

700
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,630
You know what? I read the novel.

701
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,480
The man even killed himself for her.

702
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,190
He did?

703
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:12,070
Yeah. I'm so speechless.

704
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,670
What a ridiculous script!

705
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,360
The man is handsome, anyway.

706
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,320
Just bear it.

707
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,920
Zhang... Zhang Jun,

708
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,590
where's Boss?

709
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,550
I don't know.

710
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,760
Hasn't arrived yet, I guess.

711
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,400
(Why hasn't Xu Yanshi come yet?)

712
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,230
(He can't be that fragile, can he?)

713
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,960
(He always has bad luck.)

714
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,110
(After being struck too many times,)

715
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,400
(he should be having)

716
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,440
(a strong mental endurance.)

717
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,400
(That's it.)

718
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:39,550
Mental endurance is

719
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:40,710
quite hard to be predicted.

720
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,400
How do you know

721
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,150
whether it's the last straw for him?

722
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,230
Maybe it is. Who knows?

723
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:09,000
(Why doesn't Xu Yanshi answer it?)

724
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,510
Aren't you going out?

725
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,960
Yes, for some shopping.

726
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,740
(Leader of the Other Group)

727
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,820
(Missed
Xiang Yuan)

728
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,400
I accidentally silenced it.

729
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,360
What did you want me for?

730
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,840
Did someone bully you?

731
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,070
(I must have lost my mind.)

732
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,320
(I'm sure I stayed too long)

733
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,480
(with Gao Leng and his teammates,)

734
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,480
(so that I got silly, too.)

735
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,280
No. I just wanted you

736
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,280
to bring me something.

737
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:03,030
(Can it be that thing?)

738
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,110
What brand?

739
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,030
What?

740
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,110
The brand.

741
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,320
I'll buy it for you later.

742
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,590
You weren't bullied

743
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:17,480
but your eyes are red.

744
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,000
Are you having your period?

745
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,760
No, no. I...

746
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,920
I just wanted you

747
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,960
to buy a cup of coffee for me.

748
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,840
With sugar and without milk.

749
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,510
Thank you.

750
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,230
Mm.

751
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:32,920
I'm going to Li Yongbiao

752
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,710
to report from my leave.

753
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,360
Then I'll go buy it for you.

754
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,440
Li Chi quite surprised us.

755
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,480
He appeared to be close to Ying Yinyin,

756
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,630
but behind everyone's back,

757
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,230
he's kept a dubious relationship

758
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,880
with Chen Shu of the sales department.

759
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,480
He has one-sided love, I guess.

760
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,440
In a love case,

761
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,320
it always takes two.

762
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,880
There must be something between them.

763
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,230
Also,

764
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,550
when the police asked for information,

765
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:14,000
who dared to speak of him?

766
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,590
That's understandable.

767
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,360
Considering his temper,

768
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,070
who dares to tell on him

769
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,030
to the police?

770
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,880
Last time, someone

771
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,840
told on him to Mr. Li

772
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,550
that he sneaked out to a gym

773
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:25,960
during work hours.

774
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,760
Oh, come on.

775
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,510
When he knew it,

776
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,590
he rushed to beat that man.

777
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:31,440
How fierce! No one messes with him.

778
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,000
Anyway,

779
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,150
this case

780
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,590
isn't finalized yet.

781
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:38,000
If anyone spoke ill of him

782
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,630
and he still worked here,

783
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,320
he'd certainly take revenge.

784
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:42,670
Look.

785
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,360
Li Yongbiao upstairs...

786
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,840
He didn't dare to come,

787
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,510
in case the police interrogated him.

788
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,960
What a coward he is!

789
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,920
What are you talking about?

790
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,880
Miss Xiang.

791
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:54,840
Be seated, please.

792
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,510
Guys,

793
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,590
is anyone of you

794
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:57,400
familiar with Li Chi?

795
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,710
Officer,

796
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,840
I'm Xiang Yuan,

797
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,710
leader of Technical Group II.

798
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,590
Ask me.

799
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,840
OK. Come in, please.

800
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,630
You can sit there.

801
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,550
Tell us something.

802
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,150
Li Chi is a member of my group.

803
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,030
He's always sluggish.

804
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,000
But as far as I know him,

805
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,950
- I don't think he would do that.
- Yuan is in there for the inquiry.

806
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:31,480
Li Chi's condition...

807
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,110
At work,

808
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:33,800
how's he doing?

809
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,480
He always comes late but leaves early.

810
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:37,230
Does he have

811
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,230
some friends of the opposite sex?

812
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,960
I don't know.

813
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,710
Then tell us

814
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,710
all that you know.

815
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,670
Girl, don't worry.

816
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,670
We'll try our best to save your father.

817
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,630
Hope you can cooperate

818
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,510
and tell us all that you know.

819
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:13,920
Miss Xiang?

820
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,440
Are you OK?

821
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,230
Hello, officers.

822
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,960
I'm Xu Yanshi,

823
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,670
the team leader of
the technical department.

824
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,440
If you want to know something,

825
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,320
ask me.

826
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:12,230
Fine.

827
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,710
Let's continue.

828
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:16,150
Anything special about Li Chi lately?

829
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,440
No.

830
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,760
He doesn't care too much

831
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,710
about his work.

832
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,760
At work, he goes to gyms.
After work, he goes to pubs.

833
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,960
That's mostly his condition.

834
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,440
Who's the woman

835
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,440
in the posted photo?

836
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,400
Chen Shu,

837
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,280
director of the sales department.

838
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,480
Miss Xiang, you're also a woman.

839
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,710
Are you familiar with her?

840
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:34,400
Do you know her relationship

841
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,880
with Li Chi?

842
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,400
Miss Xiang is new here

843
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,880
and she doesn't know too many employees.

844
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,840
Ask me instead.

845
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,480
Chen Shu is my colleague's girlfriend.

846
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,880
Usually, she doesn't talk too much

847
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,590
to Li Chi.

848
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,710
Li Chi is aggressive

849
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,760
but straightforward.

850
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,590
He didn't actually harass Chen Shu.

851
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,150
Miss Xiang, did you see him
enter the ladies' room?

852
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:05,400
She didn't.

853
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:06,880
You even know that?

854
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:13,800
Excuse me.

855
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:17,230
It's me.

856
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,880
I'm in Velin.

857
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,710
What?

858
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,280
You found him?

859
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:24,110
It's really him?

860
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,480
I see.

861
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,400
OK.

862
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,710
Your colleague is no longer

863
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,670
the suspect.

864
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:33,190
It's the maintenance man

865
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:34,190
who was caught two months ago.

866
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:34,510
He often

867
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:36,630
installed cameras

868
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:37,920
in public ladies' rooms

869
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,630
in the name of repairing pipes.

870
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:39,510
A recidivist.

871
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,230
The surveillance video also captured him

872
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:42,400
entering the ladies' room.

873
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:43,480
You can stop worrying.

874
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:44,670
I knew it.

875
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,760
Our team member

876
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,840
couldn't be

877
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,710
this wicked.

878
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,960
If we need something else,

879
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,230
we'll contact you.

880
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:52,840
OK?

881
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,190
Fine. We should go.

882
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:55,710
Thanks.

883
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,800
Here's your coffee.

884
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:22,510
How much is it?

885
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:23,480
I'll transfer it to you.

886
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,110
Don't bother.

887
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:27,510
I can afford a cup of coffee

888
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:29,000
for the girl I love.

889
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:30,590
I'm not that stingy.

890
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,440
I... I don't mean that.

891
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,400
What happened to you just now?

892
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:37,590
Do you know

893
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:38,920
you nearly fainted?

894
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:41,800
You just got out of the hospital.

895
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:42,480
Don't you know

896
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,710
your own health condition?

897
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,630
Why did you stand out

898
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:47,550
for everything?

899
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:50,630
Take the coffee.
