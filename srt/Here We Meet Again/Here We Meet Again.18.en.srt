You look great.

31
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,430
The hairstyle and the dress.

32
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,400
So beautiful.

33
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,280
I barely

34
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,840
got into

35
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,920
this dress.

Loveliness is not an easy thing

37
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,910
for all the women.

38
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,310
Was Xu Yanshi's suit

39
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,800
prepared by you?

40
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,120
Did he wear it?

41
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,360
Yes, it's obviously a premium suit.

42
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,840
Don't tell me

43
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,470
it's brand sponsorship.

44
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,840
Our company

45
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,870
has never cooperated

46
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,630
with such a brand.

47
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,840
You have your ways.

48
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,120
Tonight,

49
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,240
if we can get

50
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,680
more new clients,

51
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,190
then the next year

52
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,800
could be easier for us.

53
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,520
Yes, we'll complete the mission.

54
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:42,800
Let's go.

55
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,560
Please, princess.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,560
Hello, every God of Wealth.

58
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,750
Sorry.

59
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,280
Let's forget it,

60
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,470
and start it over. OK?

61
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,120
Distinguished leaders,

62
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,710
ladies and gentlemen,

63
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,280
good evening.

00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,700
(Velin New Product Launch of 2019)

65
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,740
(Velin Technology Product Launch)

66
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,560
Welcome to

67
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,750
Velin's

68
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,000
new product launch conference.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,120
I am the host, Xiang Yuan.

70
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,560
The conference today

71
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,000
will be concise.

72
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,710
We would report

73
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,590
what Velin has done

74
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,310
this year

75
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:55,870
and

76
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,560
what we will do

77
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,030
next year.

78
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,910
The theme is

79
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,150
to introduce

80
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,470
our new system,

81
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,910
Velin Cargo Link Navigation System.

82
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,150
Hope we can

83
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,400
establish cooperation relationship

84
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,310
to reach a win-win situation.

85
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:08,870
We're looking forward to your new orders.

86
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,470
Yeah. Certainly.

87
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,750
If you only want to

88
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,630
watch the new product launch,

89
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,510
it's OK.

90
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,480
That part will

91
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
be at 8:00 PM

92
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,950
tonight.

93
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,560
If you are hungry,

94
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,000
you can go to have dinner first,

95
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,950
and come back later.

96
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,040
Next,

97
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,310
let's welcome

98
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,510
Velin's general manager,

99
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,560
Mr. Li Yongbiao,

100
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,870
for a speech.

101
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,240
Hello, I am Li Yongbiao.

102
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,830
(Velin is)

103
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,390
(a high-tech enterprise)

104
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,310
- (dealing with)
- Great.

105
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,270
(vehicle navigation.)

106
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,920
The concept

107
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,800
that we've been following is

108
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,430
honesty, reflection,

109
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,630
teamwork, pragmatism,

110
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,800
and innovation.

111
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,870
- (To boost)
- Look.

112
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,800
(the smart...)

113
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,600
The hot atmosphere you made

114
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,040
was all gone.

115
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,190
(...the duty for a wonderful smart life,)

116
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,510
(we persist in the strategy)

117
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,160
(of professional talent development.)

118
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,070
(We've built)

119
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,870
- (a talent team)
- So handsome, right?

120
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,870
(of high quality)

121
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,510
I'm not exaggerating.

122
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,270
with a wide vision

123
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,800
and excellent knowledge.

124
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,310
Today, we are honored

125
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,510
to invite

126
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,510
(the guests)

127
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,950
(from the industry here.)

128
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,560
This speech is so boring.

129
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,390
When can he stop?

130
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,390
(Thank you sincerely)

131
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,510
He is so verbose.

132
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,750
(for your recognition)

133
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,600
(and support to Velin.)

134
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,190
(It's your support)

135
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,190
(which makes Velin)

136
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,870
(develop rapidly.)

137
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,830
(To further meet)

138
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,680
clients' requirements

139
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,630
in an all-round way...

140
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,510
Who wrote the speech

141
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,190
for Li Yongbiao?

142
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,510
It's too official.

143
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,630
If he goes on like this,

144
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,000
I guess

145
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,480
guests will all leave.

146
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,190
I don't know.

147
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,950
It wasn't written by me.

148
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,800
(...the result of joint efforts...)

149
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,190
Are you nervous?

150
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,360
(It also depends on)

151
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,120
(the trust,)

152
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,950
- It's fine.
- (support, help, and recognition)

153
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,360
(from our partners.)

154
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,270
Hereby,

155
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,070
on behalf of Velin,

156
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:17,630
It's so long.

157
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,040
(I'd like to thank you again...)

158
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:20,680
What should we do?

159
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,830
He hasn't finished.

160
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,240
I haven't gone up yet.

161
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,510
(Today...)

162
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,000
Forget it.

163
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,040
Start the livestreaming now.

164
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,750
(...Velin's technical achievements.)

165
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,160
Hello, guys.

166
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,390
We'll start livestreaming now.

167
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,160
Let me show you

168
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,240
the site here.

169
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,630
(Karma hasn't livestreamed
for half a month.)

170
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,360
(It's obviously not Karma.)

171
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,560
(But this man is so handsome!)

172
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,360
(Gosh.)

173
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:44,750
(Wasn't this suit)

174
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,630
(worn by Xiao Ran)

175
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,830
- (for the event the other day?)
- What?

176
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,600
(It looks great on him.)

177
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,950
(In the cooperation in previous years,)

178
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,450
(I believe you've seen...)

179
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,240
Is this your fan?

180
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,680
(At the end of the world,
the light shines,)

181
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,390
(and the sea rolls.)

182
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,870
(I'm always by your side.)

183
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,720
(When stars fall)

184
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,240
(and mountains collapse,)

185
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,830
(I will still back you up.)

186
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,560
Delicious.

187
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,000
The sense of happiness.

188
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,270
(Velin can do more.)

189
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,000
(It will)

190
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,560
(bring more surprises)

191
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,040
(to you.)

192
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,680
Good.

193
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,000
Good food and good drinks.

194
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,390
Double happiness.

195
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,480
Does anyone find that

196
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,560
the owner of this account is from Donghe?

197
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,360
I think...

198
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,630
That's it.

199
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,750
It means our disguise succeeded.

200
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,720
He's obviously from Donghe.

201
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,830
This account was registered today.

202
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,750
Definitely.

203
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,390
He couldn't even

204
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,950
tell Xu Yanshi from me.

205
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,310
But

206
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,720
no one seems

207
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,120
to care

208
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,750
if you have shown up.

209
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,750
(Yes. Target him tonight.)

210
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,270
(After all, he's a rare handsome boy.)

211
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,830
(That cuff button is so gentle.)

212
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,000
(Why does it)

213
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,720
(look like a pair)

214
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,750
(with the lady's necklace?)

215
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,680
(It's the same for a company.)

216
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,160
(The person in charge can't)

217
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,630
(finish a project alone.)

218
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
(The success of a project)

219
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,800
(relies on)

220
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,390
I'm going up there.

221
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,120
(every one of us.)

222
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,040
(We can always)

223
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,560
(see Karma playing...)

224
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,630
(Why is he leaving?)

225
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,680
(I want to see that boy.)

226
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,240
Looks like

227
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,680
people have forgotten you.

228
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,270
I don't care.

229
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,040
They are paid supporters.

230
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,270
Of course they care about him.

231
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,630
I'm going to talk with Xiang Yuan.

232
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,600
(I promise)

233
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,190
(our team...)

234
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,360
When I go to the stage,

235
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,480
turn this on.

236
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,120
Then... Look at this.

237
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,080
Hello, are you Miss Xiang?

238
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,080
You go ahead.

239
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,270
OK.

240
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,750
Please go to the prop room

241
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,960
and check the props.

242
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,030
Where?

243
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,600
Go out of this door and turn right.

244
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
You can see it.

245
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,200
Thanks.

246
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:47,870
I have something to do.

247
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,790
I gotta go.

248
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,220
(Prop Room)

249
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,670
Hello?

250
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,790
Xiang Yuan.

251
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,390
Why are you here?

252
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,750
Miss.

253
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,720
I know you want to be on the headline.

254
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,840
But you should consider

255
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,840
my feelings.

256
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,150
People all praise

257
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,630
that handsome boy in my channel.

258
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm losing face.

259
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,480
Handsome boy?

260
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,000
Xu Yanshi?

261
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,750
Or who?

262
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,870
Someone even

263
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,240
recognized him as me

264
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,550
and said I had plastic surgery.

265
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,960
I'm sorry for this.

266
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,030
How about

267
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,870
I treat you

268
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,750
to dinner in Shanghai?

269
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,870
Alright. Alright.

270
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,750
It's locked.

271
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,080
What time is it?

272
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,120
7:35 PM.

273
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,600
Where's your phone?

274
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,150
It's livestreaming.

275
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:11,140
(Under renovation. Do not enter.)

276
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,510
(Now)

277
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,030
(I can feel)

278
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,440
Who wrote the speech for Li Yongbiao?

279
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,150
(that this is the time for us.)

280
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,910
Not me.

281
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,080
Was it written by you?

282
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,120
We should warm up

283
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,390
for the game at 7:30 PM.

284
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,600
Where are they?

285
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,720
(The future market)

286
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,320
(belongs to everyone here.)

287
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,120
(I have witnessed)

288
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,350
Boss, someone is calling you.

289
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,150
(the growth of our company.)

290
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,360
- OK. I'll go.
- Goodbye.

291
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,480
(We've experienced ups and downs.)

292
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,150
Can you make a call

293
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,080
to Xiang Yuan?

294
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,390
Her phone is here.

295
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,440
Where are they then?

296
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,840
Don't worry.

297
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,840
I'm going to ask Chen Shu.

298
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,320
OK.

299
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,030
(Velin will have a wonderful future)

300
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,150
Where is Xiang Yuan?

301
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,030
(with the joint efforts of everyone.)

302
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,240
(At last,)

303
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,120
(thank you)

304
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,480
(to come to this conference.)

305
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,080
(Thank you.)

306
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,150
Mr. Li.

307
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,750
Mr. Li.

308
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,390
Something went wrong behind the stage.

309
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,080
Can you stall

310
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,720
for more time?

311
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,440
Well,

312
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,000
I forgot

313
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,080
the most important thing.

314
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,550
Miss Xiang is missing.

315
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,360
(I'd like to introduce you)

316
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,910
(the members)

317
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,750
(of Velin.)

318
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,550
We are going to look for Miss Xiang.

319
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,360
Let's look for her separately.

320
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,380
(Velin New Product Launch of 2019)

321
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,550
Is the livestreaming stuck?

322
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,630
No.

323
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,720
Where are they then?

324
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,720
Where is Karma?

325
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,200
Yuan hasn't been there

326
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,320
for a long time.

327
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,910
Please wait.

328
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,200
I'm calling to confirm.

329
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,600
(And our deputy general manager,)

330
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,870
(Ms. Li Qin.)

331
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,240
(She is beautiful and talented.)

332
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,390
Let me show you

333
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,390
the power of Donghe.

334
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,320
(The pillar of the company.)

335
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,240
(Hearts)
(We also have other...)

336
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,240
(We are advancing with the times.)

337
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,120
Sir.

338
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,080
Yuan seems to be missing there.

339
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,120
Who?

340
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,000
Yuan is missing.

341
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,750
What?

342
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,600
Xiang Yuan. Xiang Yuan.

343
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,200
- Sorry... Sorry.
- You're a pervert!

344
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,000
Get out!

345
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,910
OK. I'm getting out.

346
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,000
No.

347
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,200
- No... No.
- Are you mad?

348
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,700
(Under renovation. Don't enter)

349
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,510
Xu Yanshi.

350
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,120
How is it?

351
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,720
7:50 PM.

352
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,000
Well...

353
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,670
I'm going to look for them again.

354
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,510
We've checked

355
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,910
where we could.

356
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,870
At 8:00 PM,

357
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,150
Xiang Yuan should

358
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,200
show the navigation system on stage.

359
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,720
That's the focus of the conference.

360
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,960
If it goes like this,

361
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,150
clients will think

362
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,510
something is wrong with the conference.

363
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,150
Xiang Yuan's efforts can't be in vain.

364
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,790
What should we do then?

365
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,030
I'll stall for time.

366
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,670
Where is Miss Xiang?

367
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,240
Isn't she back?

368
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:30,960
Did you find her?

369
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,480
No. Where is she?

370
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,910
What should we do?

371
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,080
And the technical department

372
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,720
that I'm in charge of...

373
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,240
I hope you like

374
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,200
the big family of Velin more and more.

375
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
Thanks.

376
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,630
- Boss.
- Boss. Boss.

377
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,380
♪It's the day we've been traveling♪

378
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,360
♪It's the day we do happy things♪

379
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,870
Are you ready?

380
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,910
Who said

381
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,630
you wouldn't see Karma

382
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,120
and want to see this boy?

383
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,790
(Velin)
I got him here for you.

384
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,200
(Here I am! Here I am! Great!)

385
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,240

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,590
very interested in one question.

601
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,550

"will that Down

For me,

Down has become the past.

606
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,720
I quit the circle

607
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,200
because I found

608
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,720
what I really wanted to do.

609
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,350

610
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,110

615
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,920
Was it thrilling

616
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,110
to watch King D play games?

617
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,550
Yes.

618
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,200
Yes.

619
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:26,960
Yes.

620
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,550
I'd like to ask,

621
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,310
do you want to see

622
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,720

623
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,960
designed by King D?

624
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,440
Yes.

625
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,480
Let me ask first.

626
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,790
- Who are...
- Go. Go. Go.

Please raise your hand.

629
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,960
I'm an online shopper anyway.

630
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,960
Looks like there are many people.

631
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,830
So, the term logistics

632
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,720
is not strange

633
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,200
to you.

634
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,510
Because this traditional industry

635
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,310
is no longer

636
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,640
only bound to factories.

637
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,880
It is related to

638
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,750
every detail

639
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,240
of our life.

640
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,830
(15 million+ trucks, 30 million+ drivers)
As of last year,

641
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,550
there were about fifteen million
cargo trucks

642
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,440
in our country,

643
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:01,270
and about thirty million truck drivers.

644
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,510
With the rapid development

645
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,440
of internet,

646
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,070
these two numbers

647
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,400
are still rising.

648
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,350
Now I'd like to tell you,

649
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,830
our company Velin

650
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,680
has conducted a large number of
vehicle tests,

651
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,350
algorithm development,

652
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,930
- and data research.
- She's good.

653
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,240
We finally completed

654
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,030
the cargo link big data platform

655
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,270
which combines Internet
and freight together.

656
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,030
- The efficiency is improved,
- It's not bad, right?

657
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,200
- and the cost is reduced in logistics.
- Not bad.

658
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,790
It finally realizes

659
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,400

662
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,070
Next,

663
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,240
we'll see a map

664
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,030

685
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,310
can greatly decrease

the accident rate

687
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,030
and ensure the safety

692
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,920
has developed for a long time

693
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,640
and finally

694
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,440
presents you

695

this promising system.

696
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,590
Maybe this is a small thing

in the long history,

698
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,400
but it is a big step for Velin

699

Look. Look.

769
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,740
(Crossfire. Ranking:
1 Down 2 Flying High)

770
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,750
No.

771
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,400
I feel

772
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,110
Flying High was bullied.

773
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,550
Get his QQ to me.

774
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:14,960
Hurry.

775
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,160
Why?

776
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,030
He's obviously

777
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,640
coming for you.

778
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,200
I...

779
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,440
If he bullies Flying High,

780
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,510
I will kill him.

781
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,310
(Don't go too far.)

782
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,160
(If you bully my friend,)

783
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,960

787
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,550
Wait. Wait.

788
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,920
(Don't tell me)

789
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,000
(the competition
between you and Flying High)

790
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,960
(is a coincidence.)

791

(Down)

793
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,440

794
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,400
(Hello? Can anyone carry me?)

795
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,590

(Down)
(Yes.)

800
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,030
I thought he'd beat you.

801
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:17,880
It turns out that

802
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,880
he woos you.

803
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,030
Maybe he just thought

804
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,640
I talked too harshly.

805
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,110

(You're exposed.)

806
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,200

810
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:00,900
Yeah.

(Save time.)

825
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,510

826
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,820
(Yes.)

827
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,880

833
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:26,790
Xu Yuan.

834
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,030
Yes.

835
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:28,680
What's wrong?

836
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,720
What's wrong?

837
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,110
Is that girl dead?

838
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,510
Right.

839
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:43,680
(Sorry.)

You really like him?

845
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,070
I don't know.

959

(Where are you?)

960
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,070

963
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,590

964
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,960
(Sorry.)

965
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,320

966
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,550

967
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,670
(Go to do it if you're busy.)

968
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,840
(See you next time.)

969
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,440
(I couldn't)

970
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,360
(get through to him.)

971
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,630
(Was the signal bad?)

972
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,710
(Yes. Definitely.)

973
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,110
Why are you sitting here quietly?

974
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,880
I was scared to death.

975
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,480
You haven't been out all day.

976
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,880
Are you hungry?

977
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,230
I can buy you some food.

978
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,710
Did you break up?

979
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,510
I don't know.

980
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,880
Don't you know?

981
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,190
Are you in love or not?

982
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,590
Yeah.

983
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,030
Even if we break up,

984
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:58,840
he must say it face to face.

985
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,550

986
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,630
(I don't know)

987
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,070

988
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,840
(but I could feel)

989
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,760
(your change.)

990
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,670

994
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,800
Can't he forget

995
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,400
that girl?

996
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,550
