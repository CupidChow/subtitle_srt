Xu Yanshi,

30
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,480
what do you

31
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,790
use for laundry?

32
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,840
Ordinary soup.

33
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,280
It smells good

34
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,430
like the smell of the air

35
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,480
after rain.

36
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,070
Where are you going?

37
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,510
Go eat hot pot.

38
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,120
Great.

39
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,070
Why don't you invite me?

40
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:07,950
Let's go together.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,630
I only invited Xu Yanshi.

42
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,430
It's none of your business.

43
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,030
Come on, we are buddies.

44
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,870
Xiang Yuan,

45
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,710
where is your bike?

46
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,120
Don't you ride it

47
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,400
to school every day?

48
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,960
My...

49
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,030
My bike has a flat tire.

50
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,800
Xu Yanshi, hurry up.

51
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,520
Ignore him.

52
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,680
It's hurtful.

53
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,470
Let's go together.

54
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,800
It's really hurtful.

55
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,120
- Could you give me a lift regularly?
- Wait for me.

56
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,680
Wait for me.

57
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,080
No.

58
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,750
Petty.

59
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,150
You've really hurt my feelings.

60
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,360
After eating hot pot here

61
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,590
at noon,

62
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,000
we have to get back to school.

63
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,680
Why don't we

64
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,560
come after school?

65
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,840
Why do you come with us?

66
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,310
Do you know how to

67
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,750
achieve what one wishes?

68
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,590
To achieve what one wishes,

69
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,590
one should satisfy

70
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,680
his current wish without stalling.

71
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,150
For example, if I want to eat hot pot,

72
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,360
I eat it immediately.

73
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
If I want to see a movie,

74
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,800
I see it right away.

75
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,590
The dessert I want

76
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,680
is right in the fridge.

77
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,000
If I want to have fun in the morning,

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,310
I won't wait until the evening.

79
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,360
And...

80
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,520
And my English exam,

81
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,310
I can pass it if I want to.

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,120
So,

83
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,120
if I want to eat hot pot,

84
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,280
I'll eat at once.

85
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,150
Cheers.

86
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,560
To the noon and hot pot.

87
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,960
That's absurd.

88
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:38,840
Cheers.

89
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,710
Wish you achieve what you wish.

90
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,080
I have to use the bathroom.

91
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,150
You're high-maintenance.

92
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,000
Thank you.

93
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,120
This is the last gift

94
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,030
my grandma left me
before she passed away.

95
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,840
It's important to me.

96
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,830
Xu Yanshi.

97
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,920
Could you

98
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,510
put it on me?

99
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,680
Be careful next time.

100
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,950
Don't drop it again.

101
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,510
OK.

102
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,630
It should be OK.

103
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,510
Xu Yanshi.

104
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,750
Is he still tutoring you?

105
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,070
Your grades have

106
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,830
improved greatly.

107
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,000
Have you thanked him?

108
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,000
My birthday is coming soon.

109
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,830
I'll invite him

110
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,000
to my birthday party

111
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,630
and surprise him.

112
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,070
I've prepared a gift

113
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,070
to thank him.

114
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,680
It's too much.

115
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,950
What is it?

116
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,360
A gift has something to do with him.

117
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,630
Xu Yanshi.

118
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,430
What?

119
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,390
Nothing.

120
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,000
Tomorrow is my birthday.

121
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,360
I want to invite you

122
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,310
to my birthday party.

123
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,120
Will you come?

124
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,480
OK.

125
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,390
I'll go.

126
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,040
It's a deal, then.

127
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,720
Deal.

128
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,270
Xiang Yuan.

129
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,510
Xiang Yuan. Xiang Yuan.

130
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,070
Someone bought you a cake.

131
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,560
(How to achieve what one wishes?)

132
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,120
(One should satisfy)

133
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,120
(his current wish without stalling.)

134
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,560
(If I want to eat hot pot,
I eat it immediately.)

135
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,160
(If I want to see a movie,)

136
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,390
(I see it right away.)

137
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,870
(And...)

138
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,630
It's you.

139
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,070
What's that reaction?

140
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,000
I select this for you

141
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
elaborately.

142
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,070
It's too extravagant.

143
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:11,870
Didn't we agree to

144
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,070
celebrate in my house tonight?

145
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,360
Don't you like a jolly time?

146
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,240
I want to celebrate for you

147
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,120
with the class first.

148
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,390
It's for everyone.

149
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,000
- Good.
- Great.

150
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,040
Xu Yanshi.

151
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,190
Happy birthday.

152
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,070
Thanks.

153
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,160
Xiang Yuan,

154
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,950
I bought you the cake.

155
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,510
Why do you give him

156
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,480
the first piece?

157
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,430
I'll transfer the money to you later.

158
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,750
Are you leaving?

159
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,000
I have to prepare for
the physics competition.

160
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,950
I have to go.

161
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,830
So,

162
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,270
will you come to
my birthday party tonight?

163
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,750
No.

164
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,480
Xu Yanshi.

165
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,160
Do you really not come to
my birthday party,

166
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,390
Xu Yanshi?

167
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,390
No, sorry.

168
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,270
(Xu Yanshi,)

169
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,870
(we can't always)

170
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,630
(satisfy what we wish in life.)

171
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,080
(Besides my parents,)

172
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,080
(you were the first)

173
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,550
(to teach me the truth.)

174
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,750
Then may all your wishes come true.

175
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,840
Thanks.

176
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,320
Thanks for your sauce

177
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,480
and the crayfish.

178
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,910
And,

179
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,440
thanks for remembering that.

180
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,720
But there was another thing

181
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,960
I didn't understand.

182
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,480
Back then,

183
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,000
you agreed to

184
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,910
go to my house and

185
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,960
celebrate my birthday.

186
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,670
But the next day,

187
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,320
you suddenly became cold to me.

188
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,600
And you transferred unexpectedly.

189
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,600
Did anything happen?

190
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,630
Or did you

191
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,630
really not want to see me?

192
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,630
You came here to dig up the past.

193
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,510
Don't blame that on me.

194
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,550
I said I didn't want to come,

195
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,030
but someone insisted that I should come.

196
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,390
OK.

197
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,320
I deserve it.

198
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,000
But I have a question for you.

199
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,080
Why did you join Velin?

200
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,720
And why haven't you left?

201
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,870
Then why would you

202
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,000
stay in the company?

203
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,750
Since when have you

204
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,960
become so aspiring?

205
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,720
Just assume that

206
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,550
I'm here

207
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,390
to

208
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,200
change my life like you guys.

209
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,790
Just like us?

210
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,870
Is there anything about you

211
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,870
unlike us?

212
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,200
Of course not...

213
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,630
Don't split hairs, will you?

214
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,790
Anyway, let's

215
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,870
disregard our previous enmity,

216
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,480
and let go of all the unpleasant past.

217
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,960
New identity.

218
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,200
Let's have a fresh start.

219
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,120
Hello.

220
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,030
I'm the team leader
of Technical Group II,

221
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,870
Xiang Yuan.

222
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,120
Childish.

223
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,360
Xu Yanshi.

224
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,560

Mr. Li.

230
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,120
Are you OK?

231
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,910
You scared me.

232
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,550
Have you started to practice again?

233
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,550
What can I do for you?

234
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,480
I came to ask you

235
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,960
for Xu Yanshi's files.

236
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,000
All the personnel files

237
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,910
are kept at the headquarters.

238
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,630
Please sit down.

239
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
The headquarters?

240
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,550
Sit. Sit.

241
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,320
No, thanks.

242
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,840
Xiang,

243
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,630
why do you want

244
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,750
Xu Yanshi's files?

245
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,550
Do you want to study him?

246
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,910
Xu Yanshi is different from you.

247
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,750
His job is his major.

248
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,840
Let me put it this way.

249
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,240
Xu Yanshi

250
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,440
has the final say
in the technical department.

251
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,670
Even the director of the department

252
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,630
doesn't know.

253
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,240
Xiang,

254
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,790
now you're in the new surroundings.

255
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,910
As a newcomer,

256
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,320
first of all,

257
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,550
you should learn

258
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,150
how to fit in.

259
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,120
The technical department

260
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,720
is dominated by a bunch of guys.

261
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,870
They are young.

262
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,080
It's normal that

263
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,960
they don't think much of you.

264
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,270
Is that so?

265
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,000
If you ask me,

266
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,360
except for Xu Yanshi,

267
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,480
they don't think much of anybody.

268
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,720
I'm the general manager,

269
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,600
but they don't think much of me, either.

270
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,550
If I wasn't the one

271
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,510
who decided their salaries,

272
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,150
you know,

273
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,600
they would post harsh comments on me

274
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,750
in their Moments.

275
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,270
I see.

276
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,480
I'll ask the headquarters for his files.

277
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,670
Xiang...

278
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,300
(Register of Employee's Personnel File)

279
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,540
(Employee's Curriculum Vitae Xu Yanshi)

280
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,630
(Graduated from Caiyu Middle School.)

281
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,000
(Undergraduate of Wuqing University.)

282
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,240
(Joined Velin Technology.)

283
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,390
(There isn't any problem.)

284
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,670
Thank you, Mr. Li.

285
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,910
Anything else?

286
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,440
You need to replace your clubs.

287
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,670
Will do.

288
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,270
See you.

289
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,120
(What connections)

290
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,510
(does this princess have?)

291
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,910
Have you noticed

292
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:07,750
Li Yongbiao's outfit today?

293
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,360
What?

294
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,550
The other managers
all wear designer clothes.

295
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,480
But Li

296
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:14,200
wears such lame outfit,

297
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,750
making him like a president
of low quality.

298
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,510
Exactly.

299
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,080
(Apposite.)

300
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,440
Do you know

301
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,840
what's going on

302
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,720
with Li Chi and Ying Yinyin?

303
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,910
They often go out together

304
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,440
these two weeks.

305
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,600
Yinyin didn't say anything to me.

306
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,630
I guess they had a fight

307
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,600
and then they made it up.

308
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,150
But it doesn't matter.

309
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,320
What matters is that

310
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,720
the two from the technical group
are dating.

311
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,870
Technical group?

312
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,910
Who?

313
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,630
Xu Yanshi and the newcomer...

314
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,720
What's her name?

315
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,750
Zhao Yuan.

316
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,320
Xu Yanshi?

317
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,480
- Unbelievable.
- (Are you kidding me?)

318
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,870
I thought he was gay.

319
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,080
He looks aloof.

320
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,080
That's not true.

321
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,630
Yinyin told me

322
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,630
when she was a newcomer here,

323
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,390
she asked Xu Yanshi to a movie.

324
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,150
He can only fool those rookies.

325
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,080
All the veterans

326
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,480
have got him taped.

327
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,440
Sure.

328
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,670
His younger brother is a drag on him.

329
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,960
He wouldn't refuse no matter which woman

330
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,150
spends money on him.

331
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,670
I think the newcomer

332
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,670
is another pretentious coquette

333
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:12,120
loving to spend men's money.

334
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,870
I agree.

335
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,790
That's why they are

336
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,840
a perfect match.

337
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,600
But

338
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,440
Xu Yanshi made a mistake this time.

339
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,510
Yinyin is really rich

340
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,630
while that woman

341
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,200
is porcelain.

342
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,030
(Has Xu Yanshi really)

343
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,270
(been to movies with Ying Yinyin?)

344
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:30,120
(What does porcelain mean?)

345
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,320
Jingqi,

346
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,550
what does porcelain mean?

347
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,870
Porcelain means

348
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,840
keeping up appearances.

349
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,390
Fake.

350
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,200
Rookie in the world of work,

351
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,840
I forgot to call you.

352
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,550
How are you doing recently?

353
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,510
Have you learned anything?

354
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,440
It turns out that

355
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,960
porcelain means fake.

356
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,960
Next time when you

357
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,670
gossip about people in the bathroom,

358
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,270
you must make sure that

359
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,960
all the cubicles are unoccupied.

360
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,550
Or you may be recorded.

361
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,270
Did you gossip about people?

362
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,240
I'm the one who recorded it.

363
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,720
I was worried you might be bullied.

364
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,200
Alright. I thought too much.

365
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,150
Please wait over there

366
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,150
to pick up your order.

367
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,030
Hello. What would you like?

368
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,320
Coffee.

369
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:29,960
Iced Americano.

370
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,480
OK.

371
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,240
28 yuan.

372
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,420
(Insufficient available overdraft amount
for the bank card.)

373
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,740
(Insufficient balance. ¥ 1.61 remaining.)

374
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,750
Bai told me that

375
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,870
Grandpa would no longer

376
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,670
support you financially.

377
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,150
This is

378
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,350
the best I can do for you.

379
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,030
Take this.

380
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,480
Have you maxed it out

381
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,350
and wanted me to pay the bill?

382
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,510
How is that possible?

383
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,680
I'm supporting you,

384
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,790
OK, Xiang Yuan?

385
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,440
Why don't you

386
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,030
trust your own brother?

387
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,720
Sure.

388
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,270
Suit yourself.

389
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,270
I'm telling you,

390
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,350
you're a little dog if you swipe it.

391
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,240

It shows insufficient balance.

394
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,110
He wouldn't do that.

395
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,440
Try it again.

396
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,550
OK.

397

399
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,200
See you.

400
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,350
Hello. I want a latte.

401
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:08,960
Hello.

402
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,350
Iced Americano.

403
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,160
OK. Wait a moment.

(Reliable Besties Group)
(Emergency.)

405
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,400
(Need money for a turnover.)

(Xu Yuan: Oh?)

(Xu Yuan ¥ 5,000 Accept transfer)

411
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,240
Bestie,

412
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,960
I'm short of cash recently.

413
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,160
I asked my boss

414
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,550
to advance me 5,000 yuan.

415
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,590
You take it in case of emergency.

416
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,880
OK.

417
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,480
At this time,

418
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,110
I can only count on

419
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,030
my school friends.

420
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,400
(Mingxiong Electronics)
Look at this for yourself.

421
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,960
Why does Mingxiong

422
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,680
always pick on us?

423
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,720
I think it's OK.

424
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,550
Durian Witch.

425
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,480
So annoying.

426
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,440
What's wrong?

427
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,680
Mingxiong again.

428
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:29,960
Qingqing.

429
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,510
There seems to be another problem

430
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,400
with the signal processing modules

431
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,590
delivered to Mingxiong.

432
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,110
Is there anything wrong

433
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,270
with the technical department recently?

434
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,030
No, there isn't.

435
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,110
Third time lucky.

436
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,920
But this is the fourth time

437
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,160
Mingxiong has requested a rework.

438
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,830
I think you know

439
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,350
the reason better behind this.

440
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,310
Have you thought about

441
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,640
why they requested rework

442
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,240
again and again?

443
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,160
Perhaps

444
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,640
I'm incapable.

445
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,350
Mr. Huang said that

446
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,400
he was disappointed with you.

447
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,790
I'm only responsible for

448
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,590
finishing the work

449
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,750
instead of meeting the expectations
of a certain leader of Party A.

450
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,720
Do you want to be
transferred to the headquarters?

451
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,720
Does it matter?

452
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,510
Mingxiong, again?

453
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,270
I like iced drinks.

454
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,790
That's mine.

455
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,200
Stingy.

456
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,880
I'll buy some for you tomorrow.

457
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,310
Don't forget about me.

458
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,350
OK. You each get a carton
for afternoon tea.

459
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,750
Are you serious?

460
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:57,960
I should be generous

461
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,310
once in a while.

462
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,200
Hello, Ms. Li.

What can I do for you, Ms. Li?

465
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,030
Where are you from?

466
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,960
Shanghai.

467
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,750
What do your parents do for a living?

468
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,350
My parents passed away early.

469
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,000
I live with my grandpa.

470
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,400
(Has her family declined?)

471
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,200
I never thought that

472
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,270
she was a poor girl.

Come in.

475
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,590
Just now...

476
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,400
Are you OK?

477
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,750
What's up?

478
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,270
I just want to give you this.

479
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,830
Why are you so nice to me?

480
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,830
Don't say that.

481
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,200
I'm a kind person.

482
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,310
What?

483
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,640
Let me introduce myself again.

484
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,880
My real name is Xiang Shanliang.
[*Shanliang means kindness]

485
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,720
I bet I should call you Sunflower.

486
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,920
That's my brother's name.

487
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,110
You know what?

488
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,240
In junior high school,

489
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,000
I lost 200 yuan

490
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,310
in an online shopping scheme.

491
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,350
My brother promised

492
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,750
to hire someone

493
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,200
to get my money back.

494
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:13,790
And...

495
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,510
And he lost

496
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,550
another 2,000 yuan.

497
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,400
How did you know?

498
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,550
You told me before

499
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,110
in high school.

500
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,750
Guys, look.

501
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,680
Look over there.

502
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,200
Was Li Qin talking with you

503
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,110
about the batch of
signal processing modules

504
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,960
delivered to Mingxiong?

505
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,440
I've looked through all the information

506
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,510
concerning the project.

507
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,000
Just let me know

508
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:02,920
if I can help.

509
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,590
Is it a problem
with software development

510
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,310
or the coordination with Party A?

511
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,310
If it's about the connection,

512
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,480
they gave me more information

513
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,550
about the suppliers today.

514
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,070
We can sort it out together.

515
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,510
If it is about the software development,

516
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:20,960
then we...

517
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,030
Don't worry about that.

518
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:24,750
Why?

519
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,350
No reason.

520
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,110
I don't care,

521
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,310
OK?

522
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,720
But this is the work
of the technical group.

523
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,240
Yeah.

524
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,750
I don't care about

525
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,790
the work of the technical group.

526
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,640
Neither should you.

527
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,590
Please leave.

529
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,030
You don't care. Fine.

530

I'll take care of it.

531
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,110
But I don't understand.

00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,400
Why, Xu Yanshi?

533
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:56,440
Why don't you care about

534
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,200
anything now?

535
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,310
Literally, nothing.

536
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,440
I don't know what has happened to you

537
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,590
in the last few years.

538
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,310
But you've changed a lot.

539
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,310
Anyway, I'll take care of

540
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,200
this matter.

541
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,200
Things are not

542
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,480
as simple as you think.

543
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,880
That's what you said last time.

544
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,200
But it was solved eventually.

545
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,750
Why isn't it simple? Tell me.

546
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,680
Leave.

553
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,720
classify the product categories

554
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,590
and inquire about
the fastest way of purchase.

555
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,920
Qingqing, contact the factory.

556
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,000
Shu has informed us

557
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,790
that we're having

558
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,070
a dinner party tonight, right?

559
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,510
Yeah.

560
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,160
We shouldn't
miss the dinner party, right?

561
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,480
I'll treat you at Xiaodaiji

562
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,480
after finishing the project.

563
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,000
Stay if you're interested.

564
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,720
If you are not,

565
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,510
go to the dinner party as you please.

566
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,310
Are you crazy?

567
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,960
It costs over 1,000 yuan
per capita at Xiaodaiji.

568
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,270
So would you stay

569

and work late?

570
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,270
Hurry up. It's time to get off work.

I have a date tonight.

572
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,030
Don't count me in at the party.

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,350
Yuan,

578
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:43,240
I have a family emergency.

579
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:54,960
Miss Xiang,

580
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,880
I want to save you the money.

581
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,350
I'm leaving.

582
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,400
Miss Xiang,

583
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,510
I'll stay and work with you.

584
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:20,640
Let me see.

585
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,110
Look.

586
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,790
Sweet potato slices and roasted corn.

587
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:22,920
(Seafood and Lobster)
Shu, could we order one more dish?

588
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,440
OK.

589
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,590
Eggplant, please.

590
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,240
And staple food.

591
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,640
Do you think Ashers retired from
the gaming circle

592
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,350
because of love affairs?

593
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,830
Rumor has it that she has a boyfriend

594
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,070
who is a tycoon in the tech world.

595
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,480
The man has borrowed lots of money
from her to start a business.

596
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,550
And Ashers has been

597
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,750
providing for him.

598
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,270
There are so many kept men now.

599
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,720
It only looks good on the phone.

600
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,270
It won't look good on you.

601
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,550
Do you think Boss

602
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,350
has a chance to live off a woman?

603
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,750
I don't

604
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,830
think so.

605
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,830
I think the woman

606
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,720
is even poorer than him.

607
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,160
Who?

608
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,310
Me.

609
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,310
Xiang Yuan.

610
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,000
Come in.

611
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,400
Ms. Li,

612
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,880
could you give me

613
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,070
the files of Mingxiong

614
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,000
and the contracts

615
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
we've signed with them

616
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,920
in the last two years?

617
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,240
Why?

618
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,680
Has Xu Yanshi left this mess

619
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,640
to you?

620
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,070
It's supposed to be the work
for the technical department

621
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,440
and I'm one of the department.

622
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,400
You think you're one of them,

623
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,590
but they don't seem to

624
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,960
consider you one of them.

625
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,270
Why didn't they invite you
to the dinner party?

626
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,550
What do you want to say?

627
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,160
You can't put a crown on a clown

628
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,440
and expect a king.

629
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,510
You're smart.

630
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,350
You don't have to mingle in them.

631
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,440
Take Xu Yanshi for example.

632
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,960
After so many years,

633
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,240
he hasn't even got a

634
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,240
work contract Class A.

635
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,510
He is still an employee of Class B.

636
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,270
Plus, the company has been
restructuring these years.

637
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,750
The year-end assessment

638
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,240
is becoming increasingly rigid.

639
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,200
He can neither get a pay rise

640
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,830
nor a promotion.

641
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,680
Joining the company later than him,

642
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,510
Chen Shu has become
the director of a department.

643
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,830
What about him?

644
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,550
He is getting increasingly depressed,

645
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,160
and increasingly wasted.

646
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:16,750
He's going to die and rot here.

647
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,480
Are you fulfilled

648
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,400
working for

649
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,640
such a man?

650
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,110
I'm fulfilled

651
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,680
and pleased.

652
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,350
Raise your glasses.

653
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,720
To a pleasant cooperation

654
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,350
between the tech and the sales departments.

655
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:45,030
- Cheers!
- Cheers! Go, team!

656
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:45,750
Thank you.

657
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,920
I'll be driving. So no alcohol.

658
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,440
What a bummer.

659
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,750
Where is Xiang Yuan?

660
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,550
Occupied.

661
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,310
Come on.

662
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,550
I say, you didn't even

663
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,880
have the courage to invite her.

664
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,920
Why don't I?

665
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,640
If you do,

666
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,400
dare you woo her?

667
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,590
Gangster logic.

668
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:13,920
Believe it or not,

669
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,720
but even if you really woo her,

670
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,160
you may not be able to get her.

671
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,790
Ordinary men can't deal with

672
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,350
girls like Xiang Yuan.

673
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,000
Who?

674
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,350
Miss Xiang?

675
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,590
Who is she exactly?

676
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:28,400
She said she would

677
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:28,960
treat us at Xiaodaiji

678
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,400
where the per-capita spending
was 1,000 yuan.

679
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:31,750
But the premise was that

680
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,440
we would stay and

681
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,400
work overtime with her.

682
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,310
I never thought that

683
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,110
you guys would be

684
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,750
so indifferent to money.

685
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,110
Of course.

686
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,480
If we have to choose between
her and Boss,

687
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,830
we'll definitely choose Boss.

688
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,030
But

689
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,200
you're really thick-skinned.

690
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,440
I...

691
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,240
Well,

692
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,000
what does Xiang Yuan's family do?

693
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,510
She looks super rich.

694
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,440
All her bags

695
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,960
are limited edition.

696
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,830
Fake.

697
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,070
Fake?

698
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:01,880
Don't talk nonsense.

699
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,000
How did you know?

700
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,070
He's right.

701
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,030
Aren't your bags

702
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,110
all fake,

703
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,310
like your selfies?

704
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,960
Do you still have the nerve
to crack down on fake?

705
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,200
I definitely know!

706
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,920
She has maxed out her credit card.

707
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,000
When I went to buy coffee today,

708
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:15,750
I saw

709
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,640
that she had to swipe her credit card

710
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,830
to buy a cup of coffee.

711
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:19,750
The bottom line is,

712
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,310
her credit card was declined.

713
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,270
All her outfits are

714
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,440
either limited edition or new design.

715
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,000
I thought she was a really rich girl,

716
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,240
not expecting her to be

717
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,160
a credit card slave.

718
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,680
Then how could she afford to

719
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,960
treat you at Xiaodaiji?

720
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:31,830
Perhaps

721
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,160
she tried to scam you into

722
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,030
working overtime with her.

723
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,110
It's probably the truth.

724
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,160
Enough.

725
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,350
Stop gossiping.

726
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,350
Have some more.

727
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,680
You're so skinny.

728
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,590
Have some more.

729
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,400
Boss.

730
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,000
This, this, and this.

731
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,110
Thanks.

732
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,790
No problem.

733
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:12,000
What is product data management?

734
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:15,550
(Forget it.)

735
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,030
(I can't figure it out)

736
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,000
(by consulting him little by little.)

737
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,110
(Time is running out.)

738
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,920
(I'll solve it in the way)

739
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,880
(I'm good at.)

740
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,640
I have to go.

741
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,920
Already?

742
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,510
I have something to attend to.

743
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,880
Hello.

744
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,480
Is that Mr. Huang of Mingxiong?

745
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,000
I'm with Velin Technology,

746
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:49,920
the technical group.

747
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,270
Who gave you my number?

748
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,240
Tell Xu Yanshi to call me.

749
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,480
Hello.

750
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:57,960
Hello.

751
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,030
Is that Mr. Li of Dewo?

752
00:32:59,240 --> 00:32:59,920
Yes. Who's that?

753
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,400
This is Velin Technology.

754
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,240
I'm sorry to bother you at this hour.

755
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,110
Would you please tell me

756
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,400
the batch of GPS chips

757
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:05,750
we purchased

758
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,960
from your company last time...

759
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,920
I'm kind of busy right now.

760
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,000
I'm sorry.

761
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:11,680
Thanks.

762
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,240
Hello.

763
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,640
Is that Mr. Zhang of Hongyuan?

764
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:16,510
Who is it?

765
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,830
This is the technical group of Velin.

766
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,110
Do you know what time it is now?

767
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:21,920
I'm sorry

768
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,590
to bother you.

769
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,590
You can wait till tomorrow.

770
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,400
OK.

771
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,590
I'll call you tomorrow.

772
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,400
Thank you.

773
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,270
Zhang Jun.

774
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,240
Zhang Jun.

775
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,790
Go home.

776
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,350
I'll ask for leave tomorrow for you
from Mr. Li

777
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,110
and let you sleep a little longer.

778
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,070
OK.

779
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,100
(Boss: You stay and work with her.)

780
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,880
(Zhang Jun: Yes. Boss.)

781
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,840
(Boss, I'll go home first.)

782
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,520
(Miss Xiang is still working.)

783
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:19,700
(Boss: OK.)

784
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,630
Miss Xiang, I'm leaving.

785
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,840
Don't stay too late.

786
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,360
- OK. Bye.
- Bye.

787
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,070

Do you also ask for leave?

828
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,960
Whose application is that?

829
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,960
Gao Leng and Shi Tianyou

830
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,320
drank too much last night.

831
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,400
Zhang Jun's application for leave.

832
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,800
He worked till midnight yesterday.

833
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,710
(I apply for a half day off
due to working until 12:00 last night.)

834
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,800
Zhang Jun is good.

835
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,030
He works hard.

836
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,670
Drank too much?

837
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,710
Humph.

838
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,280
Did you stay out late last night?

839
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,800
I'm also a team leader.

840
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,670
I don't care what you do

841
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,360
with your group.

842
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,590
But don't lead mine astray.

843
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,190
Our princess is mad?

844
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,400
Don't you know she is difficult

845
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,510
to deal with?

846
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,360
Then will you comfort her?

847
00:38:59,030 --> 00:38:59,630
Don't move.

848
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,400
There's someone in the house opposite.

849
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,360
He is aiming at you.

850
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,190
A sniper...

851
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,320
Be careful.

852
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,760
Step back. Step back.

853
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,920
Step back.

854
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,760
You stop.

855
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:07,590
Come on!

856
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,320
Outflank them.

857
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,110
Someone is behind you.

858
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,030
Is the game three-dimensional?

859
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,030
Someone is pulling me.

860
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:21,920
Well...

861
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,550
Well...

862
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,630
Miss Xiang,

863
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:29,000
I didn't mean it last night.

864
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,590
What's wrong with Mingxiong's order?

865
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,880
Why doesn't anybody take care of it?

866
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,440
Even Xu Yanshi doesn't care about it.

867
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,630
Mingxiong…

868
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,710
Miss Xiang,

869
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,710
you are new here and you don't know.

870
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,630
It's not the problem with

871
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,360
the signal processing modules.

872
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,400
The money Mingxiong paid

873
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,440
was only enough for B,

874
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,760
but they insisted that

875
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,710
they paid enough for A.

876
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:50,960
They even showed proof.

877
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,760
There's something fishy

878
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,190
behind this.

879
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,960
There are definitely rats
in the company.

880
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:57,760
But in the end,

881
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,590
the company has to pay for it.

882
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:00,150
And the technical group

883
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,670
has to take the blame.

884
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,550
Do you think Boss could solve it?

885
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,440
What about Li Yongbiao and Li Qin?

886
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,320
Why don't they do anything?

887
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,400
They?

888
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,110
Do you think they're not aware of it?

889
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,000
Li Yongbiao,

890
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,320
a hypocrite.

891
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,400
Li Qin.

892
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,510
Do you know

893
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,840
what everyone calls her?

894
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,190
Durian Witch.

895
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,110
Annoying

896
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,510
and fussy.

897
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,550
(The number you dialed)

898
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,760
(cannot be connected...)

899
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,440
Zhang Jun,

900
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,150
you needn't work overtime today.

901
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:53,230
OK.

902
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,400
What about you?

903
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:55,670
I'm going to see Huang Qiming.

904
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,070
Mr. Huang?

905
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,190
How did you get on?

906
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,150
Why did you let her get on?

907
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,480
Don't blame him.

908
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,760
I lied to him.

909
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,280
I told him...

910
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:16,880
Look.

911
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,360
I said I was your daughter

912
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,800
and I wanted to surprise you.

913
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,550
He just couldn't

914
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,510
refuse a pretty girl.

915
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,030
What do you want?

916
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,320
Liu, call the police.

917
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:32,760
Don't.

918
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,800
Mr. Huang, calm down.

919
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,800
The car is yours.

920
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,110
The driver is yours.

921
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,280
And Miss Liu

922
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,070
is yours, too.

923
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,440
If the police come,

924
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,150
I have no choice but to tell them

925
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,400
you kidnapped me.

926
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,280
You're young,

927
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,670
but you do know how to threaten people.

928
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,960
There's a driving recorder
fixed in the car.

929
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,320
Well.

930
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,480
Don't lie to her.

931
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,590
I told her

932
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,590
there wasn't a driving recorder.

933
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,480
You traitor!

934
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,360
Mr. Huang,

935
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,190
I sincerely advise you

936
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,000
to install a recorder

937
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,800
if you don't talk about

938
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,670
private business

939
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:09,960
in the car.

940
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,000
Who the hell are you?

941
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,230
What do you want?

942
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,230
Let me introduce myself.

943
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,550
I'm Xu Yanshi's assistant.

944
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,710
I've come to discuss

945
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,400
the batch of

946
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,070
signal processing modules with you.

947
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,630
You always hang up on me.

948
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:26,070
I have no other options

949
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,280
except for this bad move.

950
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:33,360
Has Xu Yanshi got an assistant?

951
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,550
Unbelievable, right?

952
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:37,440
He is high-maintenance.

953
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:38,670
OK.

954
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,630
Let's have a talk.

955
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,960
Why don't you pick us a place?

956
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:43,960
OK.

957
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:00,000
To you, Mr. Huang.

958
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:05,000
I'll empty it.

959
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,440
How long have you been
working for him?

960
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:14,800
Not long.

961
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,360
Less than a month.

962
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,880
Less than a month,

963
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,440
and you dare to head me off?

964
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,920
Are you too bold

965
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:23,920
or does Xu Yanshi

966
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,320
want to be fired?

967
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:32,670
Guess who I saw at the door?

968
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,230
I saw Huang Qi.

969
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:36,280
Huang Qi!

970
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,510
Huang Qi!

971
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:38,800
Isn't he the son of

972
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,440
Huang Qiming of Mingxiong?

973
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:39,920
With a crop of green hair.

974
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,920
What's the fuss about?

975
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,590
No, his hair becomes yellow now.

976
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:44,190
He looks like a real dandy.

977
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:45,550
I also saw that

978
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:46,590
Xiang Yuan and his father

979
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,070
were talking excitedly

980
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:50,400
in the next room.

981
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:51,030
Wait.

982
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:52,000
Xiang Yuan?

983
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,670
She and Xu Yanshi?

984
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,360
I didn't see Xu Yanshi.

985
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:57,760
She is alone?

986
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:01,630
Xiang Yuan is really bold.

987
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:02,840
I'm telling you, Huang Qiming

988
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,800
is a notorious old goat.

989
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,670
He'll definitely

990
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:06,960
take advantage of her.

991
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,840
- Really?
- Oh, my!

992
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,320
Maybe she likes it that way.

993
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,800
Otherwise, with such a poor resume,

994
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,670
how could she get an offer

995
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:12,510
from the technical department?

996
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:12,960
Exactly.

997
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,920
The headquarters have been

998
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,000
palming people off on us.

999
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,880
But they rarely treat

1000
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,000
anyone of them

1001
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,800
as an equal to Xu Yanshi.

1002
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,440
Yeah. I never thought that.

1003
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,550
Where is she?

1004
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:39,280
She seems to have gone
to meet Huang Qiming.

1005
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,360
Huang Qiming?

1006
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,070
Yeah.

1007
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:42,710
He kept hanging up on her

1008
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:43,280
today.

1009
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:43,880
I assume she has gone to Mingxiong

1010
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,000
to intercept him directly.
