29
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,280
Hello.

30
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,150
It's 38 yuan.

31
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,000
Here is the receipt.

32
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,790
Hello, what can I get you?

33
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,510
Hello.

34
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,000
I'll have an Americano.

35
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,790
An Americano. Hot?

36
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,150
Yes.

37
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:07,940
Okay.

38
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,630
That'll be 22 yuan.

39
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,000
Hello.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,710
I'd like a milk tea

41
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,910
and a sandwich.

42
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,310
Please wait for a moment.

43
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,360
I'm the only one working here today,

44
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,150
so I'm a little busy.

45
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,910
Just a moment.

46
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,750
Okay. Thank you.

47
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:32,960
Yinyin.

48
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,360
You look so pretty today.

49
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,680
Really?

50
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,240
Yeah.

51
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,240
Wait,

52
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,360
aren't I pretty

53
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,750
every day?

54
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,190
You are.

55
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,710
Thanks.

56
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,240
Hi.

57
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,430
I'd like a piece of strawberry cake.

58
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,800
Here you go.

59
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,840
Two hot Americanos for me.

60
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,680
Put it on the tab
of Velin's sales department.

61
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,150
Thank you.

62
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,680
Okay.

63
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,400
Orange juice.

64
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,240
Orange juice, right?

65
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,120
And one serving of shaved ice.

66
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,190
- Shaved ice.
- Okay.

67
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:58,520
Yes.

68
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,750
That'll be 23 yuan.
Please wait over there.

69
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,520
Can you hurry up?

70
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,870
It's taking too long.
I still have work to do.

71
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,750
Please wait for a moment.

72
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,310
I'm the only one working here right now.

73
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,630
Here is your coffee.

74
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,360
Lin Qingqing.

75
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,000
Let me have the coffee first.

76
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,590
But we also have urgent matters

77
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,750
in our department today.

78
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,360
Give it back to her.

79
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,240
Why?

80
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,400
She said she doesn't mind.

81
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,590
Why do you care?

82
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,520
First come, first served.

83
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,080
Don't you understand such a simple rule?

84
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,800
What kind of urgent matters

85
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,080
can the technical department have?

86
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,260
Well, the sales department's meeting

87
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,220
can't be delayed.

88
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,540
She was sent to buy coffee.

89
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,300
I don't think anyone will wait for her

90
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,180
for the meeting.

91
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,780
Don't you have things to do?

92
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,900
Thank you.

93
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,540
Here is your milk tea.

94
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:07,820
Thank you.

95
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,060
See you later.

96
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,060
I...

97
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,860
Is my coffee ready?

98
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,060
Right away.

99
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,380
Just a moment, please.

100
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,900
(They have logged me in.)

101
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,220
Please check it carefully.

102
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,300
Good morning.

103
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,140
Good morning.

104
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,940
(Velin)

105
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,420
Good morning.

106
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,140
Good morning.

107
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:01,660
Hello?

108
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,700
- Thank you for helping me
- This is Velin Company.

109
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,460
with the data analysis yesterday.

110
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,420
You helped me a lot.

111
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,740
It's nothing.

112
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,540
Thank you.

113
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,180
Thank you.

114
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,900
Good morning.

115
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,660
Good morning.

116
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,180
I hate this.

117
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,100
You're all here so early.

118
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,180
- You came prepared.
- Good morning.

119
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,820
Where's Boss?

120
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,660
He went up to meet
the outside team leader.

121
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,060
The outside team leader?

122
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,620
Well...

123
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,260
What about Boss?

124
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,780
Don't scare me.

125
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,420
I feel sorry for Boss.

126
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,780
He failed to become

127
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,380
an A-class employee,

128
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,460
and now he's being targeted.

129
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,860
What are the people
in the headquarters thinking?

130
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,540
How can they still

131
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,380
hire new people at such a time?

132
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,380
Not to mention a team leader.

133
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,860
They don't know

134
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,700
the situation of our company?

135
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,180
They can barely pay our salaries,

136
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,100
and they're still hiring people.

137
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,260
I just got a copy of

138
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,140
her resume.

139
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,460
Guess what?

140
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:02,940
Let me analyze it

141
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,900
for you guys.

142
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,100
First of all,

143
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,460
she studied broadcasting

144
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,620
and hosting in college,

145
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,060
which has nothing to do
with what we're doing here.

146
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,740
So what?

147
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,100
Those who studied jewelry design

148
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,260
also worked here before.

149
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,300
She studied broadcasting and hosting.

150
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,180
There is no major

151
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:17,740
that our company

152
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,860
won't accept.

153
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,100
What else is there?

154
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,980
She has won many awards,

155
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,060
such as

156
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:23,780
the first place

157
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,180
in the 8th Children's

158
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:25,900
Radio Calisthenics Competition,

159
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,060
and the third place in the National Youth

160
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:29,860
Swimming Competition.

161
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,220
She was the president

162
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,060
of the Mountaineering Association
in college.

163
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,140
The only thing

164
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,180
that is related to what we're doing here

165
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,300
is that

166
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,300
she won the first prize

167
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,540
in the Global Navigation Satellite System

168
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,340
Knowledge Competition.

169
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,460
That's impressive.

170
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,980
She's fit for this job.

171
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,820
Who is

172
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,100
this genius?

173
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,620
How many times have I told you

174
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,460
not to touch my head?

175
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,420
Don't touch my head.

176
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,820
Here is the point.

177
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,980
Sorry, I got too excited.

178
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,660
The children's group.

179
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:16,820
Tea.

180
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:17,980
Coffee.

181
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,740
Tea.

182
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,580
Coffee.

183
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,580
Coffee or tea?

184
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,780
Thank you,

185
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,100
but I'm good.

186
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,980
Well,

187
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,620
Xiang, you're an outstanding candidate.

188
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,260
What made you decide to leave Shanghai

189
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,900
and join Velin?

190
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,940
I heard that

191
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,740
Xi'an, the ancient capital
with a history of a thousand years,

192
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,260
is full of talents.

193
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,660
There must be something

194
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,380
I can learn here.

195
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,700
You heard that.

196
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,140
Which one of your friends

197
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,180
at headquarters

198
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,260
did you hear that from?

199
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,620
I might know him.

200
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,780
I must

201
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,060
express my gratitude to him

202
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,740
for introducing such an excellent student

203
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,820
to me.

204
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,940
Well,

205
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,220
I just randomly submitted

206
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,500
my resume online

207
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,460
and ended up being recruited by you.

208
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,940
You just submitted your resume.

209
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,460
Well, you made a superb choice

210
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,500
to choose our company.

211
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,380
Li.

212
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,620
Something happened again

213
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,860
in the technical department.

214
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,820
Do you know it?

215
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,660
It can't go on like this.

216
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,380
A girl who worked under me

217
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,180
was scolded by the client and cried.

218
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,940
She is demanding justice from me.

219
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,060
What happened again?

220
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,180
What can we do?

221
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,460
That Durian Witch

222
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,740
always gives us a hard time.

223
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,780
I told her last time

224
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,620
that the area had interference

225
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,780
and needed an on-site inspection.

226
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,340
Boss asked her to approve the budget,

227
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,340
which was just a matter of
a few tens of thousands of yuan.

228
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,580
But she still rejected it.

229
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,700
Well, well,

230
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,700
now her client got lost there,

231
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,420
and she tried to blame it on us.

232
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,020
She has been aiming at our group

233
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,340
for some time.

234
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,860
Although Boss doesn't say anything,

235
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,900
I can see that

236
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,860
he's getting tired of taking the blame.

237
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,260
No one would work with enthusiasm

238
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,940
with her doing such things.

239
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,700
Obviously, that Durian Witch

240
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,580
is probably complaining

241
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,500
to Li

242
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,220
right now.

243
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,180
I'm not complaining to you,

244
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,980
but you need to talk to him.

245
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,620
The technical department

246
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,060
needs to be reorganized.

247
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,020
We can't afford this big burden.

248
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,020
He can't accomplish anything.

249
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,740
All he does is

250
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,940
torture those little girls
who work under us.

251
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,300
Let's talk about what happened
in the southwest region...

252
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,220
All right, I'll talk to Xu.

253
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:33,860
Oh, right,

254
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,620
let me introduce her to you.

255
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,100
Xiang.

256
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,980
This is

257
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,220
the Deputy General Manager of our company,

258
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,060
Li Qin.

259
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,940
This is Xiang Yuan from headquarters.

260
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,340
Hello, Ms. Li.

261
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,260
Xiang.

262
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,340
Since you've just arrived

263
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,260
and haven't met

264
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,060
the team leader
of the technical department,

265
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,980
I've asked him to come.

266
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,940
I'll introduce him to you.

267
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,340
Well...

268
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:56,940
(General Manager)
Yanshi.

269
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,500
Let me introduce you two to each other.

270
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,380
Xiang.

271
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,860
This is the team leader

272
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,300
of the technical department,

273
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,260
Xu Yanshi.

274
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:09,820
This is Xiang Yuan,

275
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,620
who was just sent

276
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,380
by the headquarters

277
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,740
to be the leader of Group II

278
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,580
of the technical department.

279
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,500
Group II?

280
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,260
Wasn't Group II eliminated?

281
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,500
It was.

282
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,140
But after Xiang came,

283
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,060
it was reestablished,

284
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,580
and drafted some members

285
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,300
from Group I.

286
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,340
In terms of work,

287
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,060
they still report to Yanshi.

288
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,340
Xiang.

289
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,100
In Velin,

290
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,380
we always encourage

291
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,620
healthy competition.

292
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,540
So,

293
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,100
with your arrival,

294
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,460
I believe you can spark some great ideas

295
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,700
with the members of Group I.

296
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,260
All right, Mr. Li.

297
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,020
There's no need

298
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,100
to beat around the bush.

299
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,540
Xiang is one of us.

300
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,900
Just say what you want to say.

301
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,540
Xu Yanshi.

302
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,860
I'm telling you,

303
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:50,860
Xiang is here

304
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,220
to replace you.

305
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:52,900
Shouldn't you

306
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,100
think about when to stop

307
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,340
making a perfunctory effort?

308
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,100
Ms. Li.

309
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,740
The declining performance

310
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,980
of the branch for the past two years

311
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,060
can't be solely blamed on Xu Yanshi.

312
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,660
You don't have to
put in a good word for him.

313
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,660
Do you think I don't know

314
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,700
what he has in mind?

315
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,260
He thinks the branch office
is too small for him.

316
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,780
He wants to go to the headquarters.

317
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,700
Am I right, Xiang?

318
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,340
Ms. Li.

319
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,860
What are you talking about?

320
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,180
You must have been watching
too many palace dramas.

321
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,860
I studied broadcasting and hosting,

322
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,380
and I know nothing

323
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,900
about the technical department.

324
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,460
I'm just a layman.

325
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,420
I'm here to help

326
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,300
Mr. Xu with his work.

327
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,820
I dare not contradict him.

328
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,820
Well, I may be here

329
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,620
to replace you,

330
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,340
but there is no way I can replace him.

331
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,300
Anyway, Xu Yanshi,

332
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,900
I have received

333
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,220
several customer complaints.

334
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,740
They followed our navigation

335
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,540
and ended up in

336
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,740
a wheat field.

337
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,620
There are a lot of issues.

338
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,100
Shouldn't you be solving them?

339
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,060
I have

340
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,420
double-checked

341
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,060
the stability of the equipment and signals,

342
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:00,820
and there's no problem.

343
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,500
The software and data

344
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,500
are also intact,

345
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,380
so it's likely influenced

346
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,980
by the local environment.

347
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,980
It's best to conduct a field mapping.

348
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,300
Then why don't you do it?

349
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,940
Have you approved the budget?

350
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,460
How do I do it?

351
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,340
I've said what I should say.

352
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,300
You should figure out

353
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,460
the solution yourselves.

354
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,460
Everyone here dares to talk back to me.

355
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,460
Do they still want to keep their jobs?

356
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,620
Yanshi.

357
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,100
I just brought some coffee

358
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,660
from Yunnan.

359
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,980
There's one type of white coffee
that tastes really good.

360
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,020
Try it.

361
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,500
(Team Introduction
Xu Yanshi, Team Leader of Technical Group I)

362
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,220
Yanshi.

363
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,140
Chen Shan left you with us

364
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,980
for the last two years

365
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,340
and she totally forgot about you.

366
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,660
Can you still count on her?

367
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,340
(Well, well, Xu Yanshi.)

368
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,460
(How miserable have you become?)

369
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,260
(It's okay.)

370
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,020
(I'll take care of you from now on.)

371
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,620
Mr. Xu.

372
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,540
I'm the leader of Group II, Xiang Yuan.

373
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,980
Nice to meet you.

374
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,620
(He's still so cold.)

375
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,860
That's what you got for pulling my hair!

376
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,060
That's what you got for pulling my hair!

377
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:26,860
I'm gonna...

378
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,220
You pulled my hair again.

379
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,540
Don't do it.

380
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,820
Good morning, Xu Yanshi.

381
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,740
Ouch.

382
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,300
Xiang Yuan, let go of me.

383
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,820
Yanshi.

384
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,540
Xiang Yuan

385
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,820
just arrived at our company.

386
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,940
You should help her get familiar with

387
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,220
the work in the technical department.

388
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,020
Well,

389
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,260
take her to the administration
department now

390
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,620
to get a computer and a work badge.

391
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,860
(Finance Department)
I've sent this photo

392
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,700
to all my spies.

393
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,500
Don't worry.

394
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,340
I'll dig out her background today.

395
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,420
Yinyin.

396
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,220
Yinyin, look...

397
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,220
Look at this person.

398
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,540
Is that her?

399
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,700
Quietly. Let me see.

400
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,700
It is.

401
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,380
Right?

402
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,180
It's her.

403
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,420
Ms. Li, hurry up.

404
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,140
I have things to do.

405
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,620
Are you finished?

406
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,500
(Perfect.)

407
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,620
(My hair and makeup are great.)

408
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,340
Xu Yanshi.

409
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,340
It's good to see you again,

410
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,540
but it seems like you're not so happy

411
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,500
to see me.

412
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,100
So,

413
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,140
if you don't want to work with me,

414
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,020
you can resign.

415
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,500
I can help you get on the fast track.

416
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,220
You should resign.

417
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,540
You're not fit for this place.

418
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:41,940
What's wrong with you?

419
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,700
How could you let go?

420
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,060
I'm sorry.

421
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,220
(Velin)

422
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,500
Let's go.

423
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,020
Come on.

424
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,680
My hair is ruined.

425
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,260
Don't you see

426
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,380
Xu Yanshi over there?

427
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:02,860
Do you want to

428
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,820
leave him a bad impression?

429
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,380
No.

430
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,540
Come on.

431
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,740
(Never mind.)

432
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,380
(I should greet him properly.)

433
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,420
I didn't expect us

434
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,180
to be colleagues here.

435
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,340
Mr. Xu.

436
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,900
I've been looking for you.

437
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,660
It's about

438
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,780
the last batch of signal receivers.

439
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,380
Look...

440
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,100
If you're busy with something,

441
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,500
I'll go to the administration department
by myself.

442
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,380
Mr. Xu, look.

443
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,140
Right here.

444
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,620
Rights related to the agreement.

445
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,620
By the way,

446
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,380
what happened last night

447
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,420
was purely an accident.

448
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,540
Don't take it personally.

449
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,140
And also,

450
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,460
I won't resign.

451
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,620
The administration department
is on this floor.

452
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,300
Mr. Xu, well...

453
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,380
Well...

454
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,260
What kind of bag

455
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,700
is she carrying?

456
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,780
I've never seen it before.

457
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,220
But it's a pretty bag.

458
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,740
Do you think

459
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,220
she looks a bit like Gakki?

460
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,620
What Gakki?

461
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,940
All you think of is Gakki.

462
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,340
Gakki.

463
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,620
They don't look alike.

464
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,140
Although she doesn't

465
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:24,940
look like Gakki,

466
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,300
she's still pretty.

467
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,460
She's not pretty.

468
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,780
This pretty girl

469
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,260
is...

470
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,180
This woman

471
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,700
was assigned to the technical department.

472
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,540
Yinyin.

473
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,580
You should be careful.

474
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,900
I think the way

475
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,660
she looked at Xu Yanshi

476
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,620
was not right.

477
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,820
Yeah, Yinyin.

478
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:44,900
Well,

479
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,820
should we check her out?

480
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,060
After all, at this time,

481
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:48,740
anyone who can get into Velin

482
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,020
might have connections.

483
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,740
Look at you two.

484
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,540
You haven't seen much of the world.

485
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,020
So what if she has connections?

486
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,500
Don't I have connections?

487
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,420
There is a hierarchy of connections.

488
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,100
Okay?

489
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,540
If she's that powerful,

490
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,140
how would she end up
in the technical department?

491
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,140
That's right.

492
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,220
No matter how powerful
her connections are,

493
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,020
can they be more powerful

494
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,820
than Yinyin's uncle?

495
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,380
Of course not. Don't be ridiculous.

496
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,660
Yeah.

497
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,420
As long as I'm here,

498
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,100
just go ahead and do whatever you want.

499
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,100
There is no need to fear or worry.

500
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,020
I'll take care of you.

501
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,540
Don't worry. She won't stay long.

502
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,380
Just wait and see.

503
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,700
These invoices can't be reimbursed.

504
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,860
The format is wrong.

505
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,700
Take them back and redo it.

506
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,340
It's no big deal.

507
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,380
It's nothing.

508
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:35,980
It's no big deal.

509
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,020
(Base Features)
Go out and turn right.

510
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,180
Go straight to the end,
and you'll see the technical department.

511
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,420
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

512
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,060
Thank you.

513
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,580
(Xi'an Velin-A Warm Family(81))
(Welcome our new colleague, Xiang Yuan.)

514
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,100
(Today is her first day on the job.)

515
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,860
(Number of red envelopes: 80
Total amount: 10,000 yuan)

516
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,340
(Sent)

517
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,500
(Great fortune and great favor!)

518
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,620
Someone sent a red envelope.

519
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,100
Grab the red envelope.

520
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:23,860
- Hurry up.
- There is a red envelope.

521
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,620
The newcomer

522
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,100
sent a red envelope
before saying anything.

523
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:26,740
I grabbed it, too.

524
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,300
(Oh, no.)

525
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,060
(I'm poor now.)

526
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:29,980
She's so generous.

527
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,860
(Why can't I take it back?)

528
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,500
I've got over 80 yuan.

529
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,180
Let me see

530
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,380
how much money she sent in total.

531
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,220
(Received your red envelope.)

532
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,500
Why don't you grab it, Xu Yanshi?

533
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,420
Do you really not want it?

534
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,540
The newcomer is considerate.

535
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,860
She sent a red envelope in the group.
Look.

536
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,780
Really.

537
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,220
It's just a red envelope.

538
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:53,940
Petty profit.

539
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,140
She's good at buying popularity.

540
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:55,820
What a to-do!

541
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,500
Yinyin,

542
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,900
shall we snatch it or not?

543
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,260
You two snatch it.

544
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,420
Anyway, I won't.

545
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,580
Look.

546
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,420
(Red envelope sent by Xiang Yuan)
120 yuan!

547
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,580
Look at mine.

548
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,700
(Red envelope sent by Xiang Yuan)
198 yuan!

549
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,860
I'm so lucky!

550
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,380
You snatched so much!

551
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,100
What a big red envelope it is!

552
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,060
Exactly.

553
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,700
Yinyin.

554
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,060
Snatch one.

555
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,060
Snatch one. Snatch.

556
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,100
Snatch what?

557
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,540
Shame on you.

558
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,940
Don't you have work to do?

559
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,340
Are you here to have fun? Get back!

560
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,420
Hurry up.

561
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,180
(Red envelope sent by Xiang Yuan
1.58 yuan)

562
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,460
Everyone has snatched a few dozen
or over a hundred yuan.

563
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,500
Why did you only

564
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,580
get 1.58 yuan?

565
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,740
1.58 yuan.

566
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,060
The least in the group.

567
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,180
Boohoo.

568
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,240
(Gao Leng)
(Unbelievable.)

569
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,420
(Moments)
(Who could have thought that under such a situation,)

570
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,780
(the headquarters still palmed her off
on us just because she had connections?)

571
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,980
(She lands from the air
like a paratrooper.)

572
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,740
(And she is said to major in)

573
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,260
(broadcasting and anchor.)

574
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,500
(Why don't they give us one)

575
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,140
(who majors in relevant subjects?)

576
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,900
(And also, her resume)

577
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,220
(is hilarious,)

578
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,740
(climbing, swimming,
flying and diving.)

579
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,020
(People would think that)

580
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,100
(she is sent by the Calabash Brothers)
[*Calabash Brothers: characters in a Chinese cartoon]

581
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,340
(to save their grandpa.)

582
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,460
You're right.

583
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,140
I'm here to save my grandpa, indeed.

584
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,740
I got 88 yuan.

585
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,700
What?

586
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,620
88.

587
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,340
Let me see.

588
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,620
Check your work plan

589
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,900
on Page 88

590
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,540
and show it to me.

591
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:50,940
Hello, everyone.

592
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,140
I'm the new leader of Group II.

593
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,100
My name is Xiang Yuan.

594
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,420
I wish that from now on,

595
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,220
we can cooperate well

596
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,300
and work together smoothly.

597
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,260
Hasn't Group II been disbanded?

598
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,620
What should we do with our stuff?

599
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,580
It's just an excuse for hiring her.

600
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,820
So you're our new colleague.

601
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,020
Nice to see you again.
I would appreciate your guidance.

602
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:12,860
Could you tell me

603
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,460
which cubicle is unoccupied?

604
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,180
It's mine.

605
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,580
Why don't you sit here for now?

606
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,020
Later on,

607
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,860
we'll tidy it up for you.

608
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,300
Thanks.

609
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,860
Well, the fare for our ride-sharing
in the morning...

610
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,580
What about

611
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,100
I buy you a takeout for lunch?

612
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:33,780
No need.

613
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,940
We are supposed to split the fare.

614
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,780
Where do I put these things?

615
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,020
You can put them there.

616
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:38,660
OK.

617
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,260
(Xu Yanshi)

618
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,820
(It's so close to him.)

619
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,340
(Will I have to see)

620
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,100
(his poker iceberg face every day?)

621
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,180
Well...

622
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:58,860
Well...

623
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,420
Which cubicle is not occupied?

624
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,420
Can... Can I take this one?

625
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,780
No... This is occupied.

626
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,460
What about this one?

627
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,900
It's taken, too.

628

(Resume Xiang Yuan)

629
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,020
Never mind.

630
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,260
I'll do it myself.

631
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,260
Customer service
is again pressing us

632
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,300
to deal with the complaints

633
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,420
on the southwest line.

634
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,460
They can't have the work done

635
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,660
without paying anything.

636
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,820
If she doesn't approve the budget,

637
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,460
how can we deal with that?

638
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,340
Exactly.

639
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:51,060
(Self-evaluation Learning Experience

640
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,580
(What kind)

641
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,700
(of crap is this?)

642
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,340
(Bai, are you kidding me?)

(Xiang Yuan)

645
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,380
What's wrong, Yuan?

646
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,740
Did you make my resume?

647
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,260
Yes, is there any problem?

648
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,700
Any problem?

649
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,740
Are you kidding me

650
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,220
or did Grandpa ask you
to play tricks on me?

651
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,260
You...

652
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,420
Are you out of your mind?

653
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,300
Do you know they call me

654
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,700
Calabash Brother now?

655
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,140
Miss,

656
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,740
I've looked through

657
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,980
all your certificates

658
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,300
just to piece up

659
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,500
this resume.

660
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,220
Your grandpa asked for it

661
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,980
to be truthful.

662
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,540
I've looked through
all your information,

663
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,740
only finding that

664
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,060
your life seems to
have stopped in your childhood.

665
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,700
Your life after growing up

666
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,660
is completely blank

667
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,580
other than playing games.

668
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:08,940
Bai,

669
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,180
you've changed.

670
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,380
Miss,

671
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,820
what else can I do for you?

672
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,900
I'm really busy.

673
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,300
Fine.

674
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,060

675
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,220
(Situ Mingtian Chairman)

676
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:42,980
Sir.

677
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,780
Has Xiang Yuan reported to the company?

678
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,420
Yes.

679
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,900
She asked me about the resume.

680
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,580
Shame on her.

681
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,220
Doesn't she know

682
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,380
what she is really like?

683
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,460
By the way, what's the relationship

684
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,340
between Chen Shan

685
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,780
and Xu Yanshi?

686
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,620
Why is she so protective of him?

687
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,820
She refused to let Xiang Yuan

688
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,460
join the technical group.

689
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,780
She even said

690
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,380
Xiang Yuan could be assigned as
the head of the department

691
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,380
other than the head of the group.

692
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,420
We tried every way to persuade her.

693
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,980
That's why we have Group II.

694
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,100
Chen Shan poached

695
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,220
Xu Yanshi

696
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,380
from Xingheng

697
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,980
at campus recruitment.

698
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,500
He was about to

699
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,340
sign a contract with Xingheng

700
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,620
when Chen Shan

701
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,700
poached him at the last minute.

702
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,500
As for their relationship,

703
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,060
I need to look it up.

704
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,100
Is Chen Shan so capable that

705
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,580
she can steal people from Xingheng?

706
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,380
Tell me about it.

707
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,900
I've never heard that Xingheng

708
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,740
would recruit undergraduate students
these years.

709
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,100
Over the last ten years,

710
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,580
they've only recruited masters
from top colleges.

711
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,140
As an undergraduate,

712
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,220
he got an offer from Xingheng.

713
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,820
He must be

714
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,420
an exceptional

715
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,260
talent.

716
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,060
Really?

717
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,220
Yeah.

718
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,100
They consider themselves

719
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,500
the industry leader

720
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,260
in global navigation satellite systems

721
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,180
in China, after all.

722
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,380
Right?

723
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,500
We, we are also the top...

724
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,740
Xingheng and Donghe

725
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,140
are competitors

726
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,340
and also the leaders of the industry.

727
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,660
We have achieved perfection respectively.

728
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,740
Shining at the top of the industry.

729
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,820
Don't flatter me.

730
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,420
I know clearly that

731
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,820
Xingheng is a

732
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,020
subsidiary of

733
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,820
the Navigation Research Institute.

734
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,980
How can we compare to them?

735
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,660
But Xu Yanshi

736
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,180
got a job offer from Xingheng

737
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,820
as an undergraduate.

738
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,940
It must be rumor.

739
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,820
If he is

740
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,060
really such an exceptional talent,

741
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,260
Chen Shan couldn't have stolen him.

742
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,940
Yeah, you're right.

743
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,500
(Team Leader of Technical Group I)

744
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,580
Boss,

745
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,300
what a small world.

746
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,460
Were you

747
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,100
in the same school as Miss Xiang?

748
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,940
Did you have a crush on her

749
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,300
or did she have a crush on you?

750
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,740
It's so awkward.

751
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,420
Is this her boyfriend?

752
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,500
He seems a little old.

753
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,100
No.

754
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,820
No?

755
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,900
How do you know?

756
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,020
And you said you didn't
have a crush on her?

757
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,140
I knew you had a crush on her

758
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,500
as soon as I saw the look
in your eyes yesterday.

759
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,500
That's her class teacher in high school.

760
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,860
Idiot.

761
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,460
This must be her boyfriend.

762
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,820
He's handsome.

763
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,060
That's her brother.

764
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,780
Seriously?

765
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,540
You even know her brother?

766
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,740
Idiot.

767
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,740
Calling me an idiot

768
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,180
only reflects your nervousness.

769
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,140
Do you remember

770
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,140
the last time when you

771
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:51,660
called me an idiot?

772
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,020
The day when you

773
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:52,780
went to the interview with Xingheng.

774
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,300
When I learned that

775
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,180
you were the only undergraduate

776
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,580
qualified for the interview
with Xingheng,

777
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,700
I was so excited
that I went to the library

778
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,100
to cheer you on.

779
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,180
But you called me an idiot.

780
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,140
Later on, you told me

781
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,460
that you were too nervous

782
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,260
to say anything to me.

783
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,140
So you called me an idiot.

784
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,460
Don't you think

785
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,260
I'm a genius?

786
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,900
Did you block her when you posted

787
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,460
the comment on your Moments?

788
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,100
If you didn't,

789
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,620
you'd better not attend the meeting.

790
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,300
I'm not sure you can get out alive.

791
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:33,580
No.

792
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,020
Impossible.

793
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,660
She doesn't

794
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,620
look like a hot-tempered person.

795
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,940
You can give it a try.

796
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:41,620
I...

797
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,740
I'm finished.

798
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,220
(Zhang Jun Add to contacts)

799
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:53,860
(Lin Qingqing Add to contacts)

800
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,500
(You Zhi Add to contacts)

801
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,700
(Shi Tianyou Add to contacts)

802
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,620
(Send)

803
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,380
(Sending)

804
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:04,340
(Moments)

805
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,780
(Why is there nothing)

806
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,340
(on Xu Yanshi's Moments?)

807
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,340
(Seriously?)

808
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,140
(Has he blocked me?)

809
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:27,340
(Received your red envelope.)

810
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,220
(Xu Yanshi,)

811
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,940
(are you so vindictive?)

812
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,740
(You didn't even grab my red envelope.)

813
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,300
Zhang Jun.

814
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,620
Why haven't Xu Yanshi and Gao Leng

815
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,740
arrived?

816
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:41,820
They...

817
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,580
Well...

818
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,460
I'm here.

819
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,860
Time's up. Let's begin.

820
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,380
Those who are absent

821
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,260
will have their bonus deducted.

822
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,980
Mr. Li and Li Chi of
the technical department

823
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,580
haven't arrived yet.

824
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,860
- Who told you to record them?
- Should I...

825
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,420
Gao Leng of the technical department
is absent.

826
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,220
Record it.

827
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,780
(Why only he is recorded?)

828
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,700
It's no big deal.

829
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,180
Forget about it.

830
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,980
Mr. Xu seemed to ask for leave

831
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,420
for Gao Leng just now.

832
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,820
He'll come later.

833
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,140
He asked for leave?

834
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,500
Then forget it.

835
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,420
Let me introduce her.

836
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,500
(The Third Quarter Summary Meeting
of Xi'an Velin) This is Xiang Yuan.

837
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,500
The newly appointed leader

838
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,660
of Group II in the technical department.

839
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,500
Greet her with applause.

840
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,300
Today we're having

841
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,980
the Third Quarter Summary Meeting.

842
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,500
The heads of each department,

843
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,620
please brief us.

844
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,100
Who is the first?

845
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,580
Sales department.

846
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,820
You first.

847
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,620
OK. Dear leaders and colleagues,

848
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,420
now I'll present you

849
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,220
with a summary of our work

850
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,620
in the third quarter.

851
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,380
(Meeting Room)
Dismiss.

852
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,100
The meeting is over.

853
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,340
Then why don't you leave?

854
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,340
Gao Leng wasn't aimed at you

855
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,580
when he posted that comment.

856
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,540
Over the last few years,

857
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,180
the headquarters have palmed
too many people off on us.

858
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,980
So he's a little defensive.

859
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,180
Are you afraid that I would bully him?

860
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:00,860
In your mind,

861
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,940
am I a narrow-minded

862
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,980
and vengeful person?

863
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,140
Shall we go?

864
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,300
Are you waiting for me?

865
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,340
Or what?

866
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,620
It's about lunch break, right?

867
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,140
There's still time.

868
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,420
We have another meeting.

869
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,140
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

870
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,900
Stop swiping your phone, Mr. Xu.

871
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,100
It's time for the meeting.

872
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,340
What's on your mind?

873
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,460
I'm thinking about

874
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,460
how to introduce you.

875
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,700
Just tell them
I'm a newcomer with connections.

876
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,900
Don't you say that

877
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,820
behind my back?

878
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,540
Isn't it true?

879
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,620
Do you really have friends?

880
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,140
Didn't Li Yongbiao introduce me?

881
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,020
If you insist on

882
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,380
introducing me again,

883
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,100
just tell them I'm your
high school friend.

884
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,580
Forget it.

885
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,060
No. 6 High School isn't a good school.

886
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:32,820
It may demean you

887
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,260
if you say that.

888
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:36,740
OK.

889
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,860
(Xu Yanshi, how dare you despise me?)

890
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,340
Does Boss know her?

891
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,900
They seem to be school friends.

892
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,460
That explains it.

893
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,300
They are coming.

894
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:03,940
Get down to business.

895
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,140
Boss just got instructions

896
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,380
about transferring a few people
to Group II

897
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,460
to work with Miss Xiang.

898
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,100
Let's volunteer for it.

899
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,900
Whoever wants to join her group,
raise your hand.

900
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,420
It doesn't matter.

901
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,300
I only

902
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,780
need one person.

903
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,540
Gao Leng,

904
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,500
among the people here,

905
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,300
I'm most familiar with you.

906
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,700
Join me, OK?

907
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,420
I'll ask Gao Leng

908
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,580
to give me a tour around the company

909
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,620
so I can orient myself.

910
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,260
May I,

911
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,460
Mr. Xu?

912
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,620
OK.

913
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,820
Wait.

914
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,780
I have no objections to you.

915
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,180
I just want to know

916
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,820
why I'm the only one

917
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,860
to join your group?

918
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,740
Because you're the most handsome.

919
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,940
OK. Welcome. Miss.

920
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,500
Who else wants to join them?

921
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,580
As a matter of fact,

922
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,060
I don't know anything.

923
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,460
So I don't need too many people.

924
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,980
You can do your work as usual.

925
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,020
Thanks, everyone.

926
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,500
I'm satisfied enough

927
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,100
to have Gao Leng.

928
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,220
Miss Xiang,

929
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,220
well,

930
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,340
may I join you?

931
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,340
OK.

932
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,180
Do you have anything else to say?

933
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,220
Everyone,

934
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,340
keep up the good work.

935
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,140
You're the future

936
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,300
of our motherland.

937
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,420
Is that all?

938
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,700
Do you want to hear more?

939
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,100
I'll tell you privately.

940
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,460
Dismiss.

941
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,460
(The Light of Technology
Xi'an Velin Technology)

942
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,020
Hello.

943
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,300
Is the new team leader

944
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,260
late on her first day of work?

945
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,660
Do you think

946
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,980
they've all asked for leave

947
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,380
on the first day?

948
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,620
All asked for leave?

949
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,980
Impossible.

950
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,260
You know perfectly well that

951
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,980
how difficult it is to ask for leave
from Stingy Li.

952
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,140
Even when you have to go to
weddings or funerals.

953
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,020
Leave work without permission.

954
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,740
Has Miss Xiang notified Boss?

955
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,340
I have no idea.

956
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,020
Did you see

957
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:08,900
how I turned the corner?

958
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,260
Sure.

959
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,860
Miss. Miss.

960
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,700
It's so much fun!

961
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,620
I know there is another

962
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,740
fun game nearby.

963
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,660
I've always wanted to go.

964
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,140
Shall we go and have a try?

965
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,260
No problem.

966
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:23,540
Great!

967
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,660
There is also a natural cave.

968
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,380
OK.

969
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,380
Do you want to
try paragliding?

970
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,300
Paragliding?

971
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:29,740
What?

972
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,020
Paragliding?

973
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,700
Is it like parachuting?

974
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,060
Is it exciting?

975
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,620
Have you never tried?

976
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,020
No, I haven't.

977
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,660
It isn't that exciting.

978
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,940
It isn't like parachuting.

979
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,300
It's like a tuk-tuk.

980
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,380
So, have you parachuted?

981
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,260
Awesome!

982
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:49,660
Then,

983
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,820
have you tried other

984
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,260
extreme sports?

985
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,140
Not many. Just a little.

986
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,100
Actually,

987
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,460
they are not very exciting.

988
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,140
But what should I do

989
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,660
next?

990
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,500
Let me see.

991
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,660
It's easy.

992
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,100
Do this first.

993
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,620
And it's done.

994
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,660
Thanks.

995
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,540
What's wrong?

996
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,420
I think our new

997
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,380
team leader

998
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,980
wants to please us

999
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,020
through this work trip.

1000
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:23,940
Then,

1001
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:24,980
she'll take

1002
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,620
Boss's place in our minds.

1003
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,980
So has Miss Xiang taken his place?

1004
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,740
How could that be possible?

1005
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,940

Amazing!

1019
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,580
What connections does she have?

1020
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,380
Why?

1021
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,340
Do you regret not having

1022
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,820
raised your hand that day?

1023
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,220
I won't be a lackey

1024
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,100
no matter how regretful I am.

1025
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,620
Does this woman

1026
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,660
try to please them?

1030
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,180
It was so fun just now.

1031
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,140
You look silly in that one.

1032
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,140
I don't think so.

1033
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,500
This one is good.

1034
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,780
This one looks great.

1035
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,180
Yeah.

1036
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,220
Send it to me.

1037
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,300
OK. I'll send it to you.

1038
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,180
Look at this one.

1039
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,660
Is this one better than yours?

1040
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,300
It really is.

1041
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,740
I should have posted this one.

1042
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,820
Send it to me first. Quickly.

1043
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,900
OK. I'll send it to you.

1044

This is so beautiful.

1045
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,460
All right.

1046
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,180
Let's start

1047
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,260
work now.

(48 hours ago)

1050
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,180
Come in.

1051
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,820
I'll go for the field survey.

1052
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:24,780
But I hope

1053
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,660
you can...

1054
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,980
Don't be so nosy.

1055
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,660
I didn't ask you to go with me.

1056
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:31,660
I just want to know

1057
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,180
if you can teach me

1058
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,500
remotely.

1059
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,820
You've heard it in the morning.

1060
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,420
The company has no budget for that.

1061
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,540
No one can go.

1062
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,340
I don't need the company's budget.

1063
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,620
I'll pay for it myself.

1064
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,140
How much is the trip?

1065
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,380
You even don't know the cost

1066
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,260
and want to pay on your own?

1067
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,500
I'm a newcomer.

1068
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,140
I want to do my best.

1069
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,420
This is a matter of principle.

1070
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,300
We shouldn't pay for official business.

00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:58,980
do the work, right?

1073
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,740
