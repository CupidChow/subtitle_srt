29
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,590
Xiang Yuan,

30
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,310
I'm telling you.

31
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,950
You are not

32
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,350
a qualified leader.

33
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,200
A picture was changed

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,680
but you didn't find it out, did you?

35
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,280
What?

36
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,560
Ate crow, huh?

37
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,190
Grandpa,

38
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,680
Li Chi always comes to work late
and leaves early.

39
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,030
He even skirts company rules.

40
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,750
A man like him

41
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,150
gets even more year-end income after tax

42
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,120
than many other employees.

43
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,710
Other hard-working employees

44
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,520
would be bitterly disappointed.

45
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,400
You want

46
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,520
every piece of your effort

47
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,360
to pay off

48
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,680
so that it'll prove your ability.

49
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,710
I totally understand.

50
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,280
But one day you'll reach

51
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,310
a higher position.

52
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,750
In a company,

53
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,280
the decisions

54
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,310
a director makes

55
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,000
can't always be

56
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,000
black or white.

57
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,870
So, we shouldn't let small problems

58
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,310
disturb the big picture.

59
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,150
Even small problems can't be solved,

60
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,710
let alone the big picture.

61
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,430
This thought is even more mysterious

62
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,430
than Mona Lisa.

63
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,360
There's a code for Mona Lisa.

64
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,280
It just hasn't been figured out yet.

65
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,800
Now, let me tell you

66
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,360
what the big picture is.

67
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,310
What is fairness?

68
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,030
No one knows

69
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,430
the exact definition of fairness,

70
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:54,680
right?

71
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,630
Even the boundaries of truth

72
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,590
have been more blurred.

73
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,560
So, what's fairness?

74
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,430
I think something is fair

75
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,240
but others do not.

76
00:03:59,240 --> 00:03:59,870
Fairness in ancient times

77
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,680
no longer works in modern times.

78
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,240
You think something is fair

79
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,080
but someone else doesn't.

80
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,560
It's hard to be fair.

81
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,030
I can help you

82
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,470
to get some fairness.

83
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,360
But actually,

84
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,870
this isn't fair.

85
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,560
OK.

86
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,030
I'll use the opportunity.

87
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,680
That's right. You would have said this.

88
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,270
Then I needn't have said so much.

89
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:19,580
(Old Man Situ)

90
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,750
His long speech really bores me.

91
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,680
Sir,

92
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,480
this is the email

93
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,600
Yuan sent you last night.

94
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,950
I printed it out.

95
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,360
How would you have it handled?

96
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,190
I read it.

97
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,480
Have it done as she asked.

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,310
You always care the most

99
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,560
about her.

100
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,190
For the sake

101
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,950
of what she said to me.

102
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,680
She's still young.

103
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,510
But before,

104
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,070
she wouldn't think much

105
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,950
about these things

106
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,870
or said that to me

107
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,190
for other people.

108
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,120
Looks like you bet with her

109
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,160
just to make her

110
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,190
improve herself,

111
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:17,830
right?

112
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,600
Exactly.

113
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,260
(Team Leader of Technical Group I)

114
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,950

00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,510
Umm...

117
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,040
Can you do this?

118
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,160
No.

119
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,830
What is this?

120
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,560
What can we do with it?

121
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,040
Impressive!

122
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,070
Pretty well!

123
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,630
- I admire you!

Hello, a package for you.

129

Put it in the doorway.

00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,800
Thank you.

131
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,120
I'll sign for it, then.

132
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,240
OK, OK.

133
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,040
- Thanks.
- All right.

134

Bye.

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,360
Hello.

138
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,070
Sorry.

139
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,630
Sorry, I misdialed.

140
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,190
I borrowed a book from you,

141
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:37,720
OK?

142
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,720
Book?

143
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,120
What book?

145
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,310
You can read that?

146
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,720
You weren't born

147
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,720
to read it, OK?

148
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,630
Fine.

149
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,950
Hope you'll study hard.

150
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,920
Thanks.

151
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,270
When I'm away these days,

152
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,430
you're all alone

153
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,390
but don't be childish.

154
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,310
Don't mess with others.

155
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,560
I don't want to mourn for you later.

156
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,750
Do I look that bored?

157
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,190
What do you think?

158
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:08,870
I'll hang up.

159
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,480
I quit.

160
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,070
Come on.

161
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:19,920
I won't read it.

162
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,870
(I'm telling you)

163
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,790
(according to my experience.)

164
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,630
(If you keep the strawberry,)

165
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,670

Hello, Boss.

Do you know how late it is now?

170
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,750
Keep an eye on Xiang Yuan for me.

171
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,670
Seriously? In the middle of the night?

172
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,030
Keep an eye on her.

173
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,790
And keep me informed.

174
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,000
Don't let her get in trouble.

175
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,120
What a cruel Boss!

176
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,630
I'll hang up.

177
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,480

179
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,390
Morning.

180
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,080
Why are you so sleepy in the morning?

181
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,270
No sleep last night?

Just now,

00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,240
I met Mr. Lin and Mr. Chen

187
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,390
from Kaisheng Technology.

188
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,120
They talked about you.

189
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,240
Talked about me?

190
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,600
Why?

191
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,510
To poach you, I guess.

192
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,360
How's Yang Pingshan?

193
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,320
One day before the business trip,

194
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,550
Yang Pingshan went

195
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,270
to the chairman's office

196
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,440
and they kinda had an open argument.

197
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,030
They're old foxes

198
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,270
who satirized each other.

199
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,720
Even though

200
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,200
they still talked to each other,

201
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,150
Yang Pingshan

202
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,440
said something offensive.

203
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,870
He said,

204
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,360
"In all business circles,

205
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,600
no other chairman

206
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,440
can be as old as you.

207
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,600
You don't hand over the power
even in your seventies."

208
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,670
He was suggesting that the chairman

209
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,630
should have a successor.

210
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,120
Our chairman

211
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,120
is indeed aged.

212
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,270
Yeah.

213
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,120
And his son and daughter-in-law died.

214
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,030
He only has his grandchildren now.

215
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,480
But neither of them is interested

216
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,320
in taking over the company.

217
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,360
One of them

218
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,790
has been working

219
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,200
on some flight bases.

220
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,270
The other one

221
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,240
wasted several years playing games.

222
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,750
Our chairman

223
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,030
has spent so many years

224
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,440
developing his company.

225
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,000
How could he want to give it

226
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,960
to someone else?

227
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,870
Have you listened

228
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,200
to what I said?

229
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,720
If Yang Pingshan

230
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,720
takes over the Donghe Group,

231
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,960
good times won't last long for Velin.

232
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,360
Anyway, we should have

233
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
a long-term plan.

234
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,030
Right?

235
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,240
Right.

236
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,510
The new girl...

237
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,670
How's she doing?

238
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,390
Xiang Yuan?

239
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,600
She's clever.

240
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,840
Can she keep up?

241
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,720
I think so,

242
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,270
if she's serious.

243
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,270
Good.

244
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,670
Take care of her if possible.

245
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,600
Your relative?

246
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,480
Yes.

247
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,320
She's the daughter of my friend.

248
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,670
Her mother was my teacher,

249
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,480
an expert

250
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,270
in the global navigation system.

251
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,630
She was in the lab for years

252
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,390
and couldn't take care of Xiang Yuan.

253
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,480
Xiang Yuan

254
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,720
was brought up by her grandparents.

255
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,390
I remember when she was little,

256
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,440
she was very clever.

257
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,240
At the age of five,

258
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,440
she took part in a quiz

259
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,320
on aerospace.

260
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,600
She shouted out the answers so fast

261
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,480
that pupils of about ten

262
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,600
were stunned.

263
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,550
Have a bite.

264
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,840
It's real.

265
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,480
(Xiang Yuan, Top Prize of Children Group)
What? I didn't lie, huh?

266
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,200
My mother taught me that.

267
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,550
She said I would

268
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,870
make a bigger difference than her.

269
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,750
I trust you.

270
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,550
Then why does it look like

271
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,440
she only has average talents?

272
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,940

275
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,440
Easy and quick, seriously?

276
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,500
(Easy and Quick,
Be a C Programming Master)

277
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,200
Hello.

278
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,870
Looks like we're arranged

279
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,120
to share this room.

280
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,510
Let me introduce myself.

281
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,080
I'm Bi Yuntao

282
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,720
from Kaisheng Technology.

283
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,670
Hello, I'm Xu...

284
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,630
I know you.

285
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,200
Xu Yanshi.

286
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,360
Mr. Lin talked about you.

287
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,150
He said you were...

288
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,630
Excuse me.

289
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,750
OK.

290
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,140
(Xiang Yuan)

291
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,780
(Leader of the Other Group)

292
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,670
What?

293
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,320
How are you doing with C Programming?

294
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,080
Good.

295
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,670
I nearly finished.

296
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,550
Sounds like you don't

297
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,510
need my help.

298
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,360
I'll hang up, then.

299
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,320
Oh.

300
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,270
Wait.

301
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,480
Are you available now?

302
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,480
I have some questions.

303
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,670
You know,

304
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,960
I nearly

305
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,270
finished reading this book.

306
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,270
But...

307
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,200
I think I have a problem

308
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,440
doing it on the computer.

309
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,320
Umm...

310
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,270
Something like Python...

311
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
So, you're still reading Chapter 1.

312
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,180
(Chapter 1)

313
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,070
Log on to QQ
[*QQ is an instant messenger]

314
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,030
and use Remote Assistance.

315
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,750
OK.

316
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,540
(Leader of the Other Group)

317
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,750
You can use
parameter variables for Python.

318
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,830
Let's start with something simple.

319
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,070
Python drawing is

320
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,160
to display data in graphical forms.

321
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,790
Then remove the coordinates.

322
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,830
Have a try.

323
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,960
It moved.

324
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,550
It isn't that hard.

325
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,960
Then why are you stuck in Chapter 1?

326
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:00,160
I'm laying a firm foundation

327
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,270
in basic knowledge

328
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,070
so that I'll make quick progress.

329
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,000
Try this, then.

330
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,720
You're indeed frustrating me.

331
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,400
I...

332
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,440
I just learned to do this.

333
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,830
It's easy.

334
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,070
Give it a go.

335
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,000
Wait a second. I'll try.

336
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,640
Done.

337
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,550

363
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,510
Not yet.

364
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Haven't pursued her yet?

365
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,200
She rejected me.

366
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,270
What?

367
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,270
Rejected you?

368
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,550
Who's she?

369
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,880
Is that weird?

370
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,680
Yes, of course.

371
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,240
But the way you pursue a girl

372
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,030
is indeed outdated.

373
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,590
The Cardioid

374
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,830
is frequently used in TV dramas.

375
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,240
What an old trick!

376
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,640
Let me teach you something new.

377
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,720
It'll work.

378
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,000
No, thanks.

379
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,500
(Your friend went offline.)

380
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,510
Fine.

381
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,720
What's the new trick?

382
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,640
Listen.

383
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,400
You can

384
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,830
operate her computer by remote control

385
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,440
to set up a pop-up,

386
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,590
asking her,

387
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,110
"Would you be my girlfriend?"

388
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,070
Then for canceling the pop-up,

389
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,160
you set "Yes"

390
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,880
or "Not girlfriend,

391
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,920
but wife".

392
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,790
She has to click one
before getting rid of it.

393
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,590
Impressive, isn't it?

394
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,200
Forget it.

395
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,110
I don't want to push her too hard.

396
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,750
Fine.

397
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:17,550
Good luck.

398
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,240
Why did she go offline?

399
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,070
(Why could Xu Yanshi)

400
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,400
(do such a romantic thing?)

401
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,660
(Old Man Situ)

402
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,680
Just get to the point.

403
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,510
I'm going to work.

404
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,790
Why are you so impatient

405
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:32,110
with your amiable grandpa?

406
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,240
I'm rushing to work

407
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,030
so that I can get back to you soon.

408
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,830
Li Chi will work
in the logistics department

409
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,310
and the transfer order is issued.

410
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,350
Mm.

411
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,350
That really worked.

412
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,440
There's another file.

413
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,110
Your commission

414
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,550
to be the director
of the technical department

415
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,110
has also been issued.

416
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,310
What about the former director?

417
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,680
Yang Pingshan transferred him

418
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,070
to the headquarters.

419
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,440
How did Yang Pingshan

420
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,110
have so much power

421
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,350
to transfer a middle-level manager

422
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,440
without your approval?

423
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,310
Don't bother about this.

424
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,750
Anyway, your position as the director

425
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,640
has been decided.

426
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,680
Your grandma is aware, too.

427
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,590
Can't you let her

428
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,640
get some peace in heaven

429
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,960
without worrying about me?

430
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,750
Don't think too much.

431
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,070
I'm just informing you,

432
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,030
you know.

433
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,720
(Then I'll also be)

434
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,640
(one of them who use connections)

435
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,480
(and keep Xu Yanshi down.)

436
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,510
Grandpa,

437
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,310
let me recommend someone to you.

438
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,240
Except him,

439
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,480
no one is perfect to be

440
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,440
the director of the technical department.

441
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,000
Who's he?

442
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,270
Team Leader of Technical Group I.

443
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,400
No way.

444
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,590
This is a very important position

445
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,830
and you are the only candidate.

446
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,750
But how can I convince others?

447
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,640
It's your own business.

448
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,590
Anyway, the transfer order

449
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,550
has been issued.

450
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,790
From this day on,

451
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,110
you're the director.

452
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,000
As for how you handle

453
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,590
the superior-subordinate relationship

454
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,510
or lead your teams,

455
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,640
you work hard on it.

456
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,070
But I...

457
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:57,920
I'll hang up.

458
00:23:59,030 --> 00:23:59,480
Grandpa...

459
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,790
(What do I do?)

460
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,510
(I suddenly became the director.)

461
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,110
(How can I explain it to Xu Yanshi?)

462
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,510
Morning.

463
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:26,960
Morning.

464
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,270
You came out a little bit late.

465
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:38,630
Mm.

466
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,030
Are you late?

467
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:40,980
Mm.

468
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,160
(How about I buy him dinner?)

469
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,960
(No, no.)

470
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,160
(Dinner isn't enough)

471
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,310
(for such a big issue.)

472
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,270
Let me drive you, then.

473
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,010
Mm.

474
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,400
Mr. Lu,

475
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,750
my company is in the Industrial Park.

476
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,000
I can take a taxi.

477
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,310
The Industrial Park?

478
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,000
What a coincidence!

479
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,070
I'm going there, too.

480
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,030
I can give you a lift.

481
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:14,910
Wow.

482
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,380
(Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Extra Meal)

483
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,440
Juice and sandwich for Tuesday.

484
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,640
Correct.

485
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:37,960
Boss.

486
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,480
When were you back?

487
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,270
Last night.

488
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:44,640
Thanks.

489
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,070
What?

490
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,590
No, no, you can't.

491
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,790
You can't eat this, Boss.

492
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,030
It's for my...

493
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:52,750
Fine.

494
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,040
Wait.

495
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,200
Umm...

496
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,640
Did you read

497
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,510
Yang's letter of transfer?

498
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,160
As far as I see,

499
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,310
the position of the director

500
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,240
will certainly be yours.

501
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,830
Throughout our department,

502
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,510
except me,

503
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,070
no one can be

504
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,160
as good as you.

505
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,160
Congratulations.

506
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,400
That's a huge promotion for you.

507
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,440
If you really have nothing to do,

508
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,680
how about I ask Miss Xiang

509
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,920
to give you some other work?

510
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,440
Don't.

511
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,510
Don't do that.

512
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,200
Look...

513
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,240
You Zhi.

514
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,790
He has nothing to do.

515
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,200
Arrange some work for him.

516
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,720
Don't… Don't keep your eye on me.

517
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,380
(Team Leader of Technical Group I)

518
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:03,880
I think it's something

519
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,200
Xiang Yuan drank last time.

520
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,310
Xiang Yuan,

521
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,750
is this your phone?

522
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,160
Yes, thanks.

523
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,680
Xu Yanshi!

524
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,110
Xu Yanshi!

525
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,790
Slow down. Wait for me.

526
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,590
Aren't you supposed
to be back this afternoon?

527
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,160
Why are you back so early?

528
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,750
Don't you rest at home?

529
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,590
I'm thirsty.

530
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,270
And I came to buy some milk tea.

531
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,830
Coming to work for milk tea?

532
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,030
I don't believe that.

533
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,830
I have something

534
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,720
to tell you, actually.

535
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,110
Go ahead.

536
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,030
I won't beat you.

537
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,830
Not now, then.

538
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,200
I'll tell you later.

539
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:03,880
Whatever.

540
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,680
Dump this.

541
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,720
Awful.

542
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:10,790
Tastes good.

543
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:26,680
Then don't dump it.

544
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,640
Why didn't he dump it personally?

545
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,070
How is this done?

546
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,550
Lin Qingqing,

547
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,350
where...

548
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,310
Where did you get this sandwich?

549
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,590
From Shu.

550
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,750
On my way to buy breakfast,

551
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,750
I met her.

552
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,030
She then gave me this.

553
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,960
What's wrong?

554
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,680
No... Nothing.

555
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,480
What breakfast?

556
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,590
To her,

557
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,400
it's just trash.

558
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:32,640
Come in.

559
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,920
Mr. Xu, the file has been printed.

560
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,830
Please come and check.

561
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:35,270
OK.

562
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,240
What's wrong with you?

563
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,400
Why do you sigh in the early morning?

564
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,750
It'll bring bad luck.

565
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,270
Have you read

566
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,240
Mr. Yang's letter of transfer?

567
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,790
I wonder if Boss can...

568
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,880
If I remember correctly,

569
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,400
you haven't given me
your weekly report yet.

570
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,220
(Schematic of Time Module)

571
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,750
Why is Li Chi late again?

572
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:14,830
Just as his name indicates.
[*Chi means late in Chinese]

573
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,480
Hope he would be forever gone.

574
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,200
You delivered breakfast

575
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,480
and had a conversation.

576
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,240
Go have the meeting.

577
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,880
Miss Xiang, time for the meeting.

578
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,720
Boss.

579
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,830
Leave me alone.

580
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,200
Miss Xiang, you'd better hurry.

581
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,790
I guess the commission
of the director was issued.

582
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,480
All leaders would be present.

583
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,790
Leave me alone. Leave me alone!

584
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,550
I should go, then.

585
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,240
OK, everyone's here.

586
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,400
Let's start the meeting.

587
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,960
This morning, you received

588
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,160
Yang Weiping's letter of transfer.

589
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,200
Now, let me announce

590
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,920
the next director

591
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,240
of the technical department.

592
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,310
Boss.

593
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,200
Boss.

594
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,590
Li Yongbiao is looking at you.

595
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,880
I told you.

596
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,310
You would be the director.

597
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,270
Xiang Yuan, Team Leader
of Technical Group II.

598
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:54,590
What...

599
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,270
Xiang Yuan? Why?

600
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:01,920
All right.

601
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,270
Miss Xiang, give a speech.

602
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,240
I appreciate the trust from our company.

603
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,110
Besides,

604
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,110
I have another

605
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,270
transfer order

606
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,000
for Li Chi of my department.

607
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,750
Under the order of headquarters,

608
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,310
from this day on,

609
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,680
Li Chi will leave our department

610
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,550
for the logistics department.

611
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,750
What did you say?

612
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,160
Are you sure it's Li Chi?

613
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,920
How about we let him stand up,

614
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,960
come to the center,

615
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,160
and turn around

616
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,590
so that we can confirm?

617
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,680
(Technical Loafing Group, Lin Qingqing)
(Our team leader is so aggressive.)

618
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,310
(Not the team leader,)

619
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,200
(but the director.)

620
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,960
(What's your sarcasm for?)

621
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:01,960
(She sent away Li Chi)

622
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,480
(and it also avenged you.)

623
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,440
(Yeah.)

624
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,270
(The enemy of our enemy is our friend.)

625
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:06,750
(Besides,)

626
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:07,720
(Li Qin, the evil woman,)

627
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,960
(has held Boss back for a long time.)

628
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,440
Mr. Li and I

629
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,480
didn't know this.

630
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,070
But you hastily announced it

631
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,830
at this meeting.

632
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,590
Isn't it rushed?

633
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,720
Maybe you didn't know.

634
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,720
The email from the headquarters

635
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,680
was carbon copied to all leaders,

636
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,720
including Mr. Li

637
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,830
as well as you.

638
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,680
But I understand.

639
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,880
After all, you don't come to the office

640
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,550
365 days a year.

641
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,000
Right.

642
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,590
I knew this.

643
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,680
But Miss Xiang,

644
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,270
I had planned to talk to Li Chi

645
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:51,550
in private.

646
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,720
I didn't expect you to make it public.

647
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,440
You made sense, Mr. Li.

648
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,880
It was thoughtless of me

649
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,920
to have done this.

650
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,480
My apologies, Ms. Li.

651
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,920
But actually,

652
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,880
for Ms. Li's sake,

653
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,150
I gave Li Chi quite a lot of chances.

654
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,070
But he didn't cherish any.

655
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,550
He often made mistakes in his work

656
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,880
and infuriated his colleagues.

657
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,800
He even threatened his superiors

658
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,920
and disrupted the harmony
of our department.

659
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,230
A new broom sweeps clean.

660
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,360
You're doing really fine.

661
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,030
All right.

662
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,590
No more discussion for this.

663
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,190
Now that an order is issued,

664
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,920
let's just follow it.

665
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:36,670
Dismiss.

666
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,110
I have no doubt

667
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,510
about the order.

668
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,230
But young lady,

669
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,920
if you often go over
your superiors' heads,

670
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,630
you'll easily offend them.

671
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,550
To transfer an employee,

672
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,710
you should first

673
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,710
inform Mr. Li or me,

674
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,630
instead of getting to the headquarters

675
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,670
through your connections.

676
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,280
If everyone behaves

677
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,190
like you,

678
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,030
Mr. Li and I

679
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,110
wouldn't need to come to work, huh?

680
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,110
Understand?

681
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:12,920
Also,

682
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,880
even if you have supporters
in the headquarters,

683
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,110
you should keep a low profile.

684
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,880
People don't take sides

685
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,320
in the way you do.

686
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,230
You can't take a side before you confirm.

687
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:27,000
You've just worked here for two months.

688
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,670
When you take the wrong side

689
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,960
before you know it,

690
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,840
you won't even know

691
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,280
how badly you may end up.

692
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,230
Ms. Li,

693
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,920
as for whether I went
over my superior's head,

694
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,480
ask Mr. Li about this

695
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,550
and you'll know.

696
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,880
And for the side-taking thing...

697
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,480
I think

698
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,590
you may still have to ask Mr. Yang.

699
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,280
What do you think?

700
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,480
Did Mr. Yang know
about this transfer order,

701
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,840
or did he not?

702
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,230
If he knew,

703
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,110
why didn't he tell you?

704
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,920
As a new employee,

705
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,400
my point

706
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,280
about side-taking is

707
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,000
that taking the wrong side is OK.

708
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:10,230
Yet it's not OK
that I think I take the right side

709
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,800
and no one

710
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,190
regards me as one of them.

711
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,150
Do I make sense, Ms. Li?

712
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:24,540
(Deputy General Manager)

713
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,230
Hello.

714
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,320
You approved of Li Chi's transfer?

715
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,000
Yes.

716
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,590
He was going too far.

717
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:41,280
Working in the logistics department

718
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,150
for some days

719
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,190
wouldn't be bad for him.

720
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,150
After some time,

721
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,550
I'll promote him,

722
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,760
OK?

723
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,710
Li Chi knows many of our secrets.

724
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,550
How dare you let him go like this?

725
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,150
Then try hard

726
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,760
to appease him.

727
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:09,840
Why is Boss's position taken again?

728
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,960
I'm just so...

729
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,510
Yeah.

730
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:12,880
What the heck!

731
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,550
What are you looking at?

732
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,110
When you took away his position,

733
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,440
you didn't look this guilty.

734
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,110
Drink one and buy me more.

735
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,710
What Miss Xiang did

736
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,710
is indeed egregious.

737
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:31,880
She wasn't

738
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,440
rubbing a little salt into your wound.

739
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:34,480
She was actually

740
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,840
rubbing a huge amount of salt

741
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,670
into all your wounds.

742
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,670
Also,

743
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,030
speaking of Velin's achievements

744
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:39,960
in recent years,

745
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,760
if you hadn't

746
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,070
satisfied every demand

747
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,070
of our customers

748
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,070
with your excellent skills,

749
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,320
how could we

750
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,190
gain a firm foothold

751
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,150
on this declining market?

752
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,440
But in the end,

753
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,800
even a new employee like her

754
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,920
was promoted faster than you.

755
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:02,930
Wow.

756
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,280
New flavor.

757
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,710
Just one sip.

758
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,590
No way.

759
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,670
But I tasted your drink before.

760
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,630
I'm a neat freak today.

761
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,840
Boss is in a fit of anger.

762
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,190
He's even a neat freak now.

763
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:29,840
Xiang...

764
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,550
Miss Xiang,

765
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,030
you'd better not poke the bear

766
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,280
until later.

767
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,960
Tastes good.

768
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,110
Two bottles already.

769
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,670
Petty man.

770
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,440
(Xu Yanshi)
(Do you have time now?)

771
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,360
(Umm...)

772
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,710
(Summarize the data report of last month)

773
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,070
(and email it to me.)

774
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,700
(Xu Yanshi
Summary Data Report)

775
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,540
(Summary Data Report)

776
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,060
(Monthly Report)

777
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,320
Miss Xiang,

778
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:03,190
congratulations!

779
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,000
What do you stare at me for?

780
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,590
I just came to pack my things.

781
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,630
Don't rub it in.

782
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,630
Pack your things and leave.

783
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,960
A loser is even bullied by a dog.

784
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,360
Who do you mean a dog?

785
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,630
Anyone who talks back!

786
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,630
Are you done shouting?

787
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,670
Then get out!

788
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,550
Dump this

789
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,030
in the dustbin of the toilet.

790
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:09,920
Thank you.

791
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,510
But you have a dustbin.

792
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:12,440
Too much sugar in it

793
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:13,960
will get ants here.

794
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:14,590
That's...

795
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,030
That's all?

796
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,070
You're upset?

797
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,110
What?

798
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:39,620
(Xiang Yuan)

799
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,320
It's for you.

800
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:11,590
Did she poison it?

801
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,550
You must be tired, Mr. Xu.

802
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,510
Have a massage.

803
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,000
That's mine.

804
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,590
Just lend it...

805
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,800
To your director.

806
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,480
Good boy.

807
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,630
(Xu Yanshi)
(Come over.)

808
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,030
Shred this paper for me.

809
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:19,880
OK.

810
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:22,630
Wait a second.

811
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:25,840
I'm a little bit sleepy.

812
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:27,920
Get me a cup of coffee

813
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:29,150
without sugar.

814
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,070
OK.

815
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:42,440
If you don't mind,

816
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,230
I should go.

817
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,670
Mr. Li asked me

818
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,550
to get the leave permit

819
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:52,070
at three.

820
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:54,070
From the HR department upstairs.

821
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,400
Go get it for me.

822
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,480
If you don't want it, fine.

823
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:03,590
I have legs and I can walk.

824
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:04,920
(Calm down.)

825
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,400
(After all,)

826
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,550
(you took away his position.)

827
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:10,000
I'll go.

828
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,840
How could I let you go?

829
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:33,280
(Xu Yanshi,)

830
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:36,230
(if I didn't feel guilty for you,)

831
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,880
(I wouldn't be doing all this for you!)

832
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:40,710
(Director of the Technical Department
Pull)

833
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:41,400
Come in.

834
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:42,960
Here, Yuan.

835
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:46,920
Yuan,

836
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:48,920
why are you going to Boss's office

837
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,590
all day long?

838
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,190
Long story.

839
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,360
You can't be pursuing him,

840
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,670
can you?

841
00:44:58,030 --> 00:44:59,440
(Seriously?)

842
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,550
Don't talk nonsense.

843
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:03,800
I've just been promoted, huh?

844
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,320
I just...

845
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:06,800
I want to serve you guys a little bit.

846
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:09,070
It's hard to be a leader, you know.

847
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,360
Mm.

848
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,280
I knew it.

849
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:12,760
Even a director

850
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,320
has to work hard, too.
