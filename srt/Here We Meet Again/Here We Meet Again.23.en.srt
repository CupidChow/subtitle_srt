(Seat: Row 4, No.03)

32
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,200
(And he was next to me.)

33
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,840
I'm hungry.

34
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,680
What would you like?

35
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,400
Whatever you cook.

36
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,030
Flavor it yourself.

37
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,710
Won't you help me?

38
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,000
I have my hands full.

39
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,120
It smells good,

40
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,710
but also

41
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,360
a little sour.

42
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,360
I didn't put vinegar in.

43
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,360
Really?

44
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,840
Then why did I

45
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,590
smell it?

46
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,920
Alright.

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,040
Don't vent your anger on a girl.

48
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,510
So if I didn't

49
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,830
come back today,

50
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,630
would you watch the play with him?

51
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,310
So, that's what you're mad about?

52
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,070
Shouldn't I be mad?

53
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,160
Should I give him the tickets

54
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,750
and tell him on WeChat that

55
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,430
your real boyfriend
couldn't come back

56
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,560
and as your backup,

57
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,950
he should spend some time with you?

58
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,430
Sounds good.

59
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,310
You can take a hint,

60
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,480
boyfriend.

61
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,160
Aren't you going to explain?

62
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,310
To show you respect,

63
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,750
I'd better drink up this bottle
of vinegar.

64
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,750
Look,

65
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,600
my boyfriend is so good to me,

66
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,120
but still, I upset him.

67
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,680
I'm such an ungrateful person!

68
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,040
Don't try to fool me.

69
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,870
Hold it.

70
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,070
Mr. Lu.

71
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,560
Xiang Yuan.

72
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,950
Would you tell me

73
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,120
where you got

74
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,560
the play ticket today?

75
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,390
The sponsor gave it to me.

76
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,190
What's wrong?

77
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,480
Nothing.

78
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,480
Thanks.

79
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,920
Apologize.

80
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,920
You wronged me.

81
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,040
Suppose I

82
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,040
drink up the bottle of vinegar?

83
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,480
Help yourself.

84
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,720
Let me give you a ride.

85
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,950
No, thanks.

86
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,120
You should go to work.

87
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,390
I just want to

88
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,800
spend more time with you.

89
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,510
Where is my car?

90
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,310
Did you drive last night?

91
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,420
(Receipt of Parking Fares)

92
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,740
(Personnel Assignment)

93
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,700
(Notice on Personnel Assignment)
The employee of technical department

94
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,390
(Lin Qingqing)
promoted to Class B from Class C is...

95
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,190
Didn't I recommend Shi Tianyou?

96
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,160
Why is it Lin Qingqing?

97
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,040
Don't frown no matter
how mad you are,

98
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,720
or even edible bird's nests
can't save you.

99
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,750
Here you are again.

100
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,040
Hello.

101
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,480
Don't you think it's bad

102
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,040
to disturb an old man's sleep?

103
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,240
Grandpa.

104
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,720
What a nice surprise.

105
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,560
I dreamed of you last night.

106
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,360
You told me you missed me.

107
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,680
So I called you back

108
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,070
immediately today.

109
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,390
You know how to please Grandpa.

110
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,000
What do you want? Go ahead.

111
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,390
We have a quota for promoting

112
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,120
an employee to Class B

113
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,190
in the technical department of Velin.

114
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,240
I recommended Shi Tianyou.

115
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,750
How come Lin Qingqing

116
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,950
gets promoted?

117
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,680
It wasn't Shi Tianyou.

118
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,750
Lin Qingqing was recommended
in the first place.

119
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,600
Aren't you busy every day?

120
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,000
How do you know that?

121
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,240
I asked Bai

122
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,720
to keep an eye on it.

123
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,360
I've read every email

124
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,040
concerning Velin,

125
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,950
OK?

126
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,430
Is there anything else?

127
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,750
Bye-bye.

128
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,910
My goodness!

129
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:44,750
Alright.

130
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,840
Now you've got

131
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,320
the work plan for next week.

132
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,550
Get back to work.

133
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,550
Miss Xiang,

134
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,150
I hear that there's a vacancy

135
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,960
for a deputy team leader

136
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,360
in your department.

137
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,630
I think Lin Qingqing

138
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,120
performs well recently

139
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,870
and is recognized by the headquarters.

140
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,600
She is qualified for the position.

141
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,720
Ms. Li, why are you

142
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,630
concerned with the work

143
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,510
in my department?

144
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,150
The vacancy hasn't been filled
for a while.

145
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,870
I'm worried about

146
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,870
the work

147
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,030
in your department.

148
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,670
Don't bother,

149
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,200
Ms. Li.

150
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,670
I've already had a candidate

151
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,750
for the deputy team leader.

152
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,720
I want You Zhi to assume the post.

153
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,960
Next week,

154
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,360
I'll go to the headquarters.

155
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,910
OK.

156
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,780
(Meeting Room)

157
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,270
Have you heard about
what happened to Lin Qingqing

158
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:34,870
from the technical department?

159
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,750
What happened?

160
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,360
She's said to have sought
connections in the headquarters.

161
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,080
She's got a fast-track promotion
to Class B

162
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,790
and will be appointed as
deputy team leader as well.

163
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,910
She's been promoted so quickly!

164
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,360
She couldn't have achieved that easily.

165
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,080
I assume

166
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,120
she is the mistress of some

167
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,080
top-ranking guy.

168
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,150
Very likely, I'm telling you.

169
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,870
Would you shut up?

170
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,320
If you have time to gossip,

171
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,960
why don't you do some more work?

172
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,080
Who are you?

173
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,240
Mind your own business!

174
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,360
It is my business!

175
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,440
- I'm telling you, today...
- Gao Leng.

176
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,550
What's your relationship with her?

177
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,670
Is he crazy?

178
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,000
Never mind.

179
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,440
Come with me.

180
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,380
(Director of Sales Department)

181
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,910
Could you

182
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,960
catch a break

183
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,320
and not make trouble?

184
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,120
Now Xu Yanshi has left.

185
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,000
Don't you think Xiang Yuan

186
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,320
is busy enough?

187
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,150
Does it have anything to do with you?

188
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,390
I must intervene in this matter today.

189
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,550
Lin Qingqing won't be

190
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,670
someone's mistress.

191
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,240
She was the first to join

192
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,440
Miss Xiang's group with me.

193
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,910
I believe in her.

194
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,030
I won't let others

195
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,440
spread rumors about her.

196
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,150
Now, none of us is clear

197
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,910
about what happened

198
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,360
to Lin Qingqing.

199
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,200
Can you leave it alone?

200
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,360
I'm talking to you.

201
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,600
Do you hear me?

202
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,000
Are you done?

203
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,200
I have to go if you're done.

204
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,240
I...

205
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,390
You mean

206
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,840
Li Yongbiao and Li Qin

207
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,080
modified the recommendation list?

208
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,910
I asked about it.

209
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,150
Lin Qingqing was on the list

210
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,840
in the first place.

211
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,510
I gave the list

212
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,960
to Li Qin

213
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,030
and Li Yongbiao personally.

214
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,030
So they were the only people

215
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,120
who had the chance.

216
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,720
Isn't it weird?

217
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,440
Just now at the meeting,

218
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,550
Li Qin

219
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,390
even recommended Lin Qingqing

220
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,320
to be the deputy team leader

221
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,030
of the technical department.

222
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,910
Lin Qingqing?

223
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,120
And Li Qin and Li Yongbiao?

224
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,390
Why did I never hear that

225
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,440
she had anything to do

226
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,150
with the two of them?

227
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,360
What's wrong, Miss Xiang?

228
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,200
Do you have any trouble?

229
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,630
On the night of the new product launch,

230
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,670
Li Chi didn't lock me up, did he?

231
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,270
What are you suggesting?

232
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,840
I felt it was strange then.

233
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,240
If he could avoid the surveillance camera
when he placed the board,

234
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,670
how could he be caught

235
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,790
by the camera

236
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,360
in the stairwell?

237
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,960
He knew I would
look into it thoroughly afterward.

238
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,790
Why would he invite trouble?

239
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,390
So?

240
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,750
So I found another

241
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,870
surveillance video.

242
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,840
The one who placed the fake board
indicating prop room

243
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,320
and replaced the board with
"For Repair"

244
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,480
was Lin Qingqing, right?

245
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,390
Then?

246
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,720
What else?

247
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,960
Didn't you try to

248
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,510
teach me a lesson

249
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,630
by bribing Lin Qingqing?

250
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,720
Not a lesson.

251
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,750
I just wanted to tell you,

252
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,750
in the workplace,

253
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,240
there were no forever friends,

254
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,510
only forever benefits.

255
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,910
Even the people closest to you

256
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,000
are not reliable.

257
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,030
Never believe in
superficial relationships.

258
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,550
Moreover,

259
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,240
Li Chi also

260
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,790
had something to do with it.

261
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,910
I told him the plan.

262
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,480
I also asked him

263
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,030
to stay there.

264
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,030
I knew that you would

265
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,750
look into it thoroughly

266
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,270
when you found out about this.

267
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,790
That's why I aggravated

268
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,440
your dispute on the meeting.

269
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,750
I knew Li Chi would

270
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,440
lose his temper and
start a fight wildly.

271
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,390
And Li Yongbiao

272
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,840
would have to fire him.

273
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,200
Do you know why

274
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,030
Ying Yinyin claimed that

275
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,960
Li Chi took secret snaps?

276
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,630
I told her that, too.

277
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,600
Why would you?

278
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,320
Why would I single Li Chi out?

279
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,120
Because he is just like

280
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,720
an ungrateful and vicious wolf cub

281
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,030
who dares to bite anyone.

282
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,360
Do you know what this strategy is?

283
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,600
To murder a person
with a borrowed knife

284
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,910
and kill two birds with one stone.

285
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,750
Book me

286
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,960
a flight to Shanghai.

287
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,670
The earliest.

288
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,750
OK. Thanks.

289
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,060
(Leader of the Other Group)

290
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,060
(Xiang Yuan)

291
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,660
(Xiang Yuan)

292
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:18,490
(Thanks for Watching)

293
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,600
Mr. Duan,

294
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,320
as you can see,

295
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,030
this is what we've been doing

296
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,670
in terms of the technology recently.

297
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,320
Since you are here,

298
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,600
we have some other news

299
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,840
to share with you.

300
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,320
What good news?

301
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,000
Yanshi,

302
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,670
you are the hero

303
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,440
of the whole project.

304
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,270
You should say.

305
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,240
In addition to improving

306
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,030
the navigation accuracy of

307
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:40,960
our drone system,

308
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,120
an extra feature has also been added.

309
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,630
Many of our customers

310
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,200
have complained that

311
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,000
our drones might get lost

312
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,790
as a result of not being able to return.

313
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,440
To solve the problem,

314
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,870
we've developed
an anti-interference function

315
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,720
for this system.

316
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,790
It can effectively improve

317
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,720
the performance of drones

318
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,080
to turn back

319
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,790
while losing signals.

320
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,320
Moreover, today,

321
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,390
we've applied for a patent

322
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,600
on the technology.

323
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:02,870
So,

324
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,640
today is definitely

325
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,680
worth celebrating.

326
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,350
After all,

327
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,160
even Wujiang,

328
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,200
the leader of the industry,

329
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,030
hasn't made such a breakthrough

330
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,400
in this technology so far.

331
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,160
This is really great news.

332
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,070
Mr. Lin,

333
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,960
with the blessing of this technology,

334
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,270
our future cooperation

335
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,680
will go better.

336
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,790
Sure, we can cooperate.

337
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,350
But,

338
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,270
Mr. Duan,

339
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,920
we need to renegotiate

340
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,880
the contract price.

341
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,830
One more thing,

342
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,110
Lu,

343
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,720
this young man,

344
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,550
is polite

345
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,110
and sociable.

346
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,270
He must be

347
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,310
a winged,

348
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:41,640
well,

349
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,270
a winged steed to you.

350
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,750
Junma,
[*Junma means winged steed in Chinese.]

351
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,110
no, Junliang, right?

352
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,960
Junliang.

353
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,720
Junliang

354
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,790
used to go to

355
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,070
the same school as Yanshi.

356
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:52,830
I heard that

357
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,200
they had

358
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,830
an unpleasant history

359
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,960
while in school,

360
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,070
some trivial disagreements.

361
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,830
Maybe I'm a little narrow-minded,

362
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,920
but

363
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,160
I wonder if it would

364
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,640
affect our future

365
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,680
cooperation.

366
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,200
Mr. Lin,

367
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,790
it's hard to avoid

368
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,830
bicker and fights
between school friends.

369
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,880
But don't worry,

370
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,720
we will

371
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,310
take care of it.

372
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,070
I feel relieved.

373
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,110
Is this your third cup?

374
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,400
Don't drink too much.

375
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,310
(I'm so stupid.)

376
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,750
(I asked for it.)

377
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,000
My car!

378
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,640
Miss,

379
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,880
you're so heavy-handed.

380
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,880
My car is parked here.

381
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,350
It almost moved one meter forward.

382
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,590
Is the engine OK?

383
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,480
I'm sorry.

384
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,680
What's the point of apologizing?

385
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,480
Why weren't you careful?

386
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,480
I'll compensate for your loss.

387
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,240
Miss,

388
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,550
I think

389
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,680
you're pretty.

390
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,920
What about this?

391
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,750
Let me have your WeChat.

392
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,110
We can talk about

393
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,310
the compensation later.

394
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,790
OK.

395
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,110
You know what,

396
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:30,720
you may not afford to

397
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,960
indemnify me for the damage to my car.

398
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:32,790
But I

399
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,830
have a soft spot

400
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,880
for pretty girls.

401
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,160
We're going to

402
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,000
have dinner now.

403
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,750
Why don't you join us?

404
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,510
Lin Kairui.

405
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:39,880
No problem.

406
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,240
Don't worry. I'm busy.

407
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,790
- My WeChat.
- Dog Ray.

408
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,720
How do you know my nickname?

409
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,110
You...

410
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,030
Let me add you.

411
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,550
We can talk privately later.

412
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,510
Xu Yanshi.

413
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,880
What are you doing?

414
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,830
Be my girlfriend, will you?

415
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,440
What?

416
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,790
I can try.

417
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,920
No, wait.

418
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,550
Do you have to step in?

419
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,750
It turns out that

420
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,000
Cardioid was for her.

421
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,000
What Cardioid?

422
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,240
The girl he chased with

423
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,680
the Cardioid.

424
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,510
A trick more old-fashioned than mine?

425
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,030
I agree.

426
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,070
But

427
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,110
did you flirt with

428
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,510
his girlfriend just now?

429
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,160
Will Mr. Xu...

430
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,070
I'm his boss.

431
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,680
He can do nothing to me.

432
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,680
Let me pour you

433
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,070
a glass of wine to atone for

434
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,000
my misdeeds.

435
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,480
- No. No.
- Allow me.

436
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,960
I'll drink this.

437
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,000
But, Dog Ray,

438
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,070
you should drink more

439
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,350
to warm your hurt heart
after the breakup.

440
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,880
Ouch.

441
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,550
Well, Mr. Xu,

442
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,480
don't you think

443
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,270
you should

444
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,590
introduce

445
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,310
formally

446
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,160
to us

447
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,070
this Cardioid lady?

448
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,590
That night,

449
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,590
Bi was in the same room with me.

450
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,070
OK.

451
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,640
Let me formally introduce

452
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,790
my girlfriend,

453
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,550
Xiang Yuan.

454
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,000
Xiang Yuan,

455
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,510
we've expected you

456
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,790
for a long time.

457
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,160
Mr. Lin, I've heard so much about you.

458
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,110
No, no.

459
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,070
We've heard more about you.

460
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,200
Little Cardioid.

461
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,240
You know what,

462
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,960
if you didn't come,

463
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,110
we would fly to Xi'an together

464
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,160
to visit you.

465
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,480
We'd like to see

466
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,240
his mysterious girlfriend
with our own eyes.

467
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,160
You know what,

468
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,200
a while ago,

469
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,070
there was a serious problem

470
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,790
with the technology of our project.

471
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,110
Mr. Xu,

472
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,240
in order to make time

473
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,680
to date you,

474
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,160
he stayed up

475
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,440
several nights working.

476
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,880
We were so moved.

477
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,590
Alright. No more jokes.

478
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,440
Let me make a toast.

479
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,400
Welcome

480
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,960
Mr. Xu's girlfriend,

481
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,720
Xiang Yuan.

482
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,680
Cheers!

483
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,110
You can drink water.

484
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:28,920
Welcome.

00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:07,510
since

501
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,440
your girlfriend is here,

502
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,200
I'll give you a chance

503
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,480
to flaunt your wealth.

504
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,240
The dinner is on

505
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,750
Mr. Xu.

506
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,350
Great.

507
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,030
Come on.

508
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:18,790
- Thanks, Mr. Xu.
- Help yourselves.

509
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,960
Help yourselves.

510
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,550
We can order some more later.

511
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,440
Xiang Yuan,

512
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,000
pay the bill.

513
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,590
Do you enjoy

514
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,480
bossing me around,

515
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,640
Mr. Xu?

516
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,590
Be good.

517
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,440
Let me chat with them
for a few more minutes.

518
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,440
Password.

519
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,440
Your birthday.

520
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,830
(Really?)

521
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,480
Come on.

522
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,680
- Cheers.
- Come on.

523
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,030
Room No.1. Bill, please.

524
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:58,960
OK.

525
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,160
2,630 yuan in total.

526
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,400
Please sign here.

527
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,440
Well,

528
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,640
don't I need to enter the password?

529
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,030
This is a secondary card.

530
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,200
It will do with or without a password.

531
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,440
No password has been set so far.

532
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,790
(He teased me again.)

533
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:34,880
My company rented me

534
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,000
this new apartment

535
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,000
so I can

536
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
commute easily.

537
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,110
The bedroom is inside.

538
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,440
It's for you.

539
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,070
Sit for a while.

540
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,550
I'll get you a glass of water.

541
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,100
(Send to WeChat)

542
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,980
(Send to Xiang Yuan)

543
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,960
Who texted me at this time of night?

544
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,920
Have you missed me?

545
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:44,720
No.

546
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:45,790
You liar.

547
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,830
Are you still mad at me?

548
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,440
Tell me the truth.

549
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,240
Does Ye Siqin like you?

550
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,680
You seem to be

551
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,920
very smart usually.

552
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:01,750
I never expected this.

553
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,510
Are you secretly pleased?

554
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,200
Do you want to get even with me?

555
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,440
You're jealous, aren't you?

556
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,680
Aren't you going to explain?

557
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,270
You can be jealous for a little longer.

558
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,480
I'll take a shower.

559
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,590
Then I'll go back.

560
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,350
Even if you can't tell

561
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,110
Ye Siqin likes Lin Kairui,

562
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,480
you should notice that

563
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,110
Lin Kairui likes Ye Siqin.

564
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,350
Then why did she

565
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,590
take your coffee?

566
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,270
Lin Kairui

567
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,110
bought the coffee for Ye Siqin

568
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,310
in the first place.

569
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,720
They bickered before.

570
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,440
Ye Siqin didn't want it.

571
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,720
Lin Kairui then gave it to me.

572
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,000
But when I was going to drink,

573
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,030
she snatched it.

574
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,680
And,

575
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,240
I was going to

576
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,920
use your birthday
as the password of the card.

577
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,110
I don't believe it.

578
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:58,880
Alright.

579
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,750
Have you missed me?

580
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,310
(Did she suddenly come to see me)

581
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,550
(because her work wasn't going well?)

582
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,550
(Xu Yanshi,)

583
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,880
(since when have you)

584
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,030
(missed something about her?)

585
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,200
(I want to take two days off)

586
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,480
(to accompany my girlfriend.)

587
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,590
(Xu Yanshi.)

588
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,240
(OK.)

589
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,640
(Lin Kairui)
(Don't just stay in the room.)

590
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,440
(Go shopping)

591
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,590
(and see a movie.)

592
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:40,640
(You can go to IKEA)

593
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,680
(and see the furniture as well.)

594
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,750
(It may come in handy)

595
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,880
(when you get married.)

596
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,750
- Morning.
- Morning.

597
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,680
Are you still sleepy?

598
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,200
Do you want to sleep a little longer?

599
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,270
No, thanks.

600
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,680
I won't sleep when I'm with you.

601
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,720
It's a waste of time.

602
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:01,830
Really?

603
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,000
Really!

604
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,070
I can, look!

605
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,750
I can even

606
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,030
do ballet for you.

607
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,310
(A couple in Dongguan who fell out)

608
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,720

609
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,510
(after the wife started to
practice ballet.)

610
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,640
(The husband said that)

611
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,030
(putting freshness)

612
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,350
(into the emotional life)

613
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,680
(was a long-term solution
to keep a marriage.)

614
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,720
What are you doing?

615
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,200
Sofa ballet, right?

616
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,310
Do it for me.

617
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,350
Xu Yanshi, you're really...

618
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,680
No more jokes.

619
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,240
Let's have breakfast.

620
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,110
Then I'll take you out.

621
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,790
Go out dating?

622
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,030
What do you want to do?

623
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,240
Eat out, see a movie or go shopping?

624
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,720
It doesn't matter

625

725
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,400
"If things go against your wishes,

726
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,840
fate must have other plans."

What else was in the book?

728
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,590

729
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,280
"Run if you can't fight."

730
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,230
Run toward me,

731
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,840
not in the opposite direction.

732
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,480
This is your key card.

733
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,480

You didn't make it this year.

768
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,670
You must come next year.

769
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,880
Did Zhong Ling egg you on?

770
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,630
Why don't you ask Xu Yanshi?

771
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,030
Xu Yuan called and told me

772
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,190
Ms. Zhong would turn 60 next year.

773
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,070
Her birthday party?

774
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,070
How did you know?

775
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,550
Ms. Zhong called me.

776
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,920
Will you go?

777
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,480
Do you want me to go?

778
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,550
You can

779
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,890
deny the rumor if you go.

780
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,000
No big deal.

781
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,960
I just don't like it.

782
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,150
When you were

783
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,030
in Velin,

784
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,880
why nobody invited you?

785
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,590
Now you're doing well in Shanghai

786
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,550
and suddenly, everyone

787
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:29,590
is eager to see you.

788
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,670
Moreover,

789
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,070
I figure Ms. Zhong

790
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,800
wants to make a match

791
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,150
between you and Zhong Ling.

792
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,920
Are you jealous?

793
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,320
I just feel that

794
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,800
they don't think much of my grandpa.

795
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,030
Why didn't you deserve

796
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,800
their invitation when you were in Velin?

797
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,840
Yeah.

798
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:55,710
Anyway,

799
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,510
I didn't promise Ms. Zhong to go.

800
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,110
If you don't want me to go,

801
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,000
I won't.

802
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,480
I have an idea.

803
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,280
You can refuse Ms. Zhong first.

804
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,000
When I get there,

805
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,070
I'll call you

806
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,130
in front of them and say,

807
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,590
"Xu Yanshi, I miss you,

808
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,670
come here quickly."

809
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,800
Then you rush there

810
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,440
without delay.

811
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,320
Then they'll think

812
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,230
you have a crush on me
but can't get me.

813
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,230
Still, you guard me hopelessly.

814
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,590
In that case,

815
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,360
I'll forget about

816
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,550
Zhong Ling.

817
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:25,400
How about that?

818
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:40,920
Yes.

819
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,480
It's not fun at all.

820
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,550
You say yes to everything.

821
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,480
You even brought toothbrushes.

822
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,400
It seems to be premeditated.

823
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,760
I just grabbed them.

824
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,360
They don't take up much space.

825
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,440
So I brought them.

826
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:08,670
Are you ready?

827
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,320
Get me the washing bag.

828
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:33,320
What's that?

829
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,590
You're kind of secretive.

830
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,110
Nothing.

831
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:42,710
Xiang Yuan.

832
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,550
Next time,

833
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,710
don't buy black.

834
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,070
I like black.

835
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:02,400
Come on.

836
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,670
Think about it again.

837
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,710
This earphone

838
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,800
only costs 1,999 yuan

839
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,590
for a group purchase.

840
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:09,030
It's a good bargain.

841
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,670
Don't go.

842
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:14,400
Forget it.

843
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:20,670
Standard equipment for mature men.

844
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:21,590
Buy one with us.

845
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:22,850
Get lost.

846
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,550
When will Miss Xiang come back?

847
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:30,760
She would love to get one.

848
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,230
Qingqing, you've changed
your dressing style!

849
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,440
You know what,

850
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,760
it suits you very well.

851
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,510
Thanks.

852
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:11,510
Velin.

853
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:13,480
I'm back.

854
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,710
Next, let me read

855
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:26,880
the transfer notice
issued by the headquarters.

856
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,110
Lin Qingqing

857
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:29,800
is promoted to deputy team leader

858
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,590
due to her outstanding performance.

859
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,110
So,

860
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:36,070
I hope you can

861
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:37,320
work well together

862
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,230
to improve the performance

863
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:40,230
of the technical department.

864
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:42,960
Didn't Miss Xiang say that

865
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,550
she recommended you
as the deputy team leader?

866
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:46,110
Why is it Lin Qingqing?

867
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:48,150
How do I know?

868
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,900
(Xiang Yuan
Durian Witch...)

869
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,280
Sorry, I'm late.

870
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,150
Ms. Li, thanks for presiding
over the meeting in place of me.

871
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,110
With pleasure.

872
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:06,030
Miss Xiang,

873
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,110
look if you have more to say.

874
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,000
Nothing more.

875
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:12,320
Then,

876
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,230
Lin Qingqing will be
the deputy team leader

877
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:14,630
of the technical department.

878
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:20,710
Lin Qingqing,

879
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:22,030
come to my office later.

880
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,440
I'll assign work to you.

881
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:28,590
Ms. Li, do you have

882
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:30,030
any other suggestions?

883
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:32,920
No.

884
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,190
Then, dismiss.

885
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:51,780
(Project Report)

886
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,620
(Deputy Team Leader Lin Qingqing)

887
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:00,070
Shi Tianyou,

888
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,320
email me

889
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,030
all your projects

890
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:04,280
this month.

891
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:05,480
Lin Qing...

892
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:07,190
Miss Lin,

893
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:07,960
I've shown

894
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,480
them to Zhang Jun.

895
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,280
I'm the deputy team leader now.

896
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,000
I'm also

897
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,320
responsible for your projects.

898
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:14,920
OK.

899
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,230
You Zhi.

900
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:18,510
You, too.

901
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:19,230
Email me all your projects

902
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:21,320
this month immediately.

903
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:23,280
OK.

904

(Lin Qingqing, Summary of Projects
Completed in the Present Month)

Check your email.

909

What is she

910

going to do?

911
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Lin Qingqing,

912
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,230
you didn't take part in
any of the projects.

913
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,760
Why did you add your name?

914
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:14,480
(Member for Project Submission)
Her name is on all the projects.

915
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,590
Why?

916
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:18,840
Look at these projects.

917
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:19,800
