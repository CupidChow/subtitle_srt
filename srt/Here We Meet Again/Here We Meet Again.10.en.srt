What's up?

00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,400
Open the mouth.

32
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,870
What's this?

33
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,840
Antialcoholic drug.

34
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:00,760
Or do you want to

35
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,950
vomit on Huang Qiming again?

36
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,120
Is this an antialcoholic drug?

37
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,360
Of course.

38
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,520
I will go with you

39
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,800
to visit Huang Qiming tonight.

40
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,240
You are good at drinking things?

41
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,840
Take a guess.

42
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,000
Mr. Huang.

43
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,560
Here's

44
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,280
the suit and tie

45
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,150
I prepared for you.

46
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,360
I was really ignorant

47
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,430
last time.

48
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,080
So

49
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,470
please don't take it seriously.

50
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,800
Give it to me.

51
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,680
Well.

52
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,630
Mr. Xu.

53
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,750
You didn't participate in

54
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,520
the first few times.

55
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Today

56
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,590
you have to drink with us.

57
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,280
Of course.

58
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,560
Well.

59
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,590
Mr. Huang.

60
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,630
Please

61
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,470
be generous

62
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,520
and don't

63
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,120
hold me accountable.

64
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,750
Everyone.

65
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,560
Look.

66
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:18,840
They are so

67
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,870
sincere, right?

68
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,680
Well.

69
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,400
Help yourselves.

70
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,560
Eat.

71
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,360
Come on.

72
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,430
Thank you.

73
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,560
It's delicious.

74
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,430
Would you like some?

75
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,750
You don't eat anything.

76
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,360
So boring.

77
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,030
Let me see the Moments.

78
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,020
(Shi Tianyou: A warm afternoon)

79
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,630
Tell me.

80
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,630
All straight men in
the technical department

81
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,520
like girls

82
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,800
like Xiang Yuan?

83
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,360
I neither like nor dislike her.

84
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,120
But with our relationship,

85
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,160
don't expect me to vent your anger.

86
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,630
I knew it.

87
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,390
To be honest,

88
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,430
the price I offered to Velin

89
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,680
was higher than

90
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,000
the normal

91
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,870
market price.

92
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,120
You must have earned a lot.

93
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,070
(He gave us much profit?)

94
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,310
(Then why is Velin)

95
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,920
(losing money year after year?)

96
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
Sure.

97
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,190
What happened before

98
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,510
was because the girl drank too much.

99
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,720
Mr. Huang, don't be angry.

100
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,720
Miss Chen.

101
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,360
I have attended dinner parties

102
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,480
for so many years.

103
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,390
I know how to tell

104
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,870
if a person is really drunk

105
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,190
or just pretending.

106
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,560
Fortunately,

107
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,390
this person is me.

108
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,870
If she does this

109
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,160
to other leaders in the future,

110
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,630
you will

111
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,190
definitely suffer.

112
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,270
Mr. Huang, you are right.

113
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:23,950
You know what?

114
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,950
He's insulting and trampling

115
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:25,750
on a leader and co-worker

116
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,750
I respect

117
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,310
and admire so much.

118
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,750
The image of Xu Yanshi

119
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,510
in my mind

120
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,920
is so sacred, tall and stalwart.

121
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,120
Because of being protected
by such a beautiful woman,

122
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,120
it is not troublesome
to offend anyone.

123
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:40,980
Look.

124
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,630
Mr. Xu.

125
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,950
Your words are as decent as you are.

126
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,750
Good for you.

127
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,870
Not as good as you, Mr. Huang.

128
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,040
Cheers.

129
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,510
(I didn't expect)

130
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,600
(that the boy who was so young
and cold back then)

131
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,950
(is so well versed)

132
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,630
(in drinking culture now.)

133
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,560
(Men)

134
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,920
(can never)

135
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,920
(be honest.)

136
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,690
Well.

137
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,190
Who said to

138
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,870
apologize just now?

139
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,120
The sincerity

140
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,630
of your apology

141
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,480
is all in the wine,

142
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,390
right?

143
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,630
Miss Xiang.

144
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,510
Mr. Huang.

145
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,120
The other day

146
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,920
I asked her to stay up late
to catch up on a project.

147
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,800
And she caught a cold.

148
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,600
I didn't know

149
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,750
our dinner was tonight.

150
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,920
So I gave her cold medicine

151
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,800
in the afternoon.

152
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,870
I will drink with you tonight.

153
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,560
(It turned out to be cold medicine.)

154
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:45,870
(Then I can't drink)

155
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,510
(any alcohol tonight?)

156
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,270
(He was worried
that I would not take it,)

157
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,870
(so he lied to me
that it was an antialcoholic drug.)

158
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,830
(So he had already planned everything.)

159
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,360
There is the aspartic acid
in mung bean sprouts,

160
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,310
which is a natural antialcoholic drug.

161
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:06,870
Wait.

162
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,800
What if

163
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,720
she drinks too much

164
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,680
and its effect is not significant enough?

165
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,240
I'd better find another way.

166
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,870
With so many antialcoholic drugs,

167
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,800
there is always one that is right for you.

168
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,720
Good for you.

169
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,270
No, don't.

170
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,070
Miss Chen.

171
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,430
Since he is willing to be a hero,

172
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,480
I have to do him a favor.

173
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,830
Right?

174
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,870
He is great.

175
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,360
Nice.

176
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,630
Mr. Xu is such a heavy drinker.

177
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:32,750
Good.

178
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:35,840
Mr. Huang.

179
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,390
Yes?

180
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,790
I can drink as much as you want.

181
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,630
Seriously?

182
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,240
Just don't

183
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,080
make her cry.

184
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,840
It's hard to butter her up.

185
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,550
(Your words are so ambiguous.)

186
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,510
(Why don't you think about)

187
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,080
(my innocence?)

188
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,840
Do you think

189
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,870
Miss Xiang is lachrymose?

190
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,120
She just looks strong.

191
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,910
After she got into trouble,
she came to me,

192
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,200
crying and saying
that she would resign,

193
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,910
and she was afraid of
being punished by the leader.

194
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,030
She has just entered work,

195
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,270
and is timid and ignorant.

196
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,910
That day,

197
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,360
she was really drunk.

198
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,390
Mr. Huang.

199
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,550
Cheers.

200
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,790
Got it.

201
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,440
Got it.

202
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,320
(What a good storyteller.)

203
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,320
Mr. Xu, you are so kind.

204
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,390
Waitress.

205
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,030
Two bottles of Chinese spirits, please.

206
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,320
Okay, hold on.

207
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,390
Come on.

208
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,360
Let me serve you.

209
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,630
Mr. Xu.

210
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,360
Ruifeng called just now

211
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,910
about the next year's order.

212
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,270
So

213
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,030
just have fun.

214
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,120
We're not short of this one.

215
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:05,910
Mr. Huang.

216
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,440
Yes?

217
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,200
Tell me.

218
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,840
Start from whom?

219
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,550
Young men

220
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,240
always drink fast.

221
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,200
No worries.

222
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,790
Let's take our time.

223
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,030
Eat something.

224
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,440
Eat something first, right?

225
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,550
Come on.

226
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,790
Eat something.

227
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,910
Give it to me.

228
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:33,750
Okay.

229
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,030
Chi.

230
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,480
Would you like to

231
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,390
do me a favor?

232
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,510
I thought of a plan.

233
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,030
Help me.

234
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,870
The plan is perfect.

235
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,600
I promise to ruin her

236
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,630
once and for all.

237
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,030
I said

238
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,150
I wouldn't get involved
with you women.

239
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,240
Chi.

240
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,510
You are the best.

241
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,630
Just do me a favor.

242
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,200
Stop it.

243
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,000
Do you like me?

244
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,320
I told you at the very beginning

245
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,670
that our relationship is pure.

246
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,080
Pure?

247
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,150
Not at all!

248
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,270
Good girl.

249
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,080
Don't look for me for a while.

250
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,000
Why?

251
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,360
I fell in love with someone else.

252
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,080
I'd be...!

253
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,720
I'd be ashamed!

254
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,240
You only dare to

255
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,240
refute Gao Leng.

256
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,360
You should go back.

257
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,000
Okay.

258
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,600
I'm fine.

259
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,200
We are leaving then.

260
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,600
Let's go.

261
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,270
We are leaving.

262
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,360
We are leaving.

263
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,910
Take care.

264
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,390
Mr. Huang, don't worry.

265
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,360
Now that you have signed,

266
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,240
we will naturally

267
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,030
give priority to you.

268
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,200
Nice working with you.

269
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,120
Always a pleasure.

270
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:08,750
Goodbye.

271
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,030
- Take care.
- Goodbye, Mr. Huang.

272
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,900
(Occupied. Xi'an Taxi)

273
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,440
Xu Yanshi.

274
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,480
Take the antialcoholic drug.

275
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,720
I've had it.

276
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,000
When?

277
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,440
Before the meal.

278
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,480
You are well prepared.

279
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,600
When Chen Shan

280
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,960
took him to a social event before,

281
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,670
he would always

282
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,030
prepare some of it.

283
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,840
Xiang Yuan has a cold

284
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,240
and cannot drink.

285
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,240
It was you

286
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,720
who gave me cold medicine.

287
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,750
Otherwise, I could definitely

288
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,320
drink them under the table.

289
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,200
How about I

290
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,320
take you back first?

291
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,120
No need.

292
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,840
We have to go back
to the company to work.

293
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,200
You have to work
after drinking so much?

294
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,440
Is your technical department
that busy?

295
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,460
Yes.

296
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,390
Are you okay?

297
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,240
I'm fine.

298
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,630
Do you want to

299
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,670
look at the stars?

300
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,000
Now?

301
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,510
Forget it.

302
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,670
Honey.

303
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,790
Why are you here?

304
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,960
I think

305
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,960
you will be very lonely

306
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,270
when you go home alone

307
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,240
after socializing and drinking.

308
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,790
I can't get into your house.

309
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,270
So I can only wait for you outside.

310
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,320
I also bought

311
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,630
fruit

312
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,440
and made various hangover soups.

313
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,630
Give me a chance

314
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,390
to take care of you.

315
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:37,750
But I didn't drink

316
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,910
tonight.

317
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:40,910
What?

318
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,910
You didn't drink?

319
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,270
How come?

320
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,440
(The door is unlocked.)

321
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,960
Huang Qiming

322
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,270
focused all his firepower

323
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:48,870
on

324
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,440
your leader.

325
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,630
We had no chance

326
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,720
of sharing at all.

327
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,270
How much did he drink?

328
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,630
No idea.

329
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,510
I didn't notice.

330
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,630
Anyway, I have never seen

331
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,000
anyone drink

332
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,320
so much.

333
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,720
Come in.

334
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,840
Well.

335
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,080
Honey.

336
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,670
Give me back the hangover soups.

337
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,150
I'd like to send them to Boss.

338
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,000
Okay.

339
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,270
Good night.

340
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,120
Take it and you will feel better.

341
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,440
Your hands are so cold.

342
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,960
It can't be told by your face.

343
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,270
It means that there is no

344
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,720
alcohol dehydrogenase
in your body at all.

345
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,150
Alcohol is metabolized by the liver.

346
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,440
Are you worried about me?

347
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,510
To be honest,

348
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,400
till now,

349
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,550
I have never...

350
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,550
(He won't confess,)

351
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,200
(will he?)

352
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,790
I have never seen
such a large moon.

353
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,240
Shall we go out for a look?

354
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,960
Tired of revising the program.

355
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,790
I want to show you something.

00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,310
You made it?

358
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,350
I got it online.

359
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,030
Sirius.

360
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,070
It does dim

00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,160

This...

422
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,960
(Beer)
Did you drink it all?

423
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,830
I heard that it was Huang Qiming
who made you drink.

424
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,310
Why did you

425
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,480
drink beer yourself?

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,200

00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,070
Last night

428
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,240
I delivered you hangover soup.

429
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,310
I waited for you all night
and you didn't come back.

430
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,960
What did you do?

431
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,350

432
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,480

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,070
No.

435
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,030
Boss.

436
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,590
You have to know

437
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,790
that health is the top priority.

438
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:07,880
Don't

439
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,160
break down

440
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,680
through overwork.

441
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,160
It's not overwork,

442
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,830
but settling accounts.

443
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,640
Settling accounts?

444
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,240
What accounts?

445
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,030
I was trying to figure out
when I could pay off the debt.

446
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,400
What next?

447
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,070
Earn money to get married.

448
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:23,720
You...

449
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,510
Do you have a girlfriend?

450
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,110
No.

451
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,720
I'm still working on it.

452
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,160
Who's that?

453
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,830
A new goal?

454
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,270
No.

455
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,400
It's always her.

456
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,310
(Look at me.)

457
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,400
(I didn't fall asleep all night.)

458
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,400
Morning.

459
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,480
No worries.

460
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,960
Xu Yanshi asked for leave for you.

461
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,350
He guessed

462
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,310
that you would definitely oversleep.

463
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,680
So he asked Mr. Li for leave

464
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,510
early in the morning for you.

465
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,160
Come here.

466
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,960
What were you two doing

467
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,070
in the office

468
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:12,920
so late last night?

469
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,880
Work.

470
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,310
What else?

471
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,550
Work?

472
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,190
I see.

473
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,640
Get to work.

474
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:33,920
Then I will

475
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,920
throw these away for you.

476
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:35,810
Okay.

477
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,070
Boss.

478
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,110
What happened?

479
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,720
Something's up, Boss!

480
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,070
A camera was found

481
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,400
in the lady's room
of our company.

482
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,640
And it is

483
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,680
a pinhole camera

484
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,550
specially used for sneak shots.

485
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,310
When did it happen?

486
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,400
Jessica found out

487
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,750
early this morning.

488
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,110
And I also heard

489
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,640
that it was probably Li Chi who did so.

490
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,640
Who said that?

491
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,830
Ying Yinyin.

492
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,350
Keep it a secret

493
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,400
and call the police.

494
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,270
Okay.

495
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,350
I'm on it.

496
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,110
Miss Xiang.

497
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:27,920
Morning.

498
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,550
Morning.

499
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:43,640
Miss Xiang.

500
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,270
Take a look.

501
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,160
I...

502
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,680
I am going to the toilet.

503
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,000
Wait a minute, there is...

504
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,750
I hate Li Chi now.

505
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,110
He has a bad personality

506
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,550
and usually loses his temper
with me.

507
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,830
But I didn't expect him
to have that fetish.

508
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,960
I said he's unreliable.

509
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,920
Didn't I tell you long ago?

510
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,350
But I don't think

511
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,550
it was necessarily him

512
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,110
who set up the camera.

513
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,720
It's just that he said

514
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,680
that when he saw related news
a few years ago,

515
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,480
he had such an idea.

516
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,920
Maybe it's just for fun,

517
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,030
and he didn't dare to do it,

518
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,550
after all, it's way too perverted.

519
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,960
Since he said so,

520
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,270
he must have done it.

521
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,110
Yinyin, are you a fool?

522
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:22,680
Right.

523
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,270
Fortunately, you have nothing to do

524
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,550
with him now.

525
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,720
Or what if

526
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,590
he did something to you?

527
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,310
Luckily

528
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,880
I have you.

529
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,070
Qi, cuddle.

530
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,240
Cuddle.

531
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,680
Jessica, cuddle.

532
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,510
Cuddle.

533
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,200
What a smell.

534
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,160
Close.

535
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,030
Close.

536
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:40,750
- Miss Xiang.
- What are you doing?

537
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,830
Are you going to the toilet?

538
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,200
It's none of

539
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,680
your business.

540
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,510
What?

541
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,640
I am just in a hurry

542
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,790
to go to the toilet.

543
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,310
I will get you one.

544
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,880
Anyone?

545
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,200
Boss, what are you doing?

546
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,000
I can't hold it anymore.

547
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,790
Clear, go.

548
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,590
This is the men's room.

549
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,270
Why are we going to the toilet

550
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,830
in order of the title?

551
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,680
This is workplace bullying!

552
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,920
Isn't there a toilet downstairs?

553
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,440
I...

554
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,270
Go.

555
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,550
Xu Yanshi.

556
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,070
I'm here.

557
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,510
Done?

558
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,830
Yes.

559
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,620
(MEN)

560
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,590
Camera?

561
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,070
Yes.

562
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,000
What else?

563
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,440
Boss just dragged me away

564
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,550
and let you into the men's room.

565
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,160
I held back and ran several floors.

566
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,590
It suddenly occurred to me

567
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,590
that the tortoise might win

568
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,160
in the race

569
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,200
because it had urgent urination.

570
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,400
Did you find out who it was?

571
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,510
Most likely it's Li Chi.

572
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,400
Where is he?

573
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,550
Did he admit it?

574
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,590
He hasn't come yet.

575
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:43,110
He must have known
that it was exposed,

576
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:43,790
so he didn't dare to come.

577
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,310
I have always felt that Li Chi

578
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,160
has a personality problem.

579
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,480
I didn't expect him
to have done this.

580
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,920
Don't talk nonsense

581
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,000
without evidence.

582
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:52,720
Not me.

583
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,160
This is what Ying Yinyin said.

584
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,960
With their relationship,

585
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,160
she should know.

586
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,480
And Ying Yinyin also said

587
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,070
that besides installing a camera,

588
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,350
he also likes to secretly

589
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,830
take photos of female colleagues.

590
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,110
What kind of photos?

591
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,830
It's pictures of them

592
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,310
in stockings and heels.

593
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,830
What a pervert.

594
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,640
How can someone do such a thing?

595
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,160
You still don't know enough

596
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,310
what men are like.

597
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,310
Gao Leng.

598
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,790
Get the obscene thoughts

599
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,440
out of your head.

600
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,070
New Year is coming soon.

601
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:21,830
Don't let others laugh at

602
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:22,590
our technical department.

603
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,000
Come on.

604
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,640
I am concerned about
female colleagues.

605
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,960
Have you finished your PPT?

606
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,000
Not yet.

607
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,790
Write now.

608
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,400
Okay.

609
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,540
(Yi Shi)

610
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,310
Miss Xiang.

611
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,400
Your call.

612
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,880
Thank you.

613
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,400
I just saw

614
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,110
that the person who called Miss Xiang

615
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,350
was Yi Shi.

616
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,680
Yi Shi?

617
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,920
Shi Yi?
[*Shiyi means one billion]

618
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,240
What a unique name.

619
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,590
The same as mine.

620
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,110
Have you never read

621
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,590
trending searches?

622
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,160
Don't you know Yi Shi?

623
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,550
The boss of Jiayi.

624
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,230
What?

625
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,110
They may just have the same name.

626
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,240
Is she going to the toilet?

627
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,400
No!

628
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,110
Congratulations.

629
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,750
You are getting married.

630
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:23,310
Wait.

631
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,830
Don't rush to congratulate me.

632
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,070
I am calling you

633
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:26,750
to invite you

634
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,750
to my wedding.

635
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,030
Forget it.

636
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,110
I'm a little busy recently.

637
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:30,960
Don't worry.

638
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,350
The red envelope
will be delivered on time.

639
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,070
No!

640
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:34,960
You are the first investor

641
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,110
in my life.

642
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:36,790
How can you not

643
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,960
attend my wedding?

644
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,880
Please understand me.

645
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,000
I'm really busy recently.

646
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,200
If you don't come,

647
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:42,400
I won't get married.

648
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:44,880
Look at you!

649
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,590
You are so mean!

650
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:48,720
Alright.

651
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,200
I'll try.

652
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,960
Send me the date and place.

653
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,550
Sure.

654
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,270
Bye.

655
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,550
Yuan.

656
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:07,590
I accidentally saw

657
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,790
that the person who called you was Yi Shi.

658
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,110
Is he the boss of Jiayi?

659
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:13,090
Yes.

660
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,440
Yuan.

661
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,070
Good for you.

662
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,310
He is a bigwig
in the online shopping area.

663
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,720
Any of his actions

664
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,160
will immediately be on the hot search.

665
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,270
How did you know him?

666
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,680
We grew up together.

667
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:28,960
Grew up together.

668
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,720
Don't go.

669
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,310
You! You!

670
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:42,750
What are you doing?

671
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,680
I just want to remind you

672
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,830
that there is a camera inside,

673
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,640
and you can't go there.

674
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,640
Then just tell me.

675
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,920
Why did you follow me?

676
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:56,920
Watch the door for me.

677
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,000
Why is the plot different from that

678
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,960
between Boss and Miss Xiang?

679
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:06,920
It hurts so much.

680
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,420
(Xu Yanshi)

681
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,100
(An unread message)

682
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,860
(Invitation, Tie the knot)

683
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,830
It's time to eat.

684
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,510
Let's eat out,

685
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,350
shall we?

686
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,350
Let's go.

687
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,270
Let's go.

688
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,590
Miss Xiang, are you going with us?

689
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,480
I'm not hungry yet.

690
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,030
Okay.

691
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,200
I'll bring you some back.

692
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,240
Okay, thanks.

693
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,000
What to eat?

694
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,240
Steamed mutton.

695
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,680
Oily noodles.

696
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,270
No!

697
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,480
Come in.

698
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:05,590
Here you are.

699
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,190
Can't I come?

700
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,630
What's wrong with you?

701
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,880
It's done.

702
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,630
Take a look.

703
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,590
Is the software ready?

704
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,400
Soon.

705
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,110
I'm still on it.

706
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,510
There are still some pending loopholes

707
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,280
in the backend of
the Cargo Link Navigation System.

708
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,670
I heard from Chen Shu

709
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:33,670
that you will be the host

710
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,030
of the press conference

711
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,550
of the Cargo Link Navigation next month.

712
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,760
That's our plan for now.

713
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,110
And I plan to

714
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:40,880
hold this press conference

715
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,400
grandly

716
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,840
and surprise everyone.

717
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,190
How surprising will it be?

718
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,480
Listen.

719
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,800
Doing a show

720
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,590
is very mind-consuming

721
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,550
and troublesome.

722
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,440
Fortunately, Gao Leng and the others

723
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,360
have nothing to do recently.

724
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,710
I'll let them prepare the show,

725
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,960
the more exotic

726
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,150
the better.

727
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,400
Everyone

728
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,320
will be amazed.

729
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,800
And

730
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,800
I'm going to invite

731
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,030
a heavyweight guest.

732
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,480
No one is allowed to go wrong.

733
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,000
It seems

734
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,280
that you attach great importance
to this conference.

735
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,480
Of course.

736
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,480
After the press conference,

737
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,030
all Cargo Link Systems
across the country

738
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,030
will belong to Velin.

739
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:15,480
Let's see

740
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,150
who would dare to
look down on Velin

741
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,070
by then.

742
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,030
How about

743
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,400
having Gao Leng,

744
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,320
You Zhi, and the others

745
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,710
in hula skirts

746
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,840
do the opening dance

747
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,110
with extra hot music?

748
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,400
By then, everyone will be

749
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,320
cheering and screaming.

750
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,320
Then the atmosphere

751
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,150
will be warmed up.

752
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,550
Good idea.

753
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,070
Better get another circus monkey

754
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,280
jumping through a fire hoop.

755
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,840
It's crazy after all.

756
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,710
Just achieve the ultimate.

757
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,710
Actually,

758
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,840
I came to tell you

759
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,360
that I might go back to Shanghai

760
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,110
in a few days.

761
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,590
And I will

762
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,510
leave the competition to you.

763
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,110
Why are you going to Shanghai?

764
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,480
An important friend of mine

765
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,280
is getting married.

766
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,280
How important he is?

767
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,760
Very important.

768
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,280
Your ex-boyfriend?

769
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,030
My childhood friend!

770
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,230
I really didn't expect him

771
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:20,880
to be like this.

772
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,070
Let's go.

773
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,360
Gao Leng.

774
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,070
Xu Yanshi is looking for you.

775
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,710
Okay, coming.

776
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,400
(Hottest news!)

777
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,800
(Velin Gossip Group)
(Li Chi once revealed his desire)

778
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,840
(to install a camera in the toilet.)

779
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,190
(You don't need to spy.)

780
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,230
(Ying Yinyin is almost going to)

781
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,760
(broadcast to the whole company.)

782
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,280
Ying Yinyin!

783
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,000
Did the lady who found it say

784
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,480
what day she found it?

785
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,630
It is so difficult

786
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,440
to check day by day.

787
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,400
She said it happened
in the past few days.

788
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,000
Have any maintenance personnel

789
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,030
come to our company recently?

790
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:23,510
Yes.

791
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,400
If it is not an insider,

792
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,630
the possibility of
the maintenance personnel

793
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,280
committing the crime
is relatively high.

794
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,480
Please let me

795
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,150
check the register.

796
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:29,710
Okay.

797
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,150
How is it going?

798
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:33,840
No found.

799
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,800
So many things
need to be checked?

800
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,880
All computers checked.

801
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:48,960
No stealthie.

802
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,280
Only this one.

803
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,000
It just has nothing to do
with the camera,

804
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,480
right?

805
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,440
Li Chi, who you're up to?

806
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,230
Are you crazy?

807
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:08,550
Piss off.

808
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,070
Miss Xiang!

809
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:09,670
Get out of my way!

810
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,510
What are you doing?

811
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:10,760
Yuan!

812
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,670
I'm gonna kill him!

813
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:12,360
- Yuan!
- Miss Xiang!

814
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,760
Miss Xiang!

815
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,800
- Who did you take the picture of?
- Miss Xiang!

816
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,440
I'm going to find Boss.

817
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,190
- Miss Xiang!
- Miss Xiang!

818
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:16,960
- Don't move.
- Don't move.

819
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,480
Stand still.

820
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,670
Look at the trouble you got into.

821
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:19,190
Take care.

822
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,550
Your head is broken.

823
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,960
Didn't I look better?

824
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:24,800
Why are you still

825
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,070
in the mood to joke?

826
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,550
Here.

827
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:36,500
(Visitor Register)

828
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,760
Is this monitoring

829
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,360
for that time period?

830
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,400
Yes, that's it.

831
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,800
Boss!

832
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,840
Miss Xiang blacked out.

833
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:47,920
Are you okay?

834
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,440
Gosh.

835
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,380
I'm exposed.

836
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:53,280
I'm exposed.

837
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,110
What?

838
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,150
The clothes.

839
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:56,880
The clothes.

840
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,000
What?

841
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,760
I'm exposed.

842
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,000
- What?
- Let me.

843
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,190
My back.

844
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,590
What?

845
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,710

that unconsciousness in the legendary

862
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,230
I know you are Xu Yanshi.

863
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,960
I also know where I am.

864
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,400
What you're talking about is a shock.

865
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:28,840
Really?

866
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,710
So talkative.

867
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,400

No.

Where does it hurt?

870
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,110
I felt

871
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,880
the envious and jealous eyes

872
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,440
of the female colleagues around me.

873
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,480
It makes me feel not good.

874
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,710
What's wrong?

875
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,710
I'm dizzy and nauseous.

876
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,960
And I feel sick.

877
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,190
Why did you pull me away?

878
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,510
Why did you do that

879
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,150
without thinking?

880
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,360
Do you have to let everyone
in the company

881
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,190
know about

882
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,840
your personal affairs?

883
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,480
Could you consider

884
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,480
my situation and feelings?

885
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,320
You are so childish.

886
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,710
Li Chi

887
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,150
didn't take me seriously.

888
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,000
I couldn't help it for a moment.

889
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,440
So you hit him?

890
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,480
Didn't you think about
the consequences?

891
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,440
Didn't you think

892
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,480
how embarrassing it would be
for me?

893
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,360
Because of your impulsiveness,

894
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,920
Xiang Yuan is now in the hospital.

895
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,110
Li Chi secretly photographed
my girlfriend.

896
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,320
Do I still have to act like an idiot

897
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,510
like nothing happened

898
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,710
and continue to be his colleague?

899
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,840
Can't I even

900
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,070
vent my anger?

901
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,190
You always only

902
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,280
think of yourself.

903
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:39,800
Obviously you are selfish.

904
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,070
Why am I selfish?

905
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,030
Go home yourself.

906
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,510
I am not sending you back.

907
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:50,670
I don't feel well.

908
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,880
What's wrong with you?

909
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,030
It has nothing to do with you.

910
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,550
Let's calm down.

911
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,070
Take some water.

912
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,510
Here.

913
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:42,710
Doctor.

914
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,190
What's wrong with her now

915
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,440
besides the skin trauma

916
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:46,670
on her head?

917
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,070
I saw her vomit badly.

918
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,710
There is a risk of concussion.

919
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,320
She'd better do another check.

920
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,480
If nothing serious,

921
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,960
just stay in the hospital
for one night of observation.

922
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,590
Family members may accompany her
in the ward.

923
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:57,400
