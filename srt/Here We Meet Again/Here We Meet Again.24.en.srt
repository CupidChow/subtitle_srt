=Episode 24=

29
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,310
(Xi'an Velin Technical Department)
Her name is on all the projects.

30
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,400
Why?

31
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,710
Look at these projects.

32
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,680
(Lin Qingqing)
She never participated in any of them

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,590
from beginning to end.

34
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,760
But still, her name

35
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,070
is on the list.

36
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,280
Why?

37
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,510
I know.

38
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,920
Besides,

39
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,840
she is

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,480
the deputy team leader
of your department.

41
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,400
According to the regulations,

42
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,710
there is nothing wrong
with her name being in the report.

43
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,430
But...

44
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,040
You and Boss

45
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,590
never did that before.

46
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,590
Everyone thinks differently.

47
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,400
Miss Xiang.

48
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,430
Are you not gonna speak up for us?

49
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,840
Forget it.

50
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:25,800
Hello?

51
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,630
Hello, Boss.

52
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,710
I'm not someone

53
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,430
who likes to complain.

54
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,870
But I'm telling you,

55
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,750
ever since you left,

56
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,240
Miss Xiang has changed.

57
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,680
She's become cold, brutal,

58
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,360
ruthless, and inactive.

59
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,190
What happened?

60
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,360
Miss Xiang is no longer

61
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,280
as sweet and naive as she used to be.

62
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,150
I don't know

63
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,360
who she had been fooling around with

64
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,190
for the last few days,

65
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,910
but when she came back,

66
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,150
she changed completely.

67
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,520
She became ruthless

68
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,470
and unreasonable.

69
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,630
Did she

70
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,240
go to Shanghai to see you?

71
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:00,540
Yes.

72
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,000
That's...

73
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,560
Sorry to bother you.

74
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,030
I'm...

75
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,360
I'm so stupid.

76
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,190
Hello, Miss Xiang.

77
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,240
(Boss)
(Miss Xiang is so cute)

78
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,310
(when she drinks coffee.)

79
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,150
(Really?)

80
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,520
(You Zhi)
(Take a picture.)

81
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,870
(Why do I feel)

82
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,360
(there's something wrong with you?)

83
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,460
(You Zhi)

84
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,520
(Can you tell it?)

85
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,660
(Boss)

86
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,420
(Yeah, it's simple.)

87
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,560
(I'm not as naive as Gao Leng.)

88
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,120
(Tell me about it.)

89
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,030
(According to my analysis,)

90
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,630
(it seemed like)

91
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,610
(you have dishonorable intentions
towards Yuan)

92
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,770
(when you asked me
to take a picture of her,)

93
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,030
(but that's not the truth.)

94
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:56,840
(You just want to see)

95
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,470
(what kind of coffee Yuan is drinking.)

96
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,400
(Have you bought)

97
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,310
(shitty coffee)

98
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,430
(and tried to sell it to someone else?)

99
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,710
(Don't think I don't know it.)

100
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,360
(That's what you did last time.)

101
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,240
Xiaodaiji is always delicious.

102
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,480
Of course.

103
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,390
Eat more.

104
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,070
You can also order more.

105
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,270
Go ahead and eat.

106
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,480
Why are you being so nice today

107
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,560
and treating me to dinner?

108
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,720
You know what,

109
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,310
I'm about to reach the pinnacle

110
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,680
of my life.

111
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,040
Have you gained weight?

112
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,270
What are you talking about?

113
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,310
I got an offer from a big company.

114
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,680
I'm going to work in Shanghai next week.

115
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,070
Really?

116
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,750
Well done.

117
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,950
Thank you.

118
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,600
Xu told me your relationship
before he left.

119
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,600
I just want to say

120
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,160
that Xu Yanshi is a good man,

121
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,950
never let him go.

122
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,270
Before he left,

123
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,430
he specifically asked me

124
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,720
to take good care of you.

125
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,160
I thought about it.

126
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,600
Besides buying tickets for you two,

127
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,950
there was nothing else I could do.

128
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,720
So, I'm treating you to dinner today.

129
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,040
Just eat whatever you want.

130
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,190
It was you who bought the tickets?

131
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,360
Who else could it be?

132
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,310
I also made a big profit

133
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,040
with the tickets.

134
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,600
How did you do it?

135
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,000
You know what,

136
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,830
when I bought the tickets for you two,

137
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,190
something went wrong with the system,

138
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,830
and I bought four adjacent tickets.

139
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,040
So I sold the extra ones.

140
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,480
Guess what happened?

141
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,720
I sold one of the tickets
at a really high price.

142
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,270
Do you know who bought it?

143
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,750
Let me see.

144
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,510
This guy.

145
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,120
Do you know him?

146
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,900
(Ruidong, Wang Yifei)

147
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,040
Xiang Yuan.

148
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,240
What a coincidence.

149
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,480
Let's have lunch together tomorrow.

150
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,830
I want to ask you something
about the Cargo Link.

151
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,310
Why don't you talk to Chen Shu?

152
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,120
You also know Gao Leng.

153
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,120
He knows better.

154
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,310
I've also invited Miss Chen.

155
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,120
The three of us can

156
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,070
talk about it over lunch tomorrow.

157
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,680
Okay.

158
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,270
Why hasn't Chen Shu arrived yet?

159
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,680
I'll give her a call.

160
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,800
No need.

161
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,390
I just called her.

162
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,120
She said she couldn't make it

163
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,190
and left us to it.

164
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,750
Okay.

165
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,430
There's no rush.

166
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,430
Let's discuss it over lunch.

167
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,270
Excuse me.

168
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,750
Here is your steak.

169
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,510
Thank you.

170
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,750
(Chen Shu)
(Why aren't you here yet?)

171
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,160
Please enjoy your meal.

172
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,500
(Chen Shu: What do you mean?)

173
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,310
(What do you mean?)

174
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,680
Mr. Lu.

175
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,580
Hmm.

176
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,040
I have something to ask you.

177
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,240
Go ahead.

178
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,040
Are you trying to pursue me?

179
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,190
No.

180
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,120
Did I do anything

181
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,190
that gave you the wrong impression?

182
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,390
Forget what I asked.

183
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,000
Sorry,

184
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,870
I was probably wrong.

185
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,360
But there is a thing

186
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,000
I want to make clear to you first.

187
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,690
Okay.

188
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,240
I think we should

189
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,950
keep some distance between us

190
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,800
because I don't want

191
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,040
to give my boyfriend the wrong idea.

192
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,800
Okay.

193
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,120
Is his name Xu Yanshi?

194
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,630
What's wrong with him?

195
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,720
Did he lose confidence?

196
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,120
It has nothing to do with him.

197
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,390
It's just me.
I don't want him to misunderstand.

198
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,600
Okay.

199
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,390
If there are any other business matters

200
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,870
next time,

201
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,360
you can contact Chen Shu.

202
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,390
After all, she's responsible
for business matters.

203
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,870
I'm working in the technical department.

204
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,000
Thank you for lunch.

205
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,510
Xiang Yuan.

206
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,150
With your conditions,

207
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,510
you don't have to

208
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,360
endure the pain
of a long-distance relationship.

209
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,240
Think about it,

210
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,670
one boyfriend in Xi'an

211
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,750
and one boyfriend in Shanghai,

212
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,030
wouldn't that be better?

213
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,440
I don't mind.

214
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:54,790
Mr. Lu.

215
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,120
You are morally bankrupt.

216
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,240
I do mind.

217
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,960
I'm sorry.

218
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:18,700
(Lin Qingqing)

219
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:25,870
Qingqing.

220
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,270
Ms. Li.

221
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,360
I'm in the process of leaving,

222
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
and I need

223
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,150
your signature

224
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,480
on my proof of qualifications.

225
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,080
Do you have time?

226
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,080
I've been away on business.

227
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,360
I don't have time.

228
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,320
Why don't you wait a little longer?

229
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,510
Well, Ms. Li,

230
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,550
how about

231
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,270
you send me your schedule

232
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:49,670
for tomorrow?

233
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,870
I'll come to you.

234
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,030
The schedule for tomorrow

235
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,870
hasn't been finalized yet.

236
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,440
How about this, you go find Mr. Li.

237
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,120
Okay?

238
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,000
But Li Yongbiao told me

239
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,550
to ask you

240
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,080
or Xiang Yuan to sign it.

241
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,840
Then you should go to Miss Xiang.

242
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,320
How is that possible?

243
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,390
Well,

244
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,000
if you have any matters,

245
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,720
just go to Miss Xiang.

246
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:12,790
I'm in a meeting

247
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,840
with a client.

248
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,480
I have to go.

249
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,240
We can go to the cinema

250
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,270
after tea, okay?

251
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,360
Hold on a minute.

252
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:32,960
Ms. Li.

253
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,360
Here is the thing...

254
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,240
Well,

255
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,550
who let you in?

256
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,750
I'm busy right now.

257
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,270
No.

258
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,030
I'm not talking to you.

259
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,120
Give me a moment.

260
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,120
I'm busy here.

261
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,720
Don't you see it?

262
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,750
Go out.

263
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,600
Go wait outside.

264
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,790
Go wait outside.

265
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,600
I'm not talking to you.

266
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,000
No.

267
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,870
Someone just came in.

268
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,390
What did you just say?

269
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,910
What movie do you want to see?

270
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,440
Look.

271
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,480
Why is she here again?

272
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,270
Keep your voice down.

273
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,600
Don't let her hear you.

274
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,360
Since she did it,
she should be prepared to be judged.

(Proof of Qualifications)

276
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,150
The data

277
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,080
are different from what I saw before.

278
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:15,790
The data you gave me previously

279
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,840
were not like this.

280
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,360
Take a look at the data.

281
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,360
What are the data from 15 to 17?

282
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,480
Ms. Li.

283
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,000
They are not right.

284
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,320
(Conference Room)

285
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,000
Close the door.

286
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,720
Okay, Ms. Li.

287
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,960
- Take a look again. Hurry.
- Ms. Li.

288
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,550
Sorry, we're in a meeting.

289
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,000
Look at the total volume

290
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,390
of the business,

291
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,840
the date of the new media part

292
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,270
are completely wrong.

293
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,750
Listen to me.

294
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,510
(List of Projects of Lin Qingqing)
Li Yongbiao said

295
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,000
this paper needs your signature.

296
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,840
Why do you decide to leave
all of a sudden?

297
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,510
Has Ms. Li agreed?

298
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,080
I resign for my further
personal development.

299
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,030
Looks like

300
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,360
Li Qin has kicked down the ladder

301
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,670
and is no longer willing to help you.

302
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,440
Or

303
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,360
maybe you never wanted to stay here

304
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,270
in the first place.

305
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,750
Miss Xiang,

306
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,960
what do you mean by saying that?

307
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,960
You're clever.

308
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,960
You should have realized

309
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,750
that Li Qin would definitely
kick down the ladder.

310
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,870
What happened to Li Chi

311
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,240
would also happen to you.

312
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,600
So,

313
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,510
when she came to you back then,

314
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,510
she was just

315
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,600
playing alone

316
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,120
and helping you
become the deputy team leader,

317
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,550
so that you could find a better new job.

318
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,320
I don't understand

319
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,120
why you said

320
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,320
these things,

321
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,600
but I hope

322
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,320
you can help me sign the paper.

323
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,550
I won't sign it.

324
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,440
I'm leaving.

325
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,910
Isn't that what you want?

326
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,360
If I sign it,

327
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,790
wouldn't I be betraying

328
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,000
the efforts of others?

329
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:17,480
I knew

330
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,320
there was something wrong

331
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,600
with you making Lin Qingqing
the deputy team leader.

332
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,150
There is no point
to go against them openly.

333
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,510
Just like what happened
to Li Chi last time.

334
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,200
Didn't I end up

335
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,550
being set up by them?

336
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,840
Xu Yanshi told me a long time ago

337
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,870
that sometimes it's not a bad idea

338
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,550
to play along.

339
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,910
At least we can know

340
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,200
what they really want.

341
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,030
What if

342
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,510
she and Li Qin

343
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,240
join hands?

344
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,550
I'll have

345
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,440
another way to solve it.

346
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,240
But at least we can give it a try now.

347
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,630
What if she does a good job?

348
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,790
What if she brings profits

349
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,240
to the company?

350
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,030
Well,

351
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,240
why wouldn't I want that?

352
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,320
Looks like you have changed a lot

353
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,080
after going to Shanghai.

354
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,670
That's true.

355
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,960
Otherwise,

356
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,510
how would the whole technical department

357
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,440
rely on him alone back then?

358
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,840
Well,

359
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,270
why is he

360
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,510
radiating the aura of a sage

361
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,360
everywhere he goes?

362
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,080
I also feel

363
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,320
a little lost recently.

364
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,000
Maybe I should also
buy an air ticket to Shanghai

365
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,960
and talk to him.

366
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,600
How about I book a ticket for you?

367
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,030
Why do you come to my place?

368
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,240
Ms. Li, you've been too busy.

369
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,270
If I didn't come here,

370
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,550
I wouldn't be able to see you.

371
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,390
What's the matter?

372
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,150
You have to sign

373
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,360
my proof of qualifications.

374
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,270
Have to?

375
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,510
Who do you think you are

376
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,550
that can give me an order?

377
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,320
I put in so much effort

378
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,510
to get you promoted.

379
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,720
Do you really think

380
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,840
I valued your talent?

381
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,510
Or do you think I was being charitable?

382
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,200
It was only because you were obedient

383
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,150
and could be used by me.

384
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,270
Do you think

385
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,870
I can't see through your tricks?

386
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,720
Your tricks

387
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,150
don't work on me.

388
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,270
You want to leave here

389
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,910
after using me.

390
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,320
Do you think it's that easy?

391
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,840
You still need to learn more.

392
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,240
Hello?

393
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:27,480
Miss Lin.

394
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,310
We need

395
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:29,880
your proof of qualifications

396
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,270
to complete the process.

397
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,720
If you can't provide it

398
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,960
by tomorrow,

399
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,240
I'm afraid

400
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,480
we'll have to consider someone else.

401
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,790
Okay, I see.

402
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,550
Okay.

403
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,720
Lu.

404
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,270
She has some nerve coming here.

405
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,240
Yeah.

406
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,640
How could she even do that?

407
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,110
Yeah.

408
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
I heard that she couldn't complete
the resignation procedure.

409
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,480
Is that woman Lin Qingqing?

410
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,510
My friends
in the technical department said

411
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,590
she didn't do anything after she was
promoted to deputy team leader

412
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,960
and took all the credit

413
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,440
for all the projects.

414
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,160
I used to think

415
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,510
she was quite innocent.

416
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,310
Hello.

417
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,590
Mom.

418
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,270
I'm doing well here.

419
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,640
Don't worry.

420
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,590
I'm glad you're okay.

421
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,790
I'm most concerned about your health.

422
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,510
You must eat on time

423
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,070
and take care of yourself.

424
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:52,830
By the way,

425
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,720
didn't you say

426
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,960
you're changing your job?

427
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,110
How is it going?

428
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,590
I've already received a job offer,

429
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,270
and will start my new job tomorrow.

430
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,480
Mom.

431
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,480
Don't worry.

432
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,310
Once I do become established,

433
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,440
I'll bring you over.

434
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,830
Okay.

435
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:07,640
Good.

436
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,830
Go do your things.

437
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,200
Talk later.

438
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,000
Come in.

439
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,070
What's the matter?

440
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:05,750
Miss Xiang.

441
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:06,830
I want to talk to you

442
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,000
about Lin Qingqing.

443
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,680
Go ahead.

444
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,030
This morning,

445
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,830
I heard her on the phone
with her mother,

446
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,030
and I suddenly remembered

447
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,550
what you said to me before.

448
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,550
What did I say?

449
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,640
You said

450
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,750
everyone has a prism in front of them,

451
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,830
and we shouldn't only focus on

452
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,200
the glamour on the surface.

453
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,590
I know

454
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,350
that everyone has a lot of complaints

455
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,200
about Lin Qingqing.

456
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,590
But I also know

457
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,110
that whenever there's a task,

458
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,270
she would always stay late

459
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,720
to finish it.

460
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,110
All of us in the technical department
had lazy moments

461
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,240
during the work,

462
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,510
but she never did.

463
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,110
Even though

464
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:42,920
she made a mistake,

465
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,550
we shouldn't deny

466
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,550
all her past efforts.

467
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,400
Right?

468
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,310
We're colleagues.

469
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,830
It doesn't have to be like this.

470
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,400
What are you trying to say?

471
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,680
I just think

472
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,510
if Boss was here,

473
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,680
it wouldn't have turned out like this.

474
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,110
I really don't like

475
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,790
the current state
of the technical department.

476
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,960
Yeah, when I went to see him last time,

477
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,960
he seemed quite idle.

478
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,000
Here is your coffee.

479
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,160
How's it going?

480
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,350
(Sorry, Miss Lin.)

481
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,110
(We don't have)

482
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,510
(Team Leader of Technical Group)
(any openings you're qualified for.)

483
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,180
(Lisa Haokun Technology HR)

484
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,240
Hello.

485
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,400
Lisa.

486
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,270
Could you please

487
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,160
give me some more time

488
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,920
for the proof of qualifications?

489
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,680
Qingqing.

490
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,310
We don't need it anymore.

491
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,480
We've received

492
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,270
a letter of recommendation
from your superior,

493
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,680
and we're ready to hire you.

494
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:08,720
By the way,

495
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,440
when do you have time

496
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,720
to complete the onboarding process?

497
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,960
Letter of recommendation?

498
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,480
What letter of recommendation?

499
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,830
Xiang Yuan sent that via email.

500
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,240
I can see that

501
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:17,830
your superior

502
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,750
put a lot of faith in your abilities

503
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,920
in your previous work.

504
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,550
Although you don't have much

505
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,510
project experience,

506
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,310
our leader

507
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,790
is satisfied after reading
the letter of recommendation

508
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,510
and hopes you can join us
as soon as possible.

509
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,110
Thank you.

510
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,790
You're welcome.

511
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,830
Talk later.

512
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,200
Miss Xiang.

513
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,110
Miss Xiang.

514
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,030
Haven't you gone to the new company

515
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,070
to complete the onboarding?

516
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,160
Why

517
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,510
did you...

518
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,480
There is no why.

519
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,590
You didn't do anything

520
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,960
for those projects,

521
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,240
so, regardless of who it is,

522
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,720
I wouldn't sign it.

523
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,160
But you are

524
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
more responsible

525
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,350
and hard-working than others.

526
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,400
I only stated the facts.

527
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,750
Miss Xiang.

528
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,310
Thank you.

529
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,000
You should thank Gao Leng.

530
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,240
Actually,

531
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,440
I worked harder than anyone else

532
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,510
when I first came

533
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,270
to the company.

534
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,110
Then what happened?

535
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,240
You were right.

536
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,510
Long before Li Qin came to me,

537
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,720
I was planning to leave.

538
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:35,750
Because

539
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,790
no matter how hard I worked
or how much overtime I put in,

540
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,400
I couldn't get

541
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,480
recognition from anyone.

542
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,510
Velin

543
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:43,720
is like

544
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,350
a bottomless abyss to me.

545
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,510
No matter what I throw into it,

546
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,240
I would never receive any response.

547
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,440
There's a saying

548
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,160
that when you gaze into the abyss,

549
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,200
the abyss also gazes into you.

550
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:02,830
But there aren't that many abysses

551
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,310
in the world.

552
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,000
It's just

553
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,590
people's imagination working.

554
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,830
As long as we keep

555
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,920
shining our own light,

556
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,070
we will be moving forward.

557
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,270
As long as we're moving forward,

558
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,590
why should we care where we are now?

559
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,750
I know, Miss Xiang.

560
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,720
I finally understand

561
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,110
what I want to do

562
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,160
and what I'm suited for.

563
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:28,920
I should insist on

564
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,160
my original passion for technology.

565
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,400
Work hard at the new company.

566
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,510
Don't make Velin look bad.

567
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,030
Miss Xiang.

568
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,110
I have something for you.

569
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,000
You look happy.

570
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,070
Looks like things are going well.

571
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,720
That's right.

572
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,880
Guess

573
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,200
what Lin Qingqing gave me?

574
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,350
What?

575
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,680
Lin Qingqing recorded their conversation

576
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,310
when Li Qin asked her

577
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,590
to lock us in the room.

578
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,920
When she left work today,

579
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,270
she not only apologized to me

580
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,400
but also gave me this USB drive.

581
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,030
Why did she suddenly change her mind?

582
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,240
Just because

583
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,550
you wrote a letter
of recommendation for her?

584
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,720
That's right.

585
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,880
Essentially,

586
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,400
it was Gao Leng's kindness

587
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,110
that touched me.

588
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,510
Is it Gao Leng's kindness

589
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,960
or your kindness?

590
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,440
He did set me straight.

591
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,030
Although I consider myself

592
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,680
a kind person,

593
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,510
it doesn't mean

594
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,030
I have a misconception about kindness.

595
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,640
Kindness is relative,

596
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,920
not absolute.

597
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,550
If I were kind

598
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,480
to everyone and everything,

599
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,480
that wouldn't be kindness,

600
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,880
but cowardliness.

601
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,550
I handled it

602
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,510
so well today.

603
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,240
Shouldn't you

604
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,440
praise me?

605
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,270
Only children

606
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,920
would ask for praise like you do.

607
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,750
Actually,

608
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,960
I expected

609
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,790
that you would write
a letter of recommendation for her.

610
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,070
However,

611
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,350
I didn't expect

612
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,750
that you would ask for praise

613
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,590
like this.

614
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,750
Alright then. Let's go first.

615
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,160
Okay.

616
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,720
Come on.

617
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,680
Gao Leng.

618
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,680
Thank you.

619
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:07,160
Why

620
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,070
are you thanking me?

621
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,880
Thank you for saying nice things about me

622
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,400
to Miss Xiang.

623
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,640
I just

624
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,750
told her

625
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,720
my real feelings.

626
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,640
It's no big deal.

627
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,400
No matter what,

628
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,640
I still want to thank you.

629
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,680
It's nothing.

630
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,160
Gao Leng.

631
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,400
I have one thing

632
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,640
to tell you.

633
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,000
What is it?

634
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,440
I've been having feelings for you.

635
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,790
When I first joined the company,

636
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,480
I listened to you

637
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,070
telling jokes in the office every day.

638
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,070
Not long ago,

639
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,480
we went to the southwest

640
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,440
for the survey with Miss Xiang.

641
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,200
And earlier,

642
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,720
you were the only one
who was willing to talk to me

643
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:04,000
in such circumstances.

644
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,790
Well, I just want to tell you

645
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,680
that the happiness you brought me

646
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,750
is really important to me.

647
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,270
I'm happy every day

648
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,550
when I see you.

649
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,440
Well, Qingqing...

650
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,750
I...

651
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,830
I know.

652
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,000
Well, I just

653
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,350
want to tell you my feelings

654
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,200
before I leave.

655
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,200
After all, we might not

656
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,920
have many chances

657
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,110
to meet again.

658
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,510
I feel much more relaxed

659
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,720
after saying it.

660
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,400
Well,

661
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,110
Lin Qingqing,

662
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,400
you will meet someone you like

663
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,110
and who likes you.

664
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:48,930
Yeah.

665
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,310
Well, I always think

666
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,720
you don't have to force yourself to become

667
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,790
a mature man like them.

668
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,350
You're fine the way you are.

669
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,750
Just be yourself

670
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,440
and you can bring happiness and warmth

671
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,880
to other people every day.

672
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,680
And also,

673
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,310
I believe

674
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,680
that one day

675
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,160
she will realize how amazing you are.

676
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,350
Thank you.

677
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,510
Good luck.

678
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,900
(Happy New Year)

679
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,070
Guys!

680
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,350
Guys!

681
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,790
Look what I've made for you.

682
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,440
I specially made

683
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,550
an ice cream cake.

684
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,240
Aren't you

685
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,000
surprised?

686
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,480
You have to heat up the pan first.

687
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,400
After it's hot,

688
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,790
pour in the seasoning

689
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,750
and let it boil.

690
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,550
Well, if Li Yongbiao finds out

691
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,110
that we're eating hot pot in the office,

692
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,590
will we be in trouble?

693
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,830
- No.
- It's okay.

694
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,200
Leave the cooking to me.

695
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,310
I'll be responsible for

696
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,240
cooking hot pot seasoning.

697
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,240
- It's really delicious.
- I have

698
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,000
a great game.

699
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,750
Come and take a look.

700
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,590
You can have it.

701
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,590
This one?

702
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,270
Who should we give it to?

703
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,270
Okay.

704
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,070
Press enter.

705
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,270
No, why?

706
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,790
Why do you ignore me?

707
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,000
We can't make it through.

708
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,590
We can.

709
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,920
The hot pot is ready.

710
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,720
It's great.

711
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,350
It's mine.

712
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,590
- Here.
- I don't want it.

713
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:20,830
Thank you.

714
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,030
Thank you.

715
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,000
It's the New Year's party.

716
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,440
How can we forget Boss?

717
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,920
Let's video call him.

718
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,590
Okay. Let's do it.

719
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,920
Happy New Year!

720
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,920

This time, not only the power

722

but also the size

723
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,350
has been reduced

724
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,160
by 50%.

725
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,310

Your phone is lagging?

729
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,000
Why are you answering my phone?

730
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,350
I just want to see

Cheers.

What's the matter?

734
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,790
Boss, we're having a New Year's party

735
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,310
and we want to say

736

It's almost midnight.

Let's count down together.

Let's do it.

Come on.

797
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,270
Boss, shouldn't you give out red packets?

798
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,550
- Grab our boss's red packets.
- I...

799
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,030
Come on.

800
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,310
- Send red packets now.
- Love...

You.

802
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,070
What did you say?

803
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,280
Nothing.

Happy New Year.

806
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,400
Huh?

807
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,590
What's going on?

808
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,190
Is the hot pot tripping the circuit?

809
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,280
If Li Yongbiao finds out,

810
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,590
will he deduct our wages?

811
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,440
We still have time to cover up.

812
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,000

817
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,400
left work yet?

818

Yeah, go on!

825
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,880
Go on.

826
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,670
I'll continue

827

with Zhang's story.

828
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:37,800
Okay.

829
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,440
One day Zhang

830
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,710
was walking

831
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,150
on the street...

832
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,280
Happy New Year.

Hello?

838
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,360
Next week is the annual management
summary meeting.

839
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,320
Are you coming?

840
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,630
I'll come and see you and the kid.

841
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:11,920
Well,

842
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,480
has he been a good boy?

843
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,150
Of course.

844
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,320
Yesterday, he said he missed you.

845
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,510
I'll wait for you.

846
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,030
Okay.

847
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,630
(Conversation with Li Qin)
(Don't worry.)

848
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,920
(Just do what I say,)

849
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,440
(and I'll give you)

850
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,110
(whatever you want.)

851
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,280
Li Chi.

852
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,070
There are some misunderstandings

853
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,070
that I want to clarify.

854
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,110
Excuse me, may I take your order now?

855
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:19,920
Just a moment.

856
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,400
Okay.

857
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:27,070
I didn't care too much about it.

858
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:27,760
(Li Chi)

859
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,110
But after Li Chi left,

860
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,230
he did send me

861
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,360
(I didn't lock Xiang Yuan up at the launch event.)
a message.

862
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,920
(Li Chi)
(I won't see you.)

863
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:38,840
(Don't wait for me.)

864
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,190
Mr. Yang has arrived.

865
00:37:59,360 --> 00:37:59,800
Okay.

866
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,280
Okay.

867
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,920
Come on. Line up.

868
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:03,320
Come on

869
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:03,670
Come on.

870
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,320
Good.

871
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,400
Mr. Yang.

872
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,320
Hello, guys.

873
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:19,070
You all look good.

874
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,440
I can tell that Mr. Li

875
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,150
and Ms. Li

876
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,510
have been doing well in management.

877
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,440
It's all because of the good guidance
from the headquarters.

878
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,400
Mr. Yang, thank you so much
for coming to our annual meeting.

879
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:28,960
Please.

880
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,400
Xiang Yuan.

881
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,920
What took you so long?

882
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,960
Sorry, Mr. Yang.

883
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,280
There was a traffic jam.

884
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,960
Are you Xiang Yuan?

885
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:37,760
Yes.

886
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,110
Nice to meet you, Mr. Yang.

887
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,510
Have we met

888
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,800
somewhere before?

889
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,400
Maybe it's because
I attended some meetings in Shanghai.

890
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:47,800
You did?

891
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,360
Miss Xiang is young and talented.

892
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,190
She must have left
a deep impression on you

893
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,920
during the conference earlier.

894
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,510
Please.

895
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,440
Why do I think

896
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,190
she looks like someone?

897
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,710
Who?

898
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:13,020
(Xi'an Velin
Year-end Management Summary Meeting)

899
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,280
Now that everyone is here,

900
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,150
let's get ready for the presentations.

901
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,230
Everyone.

902
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,550

903
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,030

904
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,480
significant progress this year,

905
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,480
which wouldn't have been possible
without your efforts.

906
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,030
Thank you for your hard work.

907
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:31,630
By the way,

908
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,280
I heard that Miss Xiang

909
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,070
did exceptionally well this year.

910
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,280
I'm looking forward
to your presentation later.

911
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,660

912
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:16,920

has done really well this year.

918
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,510
I would suggest

919
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,590
that the headquarters

920
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,480
give you a big award.

I'm surprised.

941
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,190
Miss Xiang has been working here
only for less than six months,

942
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,840
and she organized the launch

943
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,760
of the Cargo Link

944
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,360
Yes.

945

I hope you can keep up the good work.

946

The launch event

947
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:33,230
was well organized,

948
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,510
but Miss Xiang

949
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:36,110
disappeared for more than an hour

950
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,150
and she didn't show up

951
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,400
when it was time for her
to go on stage.

952
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,480
The launch event

953
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,960
almost couldn't proceed.

954
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:41,710
Is that true?

955
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:42,670
How

956
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:43,920
did that happen?

957
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,960
But fortunately,

958
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,190
she came back later.

959
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,760
Since you mentioned it,

960
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,880
I'll explain to everyone

961
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,320
where I was

962
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,590
during that one hour.

963
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:58,360
(I'll let you know)

964
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,630
(where all the security cameras are.)

965
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,030
(I need you to trap Xiang Yuan)

966
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,630
(during the launch event)

967
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,920
(and don't let her go on stage.)

968
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,230
(Okay.)

969
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,070
(When I get it done,)

970
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,920
(you will get me promoted)

971
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,920
(as you promised me, right?)

972
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,360
(Don't worry.)

973
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:14,800
(The position of deputy team leader)

974
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,920
(will be yours.)

975
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,590
(Okay, Ms. Li.)

976
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,880
(I'll do as you say.)

977
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,320
Enough!

978
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,400
Turn it off!

979
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,920
What's this nonsense?

980
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:27,510
This is the record

981
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:29,670
of Ms. Li asking my former subordinate,
Lin Qingqing,

982
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,070
to lock me up in a room,

983
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,800
almost jeopardizing

984
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,320
the last part of the event,

985
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,760
which is the launch of the new product.

986
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,110
So?

987
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:45,230
Mr. Yang, don't you think

988
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:45,760
that was

989
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,030
a very malicious act?

990
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,800
Mr. Yang.

991
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,710
What can it prove?

992
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:51,400
It's not even

993
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,840
my voice.

994
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,360
It's obviously fabricated.

995
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:56,670
How can it be used as evidence?

996
00:42:58,590 --> 00:42:59,550
I think Ms. Li

997
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:00,840
has a good point.

998
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:02,400
We can't even tell

999
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,630
who the people were
in that conversation.

1000
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:04,760
Maybe it's Lin Qingqing

1001
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,400
who resigned

1002
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,030
deliberately framing Ms. Li.

1003
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:08,400
Yeah.

1004
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:09,670
It's possible.

1005
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:11,760
Miss Xiang.

1006
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,480
You've done a good job,

1007
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:16,190
but deliberately

1008
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:17,920
instigating discord among colleagues

1009
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,960
is something I cannot
turn a blind eye to.

1010
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:21,760
Mr. Yang, it's...

1011
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:26,710
It's okay, Mr. Yang.

1012
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,190
I have one more question.

1013
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,480
I wonder if you'll also think

1014
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,190
that I'm instigating discord
among colleagues after seeing this.

1015
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:36,150
Please look at this chart.

1016
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:38,150
I don't know

1017
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,480
if you can find the problem.

1018
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:40,550
In recent years,

1019
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:42,320
(Total Sales and Operating Expense)
the sales performance of our company

1020
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,480
has remained stagnant,

1021
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,150
while the business expenses
have been consistently high

1022
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:49,630
and rising.

1023
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,510
Please look at the next chart.

1024
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,590
The products

1025
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,150
we provide to our clients

1026
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:58,110
are already competitive,

1027
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,510
why do we still need to

1028
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:00,760
pay such high operating expenses

1029
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,440
to keep our clients?

1030
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:04,280
That's right.

1031
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:05,880
It's obvious.

1032
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,510
That's way too much.

1033
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:11,400
Xiang Yuan.

1034
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:13,000
Don't accuse me without evidence.

1035
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,880
Calm down.

1036
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,190
Sit down.

1037
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:18,230
Miss Xiang.

1038
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,320
You're working
in the technical department.

1039
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,480
You only need to

1040
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,400
focus on technology.

1041
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,070
Don't overly concern yourself

1042
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:25,280
with other matters

1043
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:27,030
that are not at your level.

1044
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:30,110
What if someone

1045
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:32,440
is embezzling profits?

1046
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,550
Is she your subordinate?

1047
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:43,230
Xiang...

1048
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,030
Xiang Yuan!

1049
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:44,960
Xiang Yuan!

1050
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,400
You can eat whatever you want,

1051
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,510
but you can't say whatever you want.

1052
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:48,760
Do you have proof?

1053
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
If you make baseless accusations

1054
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,030
without proof,

1055
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:52,880
the company will deal with you seriously.

1056
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,840
Mr. Yang.

1057
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,800
Xiang Yuan is young

1058
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:57,230
and impulsive.

1059
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:58,360
Mr. Yang.

1060
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,550
Calm down.

1061
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:02,360
Here is the proof.

1062
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:07,420
(Private E-ledger;
Name of clients; Actual operating expense)

1063
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:20,670
It's clearly recorded on the form.

1064
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:22,630
April 2017,

1065
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:23,760
Mr. Chen of Huixing,

1066
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,480
the actual operating expense is 200,000,

1067
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:27,000
and the declared expense is 400,000.

1068
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:33,190
April 2018,

1069
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,070
Mr. Liu of Qihuan,

1070
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:36,630
the actual operating expense is 160,000,

1071
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,440
and the declared expense is 280,000.

1072
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,110
Do I need to keep reading it?

1073
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,110
Close it!

1074
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,030
Close it now.

1075
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:58,140
(Xi'an Velin
Year-end Management Summary Meeting)

1076
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:00,510
Xiang Yuan.

1077
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,230
We are aware of the information

1078
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,800
you provided,

1079
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:06,360
but don't forget

1080
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,150
today is our company's

1081
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:10,150
annual summary meeting.

1082
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,670
We're clear

1083
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:12,710
with the evidence now.

1084
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:14,000
After the meeting,

1085
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:14,800
we will submit it to

1086
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,000
the general manager office.

1087
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I also believe

1088
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:18,400
the headquarters

1089
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:20,190
will conduct a thorough investigation.

1090
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,070
If there's nothing to discuss,

1091
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:22,880
the meeting is over.

1092
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:23,800
Mr. Yang.

1093
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,920
Is that all?

1094
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:27,440
Or do you think the evidence

1095
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,190
is not enough?

1096
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:30,550
Miss Xiang.

1097
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:33,590
You're only the director
of the technical department.

1098
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:35,590
You're not qualified

1099
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:36,920
to report your superior.

1100
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,000
Furthermore,

1101
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,150
these are

1102
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,030
internal financial records

1103
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,440
of our company.

1104
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:42,840
Where did you get them?

1105
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:43,920
Explain it to me!

1106
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:48,710
