00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,310
Ms. Cao, it's insane

30
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,560
for a newcomer

31
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,640
to lead a team outing, isn't it?

32
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,350
Ms. Cao.

33
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,480
Well,

34
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:54,920
who

35
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,710
is this

36
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,150
little princess?

37
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,150
She disappeared right after onboarding,

38
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,840
and she's been gone for days.

39
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,310
Remember

40
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,710
when I asked you for leave

41
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,480
for my sister's wedding,

42
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,400
you were so reluctant

43
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,200
to approve it.

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,400
You made my uncle

45
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,310
call Mr. Li personally.

46
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,190
Well, who is she?

47
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,280
We have no problem

48
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,870
with the technical department.

49
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,120
Yeah.

50
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,710
We just want the leader

51
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,800
to give us an explanation.

52
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,590
If the leader

53
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,030
can't do that,

54
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,630
then I'll have to report it

55
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,870
to my uncle.

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,310
Report it to her uncle.

57
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,470
Thank you, Ms. Cao.

58
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,080
Why don't you submit a petition?

59
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,680
(General Manager)
We should kneel down for you.

60
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,120
(They act like
they're speaking with justice)

61
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,310
(only because they want to)

62
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,120
(enjoy the same privileges.)

63
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,190
(Take a few more days off.)

64
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,870
(Why don't they let Chen Shan)

65
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,840
(come talk to me?)

66
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,080
(When they see Chen Shan,)

67
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,710
(they are anxious to be invisible)

68
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,960
(and try to hide themselves.)

69
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,430
(Chen Shan signed it.)

70
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,910
(How could I reject it?)

71
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,430
(If they are able enough, they can)

72
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,280
(let the headquarters
approve the leave request.)

73
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,000
(Xu Yanshi)
(Yanshi.)

74
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,310
(Xiang Yuan's leave request
has caused quite a stir.)

75
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,800
(What do you think?)

76
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,560
Boss probably doesn't know that

77
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,120
Ying Yinyin

78
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,280
is complaining to the HR department.

79
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,120
Do you think

80
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,430
we should do something about it?

81
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,710
Forget it.

82
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,750
I wouldn't dare
to go against Ying Yinyin.

83
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,150
Yeah.

84
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,840
Ying Yinyin is a crazy woman.

85
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,560
If she gets upset,

86
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,470
she will report it to headquarters.

87
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,310
When that happens,

88
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,400
will they support you or her?

89
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,000
Last time, when it came to

90
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,240
the distribution of year-end bonuses,

91
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,400
we clashed with
the marketing department.

92
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,240
Boss even got reprimanded
by headquarters.

93
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,800
They said that we young folks

94
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,870
have high aspirations but puny skills,

95
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,840
and unstable emotions

96
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,520
with no substantial contribution
to the company.

97
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,800
Boss was furious when he came back.

98
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,910
If it wasn't for him,

99
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,800
this lousy company
would have closed down long ago.

100
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,310
What are you drinking?

101
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,680
Heart-nourishing oral liquid.

102
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,150
Nourishing the heart
and guarding against evil,

103
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,190
a must-have object.

104
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,280
If Boss is being treated unfairly,

105
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,310
why doesn't he resign?

106
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,120
He can't resign.

107
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,520
I'm not exactly sure

108
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,710
of the reason.

109
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,710
I just

110
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,710
overheard

111
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,030
Shu mentioning

112
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,960
something about him

113
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,070
being in a five-year project.

114
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,920
He can't resign within five years.

115
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,870
Look at this.

116
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,720
(Xi'an Velin-A Warm Family)
(Xiang Yuan will cover)

117
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,480
(the expenses)

118
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,720
(for field surveys in G402 herself.)

119
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,000
(I just received)

120
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,310
(her survey data.)

121
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,480
(She's new to the company)

122
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,270
(and doesn't know much about)

123
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,120
(the company's rules and regulations.)

124
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,160
(She went out to work)

125
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:37,950
(without following)

126
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:38,870
(the leave procedure.)

127
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,600
(I apologize.)

128
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,560
Boss is so protective today.

129
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,870
(My person made a mistake.)

130
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,750
(It's my dereliction of duty.)

131
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,070
(When she returns,)

132
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,390
(I will educate her properly.)

133
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,510
(Xu Yanshi retracted a message)
Boss is so cool.

134
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,600
He is being tricky.

135
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,560
Why would he retract it?

136
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
He never sent a message

137
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,070
in the WeChat group, right?

138
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,680
He made an exception this time,

139
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,310
and looked so cool.

140
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,480
Did Boss just say

141
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,480
Miss Xiang is his person?

142
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,950
Who else's person could she be? Yours?

143
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,950
Then I'm also his person.

144
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,950
If I suddenly retract a message,

145
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,160
won't you be curious?

146
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,270
They must be really curious

147
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,560
right now.

148
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,070
What's the relationship

149
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,950
between Xu Yanshi and this woman?

150
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,160
Why is he so protective of her?

151
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,830
Is it because he likes her?

152
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,040
Once people's attention is diverted,

153
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,950
it's hard for them to return

154
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,040
to the original question.

155
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,190
So, how did Xiang Yuan,

156
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,560
a newcomer who just joined the company
a few days ago,

157
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,920
manage to get this annual leave approved?

158
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,120
Is it still important?

159
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,190
Why are you so clever now?

160
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,040
Yeah.

161
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,430
Although Boss

162
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,310
usually appears

163
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,000
lazy and indifferent,

164
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,160
not caring about anything,

165
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,750
he can be godertive

166
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,240
when he wants to.

167
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,120
Isn't Gao Leng
Boss's junior in school?

168
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,630
I heard that Boss was quite popular

169
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,630
in Wuqing University.

170
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,160
I, a student from
Beijing Institute of Technology,

171
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,160
even know about Xu Yanshi,
the campus heartthrob.

172
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,920
But now,

173
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,680
he's fallen from grace.

174
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,310
This just proves

175
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,870
that even a lion can turn into
a Hello Kitty

176
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,600
if it sleeps for too long.

177
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,750
However, I'm quite satisfied

178
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,190
with what he did today.

179
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,630
At least he realizes

180
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,070
that he is a lion,

181
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,120
even though he's still far from

182
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,240
fully recovering.

183
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,600
Hello.

184
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,160
See you later.

185
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,270
We are now

186
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,600
on the G402 route,

187
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,800
which is a two-way single-lane main road.

188
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,920
The overall roadbed is ten meters wide.

189
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,430
The road surface is eight meters wide.

190
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,830

00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,790
Qingqing, did you see it?

380
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,070
No.

381
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,790
If it's lost, it's lost.

382
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,510
That's unfortunate.

383
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,400
Everyone in the department
will receive a gift

384
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,480
except him.

385
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,590
When we go downstairs later,

386
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,750
I'll buy him two lollipops.

387
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,640
Is that okay?

388
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,550
Did he offend you?

389
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,510
You'll regret

390
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,750
treating him like that.

391
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,160
You Zhi told me

392
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,750
that he cooked for us

393
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,000
to welcome us.

394
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,400
I haven't had a meal he cooked

395
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,680
for years.

396
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,790
Maybe he's too poor
and wants to save money.

397
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:18,200
But...

398
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:18,920
Let's go.

399
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:22,880
Come on.

400
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:23,920
What to do?

401
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:42,940
(Lijing Haoting Apartments
(Xianning West Road))

402
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,270
(Besides,)

403
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,400
(I was over you a long time ago.)

404
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,920
(What was Xu Yanshi's reaction)

405
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,310
(when he saw it?)

406
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,310
(It would have been fine
if I hadn't added this sentence.)

407
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,160
(With it, it seems like)

408
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,590
(I'm trying to deny something.)

409
00:18:59,240 --> 00:18:59,680
(What should I say)

410
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,440
(when I meet him?)

411
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I just remembered

412
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,790
I made an appointment
with someone today.

413
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,720
Besides, I didn't get a bonus.

414
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,000
What's there to celebrate?

415
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:16,920
If you don't go,

416
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,270
I won't go, either.

417
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,680
It's all boys.

418
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,160
I won't have fun there.

419
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:21,960
Come on.

420
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,720
You said you would come.

421
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,790
Well,

422
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,160
it's about the bonus, right?

423
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,640
I'll give you five yuan.

424
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,510
It's all about participation.

425
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,790
I really have an appointment.

426
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,830
20.

427
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,350
I can't give you more.

428
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,750
Hello, You Zhi.

429
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,510
Where are you?

430
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,270
Just two traffic lights away.

431
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,070
But

432
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,400
there's something going on.

433
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,200
Miss Xiang said she doesn't want to go.

434
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,240
Lin Qingqing heard it

435
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,070
and said she won't come, either.

436
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:01,830
After all, she is lack of her own will.

437
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,550
What do we do now?

438
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,310
Hello.

439
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,960
Put Xiang Yuan on the phone.

440
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,110
Okay.

441
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,240
Boss wants to talk to you.

442
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,480
Hurry.

443
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:22,960
Hello.

444
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,440
Didn't you say you're over me?

445
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,000
Well,

446
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,680
are you scared to come?

447
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,270
You're thinking too much.

448
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,440
It's only because

449
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,590
I want to eat crayfish.

450
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,510
They said

451
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,680
you're having hot pot today.

452
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,830
I'm not feeling good.

453
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,480
I can't eat it.

454
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:43,960
Okay.

455
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,440
Are you sure you won't come?

456
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,550
Sir.

457
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,070
How much further is it?

458
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,960
It's just around the corner
from the intersection ahead.

459
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,960
(Xu Yanshi.)

460
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,400
(You're making this phone call)

461
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,880
(to buy time.)

462
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,180
I see you.

463
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,550
Get off the car.

464
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,270
I'll go buy crayfish.

465
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,310
Boss.

466
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,550
It's You Zhi's phone.

467
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,790
You guys go up first.

468
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,070
I'll go buy crayfish.

469
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,590
Go ahead.

470
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,000
Miss Xiang has my phone.

471
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,920
Miss Xiang, my phone.

472
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,110
Thank you.

473
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,240
Let's go up.

474
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,200
Come on, Miss Xiang.

475
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,270
Well, you don't have to

476
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:46,880
buy crayfish.

477
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,270
I can eat hot pot.

478
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,920
So crayfish

479
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,680
is just an excuse for you not to come.

480
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,790
Sort of.

481
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,110
Didn't you say
we should let go of the past

482
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,240
and start over?

483
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,310
That's because I don't want you
to feel awkward.

484
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,880
I was giving you a way out.

485
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,000
You didn't even reply.

486
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,400
What do you expect me to reply?

487
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,070
I see.

488
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:16,680
Oh.

489
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,000
Okay.

490
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,680
Do you still want to
eat crayfish or not?

491
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,160
Let's walk together.

492
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,310

Sorry.

It's 1.4 yuan.

Are you not gonna answer it?

551
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,310

00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,310
Why did you come to Velin?

568
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,750
It was a coincidence.

569
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,830
I heard from Gao Leng

570
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,590
you're not very happy

571
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,830
at this company.

572
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,070
Do you want to work somewhere else?

573
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,070
I can introduce you to another company.

574
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,720
No need.

575
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,130
Do you want to see

576
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,490
what I

577
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,620
(Receipt)
brought you back

578
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,440
from the southwest?

579
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,720
Don't turn up your nose at

580
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,920
these two lollipops.

581
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,880
I chose them carefully

582
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,440
and bought them especially for you.

583
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,070
- The supermarket receipt fell out.
- This is...

584
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,940
(Lollipops 1.4)

585
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,550
Xu Yanshi.

586
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,000
Sweetie,

587
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,030
this man is divorced

588
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,310
and has a child of about 7 years old.

589
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,480
He's almost thirty

590
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,640
and still lives in
this shabby apartment building.

591
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:36,960
Seriously,

592
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,550
he's poor.

593
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,590
(What?)

594
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,480
(Has Xu Yanshi been divorced?)

595
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,640
(Isn't that child)

596
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,880
(his younger brother?)

597
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,440
(But there are people)

598
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,240
(who disguise their own sons
as their brothers)

599
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,680
(just to find a date.)

600
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,240
(He's such a good person.)

601
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,720
(How did he get divorced?)

602
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,030
Are you an idiot?

603
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:09,960
Chen Shu,

604
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,550
Sales Department Manager.

605
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:12,750
Xiang Yuan.

606
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,310
It's you.

607
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,510
I'm Chen Shu.

608
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,590
I was on a business trip

609
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,720
to Shanghai recently,

610
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,590
and I often heard them
talking about you.

611
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,750
You're a pretty girl.

612
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,480
You're too kind.

613
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,640
You're pretty, too.

614
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:27,750
Thank you.

615
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:33,720
By the way,

616
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,880
Huancheng Apartments will be on sale
at the end of the year,

617
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,880
with elevators.

618
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,160
I know someone.

619
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,440
Well,

620
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,720
how about I use my connections

621
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,030
and get you an internal price?

622
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,510
Let's talk about it later.

623
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,440
(We both try to use connections,)

624
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,160
(why did he act like)

625
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,440
(I did something wrong?)

626
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,270
(Xu Yanshi, what's your problem?)

627
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,110
Well,

628
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,400
you're not still thinking about
going back to Shanghai, are you?

629
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:56,070
I've asked around for you.

630
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,270
Chen Shan meant

631
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,350
that she will get you back

632
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,160
next year

633
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,440
at the latest.

634
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,750
I think the headquarters
probably feels the same way.

635
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,680
This place

636
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,640
probably won't last
until the end of next year.

637
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,880
When the branch office is closed,

638
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:09,920
she'll have a reason

639
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,830
to bring you back.

640
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,200
But I think

641
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,720
even if you go back to the headquarters,

642
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,960
it won't be any better than here.

643
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,880
- Are you thirsty?
- I...

644
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,480
(Why don't you ask me if I'm thirsty?)

645
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,480
I'm thirsty.

646
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,160
We can talk about it later.

647
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,590
Where is Xu Chengli?

648
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,880
Boss said his vacation is over

649
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,270
and he has already returned to Shanghai
to attend primary school.

650
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,070
It's a boarding school.

651
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,750
He's all alone in Shanghai

652
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,160
at such a young age.

653
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,070
He must be missing Boss every day.

654
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,270
I'll go back to spend two days

655
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,480
with him every month.

656
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,590
Honey, there you are!

657
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,000
Do you want to strangle me

658
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,960
to find a new one?

659
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,000
I should have known

660
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,680
that you're interested in Ying Yinyin.

661
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,550
What?

662
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,480
I'll be killed by lightning

663
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,640
if I'm interested in Ying Yinyin.

664
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,680
What about your dream girl, Ashers?

665
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,350
Ashers...

666
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,200
Who's Ashers?

667
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,640
(Men all like to play the field.)

668
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,750
I forgot to tell you

669
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,750
that Chen Shu is Gao Leng's girlfriend.

670
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,070
Why should I care?

671
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,310
Guys, go get prepared

672
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,680
and we'll eat on the rooftop.

673
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,350
Got it.

674
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,200
- Okay.
- Okay.

675
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,400
Here comes the food.

676
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,920
- Hurry.
- Come on.

677
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,480
It's nice.

678
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,160
- It smells so good.
- There is so much meat.

679
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,000
What do you want to eat?

680
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,920
Is that okay?

681
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,310
How many times have I told you?

682
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,000
Why can't you remember?

683
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,880
I want seafood sauce, not sesame sauce.

684
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,350
Green onions, not cilantro.

685
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:07,000
Capsicum frutescens, not chili oil.

686
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,110
And three drops of oyster sauce.

687
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,030
Is that hard to remember?

688
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,310
It's hard to remember.

689
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,590
Make your own dipping sauce next time.

690
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,640
It's done.

691
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,640
(He actually remembered this.)

692
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,200
Come on, let's have a drink together.

693
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:27,790
Okay, come on.

694
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:28,350
Come on.

695
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,920
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

696
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,350
It won't open.

697
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:34,550
Let me do it.

698
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,640
Here, Zhang Jun.

699
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,000
Okay.

700
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,000
This is for you.

701
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,440
How about we play a game?

702
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,070
Again?

703
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,550
- You love playing but are bad at it.
- No.

704
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,200
It's a new game and it's fun.

705
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,480
Well,

706
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,350
this game is called ''Of Course''.

707
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,160
That is to say

708
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,830
no matter how absurd

709
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,480
the question is,

710
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,510
you have to answer ''Of course".

711
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,960
If you fail to answer,

712
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,960
you have to drink.

713
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,550
All right?

714
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,160
What's so hard about that?

715
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,790
You Zhi.

716
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,640
Do you think

717
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,160
Shi Tianyou is very manly?

718
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,030
Of course.

719
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,750
I knew you'd think so.

720
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,200
Shi Tianyou.

721
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,110
Since you're so manly,

722
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,510
do you never take showers?

723
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,030
Of course.

724
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:35,000
I'm a big fan of dry cleaning.

725
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,240
Gao Leng.

726
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,750
You will break up with Shu,

727
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,350
right?

728
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,000
Well,

729
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,440
how is that possible?

730
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,350
What a coward.

731
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,400
Drink up.

732
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:53,960
Boss.

733
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,550
Did you

734
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,750
have a crush on Miss Xiang before?

735
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,790
Of course.

736
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,590
Really?

737
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,200
Crayfish.

738
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,750
Crayfish.

739
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,160
Who ordered crayfish?

740
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,070
Me.

741
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,070
I can see why.

742
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,720
After all, Boss

743
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,240
never buys out-of-season food.

744
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,550
Is crayfish out of season now?

745
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:38,830
Actually,

746
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,440
I think the reason
why Boss doesn't buy it

747
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,270
is that

748
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:42,680
it's expensive.

749
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,830
Every kind of food,

750
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,000
whether it's out of season or not,

751
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,070
we should respect it.

752
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:51,510
Right?

753
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,550
But cilantro

754
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,550
will probably

755
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,110
never earn my respect.

756
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,030
Anyway,

757
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:01,880
we still welcome you

758
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,920
to join us.

759
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,270
Although after you joined us,

760
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:06,000
Boss seemed to have gone crazy,

761
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,550
we don't mind

762
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,230
making him even crazier.

763
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,590
By the way,

764
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,000
I don't think we've ever seen

765
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,960
Boss in love.

766
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,630
So we're looking forward to seeing

767
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,440
how he'll talk back

768
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,230
to his girlfriend.

769
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,230
You have misunderstood.

770
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,880
We're not in that kind of relationship.

771
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,800
Xu Yanshi and I are just...

772
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,480
We went to the same high school.

773
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:28,960
It's not

774
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,280
what you guys are thinking.

775
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,670
So,

776
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,150
just shut up and eat crayfish.

777
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,150
Okay.

778
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,400
Forget what I said.

779
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,590
I'll be right back.

780
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,590
That's why you two don't look like

781
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,030
you just met.

782
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,550
Turns out you were schoolmates
in high school.

783
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,800
No wonder Boss
confronted Ying Yinyin for you

784
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,190
in the WeChat group.

785
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,480
Confronted Ying Yinyin?

786
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,440
You don't know it?

787
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:04,880
No.

788
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,590
We were in the mountains,

789
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,550
and I have

790
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,710
the group messages on mute.

791
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,320
Who bothers to look at that?

792
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,360
It's okay.

793
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:11,760
She doesn't know.

794
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,480
Let me vividly describe it

795
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,190
to you.

796
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,150
What happened is

797
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,190
that Ying Yinyin sent a message

798
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,150
in the WeChat group,

799
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,360
then Boss

800
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,400
immediately replied.

801
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,280
(Xi'an Velin-A Warm Family)
He was like a god from heaven.

802
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,670
He was really cool.

803
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,710
Really, really cool.

804
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,180
(''XYS'' retracted a message)

805
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,400
I see.

806
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,630
What message did Xu Yanshi

807
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,360
retract?

808
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,760
I want 200 yuan.

809
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,360
I took a screenshot

810
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,480
with high definition and not pixelated.

811
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:40,760
It's too expensive.

812
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,190
I don't have to know it.

813
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,840
Another poor guy.

814
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,150
Boss is poor enough.

815
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,360
Now he's with another poor woman.

816
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,760
How are you gonna live your life?

817
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,710
Gao Leng, lend me the money.

818
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,030
Shi Tianyou, lend her the money.

819
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,590
Why me?

820
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,400
What did I do?

821
00:35:59,400 --> 00:35:59,960
All right.

822
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,190
It's nothing.

823
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,590
There is no screenshot.

824
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,920
If you want to know,

825
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,190
go ask Boss yourself.

826
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,800
I was going to tell you

827
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,280
that there is a company I know

828
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,150
that wants to poach you.

829
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,440
It's not as prestigious

830
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,150
as Xingheng with ideals.

831
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,280
It's just a start-up company.

832
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,070
But their boss

833
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,190
especially appreciates you.

834
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,400
He has mentioned it to me
several times.

835
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:27,670
Come on.

836
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,550
It tastes great.

837
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,880
During my trip to Shanghai this time,

838
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,670
he asked me out and we talked all night.

839
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,880
He provided

840
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,550
a pretty good offer.

841
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,150
What kind of offer?

842
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,440
Director of the technical department

843
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,030
with five insurances and one fund.

844
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,510
The basic annual salary
is 600,000 yuan a year,

845
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,400
plus project bonuses.

846
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,710
If you're doing well,

847
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,920
getting an apartment in Shanghai

848
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,030
won't be so difficult.

849
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,550
Honey.

850
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,920
Come over and eat.

851
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,150
I'll peel the crayfish for you.

852
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,240
Okay.

853
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,350
We're out of alcohol.
Can you get me a drink?

854
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:03,400
Are you two just schoolmates?

855
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:08,730
The spicy one is good.

856
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,480
But I feel like

857
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,190
you know her well.

858
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,920
I've known you for so long.

859
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,800
Although I don't think

860
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,800
you're a stingy person,

861
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,960
it's a bit unusual for you

862
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,670
to specifically buy crayfish

863
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,920
for someone.

864
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,920
Coming.

865
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,440
Where are the crayfish?

866
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,510
Come on. Sit down.

867
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,110
Here.

868
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,630
You Zhi.

869
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,440
Pass me the vegetables.

870
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,760
I'll pass them on to you.

871
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:34,960
Is it good?

872
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,230
This one.

873
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,360
It's good.

874
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:38,630
Come on.

875
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:40,800
Have a taste.

876
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,230
Cheers.

877
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,480
Come on. Let's play a drinking game.

878
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,030
Come on. 15, 20.

879
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:55,710
10.

880
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:56,820
You lost.

881
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,800
Come on. Let's drink.

882
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:01,960
You heard it.

883
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:04,680
Cheers!

884
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,550
You two

885
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,880
were talking openly.

886
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,670
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

887
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,070
I never thought

888
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,630
it would turn out like this today.

889
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,400
Same here.

890
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,960
I remember
you were into space technology

891
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,030
when you were in high school.

892
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,440
Now you're working on
navigation at Velin.

893
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:29,880
It's like a dream came true.

894
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,920
For most people,

895
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,590
navigation only exists on their phones

896
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,920
and in their cars.

897
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,920
But it's far more than that.

898
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,760
In my heart,

899
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,550
it's something

900
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,840
fascinating.

901
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,480
Navigation positioning

902
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,710
is like having a conversation
with the satellites in the sky.

903
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,070
Now, there are

904
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,070
no fewer than ten satellites
above our heads,

905
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,150
watching over us.

906
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,670
When we lose our way,

907
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,960
the satellites will

908
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,710
contact their partners for us.

909
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,110
Even if one day

910
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,550
we're separated by mountains

911
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,030
and oceans,

912
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,920
as long as the stars are connected,

913
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,230
I can find you.

914
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,880
(That sounds romantic.)

915
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:44,070
You make it sound romantic.

916
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,440
Is that a shooting star?

917
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,150
You must have made a mistake.

918
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,280
Look.

919
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,110
What?

920
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,440
Do you want to make a wish?

921
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,710
Do you know what it means

922
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,760
to get what you wish for?

923
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,360
I just heard from the class monitor

924
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,030
that there's a lecture on aerospace

925
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,190
tomorrow afternoon.

926
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:22,400
That's great.

927
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,630
Let's skip class and go see a movie.

928
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,550
Xu Yuan.

929
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,840
Who's that guy?

930
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,070
Are you serious?

931
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:40,760
We've been talking about him

932
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,630
for half a semester,

933
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,630
and you still don't know him?

934
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,030
It's the new transfer student in class 2,

935
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:45,920
Xu Yanshi.

936
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,590
He's super smart.

937
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,480
He even won the first prize
in the math competition

938
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,590
the day before yesterday.

939
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,630
Oh my goodness.

940
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,280
He single-handedly

941
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,800
raised the grades of boys

942
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,030
in our grade.

943
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,630
Hello, Xu Yanshi.

944
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,590
I'm Xiang Yuan.

945
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,400
I'm from class 5.

946
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,030
I heard that you're good at math.

947
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,630
I envy you.

948
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,030
I'm bad at math,

949
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,230
and I always fail.

950
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,030
Like that theorem

951
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,590
we learned a few days ago,

952
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,280
the cosine rule,

953
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,590
I still don't understand it.

954
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,760
Don't you have a class now?

955
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,550
I do.

956
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,800
Then you should hurry back.

957
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,340
(Satellite Communication
Systems and Applications)

958
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,030
There's a lecture

959
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,320
by an aerospace expert
tomorrow afternoon.

960
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,030
Are you going?

961
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,800
What a coincidence. I'm going too.

962
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,420
(The Development of Beidou Navigation)
Everyone.

963
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,550
You know,

964
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,550
(China Coordinates Beidou-2)
on April 14,

965
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,230
2007,

966
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:53,070
the Beidou-2 satellite was
successfully launched,

967
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:55,070
marking the beginning

968
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:57,800
of the Beidou-2 era.

969
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,360
It's fundamentally different

970
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,510
from the Beidou-1 experimental satellite

971
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,280
launched a few years earlier.

972
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,070
Its signal coverage

973
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,400
includes the entire Asia-Pacific region,

974
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:09,230
and its positioning accuracy

975
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,360
reaches...

976
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:12,360
(Deployment Procedure)
It can reach

977
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,670
fifty nanoseconds.

978
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:15,920
This means

979
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:18,150
that the data

980
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,110
from our Beidou-2 satellite

981
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,440
has reached

982
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,670
the civilian level

983
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,840
of the GPS.

984
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,230
Now

985
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,440
I'll show you a video.

986
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,030
Feng Jun, let's switch seats.

987
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,070
Why?

988
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,760
I want to listen better

989
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,230
to the aerospace expert's lecture.

990
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:49,760
Don't you hate

991
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,510
these lectures?

992
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:51,880
Less talking. Switch or not?

993
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:53,840
500 yuan.

994
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,320
Are you crazy?

995
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,150
Because you're my friend,

996
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,030
I'll give you a discount.

997
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:59,000
250 yuan.

998
00:42:59,230 --> 00:42:59,880
I...

999
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,480
Look at that.

1000
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,110
It looks like my constellation.

1001
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,400
I'm a Gemini.

1002
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,630
What's yours?

1003
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:34,360
That's the orbit of a satellite.

1004
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:38,230
You're good.

1005
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,150
Did you win the championship

1006
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:43,550
of the satellite navigation contest

1007
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:45,070
when you were five?

1008
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,110
Well,

1009
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:47,280
you can't even tell
the orbit of a satellite?

1010
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,000
Shut up.

1011
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:00,500
(English Practice Exam for Grade 11 58)

1012
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:05,480
No.

1013
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:08,110
Please.

1014
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,030
I only got 58 points.

1015
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:11,550
Please help me with it.

1016
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,320
I'm begging you.

1017
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,760
Xu Yanshi, you...

1018
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,320
For the sake of

1019
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,550
this little frog,

1020
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:50,760
please teach me.

1021
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,550
You can start by
memorizing the vocabulary.

1022
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:15,110
I did it.

1023
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:18,110
To which word?

1024
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:20,590
Zoo.

1025
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:22,510
You're almost done.

1026
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,840
But I memorized it backwards.

1027
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,760
Do you

1028
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,550
only have a one-minute passion

1029
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:33,880
for everything?

1030
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,230
That's not true.

1031
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,710
What about math?

1032
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,960
It's too hard.

1033
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,630
It takes me a long time
to solve a problem.

1034
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,400
What about Chinese?

1035
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:44,070
I can't remember it.

1036
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:45,400
The way those ancient people spoke

1037
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,280
is too strange.

1038
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,320
But

1039
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:53,920
there is one thing

1040
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:55,880
that I definitely have
a longer passion for.

1041
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,880
Guess what it is.

1042
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:07,280
Only one hour.

1043
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:09,550
Every day after school,

1044
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:10,710
I'll tutor you for one hour.

1045
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,030
From 5:30 pm to 6:30 pm.

1046
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:13,400
I'll leave when the time is up.

1047

With you tutoring me,

1048
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:17,030
