Do you know

30
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,200
you nearly fainted?

31
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,000
You just got out of the hospital.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,640
Don't you know

33
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,040
your own health condition?

34
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:46,840
Why did you stand out

35
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,950
for everything?

36
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,950
Take the coffee.

37
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,510
Sorry.

38
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,000
I got mad.

39
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,910
I forgive you.

40
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,870
Can you get out of my way?

41
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,680
How to deal with

42
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,710
the thing about Li Chi?

43
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,240
Tell everyone the truth.

44
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,470
That the maintenance man is the one

45
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,430
who did that.

46
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,430
Li Chi shouldn't be the scapegoat.

47
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,540
(Meeting Room)

48
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,910
Everyone, attention please.

49
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,470
The one who installed the camera

50
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,400
has been found.

51
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,280
It's a maintenance man from outside.

52
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,150
It has nothing to do with Li Chi.

53
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,840
Rest assured.

54
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,960
We'll send an e-mail

55
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,630
inside the company.

56
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,240
Stop your acting.

57
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,470
You guys pretended to

58
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,470
clear my name.

59
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,590
Actually, you want me to leave here now.

60
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,960
Listen.

61
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,680
I've had enough

62
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,150
in this place!

63
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,240
Li Chi.

64
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,080
Sorry.

65
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,280
I suspected you
of installing the camera.

66
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,190
I apologize.

67
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,960
I wronged you.

68
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,870
I'm so sorry.

69
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,190
You come out

70
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,150
just to tell me this?

71
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,560
And

72
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,470
please delete

73
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,280
Chen Shu's photo.

74
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,280
Why?

75
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,280
Because she's my girlfriend.

76
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,680
I won't delete them.

77
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,750
So?

78
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,590
Besides,

79
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,430
do you think Chen Shu

80
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,590
really likes you?

81
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,470
What are people like you?

82
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,430
Oh.

83
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,070
Right.

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,560
Gigolos.

85
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,600
You haven't married her

86
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,310
yet.

87
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,070
Even if you get married,

88
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,560
it won't last long.

89
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,830
I'll kill you!

90
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,360
Stop fighting!

91
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,680
Go and stop them.

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,120
I'll kill you!

93
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,190
Gao Leng. Stop!

94
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:43,630
Stop fighting!

95
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,480
Li Chi.

96
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,070
The fight has been shot.

97
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,680
Say it again!

98
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,120
Stop fighting!

99
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,800
Come with me.

100
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,920
Why did you call him away?

101
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,870
Did he flirt with you in private?

102
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,360
Could I get you away?

103
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,270
Didn't you say you could handle it?

104
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,430
Didn't you say you wouldn't be naive?

105
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,830
That's because he just said...

106
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,560
Forget it.

107
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,750
What do you mean?

108
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,160
We should break up.

109
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,040
Argue and then break up?

110
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,920
Is it so easy to say that out?

111
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,310
Why?

112
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,680
I got punished.

113
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,720
Why... Why could Li Chi

114
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,870
get out?

115
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,750
Look at you.

116
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,510
Why did you offend him?

117
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,040
He is Mr. Yang's people.

118
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,390
Yinyin.

119
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,600
Don't be so willful

120
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,800
and childish.

121
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,190
To be frank,

122
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,240
everyone knows

123
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,360
you are stupid and...

124
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,560
So, they don't mind it.

125
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,240
If someone intended

126
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,310
to harm you,

127
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,070
you could have been killed.

128
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,310
Honestly,

129
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,040
I don't know

130
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,160
his relationship

131
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,430
with Yang Pingshan either.

132
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,720
Yang Pingshan stepped in for him
this time.

133
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,750
It means no one here

134
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,950
can touch him.

135
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,950
No one can touch him…

136
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,800
No one can touch him.

137
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:48,600
Then I...

138
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,600
Uncle.

139
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,480
Do you mean

140
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,560
I'm not the one who has

141
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,560
the greatest background in Velin?

142
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,270
Am I no longer

143
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,510
the number one in the company?

144
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,000
I...

145
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,870
He hangs up on me so fast.

146
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,870
I'm nothing now.

147
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,480
No. No.

148
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,870
I'm done.

149
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,870
How is it possible?

150
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,800
I'm not the number one in the company.

151
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,160
Even the coffee is so bitter.

152
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,120
Are you looking for me?

153
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,870
Hey.

154
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,160
Here comes the Boxing Champion.

155
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,750
Yuan.

156
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,950
Do you tease me

157
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,750
too?

158
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,000
Mocha.

159
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,270
Thanks.

160
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,680
Did you bicker with her?

161
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,950
I'm so confused

162
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,120
about you girls.

163
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,390
What's this?

164
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,120
Look at it.

165
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,870
You are involved in it.

166
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,360
People naturally blacklisted you from it.

167
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,160
Don't you feel that

168
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,240
we no longer check Moments

169
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,480
in the office?

170
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,510
This thing gets so big.

171
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,680
Even the headquarters have known it.

172
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,390
How would she think about it?

173
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,070
Chen...

174
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,160
Has Chen Shu known it?

175
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,360
Of course she has known it.

176
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,800
She's been in Velin for years.

177
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,480
Nothing can escape her ears.

178
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,600
I... I was too furious.

179
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,390
It's said that

180
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,000
you were a Straight-A student too.

181
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,840
The study was hard, right?

182
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,440
Certainly.

183
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,440
All students have a hard time
during their school year.

184
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,550
But after working for so many years,

185
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,270
I finally understand

186
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,630
that study may be

187
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,000
a relatively fair way

188
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,320
for common people like us

189
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,720
to be successful.

190
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,440
But I would not go back

191
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,320
to that time

192
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,480
and study again.

193
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,000
I still remember my study life
In senior high school.

194
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,030
It was a nightmare.

195
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,600
Actually, everyone has a prism

196
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,150
in front of them.

197
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,790
From the prism, people can see

198
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,960
all sides of themselves.

199
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,270
As adults,

200
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,840
we should keep every side

201
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,440
clean, decent and glamorous.

202
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,750
But only you know

203
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,200
what you've experienced behind.

204
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,030
Take Chen Shu as an example.

205
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,440
She studied so hard that she could

206
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,320
get an opportunity to be educated
in Shanghai.

207
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,200
She worked so hard in the company,

208
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,910
in order to be transferred
to the headquarters

209
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,000
and stay in Shanghai.

210
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,670
But your punch

211
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,030
to Li Chi

212
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,240
broke her prism

213
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,270
into pieces.

214
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:47,910
From these pieces,

215
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,080
they negated

216
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,510
all her hard work,

217
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,720
and put them into the way

218
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,480
they could make fun of.

219
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,670
How would she think about it?

220
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,080
I just...

221
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,840
In society,

222
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,870
women are easier

223
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,670
to be reproached

224
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,270
and criticized

225
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,870
than men.

226
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,750
When you work hard,
they say you neglect the family.

227
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,960
When you are family-oriented,
they say you rely on men.

228
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,390
If you had considered more for her

229
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,150
in her position,

230
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,440
you wouldn't

231
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,750
have been so impulsive.

232
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,510
Don't break

233
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,870
anyone's prism at will.

234
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,080
Moreover,

235
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,910
Chen Shu values her dignity.

236
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,510
Think about it.

237
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,940
(Chen Shu)

238
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,440
(Honey,)

239
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,900
(I'm so sorry.)

240
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,740
(I got impulsive again.)

241
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,600
Good morning.

242
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,510
Good morning.

243
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,630
You are in good spirits.

244
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,240
I thought

245
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,120
you'd be in pain

246
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,440
for some time.

247
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,320
Then you'd realize

248
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,840
you don't match Chen Shu.

249
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,440
What did you say?

250
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,200
What?

251
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,720
Are you angry?

252
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,960
I am right.

253
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,600
Chen Shu dumped you.

254
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,790
I think

255
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,240
you should stop struggling.

256
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,320
Since she said to break up,

257
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,960
she wouldn't turn back.

258
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,440
People like her

259
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,600
are decisive

260
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,000
when leaving.

261
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,200
What did...

262
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,030
Hello, Shu.

263
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,600
What are you doing?

264
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,240
Li Chi, you come so early.

265
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,440
I thought

266
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,910
I was late.

267
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,510
Let me go.

268
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,320
Morning, Miss Xiang.

269
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,550
Morning.

270
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,390
Hello.

271
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,480
Hello.

272
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,750
Could you tell me

273
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,670
when you can offer

274
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,390
the drawing of

275
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,270
the Cargo Link Navigation System?

276
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,480
There are only a few days left.

277
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,550
How is it going?

278
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,670
The time is tight

279
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,960
for the factories and us.

280
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,440
Please be sure to give us

281
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,200
before the deadline.

282
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,750
Alright?

283
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,320
OK. No problem.

284
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,960
Rest assured.

285
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,030
OK. OK. Thanks.

286
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,910
Thanks. Goodbye.

287
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:04,840
Come in.

288
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,840
What's the matter?

289
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,630
I bought too many cups of milky tea.

290
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,630
Try it.

291
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,790
Too sweet.

292
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,870
I only drink oolong tea.

293
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,200
Why do you come to me?

294
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,120
Only for milky tea?

295
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,720
I... I want to ask

296
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,200
when the drawing
of the Cargo Link Navigation System

297
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
will be finished.

298
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,750
Most of it is done.

299
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,440
But the function of

300
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,320
safety driving assist

301
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,390
needs to be improved.

302
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,030
What?

303
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,200
Are they urging?

304
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,440
Three days.

305
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,600
Tell them it'll be done in three days.

306
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,270
OK.

307
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,440
Go out with me tomorrow.

308
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,000
What?

309
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,120
Test the system of the vehicle terminal.

310
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,510
OK.

311
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,030
It tastes so bad.

312
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,700
(Velin)

313
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,000
Is the development
of Cargo Link Navigation System

314
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,120
almost finished?

315
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,790
Yes.

316
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,150
Our company pays great attention

317
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,270
to the car navigation market.

318
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,270
Now most of the power

319
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,630
is in my hands.

320
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,390
If it's successful this time,

321
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,510
Velin will divert

322
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,910
to cargo truck navigation market.

323
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,600
All the clients we have now

324
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,750
will desert us.

325
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,320
Xiang Yuan

326
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,080
is unpredictable.

327
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,840
She shouldn't get high above me.

328
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,960
I have an idea.

329
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:23,550
Say it.

330
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,510
I'll leave it to you.

(Anji Manju Shanqu B&B)

364
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,000
Have you booked rooms?

365
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,030
I don't think we need to.

366
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,790
What if there's only

367
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,590
one room?

368
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,310
The chances are slim.

369
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,160
Sorry.

370
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,510
I didn't have time to rebook for you.

371
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,820
(33 rooms available, 22 double rooms,
11 twin rooms)

372
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,880
Sir.

373
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,480
This is so cute.

374
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,790
That's the new version.

375
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,790
Hang it up after brushing your teeth.

376
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,750
It takes up little space
and is hygienic.

377
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,510
What's the use

378
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,440
of this kitty box?

379
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,200
It's an ultraviolet sterilization box.

380
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,270
It's like this.

381
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,920
Let me show you.

382
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,400
Come.

383
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,510
Open this cover.

384
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,350
Put the brush in.

385
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,790
It can be sterilized automatically.

386
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,920
I'll take one.

387
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,640
OK.

388

389

Here.

396
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,510
Working like this, you will die.

397
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,070
I am alive and well. Right?

398
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,640
You were not like this in school.

399
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,440
Back then you could rank the first

400
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,590
easily.

401
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,160
When did you become so hard-working?

402
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,830
After you started to work?

403
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,680
The mission is

404
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,720
kind of different now.

405
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,750
What is it?

406
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,400
Because of you.

407
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,720

409
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,000
You asked me

410
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,920
when I became like this.

411
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,830
I thought about it.

412
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,310
Maybe when I became the team leader.

413
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,310
Responsibility?

414
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,550
Responsibility?

415
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,880
Not so sentimental.

416
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,000
I just think

417
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,160
it's fine if I starve alone.

418
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,240
But I don't want others
to starve with me.

419
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,720
What are you doing?

420
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,200
I can do it alone.

421
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,480
Don't forget. I am a team leader too.

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,590
and signed

579
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,720
before submitting it.

580
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,480
You don't know specialized knowledge

581
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,830
and don't understand the file,

582
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,680
so you didn't find the problem

583
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,880
in time.

584
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,110
In a word,

585
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,070
you rely on Xu Yanshi, don't you?

586
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,920
Miss Xiang.

587
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,400
Forget it.

588
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,590
If you keep investigating,

589
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,350
both of us will be punished.

590
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,240
Miss Xiang.

591
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,030
I can send you

592
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:43,880
the contract now.

593
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,940
Right now...

594
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,060
(Person in charge: Xiang Yuan)

595
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,180

(Send)

601
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,140
(Letter of Production Confirmation)

602
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,110
Are you looking for me?

603
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,480
Xiang Yuan doesn't understand it.

604
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,880
But you are a technician.

605
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,070
Don't you know the difference

606
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,640
between version 1.3 and version 1.8?

607
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,830
You get an excuse

608
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:00,920
for your girlfriend so fast.

609
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,640
Xiang Yuan signed it

610
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,920
in black and white.

611
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,110
Do you blame me?

612
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,550
What will you do to me?

613
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,440
Listen.

614
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,200
If there is any problem,

615
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,240
Xiang Yuan will be punished too.

616
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,550
You can try.

617
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,030
I'm so full.

618
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,620
(Version 1.3)

619
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:54,920
What are you gonna do?

620
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,720
I want Li Chi to leave our team.

621
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,720
Because of the drawing?

622
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,160
Look at the confirmation letter.

623
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,510
The number three

624
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,880
was obviously scrapped.

625
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,880
I suspect it was done by Li Chi.

626
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,070
But there is no evidence.

627
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:08,740
(Version 1.3)

628
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,000
I checked Li Chi's

629
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,110
work record.

630
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:16,270
He had not completed his work,
and his progress was slower than others.

631
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,510
And he didn't coordinate

632
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,680
with other teammates at all.

633
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,270
He isn't suitable

634
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,200
in the team.

635
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,680
It should be reported
to the headquarters.

636
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,160
Li Chi also has an unusual relationship

637
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,200
with Li Qin.

638
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,590
It's not easy

639
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,750
to transfer him away.

640
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,310
Li Qin?

641
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,070
Gao Leng told me

642
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,830
that you defended Li Chi

643
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,480
for what he did.

644
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:42,830
Even if I didn't do it,

645
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,160
Li Qin would defend him.

646
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,830
Li Qin owes me a favor

647
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:47,680
now.

648
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,590
(Has Xu Yanshi)

649
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,070
(become so diplomatic?)

650
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,160
What about this time?

651
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,440
I just want to remind you.

652
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,440
Don't tell others

653
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,000
about getting Li Chi away.

654
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,790
I'll handle it.

655
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:02,920
I'm not doing this

656
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,160
for myself,

657
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,000
or doing it emotionally.

658
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:06,880
I'm responsible

659
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,320
for all my teammates.

660
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,030
I hope they...

661
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,760
You'll understand after a long time.

662
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,440
Sometimes,

663
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,190
if you can't do anything,

664
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,400
then play along.

665
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,760
So, as for responsibility,

666
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,070
you were just saying.

667
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,510
(Hello. Welcome.)

668
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,880
(You covered up Li Chi.)

669
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,960
Ma'am. I...

670
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,440
Ma'am.

671
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,800
All the meat burgers, please.

672
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,480
Thanks.

673
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,030
OK.

674
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,440
Why do you like

675
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,190
eating these things?

676
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,360
Yuan.

677
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,550
Why did you buy the food

678
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,030
Boss likes?

679
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,150
Good morning, Mr. Li.

680
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:35,620
(General Manager)

681
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,190
Good morning, Mr. Li.

682
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:36,670
Good morning.

683
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,000
Cao.

684
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:43,360
Mr. Li.

685
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,960
Remember to do what I told you

686
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,440
yesterday.

687
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:47,550
Mr. Li.

688
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,150
Got it?

689
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:48,920
OK. OK.

690
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:51,800
Well, Mr. Li.

691
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,480
I'm going to work.

692
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:52,800
OK. Go.

693
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,190
OK.

694
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,230
Remember it.

695
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,960
Miss Xiang.

696
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:03,400
Are you waiting for me so early?

697
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,670
As the leader, you are very busy.

698
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,150
I'm afraid you have no time to meet me.

699
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,510
You must have something to say.

700
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,550
Tell me.

701
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,840
I want to get Li Chi away

702
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,070
from our department.

703
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,280
Did Xu Yanshi ask you to come to me?

704
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,880
The logistics department is too idle,

705
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,510
not suitable for young men

706
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,190
like Li Chi.

707
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,550
You should understand it.

708
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,360
Did Xu Yanshi go to you?

709
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,590
He was earlier than you,

710
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,320
at the door of my house.

711
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,670
Thank you, Mr. Li.

712
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,670
Xu Yanshi.

713
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,710
What are you doing here?

714
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,030
I'm packing up for Boss.

715
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:56,760
He is leaving.

716
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,480
Will Li Qin fire Xu Yanshi

717
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,710
because of Li Chi?

718
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,710
What are you

719
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,480
talking about?

720
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,000
Come with me.

721
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,440
No matter he is Li Chi,

722
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,360
or Ms. Li's man,

723
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,590
I will kill him.

724
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,440
Calm... Calm down.

725
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,880
I'm preparing files

726
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,840
for Boss's business trip.

727
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,960
Business trip?

728
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,590
Yeah.

729
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,840
One week in Shanghai.

730
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,760
Sorry.

731
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,070
What's going on?

732
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,070
It's my decision to force you to leave.

733
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,030
Stay away from Xiang Yuan.

734
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:43,480
Boss.

735
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,400
Do you keep the best food

736
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,440
to the last

737
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,800
when you are eating?

738
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,710
Like eating a strawberry cake.

739
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,960
You eat the cake first
and keep the strawberry.

740
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,110
What do you mean?

741
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,800
I'm telling you

742
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,800
according to my experience.

743
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,760
If you keep the strawberry,

744
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,710
it'll be robbed away sooner or later.

745
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,230
No one can take my things away.

746
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,190
Wait and see.

747
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,150
Did Boss tell Li Yongbiao

748
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,400
to get Li Chi away?

749
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:24,190
Great.

750
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,880
Boss is so great.

751
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,360
Don't take it personally.

752
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,070
In my opinion,

753
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,590
it is because of you.

754
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,280
If you hadn't told

755
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,030
Boss

756
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,150
to get Li Chi away,

757
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,710
he wouldn't have offended others.

758
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,000
He got disappointed,

759
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,230
and has been tolerated all the time.

760
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,360
Why did he get disappointed?

761
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,880
When Boss just came,

762
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,550
he worked very hard with us,

763
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,000
even sleeping in the company every day.

764
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,670
He wished to perform well

765
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:54,360
and be transferred to the headquarters.

766
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,670
Why is he still there?

767
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,440
Because there were not

768
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,590
enough places for those
who have strong backgrounds

769
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,480
in the Beijing branch.

770
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,070
The places for Velin were canceled.

771
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,590
So, is he still suppressed

772
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,190
by those who have backgrounds?

773
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:08,110
You can check that list.

774
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,150
It's either the Lis

775
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,230
or the Zhaos.

776
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,880
And some Zhous.

777
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,670
All have backgrounds.

778
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,710
Does he

779
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:19,280
hate closely-related units?

780
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,840
Yes.

781
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,630
Anyway,

782
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,550
don't talk about getting Li Chi away

783
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,000
in front of him again.

784
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,550
If Boss is fired,

785
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,760
you'll suffer a lot.

786
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,360
Will... Will he resign?

787
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,280
No.

788
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:35,510
But I think

789
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:37,030
it's better if he leaves.

790
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,880
He won't have a good time
in the headquarters.

791
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:40,960
Li Qin might speak ill of him

792
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,190
to Mr. Yang.

793
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,150
Mr. Yang?

794
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,030
Yang Pingshan, vice president of Donghe?

795
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,840
Ms. Cao.

796
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,670
Miss Xiang.

797
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,800
What's the matter?

798
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,360
Please get me

799
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,480
Li Chi's KPI

800
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:03,630
and attendance record

801
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,550
in the past years.

802
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,140
Li Chi's?

803
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,480
OK. I'll get them for you.

804
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,100
(Attendance Record)

805
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,400
Yuan. What's the matter?

806
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,110
I miss you.

807
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,150
Stop.

808
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,190
You want my help again, right?

809
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:33,440
Do me a little favor.

810
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,360
The last time you talked

811
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,190
in this tongue

812
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,670
was when

813
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,840
you blew your school lab up.

814
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,760
My gosh.

815
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,150
Tell me.

816
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,230
I can bear with it.

817
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,320
I want to reorganize
the technical department.

818
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,070
What's your plan?

819
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,670
Do you know Li Chi in our department?

820
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,320
Who?

821
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,230
An engineer.

822
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,590
He's been here for three years,

823
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,840
but his performance is terrible.

824
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,670
He doesn't contribute much

825
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:58,800
to the company either.

826
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,150
The effort of the whole department

827
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:01,800
was almost ruined

828
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,440
due to his faults.

829
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,590
It came out on several occasions.

830
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,550
Li Qin's man?

831
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:09,440
I knew you know him.

832
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,840
So, what do you want to do?

833
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,670
Transfer him away.

834
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,000
He can't be in the technical department.

835
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,440
Go tell Li Qin.

836
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,960
Why do you tell me?

837
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,510
If it worked,

838
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:19,590
he wouldn't have been

839
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,880
in the company for so many years.

840
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,440
Grandpa.

841
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,630
I'm talking to you seriously.

842
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,070
OK. OK.

843
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,070
When I didn't enter the company,

844
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,630
I didn't know about employees' hardships.

845
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,360
I didn't know what they care about.

846
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,710
They work overtime

847
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:32,510
and stay up late

848
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,440
for KPI.

849
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:34,590
I don't know

850
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:35,440
what that means to them.

851
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:35,800
I didn't understand either.

852
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,360
Now I know.

853
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,590
The physical and psychological pressure

854
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,070
on them

855
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:41,630
may not knock them down.

856
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,880
What matter to them is

857
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,840
the results

858
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,110
that they have earned hard,

859
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:47,110
which are covered or even stolen.

860
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:51,000
I don't want

861
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,320
these things

862
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,230
in my department.

863
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,000
I want all my men

864
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,110
can be treated

865
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:57,590
fairly.

866
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:59,630
All their effort

867
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,190
can be paid back.

868
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:02,800
You said so much.

869
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,320
I see

870
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,670
what you mean.

871
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:08,000
Grandpa, I know you are
the kindest to me.

872
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,230
You know me best.

873
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:11,110
You agree then.

874
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:13,480
Then you'll only have one chance
asking for my help.

875
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,880
Forget it.

876
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,360
Miss Xiang.

877
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:35,230
Will you

878
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,880
transfer me away?

879
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,000
Aren't you happy about that?

880
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,670
You don't need to work anymore.

881
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:41,920
No one manages you.

882
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,400
Suddenly, I think

883
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:51,480
you are much more powerful

884
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,150
than Chen Shu.

885
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,550
When I was chased by a large dog

886
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,000
at the age of three,

887
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,110
I ran and yelled.

888
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,480
Then I knew I'm powerful.

889
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,880
Because dogs bark at me

890
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:07,630
when they see me.

891
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,360
I forgot to remind you.

892
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,000
I've been spoiled

893
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:14,800
since childhood.

894
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:16,360
I have a bad temper.

895
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,070
So, I warn you.

896
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,960
You are employed to work

897
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:20,510
in the company,

898
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:22,000
not to loaf around

899
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,280
and get paid without working.

900
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:27,800
Miss Xiang.

901
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:29,920
I might be begged off

902
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,150
but not be coerced.

903
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:33,630
If you beg me,

904
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,150
I'll be good.

905
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,030
You can invite me

906
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:38,150
to go to a movie

907
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,710
or have dinner.

908
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,150
And you'd better play cute.

909
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:44,230
Then I will promise anything.

910
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,920
But

911
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,760
you are so fierce.

912
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,480
I don't like that.

913
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,030
I am

914
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:53,510
very rebellious.

915
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,630
I like to do things

916
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,230
that you don't want me to do.

917
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,280
Xiang Yuan.

918
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,110
I'm telling you.

919
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:03,630
You are not

920
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:05,000
a qualified leader.

921
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:05,800
A picture was changed

922
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,440
