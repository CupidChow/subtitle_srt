It's just that I still couldn't

83
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,870
get in touch with him.

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,560

(How did you get Gu Yan's phone number?)

102
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,190
(It was quite unexpected.)

103
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,160
(The only unexpected thing)

104
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,160
(ever happened to me.)

105
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,750
Take a look at this.

106
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,830
Why were you so rigid?

107
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,480
You should be gentle to a girl.

00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,560

109
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,560
What did you say?

110
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,360
Say it again if you dare.

111
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,630
She shouldn't have gotten in my way.

112
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,720
I just couldn't stand her attitude.

113
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,390
Don't mess with me again.

114
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,360
I won't be lenient with her.

115
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,600
Miss Xiang,

116
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,510
I haven't given my permission

117
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,800
to your flexible working hour system.

118
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,310
How could you announce it?

119
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,950
Ms. Li, didn't you demand

120
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,360
the technical groups

121
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,270
to keep discipline?

122
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,870
I'm simply following your request

123
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,870
to adjust the system.

124
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,560
Do you think anyone can gain

125
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,950
extra performance?

126
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,240
You submit it to the headquarters first.

127
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,800
After the headquarters approves it,

128
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,000
then we'll talk about the details.

129
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,240
But the headquarters has approved it.

130
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,680
They have?

131
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,560
It usually takes

132
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,830
the headquarters 10 to 15 days

133
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,360
to give a reply to such matters.

134
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,120
Your whimsical

135
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,800
work system will never

136
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,480
get the approval of the headquarters.

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,800
Was the headquarters

138
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,360
so slow with a reply to you?

139
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,680
They're fast today.

140
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,430
Check your e-mail.

141
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,500

143
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,800
(is on Chen Shan's side.)

144
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,510
Then I'll be looking forward

145
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,120
to the results of your new system.

146
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,480

00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,240
Bye-bye.

148
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,950

149
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,390
Xiang Yuan's

150
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,950
attendance reform

151
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,120
within the technical department?

152
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,800
Don't you think she's making

153
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,510
too much of a scene
as a new team leader?

154
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,870
Who is her target?

155
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,000
She's just a young girl.

156
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,000
A new broom sweeps clean.

157
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,360
Who do you think is her target?

158
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,600
What do you think?

159
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,070
That's ridiculous.

160
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,390
Young people are hotheaded

161
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,310
and ill-considered.

162
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,750
She's just like Xu Yanshi

163
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,720
when he first came.

164
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,190
Mr. Chen,

165
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,270
this is our new system.

166
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,030
We have some minor problems

167
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,910
with the system installation.

168
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,240
Mr. Chen,

169
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,390
I can give you…

170
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,150
Look.

171
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,750
You don't have to worry about this.

172
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,390
It's not gonna be a problem.

173
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,240
We will arrange everything for you.

174
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,270
Mr. Chen,

175
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,670
if you are uncertain,

176
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,360
I can give you

177
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,510
a detailed introduction.

178
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,200
Mr. Chen,
I look forward to our next meeting.

179
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:55,960
Sure.

180
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,960
I'll leave then.

181
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,510
Wang, see Mr. Chen off.

182
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,150
OK.

183
00:08:59,150 --> 00:08:59,910
This way, please.

184
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,480
The technical department

185
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,960
doesn't need to come to meetings
with our clients anymore.

186
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,360
Why?

187
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,150
I know

188
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,790
you're very close

189
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,870
with Chen Shan.

190
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,120
But sometimes,

191
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,600
working hard is just not enough.

192
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,480
Donghe's human relations
are complicated.

193
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,390
If you want to
go to the R&D department,

194
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,120
her support is not enough.

195
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,030
Because she is not here.

196
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,360
You should know

197
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,630
whose side you should take.

198
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,840
To upgrade the system,

199
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,510
we need hardware

200
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,120
and protocols.

201
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,080
Research and development

202
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,320
will be an illusion without investment.

203
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,510
This is not a problem
you should worry about.

204
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,510
The system must be constructed
in two steps.

205
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,720
What's so hard about it?

206
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,840
A few codes will do.

207
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,960
There is no need to fight about work.

208
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,000
Yanshi is right.

209
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:05,630
The job

210
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,960
can't be done without money.

211
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,630
But Ms. Li's hands

212
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,870
are tied.

213
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,320
We have to understand each other.

214
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:11,960
Isn't that right?

215
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,300
(Work Plan)

216
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,620
(Recycle Bin)

217
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,620
(Are you sure you want to delete
the 2 files permanently? Yes)

218
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,360
Yang Pingshan said

219
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,120
Situ family

220
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,670
is declining.

221
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,600
Both of the heirs goof around every day.

222
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,080
If Situ Mingtian

223
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,440
shuts down

224
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,960
the Velin company

225
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,200
the next year,

226
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,960
we'll need to

227
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,750
work out some plans for ourselves.

228
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,870
Things always have a way
of working out in the end.

229
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,870
Sometimes,

230
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,360
you simply can't do anything in advance.

231
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,240
Besides,

232
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,440
Velin has been in business
for so many years.

233
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,240
It's the mainstay

234
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,510
of many enterprises.

235
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,910
How can he just shut it down?

236
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,030
You think too much.

237
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,440
You seem quite optimistic.

238
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,320
I got some good Pu'er tea recently.

239
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,750
It's 30 years old.

240
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,240
Please.

241
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,030
You're gonna lose your job,

242
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,320
yet you have the mood to drink tea.

243
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,870
You know,

244
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,000
Ms. Li is putting pressure on me again.

245
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,600
The 50%

246
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,550
of Mingxiong Electronics' order

247
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,080
really can't wait any longer.

248
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,630
Otherwise,

249
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,720
I don't think Xu Yanshi

250
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,120
can manage it.

251
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,960
Let's proceed without him.

252
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,510
Make an appointment tonight.

253
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,550
Sure.

254
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,550
How about dinner?

255
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,790
Do you dare?

256
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,120
Why not?

257
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,270
Can you drink?

258
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,150
Try me.

259
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,080
I knew you could.

260
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,080
Should I tell Xu Yanshi?

261
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,320
I can handle

262
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,630
such a small issue.

263
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,480
OK.

264
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,120
I'm counting on you.

265
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,000
I'll get to work.

266
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,340
(Hospital)

267
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,440
You're awake.

268
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,120
Nurse.

269
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,200
Nurse.

270
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,600
There's nothing wrong.

271
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,390
Pay attention to his vitals.

272
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,840
Make sure they're stable after surgery.

273
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,000
If anything goes wrong,

274
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,270
call me at any time.

275
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,480
- Okay, sure.
- Thanks.

276
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,030
You are welcome.

277
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,790
Thank you.

278
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,360
How do you feel?

279
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,120
Not bad.

280
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,320
Not bad?

281
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,910
Your sudden collapse

282
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,270
baffled us.

283
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,870
While you were in a coma,

284
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
we went through all sorts of

285
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,150
difficulties

286
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,630
getting you treated.

287
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,030
Finally, we saw a silver lining.

288
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,150
It's so dramatic.

289
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,960
Thanks to Xu,

290
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,750
he found Director Gu.

291
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,320
I owe you another favor.

292
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,870
Alright,

293
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,870
Xu needs to go back and get some rest.

294
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,390
He's been with you all night.

295
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,360
Have a good rest.

296
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:20,960
OK.

297
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,790
Then, if anything goes wrong,

298
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,600
let me know anytime.

299
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,960
- OK.
- Bye.

Look.

317
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,360
(Huang Qiming)
Two strokes

318
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,390
missing in his signature.

319
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,480
Didn't you

320
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,510
go with Xiang Yuan?

321
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,390
How could you let her get drunk

322
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,670
and offend Huang Qiming?

323
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,360
But, this really has

324
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,120
not much to do with Xiang Yuan.

325
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,630
Besides, Huang Qiming

326
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,320
had already decided

327
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,440
not to cooperate with us.

328
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,030
Xiang Yuan just happened to

329
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,600
give him

330
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,630
an excuse.

331
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,790
So what?

332
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,240
Everyone can tell

333
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,320
that he doesn't want to
cooperate with us.

334
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,630
But that's not an excuse

335
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,120
for us to stop trying.

336
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,240
But, think about it.

337
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,000
His demands

338
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,200
are getting more and more difficult
every year.

339
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,720
If it weren't for Xu Yanshi's

340
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,910
new algorithm this time,

341
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,480
we would have taken a loss.

342
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,030
Besides, Xiang Yuan

343
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,080
was indeed drunk.

344
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,750
When she came back,

345
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,120
she couldn't stand on her own.

346
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,270
On the ground floor
of the office building,

347
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,840
she couldn't stop vomiting.

348
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,320
Ms. Li,

349
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,360
I don't know if you still remember.

350
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,150
He ran his mouth

351
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,720
in front of Xu Yanshi.

352
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,910
It's unbelievable that Xu Yanshi

353
00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:59,440
put up with it.

354
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,240
Otherwise,
this cooperation would've been gone.

355
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,030
Huang Qiming thinks

356
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,160
we can't do anything about him.

357
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,480
That's why he's so arrogant.

358
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,510
He's arrogant because he's a client.

359
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,160
You're more arrogant.

360
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,880
Who is the boss?

361
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,180
(Huang Qiming-Mingxiong)

362
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,790
(Sorry, the number you've dialed)

363
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,000
(is busy.)

364
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,720
(Please call again later.)

365
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,270
He won't even answer my call.

366
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,920
He is

367
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,070
the magnate of the factory-installed
products market.

368
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,510
What now?

369
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,440
This incident must be taken seriously.

370
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,640
Fire Xiang Yuan.

371
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,160
Immediately!

372
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,030
Wait,

373
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,110
this really

374
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,310
has nothing to do with Xiang Yuan.

375
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,160
There is no need

376
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,830
to make such a big deal out of it.

377
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,270
The girl works hard.

378
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,720
She's drunk,

379
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,750
right?

380
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,070
On another day,

381
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,310
we'll ask Xiang Yuan

382
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,680
to apologize to Mr. Huang.

383
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,640
Mr. Huang is highly tolerant

384
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,720
of girls.

385
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,270
Then he'll complete

386
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,510
his signature.

387
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,110
Mr. Li,

388
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,240
Xiang Yuan is now

389
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,400
on a business trip to the headquarters.

390
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,480
How about this?

391
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,310
Once she returns,

392
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,880
we'll make an appointment with
Huang Qiming.

393
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,480
OK, then.

394
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,440
Call Xu Yanshi.

395
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,240
Tell him he and Xiang Yuan

396
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,110
will have to deal with this.

397
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,510
If the problem is not solved,

398
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,030
Xiang Yuan will have to go.

399
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,480
Chen Shu.

400
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,960
We all

401
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,920
have to take the right side.

402
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,590
You should know

403
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,720
the situation in Donghe.

404
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,000
So you should know what to do.

405
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,160
Ms. Li, you seem sure about winning.

406
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,640
Congratulations.

407
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,830
(Ice cream, dessert, drinks)
How did you find me?

408
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,790
Is it hard?

409
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,640
I asked around,

410
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,000
and I knew everything.

411
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,070
Come on, let's eat.

412
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:19,750
On the plane,

413
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,750
I didn't even eat before I fell asleep.

414
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:31,960
Hello?

415
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,640
Is Xiang Yuan with you?

416
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,640
She's here.

417
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,240
I knew

418
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,000
she must have gone to you.

419
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,070
Are you two

420
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,270
serious

421
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,310
this time?

422
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,270
You're thinking too much.

423
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,070
Do you want to speak to her?

424
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,480
No.

425
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,510
I just thought

426
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,960
I need to let you know.

427
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:11,350
Hello, Mr. Huang.

428
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:11,880
Hello!

429
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,350
Mr. Huang.

430
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,350
Hi!

431
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,550
Take a seat.

432
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:16,960
Right.

433
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:17,790
Um…

434
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,750
Let Miss Xiang

435
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,480
sit next to me like last time.

436
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,160
Come on, girl.

437
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,750
It's not often
that you get a pretty girl

438
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,110
to pursue you every year.

439
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,160
Miss Xiang,

440
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,750
you're not bad.

441
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,440
I gave you

442
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,590
only three days.

443
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,550
By upgrading the algorithm,

444
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,920
you did solve the problem.

445
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,160
Then, Mr. Huang, you said last time,

446
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,310
as long as the problem is solved,

447
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,310
you would

448
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,960
place another 50% of the order.

449
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,310
So the order…

450
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,640
I'll sign it.

451
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,550
We can sign it today.

452
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,700
That's what we all want.

453
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,820
(Cooperation Agreement)

454
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,550
But…

455
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,510
You don't trust
our technical department?

456
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,920
You made me wrong.

457
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,110
Since

458
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:09,920
you want me

459
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,750
to sign this contract

460
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,160
during the dinner,

461
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,350
we should

462
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,830
follow the rules

463
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,720
of the dinner.

464
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,400
No problem.

465
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,270
To you.

466
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,510
Xiang Yuan got wild with wine

467
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,350
and vomited on Huang Qiming.

468
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,160
She even wiped her mouth with his tie.

469
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,790
After that, she tied a bow.

470
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,160
She's got a lot of shenanigans.

471
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,680
Me?

472
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,510
What happened later?

473
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,160
Mr. Huang, Mr. Huang!

474
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,400
One second, please.

475
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,590
What is going on?

476
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,400
Weren't you

477
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,350
drinking happily back inside?

478
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,590
Happily?

479
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,030
How could I be happy with this?

480
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:54,750
Um…

481
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,790
Look what your star employee

482
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,830
has done!

483
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:57,920
Miss Xiang

484
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,240
vomited on Mr. Huang

485
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,400
and she also…

486
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,640
Mr. Huang

487
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,440
has never been so humiliated

488
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,400
in his life.

489
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,640
What's the point of talking to her?

490
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,350
Get in the car.

491
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,510
Mr. Huang, I'm sorry.

492
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,480
No matter what happened tonight,

493
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,440
it's all my fault!

494
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,550
Xiang Yuan,

495
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,070
you could at least apologize

496
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,480
- to Mr. Huang.
- Keep her mouth shut!

497
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,750
Get in the car.

498
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,480
Come on.

499
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,240
Really?

500
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,000
You're laughing now?

501
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,680
He shouldn't have said the bad things
about Xu Yanshi.

502
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,640
Oh my God!

503
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,070
Let me see.

504
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,590
Unbelievable. You know what?

505
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,640
Mr. Huang has

506
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,640
a big mouth.

507
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,160
With a little alcohol,

508
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,440
he'd say anything.

509
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,340
(Huang Qiming)

510
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,750
My lady,

511
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,720
the last two strokes?

512
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,350
Couldn't you hold it a little longer?

513
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,510
No.

514
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,070
My scale is broken.

515
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,640
No one can say anything bad about
Xu Yanshi.

516
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,240
What are you talking about?

517
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,170
But, seriously,

518
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,270
this is really not her fault.

519
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,750
Huang Qiming

520
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,070
is a wily man.

521
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,480
He's got all kinds of dirty ideas.

522
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,920
Xiang Yuan is just too young.

523
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,720
Her response to provocation

524
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,480
is far out of line.

525
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,440
She's too young.

526
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,510
Anyway, you know what?

527
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,950
This girl

528
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,160
is so interesting.

529
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:16,990
You should see

530
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,270
how furious Huang Qiming is.

531
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,080
He didn't even answer our call.

532
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,440
And in the end,

533
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,080
we had to call his secretary.

534
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:25,750
Anything else?

535
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,990
Li Qin is mad about this.

536
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,710
She wants Xiang Yuan gone.

537
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,080
What's Li Yongbiao's opinion?

538
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,470
He's a fence-sitter.

539
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,540
He didn't take a stand

540
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,980
and kept acting numb.

541
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,580
But Li Qin seems

542
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,580
very determined.

543
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,660
She said

544
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,940
if we don't solve this,

545
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,780
Xiang Yuan must be expelled.

546
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,420
I reckon

547
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,020
she'll collaborate with the headquarters

548
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,380
to put pressure on Li Yongbiao.

549
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,460
So?

550
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,900
You want to protect her?

551
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:54,900
OK.

552
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,180
Then you should talk to Li Qin.

553
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:56,740
OK.

554
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,580
How long will she be away?

555
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,020
For three days.

556
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,260
Anyway, there's

557
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,460
a training session at the headquarters.

558
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,860
Neither you nor Yang is available.

559
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,300
She has to go.

560
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,620
Li Yongbiao said

561
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,540
you have to

562
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,220
take care of this.

563
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,620
Tell Huang Qiming
I need a few more days.

564
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,260
When my vacation is over,

565
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,460
I'll go with her.

566
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,500
OK.

567
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,100
I'll try to stall Li Yongbiao

568
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,580
and buy you the time.

569
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,060
Thank you.

570
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,180
It's Chen Shu?

571
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,500
Now you regret it?

572
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,660
When you vomited on Huang Qiming,

573
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,980
why didn't you think about
the consequences?

574
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,380
No way!

575
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,340
He insulted

576
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,220
and humiliated

577
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,660
my boss and colleague

578
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,180
who I respect and admire.

579
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,580
Xu Yanshi

580
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,420
is a legend to me.

581
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,820
He's a noble

582
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,780
and amazing man.

583
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,860
He's the only person

584
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,020
who never takes annual leave.

585
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,900
How dedicated and hard-working

586
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,740
he is

587
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,380
as the mainstay

588
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,340
of the department.

589
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,220
When you hear such a good colleague

590
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:15,700
being insulted

591
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,660
- and humiliated
- OK, stop.

592
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,340
at the dinner,

593
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,620
would you do nothing about it?

594
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,380
As a representative of the company,

595
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,380
I couldn't swallow the insult.

596
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,860
So on behalf of the company,

597
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,140
I gave him a little lesson.

598
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,100
Just

599
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,340
a little one.

600
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,340
I should not have asked.

601
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,220
But,

602
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,380
you don't need

603
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,660
to put yourself in that position

604
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,060
anymore.

605
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,020
I can't let you do that for me.

606
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,540
Promise me.

607
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,500
OK.

608
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,420
They're all my favorites.

609
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,780
Can you read my mind?

610
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,380
Aren't you hungry?

611
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:02,780
Come on.

612
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,100
Let's eat.

613
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,020
(How does he know)

614
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,540
(my favorite food?)

615
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:18,980
No worries about the calories?

616
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,340
I don't understand you,

617
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,180
Mr. Xu.

618
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,660
If you don't understand Mandarin,

619
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,260
I can repeat it

620
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,260
in Cantonese.

621
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,540
I'd be more confused then.

622
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,900
Really?

623
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,820
Didn't you speak fluent Cantonese

624
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,740
in the car that day?

625
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,300
Miss,

626
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,780
put on more layers if you feel cold.

627
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,420
What are you doing with your hoodie on?

628
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,340
It's really scary

629
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,780
at midnight.

630
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,700
What are you talking about?

631
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,380
I don't understand.

632
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,140
Yes, I did!

633
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,180
So, are you laughing at me now?

634
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,220
I dare not.

635
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,300
Eat some vegetables.

636
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,660
Don't just eat meat.

637
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,940
Honey,

638
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,460
I bought you a present.

639
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,980
What is it?

640
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,180
(Luxury caviar facial mask)

641
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,020
How did you know I like this brand?

642
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,900
There's nothing about you
that I don't know.

643
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,140
By the way,

644
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,300
Durian Witch looks

645
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,300
unhappy.

646
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,020
Did you

647
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,660
have a fight with her?

648
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,300
Well,

649
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,180
is Miss Xiang gonna be alright?

650
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,780
Are you worried about me,

651
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,420
or just

652
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,820
your leader?

653
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,500
I...

654
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,220
Of course, I'm worried about you.

655
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,180
Are you?

656
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,300
I…

657
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,420
I swear!

658
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,380
I clearly asked

659
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,300
your fight first.

660
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,820
And I bought you a present.

661
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,180
Then I asked

662
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,420
if Miss Xiang's gonna be OK.

663
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,540
I'm just kidding.

664
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,380
I just talked to Xu Yanshi

665
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,300
on the phone.

666
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,060
He'll meet Huang Qiming
when he gets back.

667
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,100
Then everything will be fine.

668
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,980
I'm not 100% sure.

669
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,900
We're in two crises.

670
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,380
After all, Li Qin and Huang Qiming

671
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,900
are both hard nuts to crack.

672
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,100
Don't worry.

673
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,020
My Boss will deal with it,

674
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,100
no matter what trouble

675
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,140
Miss Xiang causes.

676
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,460
Don't worry about it.

677
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,300
Put on a mask before bed.

678
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:21,980
Tomorrow is another

679
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,380
day full of vitality.

680
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,980
Or you could get wrinkles.

681
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,500
Have some soup.

682
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,340
Hey,

683
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,780
who is plumper? Me or Ying Yinyin?

684
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,900
It's just an indicator.

685
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:44,900
It means nothing.

686
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,140
If you want to compare,

687
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,100
compare how fast your fat

688
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,180
burns.

689
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,620
What's that?

690
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,860
How would I know?

691
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,340
You'll see

692
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,340
when your body is cremated.

693
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,300
Are you finished?

694
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,140
You haven't

695
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,540
answered my question yet.

696
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,620
You're plumper.

697
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,180
Xu Yanshi, you...

698
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,860
Say that again.

699
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,260
It's good to be plump.

700
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,420
It means you're happy.

701
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,980
It's me, Li Yang!

702
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:32,940
(No!)

703
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,260
(It's the big mouth of the class.)

704
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,060
(He'll let everyone know about us.)

705
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:37,780
Do you know him?

706
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:38,820
No, I don't.

707
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,860
He mistook me for someone else.

708
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,500
Let's go.

709
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,460
Wait.

710
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,100
What's up, Yuan?

711
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,940
Why did you pretend

712
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,980
that you didn't know me?

713
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,260
Have you forgotten the lavish meal

714
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,620
I treated you and Xu Yuan with?

715
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,420
How can you do that?

716
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,420
How could I forget?

717
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,300
Well,

718
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,820
it's just…

719
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,300
too dark. I didn't recognize you.

720
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,180
You must be Xu Yanshi.

721
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,260
I remember you.

722
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,340
The best student in Class 2.

723
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,100
All the girls in my class

724
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,460
admired you so much.

725
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,300
Hello, Mr. Xu.

726
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,220
My name is Li Yang.

727
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,820
Yuan and I were classmates.

728
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:17,860
Hi.

729
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,100
Come, I'll give you a ride
in my new car.

730
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,620
We got plans.

731
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,060
Can't talk right now.

732
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:27,660
Bye.

733
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,780
Are you simply taking a stroll,

734
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,220
or dating?

735
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,300
Don't make it wrong.

736
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,340
He's my leader now.

737
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,620
We are in the same company.

738
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,620
Colleagues.

739
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,220
Can we go now?

740
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,860
When I asked you a while ago,

741
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,420
didn't you say

742
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,620
you were playing games at home?

743
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,500
What happened?

744
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,740
You broke up with your boyfriend

745
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,740
and no one supported you?

746
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,500
Don't talk nonsense.

747
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,020
We're busy.

748
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:51,500
Let's go.

749
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,700
Get in the car.

750
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,100
It's gonna be late.

751
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,540
For the sake of the Maserati.

752
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,060
You've never been in one?

753
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,260
Have you?

754
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,460
No.

755
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,860
I can't even

756
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,500
pay off my credit card,

757
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,820
let alone ride in such a fancy car.

758
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:15,860
Let's go.

759
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,140
Was there a rumor about you two

760
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,020
back then?

761
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,220
Shut up!

762
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,300
Don't be such a chatterbox.

763
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,020
I'm not very good at conversation.

764
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,060
Please don't mind me, Mr. Xu.

765
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,620
So, are you two

766
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,740
back together,

767
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,660
or what?

768
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,620
Just colleagues.

769
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,900
(A young rich girl)

770
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,700
(working for him.)

771
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,460
(Come on, leader?)

772
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,900
(I bet she's definitely)

773
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,100
(after something else.)

774
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,100
(Judging by Xu Yanshi's attitude,)

775
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,700
(Xiang Yuan will need to try harder)

776
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,940
(to get the legend of the school.)

777
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,380
(OK, let me help you.)

778
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,060
Yuan,

779
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,020
let's have fun tonight.

780
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,540
There's a dinner party.

781
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,940
I invited our classmates.

782
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,500
We can bring Mr. Xu.

783
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,820
He'll be the biggest surprise tonight.

784
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:13,620
Think about it.

785
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,940
Almost all girls

786
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,780
in our class

787
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,900
had a crush on him.

788
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,500
You know what?

789
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,860
Xu Yuan will be there, too.

790
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,820
Hey, Mr. Xu,

791
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:22,900
come to the party.

792
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,060
We guys in Class 5 were poor students.

793
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:29,940
To be clear,

794
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,220
Yuan

795
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,060
usually hung out with

796
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,620
poor students like us.

797
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,740
To be honest,

798
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,220
over the years after we graduated,

799
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,180
we seldom met

800
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,580
excellent students

801
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,940
like you.

802
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,260
I remember your photos

803
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,340
were always on top

804
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,020
of the bulletin board

805
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,860
by the gate

806
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,940
of the school.

807
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:47,940
That was really

808
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,580
a spectacle.

809
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,340
Awesome!

810
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,100
So,

811
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,220
are you coming?

812
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,740
- Sure.
- No.

813
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,420
- No.
- OK.

814
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,300
Come on.

815
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,740
You've known each other for years.

816
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,100
But you don't understand
each other at all.

817
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,220
Last time.

818
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,500
Are you coming?

819
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,860
(Such a party)

820
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,420
(will hurt Xu Yanshi's)

821
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,460
(self-esteem, right?)

822
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,300
- No.
- Yes.

823
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,180
I give up.

824
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:23,820
Look.

825
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,420
Yeah.

826
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,860
This makes the operation

827
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,980
much more convenient.

828
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,100
Why did you bring Xu Yanshi

829
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,260
to this party?

830
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,380
What's going on with you two?

831
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,340
You don't know

832
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,100
what I've been through
over the past few months.

833
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,300
I've experienced

834
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,660
so many things,

835
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,820
like workplace competitions,

836
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,260
getting drunk at business dinners,

837
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,220
and getting a wet look.

838
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,700
Awesome. Respect.

839
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,900
The work pays off.

840
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,580
And?

841
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,220
And you know what? I…

842
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,060
So,

843
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,260
he insisted to come.

844
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,420
I was trying

845
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,420
to turn it down

846
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,180
in case of hurting his feelings.

847
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,180
But he insisted

848
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:58,940
to come.

849
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,740
What could I do?

850
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,100
Men aren't as vulnerable

851
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,860
as you think.

852
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,220
You worry too much.

853
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,740
Not vulnerable?

854
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,140
You know back in school,

855
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,660
Xu Yanshi

856
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,900
threw them

857
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,260
into the shade.

858
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:12,860
Look at

859
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,900
those men,

860
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,660
and their golden chains, fancy watches,

861
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,420
and sport and luxury cars.

862
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,740
Don't you think Xu Yanshi

863
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,740
would feel bad?

864
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,220
Maybe he doesn't care

865
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,900
about those things.

866
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,380
By the way,

867
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,500
are you sure
you want to sit next to me?

868
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,140
How about a seat next to

869
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,220
Xu Yanshi?

870
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,220
Go.

871
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,060
If some rich girl

872
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,500
falls for him

873
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,340
and wants to marry him,

874
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,700
he'll become rich right away.

875
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,500
You're

876
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,460
the richest girl…

877
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,300
Shut up.

878
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,020
I'm not getting married.

879
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,580
Don't you know that?

880
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,740
And you're done?

881
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,940
Incredible.

882
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:52,700
You know that?

883
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,660
This client

884
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,780
has been a headache.

885
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,620
And you solved it just like that.

886
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,940
Friend me on WeChat.

887
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,220
I'll scan your QR code.

888
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,940
Xiang Yuan can send you my ID.

889
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,980
Why bother her?

890
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,900
I'm here, right?

891
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,780
You don't want to be my friend, do you?

892
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,820
That's right. I'm not a bad person,

893
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,580
OK?

894
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:11,700
Bei,

895
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,020
why don't you offer high pay

896
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,140
and hire Mr. Xu?

897
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:14,900
Then you'll never worry about

898
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,180
the technical problems anymore.

899
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,020
- My company is small.
- What can I say to him?

900
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:18,780
We can't afford to hire

901
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,700
such a top talent.

902
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,500
Stop.

903
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,300
Right.

904
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:21,900
Look at this.

905
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,140
See?

906
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,860
I'm sorry, guys.

907
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,220
The company gave me a commendation.

908
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,140
It took some time.

909
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,500
Xiang Yuan, glad that you came.

910
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,540
The beautiful Miss Zhong.

911
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,700
Come and sit down.

912
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,660
Come on, move.

913
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,540
- Sorry.
- Let's switch seats.

914
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,180
Have a seat.

915
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,340
Please sit down.

916
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,540
Thank you.

917
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,220
You must have covered

918
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,420
some big news, Miss Zhong.

919
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,420
Not really.

920
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,020
Just a breaking story

921
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,180
on the front page, and it's exclusive.

922
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,260
Exclusive news on the front page?

923
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:47,980
That's impressive.

924
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,700
Look at her.

925
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:49,900
- Zhong Ling,
- Stop.

926
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,300
I heard you got another pay rise.

927
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,100
I'm so jealous.

928
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,820
Large companies are so generous.

929
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,780
I want to work for your company, too.

930
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,700
It's easy to join our company.

931
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,460
I was unlucky when I applied.

932
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,660
I didn't do well on the written test.

933
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,220
You're too modest.

934
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,700
You got a first among all applicants.

935
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,820
Don't be modest.

936
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,260
We still depend on our parents.

937
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,140
We throw in the towel.

938
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,300
Don't.

939
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,340
Zhong Ling,

940
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,260
I heard that the other day

941
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:11,900
you interviewed

942
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,060
some esports players.

943
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:13,980
Did you get their autographs?

944
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,780
Yes, I did.

945
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,740
They were really nice.

946
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,700
They took pictures with me,

947
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,100
and added me on WeChat

948
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,260
to send me the pictures.

949
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,620
What a poser!

950
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,500
Don't take her words seriously.

951
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,380
There are 365 days in a year,

952
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,940
and she gets a commendation

953
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,210
- every day.
- I gained a lot of weight.

954
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,540
Every time she's invited to a dinner,

955
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,020
she happens to receive a commendation.

956
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,260
And she comes

957
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,420
10 minutes late.

958
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,380
Isn't she a poser?

959
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,380
By the way,

960
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,620
do you know who the esports player

961
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,420
she said is?

962
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,380
No way.

963
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,580
It's Karma.

964
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,580
What a surprise, huh?

965
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,660
Can't believe it.

966
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,140
She's marched into your circles.

967
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:48,890
I feel sorry for Karma.

968
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,180
I envy you so much.

969
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:50,780
His reputation is ruined.

970
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,960
I really have nothing for you to envy.

971
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,260
Eat it.

972
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,380
This job is pretty hard.

973
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,260
Cola, Sprite, coffee, and tea,

974
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,380
what do you like to drink?

975
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,260
You're so funny.

976
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,100
Just water. I'm on a diet.

977
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,620
It took you so long,

978
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,700
and you ordered water?

979
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,700
Water is fine.

980
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,100
OK.

981
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,420
Enough talking, enjoy the food.

982
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,260
Just a second.

983
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:11,940
We're almost done.

984
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,540
Finished?

985
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,140
Amazing!

986
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,140
Guys,

987
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,140
fill and raise your glasses

988
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,020
to a happy day

989
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,060
of reunion!

990
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,070
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

991
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,180
Nice wine.

992
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,180
Enjoy the food.

993
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,420
Oh no!

994
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,020
The lamb is in danger.

995
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,380
Can we switch seats?

996
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:44,580
Sure.

997
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,140
We all know Zhong Ling

998
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,660
had a crush on Xu Yanshi.

999
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,860
Xu Yanshi,

1000
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,540
it's been a long time.

1001
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:55,780
I didn't know you'd come

1002
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,060
to our class reunion.

1003
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,060
I came…

1004
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,500
At my invitation.

1005
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,740
Am I great?

1006
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,620
I have a lot of friends.

1007
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,380
After you transferred to another school,

1008
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,100
I called your home line.

1009
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,420
But no one answered.

1010
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,220
I also went to your house
to look for you.

1011
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,580
The old lady next door said
you had moved away.

1012
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,140
Which college did you go?

1013
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,540
He went to Wuqing University.

1014
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,420
No wonder.

1015
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,380
I thought you'd go to
Tsinghua University.

1016
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,260
I'm glad to see you

1017
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,660
here tonight.

1018
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,540
Zhong Ling can't believe

1019
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,900
that Xu Yanshi

1020
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,820
came to the reunion for her, can she?

1021
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,780
But Zhong Ling

1022
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,500
is a self-absorbed person.

1023
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,140
I think

1024
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,420
that's definitely what she thinks.

1025
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,900
Don't sit here.

1026
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,620
Go over and keep an eye on him.

1027
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,620
Or he's gonna be taken away from you.

1028
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,500
He's not

1029
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,500
that kind of person.

1030
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,500
But Zhong Ling

1031
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,180
is a sly woman.

1032
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:45,940
It's like

1033
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,420
a piece of cake for her.

1034
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,300
Hurry up!

1035
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:48,900
Come on.

1036
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,420
Eat the food.

1037
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,220
Xu Yanshi,

1038
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,780
can you open it for me?

1039
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,100
Open it for Zhong Ling.

1040
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,620
I recently hurt my hand
playing basketball.

1041
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,140
Sure thing.

1042
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,740
Here you go.

1043
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:23,820
- Mr. Xu.
- Thanks.

1044
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,020
Do you still play basketball?

1045
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,500
What position do you play?

1046
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,380
Guard.

1047
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,260
Guard.

1048
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,100
Right.

1049
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,220
I remember you were

1050
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,900
a point guard back in school.

1051
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,420
Right?

1052
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,180
Point guards

1053
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,460
often hurt their wrists.

1054
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,220
And…

1055
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,100
The joint often dislocates.

1056
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,820
Sorry,

1057
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:44,100
I didn't know your hand was injured.

1058
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,100
Hey, guys.

1059
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,180
After dinner,

1060
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,420
let's go play games.

1061
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,740
OK, let's play Crossfire.

1062
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,820
That's what I want.

1063
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,620
I remember there's a cyber bar nearby.

1064
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,860
I haven't played games in a while.
Are you itching to play?

1065
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,900
It's your home turf.

1066
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,100
I'll go then.

1067
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,340
I don't care.

1068
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,940
You must go with me later.

1069
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,260
Mr. Xu,

1070
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,540
have you played CF?

1071
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,380
A long time ago.

1072
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,020
But my account is suspended.

1073
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,340
Don't worry about that.

1074
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,580
You can use my alternate account,

1075
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,140
OK?

1076
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,020
OK.

1077
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:34,580
There's someone behind you.

1078
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,380
Don't unpack it.

1079
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,340
There is an ambush.

1080
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,380
Do you have a flash bang?
I don't have any flash bang.

1081
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,220
There's someone at Site B.

1082
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,700
Xu Yanshi,

1083
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,140
there's a kit up ahead. Shall I pick it?

1084
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,140
Zhong Ling,

1085
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,500
can you please

1086
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,580
not focus on Xu Yanshi alone?

1087
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,620
I'm behind you.

1088
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,980
Look back.

1089
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,180
Can you come and help?

1090
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,180
Go to the bathroom.

1091
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:03,740
I'll play for you.

1092
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,820
I don't want to.

1093
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,100
I'm going to the bathroom.

1094
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,100
You're in?

1095
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,900
Xiang Yuan is in.

1096
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,460
Let's bet on something then.

1097
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,780
What do you want to bet on?

1098
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:23,860
Look,

1099
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,100
Xiang Yuan,

1100
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,060
if you lose this round,

1101
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,300
go to the cinema with me

1102
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,420
when this is over, OK?

1103
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,100
Are you saying that you want to

1104
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,660
date Xiang Yuan?

1105
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,220
Are you jealous?

1106
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,940
But it's OK.

1107
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,260
I don't mind

1108
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,460
if you go with me.

1109
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,620
I'm just kidding.

1110
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,220
OK, if I lose, we'll go to the cinema.

1111
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,140
Really?

1112
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,780
Guys, did you hear that?

1113
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,260
Do your best for me.

1114
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,020
No problem.

1115
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,340
(BL GR)

1116
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:32,660
God.

1117
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,300
The resolution of Yanshi
and Xiang Yuan's screens

1118
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,340
is exactly the same.

1119
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,380
Xiang Yuan

1120
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,660
adjusted the mouse sensitivity.

1121
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,820
It's exactly

1122
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:39,860
as Yanshi's.

1123
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,100
Did you discuss it?

1124
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,700
What do you know?

1125
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,540
Stop talking.

1126
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:45,620
There's someone in the path.

1127
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,740
You take care of him.

1128
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,500
I'll go unpack the kit.

1129
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:50,620
I'm out of ammo.

1130
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,380
Take my gun.

1131
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,580
What about you?

1132
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,740
I can use the pistol.

1133
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,900
You want to kill me with a pistol?

1134
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:58,900
It's not hard, is it?

1135
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,370
Well, Yanshi does know

1136
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,060
who to trust.

1137
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,290
He gives his gun to his teammates.

1138
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,860
(Well done, you two!)

1139
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:10,500
(It's boyfriend and girlfriend.)

1140
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:19,180
(GR BL)

1141
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,340
Xu Yuan,

1142
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,660
I'm dead!

1143
