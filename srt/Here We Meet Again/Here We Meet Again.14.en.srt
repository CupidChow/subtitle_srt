29
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,590
Are you free the day after tomorrow?

30
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,120
I want to invite you guys

31
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,640
to my place for dinner.

32
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,920
I'll cook something good.

33
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,870
As an office worker,

34
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,040
I want to spend my off-duty time myself.

35
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,350
I might

36
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,480
have to play games with my girlfriend.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,950
I may also not go.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,030
I joined a yoga class,

39
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,240
and the day after tomorrow
is my first day.

40
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,870
I'm fasting because of my bad love life.

41
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,190
Well,

42
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,800
so You Zhi is the only one here

43
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,400
with a girlfriend.

44
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,240
Not exactly.

45
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,470
Chen Shu is only giving me
the silent treatment.

46
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,960
There's still a difference

47
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,520
between me and you single folks.

48
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,680
I just want to invite you guys

49
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,800
for dinner.

50
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,190
Why is it hard?

51
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,520
Accept or not?

52
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,960
I'm busy the day after tomorrow.

53
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,400
You are also not available?

54
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,360
Yes.

55
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,400
I made plans with Qing.

56
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,630
What about tomorrow?

57
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,360
Why do I get the feeling

58
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,710
that Miss Xiang only cares about

59
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,280
if Boss is free tomorrow night?

60
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,560
I'm fasting, thank you.

61
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,910
Maybe I should join a Muay Thai class,

62
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,630
to improve my "fighting" skills.

63
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,190
Well,

64
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,080
I can't really go.

65
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,960
Are you guys coming or not?

66
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,800
Tomorrow is a great day.

67
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,910
I can

68
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,280
spend the weekend with my girlfriend.

69
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,120
Tomorrow is fine.

70
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,030
I'll go there tomorrow too.

71
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,710
A real man should be flexible.

72
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,280
I'll fast after this meal.

73
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,240
Well said.

74
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,680
As men,

75
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,910
we should be decisive

76
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,910
and bold.

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,560
Bro,

78
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,000
what's the point of talking so much?

79
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,910
Forget about playing games

80
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,710
with your girlfriend.

81
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,030
Forget about fighting with your girlfriend

82
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,800
and being given the silent treatment.

83
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,000
In my opinion,

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,960
they are all excuses.

85
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,400
When it comes to me,
I'll only say two words.

86
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,800
I'll go.

87
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,710
I'll go.

88
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,680
Me too.

89
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,190
That's happily decided.

90
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,150
(Perfect.)

91
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,310
(I'll treat Xu Yanshi to a nice dinner,)

92
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,430
(and I'll be even with him)

93
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,630
(after taking the post
that was supposed to be his.)

94
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,400
I'm down.

95
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,470
You Zhi, help me!

96
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:10,560
I'm sorry.

97
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,240
Don't help Lin Qingqing.

98
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,400
Sorry, I'm mistaken.

99
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,030
Hurry.

100
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,870
There's no one at Point A.

101
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,070
Plant a bomb now.

102
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,160
Coming.

103
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,680
Okay.

104
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,160
You go first.

105
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,950
I'm saving you. Why are you shooting me?

106
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,800
I've got eyes on the side path.

107
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,680
I've also got eyes on Path A.

108
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,160
Where are the people?

109
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,720
Someone attacked me.

110
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,000
Forget it. I quit.

111
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,360
Perfect.

112
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,000
You Zhi, I'm down again, hurry up!

113
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,360
Pull me up!

114
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,380
(Recipe)

115
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,560
Have you never cooked before?

116
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,950
Yes.

117
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,360
I'm leaving.

118
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,360
Okay.

119
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,720
Cut upright, porker.

120
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,040
You're the porker.

121
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,510
I mean the pork
should be cut vertically,

122
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,270
while the beef
should be cut horizontally.

123
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,720
Humph.

124
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,720
(Turn on the lights.)

125
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,430
Long beans should be cooked thoroughly.

126
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,870
If you take them out like that,

127
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,680
we'll all end up

128
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,870
in the hospital later.

129
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,680
Take out the spatula.

130

You...

131
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,240
It's mushy.

132
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,430

00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,120
♪Whatever I did is useless♪

193
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,320
♪I loved the wrong person

194
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,200
Why don't we play a game?

195
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,270
If you keep singing like this,

196
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,440
I'm afraid I won't
make it through tonight.

197
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,000
Don't the heartbroken

198
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,390
have the right to be sad for a while?

199
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,480
But it doesn't mean

200
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,440
you have to drag everyone down with you.

201
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,870
Is my singing that bad?

202
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,600
Well,

203
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,510
let's play a game then.

204
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,510
Truth or Dare.

205
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,510
Truth or Dare again?

206
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,120
Do you have a better suggestion?

207
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,080
Well,

208
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,120
let's spin the bottle.

209
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,550
Whoever the cap points to

210
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,320
will be punished, okay?

211
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,320
Okay, let's do it.

212
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,480
It's you.

213
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,600
I choose Dare.

214
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,390
Okay.

215
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,600
Call the first person

216
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,750
in your contact

217
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,440
and scold him,

218
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,440
curse at him

219
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,080
until he cries.

220
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,550
A piece of cake.

221
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,120
You...

222
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,140
(A Chen Shu)

223
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,270
Who is it?

224
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,840
Chen Shu.

225
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,670
I...

226
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,750
I accept the punishment.

227
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,360
You're such a coward, Gao Leng.

228
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,510
All right, he is still young.

229
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,600
Again.

230
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,440
Boss.

231
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,120
Truth

232
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,440
or Dare?

233
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,670
He will definitely choose Truth.

234
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,870
He knew we'd mess with him.

235
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:00,390
He has never

236
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,630
chosen Dare before.

237
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,480
Yeah, it's no fun.

238
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,030
I choose Dare.

239
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,000
Oh, my!

240
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,390
Are you serious?

241
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,360
These people can be inhumane

242
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,200
when they are playing a game.

243
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,550
The choice has been made.

244
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,720
The choice has been made.

245
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,910
- Call the first girl
- Do 60

246
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,600
- in your contacts
- push-ups

247
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,550
- and ask her to be your girlfriend.
- in one minute.

248
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,550
You Zhi, what kind of stupid thing

249
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,480
did you just say?

250
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,030
You're so naive!

251
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,150
It's such a sacred moment.

252
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,840
How could you say

253
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,840
such a thing?

254
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,240
He said

255
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,670
he can do 60 push-ups in a minute.

256
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,200
I just

257
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,840
wanted to test him.

258
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,510
Why did you come up with

259
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,720
such a silly request?

260
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,270
If you say it like that,

261
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:42,870
he will definitely

262
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,630
choose push-ups.

263
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,240
My hand was injured
from playing ball the other day.

264
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,630
I can't do push-ups.

265
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,840
Who's he calling?

266
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,230

What's going on now?

273
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,320
It should be

274
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,720
that Mr. Xu is going to ask Miss Xiang

275
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,870
to be his girlfriend.

276
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,540
(Leader of the Other Group)

277
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,960
What kind of game is this?

278
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,240
Why are you drinking it?

279
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,390
I'm not the one who lost.

280
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,320
Why should I be involved?

281
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,120
Miss Xiang, you're a coward.

282
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,270
You should drink it

283
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,000
if you're not a coward.

284
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,630
I'll go to the toilet.

285
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,630
Is Miss Xiang feeling shy?

286
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,390
Boss.

287
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,550
Why did you tease Miss Xiang?

288
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,080
It's none of your business.

289
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,910
Let's drink.

290
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,550
Boss.

291
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,840
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

292
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:25,750
Dude.

293
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,870
Don't be a third wheel.

294
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,270
But...

295
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:27,910
Boss, bye-bye.

296
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,320
Hurry up.

297
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:28,750
Bye-bye.

298
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,000
Let's go.

299
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,720
Go, go, go.

300
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,550
Come on. Let's go.

301
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,080
Xiang Yuan.

302
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,080
Come here.

303
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,360
Are you still angry
because of what happened

304
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,120
in the kitchen earlier?

305
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,390
No.

306
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,550
It doesn't matter

307
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,480
what others think of me,

308
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,550
but it does matter what you think.

309
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,150
How do you

310
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,080
want me to think of you?

311
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,870
You rejected me,

312
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,750
and then you got off his car.

313
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,270
Tell me,

314
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,870
who are you giving a chance to?

315
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,080
Are you talking about yesterday morning?

316
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,600
Do you want me to repeat it again?

317
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,360
You seem pleased with yourself.

318
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,320
So you've been angry all day

319
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,550
because of what happened yesterday,

320
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,600
not because of something else?

321
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,200
What else?

322
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,960
Mr. Yang left and I got promoted.

323
00:15:59,030 --> 00:15:59,720
No.

324
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:03,790
Yes.

325
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,960
You got promoted to the director

326
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,440
and transferred Li Chi away.

327
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,870
You acted too unadvisedly

328
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
and didn't think about the consequences.

329
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,000
I thought about it.

330
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,390
I even thought about

331
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,750
how to deal with it

332
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,960
if Li Qin takes advantage
of the situation.

333
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,630
Are you asking for praise?

334
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,320
So you're not angry.

335
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,480
I was afraid

336
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,750
you'd be upset about it.

337
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,150
Frankly speaking,

338
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,910
I'm also someone with connections.

339
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,390
But my connections

340
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,510
are a bit more complicated.

341
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,550
There is nothing I can do.

342
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,120
I know.

343
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,200
It's not because of this.

344
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,150
So, that's what you wanted to

345
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,360
talk about yesterday?

346
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,500
Yeah.

347
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,670
What else could it be?

348
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,840
Yesterday,

349
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,270
I happened to meet Mr. Lu

350
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,240
in the elevator.

351
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,870
He offered to give me a ride

352
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,150
because I was about to be late.

353
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,900
Oh.

354
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,440
No need to explain.

355
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,790
So, I don't have to

356
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,400
take out the trash tomorrow, right?

357
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,030
Don't take his car

358
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,440
even if you're late next time.

359
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:15,940
Oh.

360
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,070
I'm leaving.

361
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,350
By the way,

362
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,200
we're meeting with Qing

363
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,030
tomorrow.

364
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,270
Ah?

365
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,310
We've passed the preliminary round.

366
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,720
It's time to prepare for the finals.

367
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,440
So you're meeting him

368
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,750
for that.

369
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,480
You participated in the competition.

370
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,640
At least remember the time.

371
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,070
(Yuan.)

372
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,350
(I think Boss)

373
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,680
(does like you.)

374
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,400
(We played Truth or Dare a lot of times)

375
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,640
(over these years.)

376
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,750
(He knows that we would)

377
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,440
(take every opportunity to screw him,)

378
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,920
(so he never chooses Dare)

379
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,030
(in case we get a chance.)

380
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:17,920
(Besides,)

381
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,960
(with his workload,)

382
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,590
(how would he have time to play ball?)

383
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,720
(I think)

384
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,400
(he wants to confess his love today.)

385
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,070
(Don't listen to the people
in the company.)

386
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,270
(Boss)

387
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,640
(has been single these years.)

388
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,310
(I remember he told me)

389
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,880
(that his father owed money in business)

390
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,110
(and had been hiding for several years.)

391
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,030
(To avoid the debt collectors,)

392
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,070
(he couldn't stay in one place
for more than half a year.)

393
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,070
(Now he's finally moved on.)

394
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,830
(Don't break his heart.)

395
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,110
(That's the reason)

396
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,750
(why he left without telling me.)

397
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,240
Xu Yanshi!

398
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,590
What's wrong?

399
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,110
Can't bear to part with me?

400
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,960
What's wrong?

401
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,440
We've known each other for so many years.

402
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,160
We can't be anything else,

403
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,440
so let's be brothers.

404
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,510
I'll take care of you from now on.

405
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,070
(I don't want to be your brother.)

406
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,070
(At 2:07 AM today,)

407
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,200
(News: The 18th and 19th BDS-3 Launched)
(China successfully launched)

408
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,310
(the 18th and 19th satellites)

409
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,160
(of the BDS-3 system)

410
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,160
(at the Xichang Satellite Launch Center)

411
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,440
(using the Long March 3B carrier rocket)

412
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:16,000
(and the Yuanzheng-1
upper stage in a dual-satellite launch.)

413
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,440
(The basic constellation deployment)

414
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,920
(of China's BDS-3 system...)

415
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,110
Finally, we have

416
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,680
our own navigation system.

417
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,750
Since Beidou is so powerful,

418
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,880
why are we still using

419
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,790
GPS?

420
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,240
GPS started early

421
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,240
and is well-established.

422
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,880
It's also free to use,

423
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,310
so it occupied the market early,

424
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,750
and users have become

425
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,960
accustomed to it.

426
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,480
Our Beidou system started late

427
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,550
and has only begun

428
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,920
global system construction
in recent years.

429
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,880
Therefore, user confidence

430
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,030
hasn't been established yet.

431
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,030
(...to the Belt and Road
countries and regions...)

432
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,400
Well, since everyone is used to

433
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:47,880
GPS,

434
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,640
why do we have to develop Beidou?

435
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,200
Beidou provides

436
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,790
positioning, navigation,

437
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,920
and time service.

438
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,960
If we don't have our own time service,

439
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,000
it would be unsafe.

440
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,240
(...said in an interview...)

441
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,160
China's time and space reference

442
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,720
should be controlled by ourselves.

443
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,310
Before the year 2000,

444
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,240
the GPS

445
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,270
provided time service for us.

446
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,400
In wartime,

447
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:07,920
if the GPS

448
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,240
shuts down its services,

449
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,750
we would be like headless flies.

450
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,030
So we must establish

451
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,200
our own reference.

452
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,640
(BDS-3...)

453
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,510
With the completion of the global system,

454
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,720
more and more people will use Beidou

455
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,830
and have

456
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,070
more confidence.

457
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,920
It's our own

458
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,270
navigation system.

459
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,070
(China will build)

460
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,200
(a global
Beidou navigation satellite system)

461
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,750
(with the capability
to provide services worldwide.)

462
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,510
(By the year 2035,)

463
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,200
(it will also construct
a more ubiquitous,)

464
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,480
(integrated, and intelligent)

465
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,920
(comprehensive spatiotemporal system.)

466
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,790
(China's Beidou...)

467
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,240
You only need to

468
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,960
learn the basic framework.

469
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,640
Yang Weiping doesn't even understand

470
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,640
what code is,

471
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,070
but he still worked as
the director for years.

472
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,350
I'm not like him.

473
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:54,160
(The global system was implemented
in three steps.)

474
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,270
(Yang Changfeng, the chief designer)

475
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,830
(of the Chinese Beidou
satellite navigation system,)

476
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,720
(stated that)

477
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,750
(News: The 18th and 19th BDS-3 Launched)
(the BDS-3 basic system)

478
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,640
(will officially commence operations
by the end of this year.)

479
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,880
(It will provide
essential navigation services)

480
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,720
(to countries and regions
along the Belt and Road Initiative,)

481
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,310
(marking a crucial step towards
transitioning from a regional system)

482
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,240
(to a global one.)

483
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,070
If it

484
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,480
hadn't happened back then,

485
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,960
you would probably...

486
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,510
You should spend time on

487
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,030
thinking about the future,
instead of the past.

488
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,400
I'll tell you next time.

489
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:50,000
(I know it's about Chen Shan.)

490
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,720
(I'm not interested.)

491
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,400
Who cares?

492
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,070
Come in.

493
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,960
We have submitted our discourse.

494
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,440
Should we be waiting for the results now?

495
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,200
Yes.

496
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,160
The final competition

497
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,070
is consisted of two stages:

498
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,920
discourse and practical operation.

499
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,920
As long as our discourse passes,

500
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,110
all we need to do

501
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,000
is to wait for their notification

502
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,350
regarding the time and location
of the practical operation.

503
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
I've finished this week's report

504
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,240
and next week's plans.

505
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,350
You'll leave for Shanghai tonight.

506
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,510
For my friend's wedding.

507
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,030
Okay.

508
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:50,680
Is it okay?

509
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,960
Yi Shi.

510
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,200
Come here.

511
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,510
Hello.

512
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,880
I'm Yi Shi's good friend.

513
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,720
Hi.

514
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,200
What a coincidence.

515
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,070
Have a seat.

516
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:10,310
You're Yi Shi's wife.

517
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:11,750
That's me.

518
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,200
Look at her.

519
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,830
So, you two teamed up

520
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,160
to tease me, didn't you?

521
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:17,830
Yes.

522
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,200
That's why you told me in Xi'an

523
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,960
that you were getting married

524
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,000
but didn't mention the date.

525
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,240
You did it on purpose.

526
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:23,750
No.

527
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,240
I only found out
that you two were childhood friends

528
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,640
when I was planning the wedding.

529
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,510
Who could have imagined
such a coincidence?

530
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:28,880
Right?

531
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,510
Yeah.

532
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,830
I wanted to give you a surprise.

533
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,880
Fine.

534
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,270
Since one of you is my childhood friend,

535
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,110
and the other is my best girlfriend,

536
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,070
I'm gonna

537
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,920
eat something good today.

538
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,070
Today is my boss's treat.

539
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,070
Just order whatever you want.

540
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,400
Still calling him boss?

541
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,030
Shouldn't you call him

542
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,070
a word starts with "h"...

543
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:46,790
You're teasing me.

544
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,240
Don't tease me.

545
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:49,920
Here's something

546
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,000
you need to know first.

547
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,400
When Mr. Yi

548
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,110
encountered obstacles in his business,

549
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,510
I provided the funding,

550
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,310
which means

551
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,000
a portion of

552
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,960
your family's assets

553
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:58,680
is owned by me.

554
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:00,070
Oh.

555
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:00,720
I know.

556
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,110
Yi Shi told me about it.

557
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,480
Hello?

558
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,440
Bro.

559
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,880
How much do we have left in our account?

560
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,480
I don't think we can
hold on much longer.

561
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,880
I'll figure it out.

562
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,270
Okay.

563
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,880
(Xiang Yuan)
(I heard)

564
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,240
(you've been having financing problems.)

565
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,350
(Take the money for emergencies.)

566
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,030
(You can pay me back later.)

567
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,350
(Good luck.)

568
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,640
(Consider it a loan from me.)

569
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,740
(Account Overview)

570
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,960
Hello.

571
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,830
We might be able to survive.

572
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,720
I'll hang up.

573
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,720
Sorry, I have to take this.

574
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:38,920
You two keep talking.

575
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,720
When you told me
about your flash marriage,

576
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,510
I thought you met a scammer.

577
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,070
I scammed him.

578
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,110
Can you call him a scammer?

579
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,400
I'm glad you know yourself.

580
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,200
I don't know about others,

581
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,440
but he is not that kind of person

582
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,030
who would

583
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,070
hack people's QQ accounts

584
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,160
for membership

585
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,680
renewal fees.

586
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,110
That happened ages ago.

587
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,510
How dare you mention it?

588
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,510
You're so bad.

589
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,070
To celebrate my last night

590
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:09,550
as a single person.

591
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,510
Cheers.

592
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,350
You're not single anymore.

593
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,550
You've got your marriage certificate.

594
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,640
You're no fun.

595
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,920
Have you really decided

596
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,960
to get married in such a short time?

597
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,040
Yeah.

598
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,720
Sometimes

599
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,830
when you meet someone,

600
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,440
you just have this feeling

601
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,720
that it's him.

602
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,400
I had that feeling

603
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,310
when I first met Yi Shi.

604
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,550
But it happened too fast.

605
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,110
Do you know him well?

606
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,680
Quite well.

607
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,400
I also know

608
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,310
that he had

609
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,480
two exes.

610
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,640
And?

611
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,590
It's not important.

612
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,270
What I like

613
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,790
is the person

614
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,720
who is with me right now,

615
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,480
not his past.

616
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:52,240
Just like the cocktail.

617
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,440
As long as it tastes good,
that's all that matters.

618
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,680
Would you wonder

619
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,240
what's in it

620
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,550
and in what order it was mixed?

621
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,720
When you

622
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,400
truly care about someone,

623
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,070
all you can think about is

624
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,240
your future with him,

625
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,160
not what he did in the past.

626
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,400
(The past.)

627
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,680
(What if Chen Shan)

628
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,720
(is just Xu Yanshi's past?)

629
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,400
Look at you.

630
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,240
Are you thinking of someone?

631
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,000
Just keep drinking.

632
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:33,960
Do you need me

633
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,920
to do something tomorrow?

634
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,920
My wedding is quite simple.

635
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,030
I didn't even invite
bridesmaids or groomsmen,

636
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,030
just a marriage witness

637
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,440
who is Yi Shi's senior in college.

638
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,550
Yi Shi told me

639
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,680
that when he was at

640
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,270
the lowest point in his life,

641
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,680
he would send a WeChat message

642
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,400
to his senior,

643
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,640
asking how he was doing

644
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,350
and if he got a raise.

645
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,240
The senior said he didn't,

646
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,790
and that filled Yi Shi with strength.

647
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:57,510
See,

648
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,310
there are people worse off than him.

649
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,590
So, that senior's like a negative example.

650
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,260
Yeah.

651
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,820
(Welcome to the wedding of
Yi Shi and Xu Yuan)

652
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,480
Turns out you're the negative example

653
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,440
they were talking about.

654
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,160
You already knew.

655
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,510
I saw the invitation

656
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,240
and knew who the bride and groom were

657
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,000
before I came.

658
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,030
I knew that the three of you

659
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,110
are on the same side.

660
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:33,830
Hello?

661
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:34,920
Xu.

662
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,310
The time of the finals is set.

663
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,510
When is it?

664
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:38,830
Is it Qing?

665
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,640
Is the final time set?

666
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,270
Tomorrow, in Shanghai.

667
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,160
My bad.

668
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,510
(Joyous Computer Repair)
I've been too busy these days

669
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,790
to check my e-mail.

670
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,160
Can we still make it to Shanghai now?

671
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,480
I'm with Xiang Yuan.

672
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,590
We are in Shanghai now.

673
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,920
In Shanghai?

674
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,480
Are you in Shanghai?

675
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,200
That's great.

676
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,000
I'll pack up

677
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,070
and get ready to go.

678
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,720
Okay, see you tomorrow.

679
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:01,920
When is it?

680
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,590
Tomorrow.

681
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,270
In Shanghai.

682
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,720
(If Grandpa finds out)

683
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,030
(that I entered the Xingheng competition
without telling him,)

684
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:13,070
(he'll probably strangle me on the spot.)

685
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,270
(No, I can't go home.)

686
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,340
(Hotel)

687
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,440
No place to go?

688
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:28,720
Who said that?

689
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,880
I have plenty of places to go.

690
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,750
I'll book a hotel.

691
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,260
(Payment failed,
insufficient balance in the bank account)

692
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,640
(No wonder all workers)

693
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,510
(are looking forward to)

694
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,830
(payday.)

695
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,480
Let's go to my place.

696
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,000
It's a bit small,

697
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,790
but at least there are two bedrooms.

698
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,070
I can also

699
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,960
teach you programming.

700
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,030
With your bad memory,

701
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,270
if you don't review for a few days,

702
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,510
you'll probably forget everything.

703
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:02,200
I didn't say I'm going.

704
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,400
Do you have somewhere else to go?

705
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,310
I...

706
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,640
Let's go.

707
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,720
Aren't we brothers?

708
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,480
What?

709
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,790
Will I bother you?

710
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,720
Actually, I can go home.

711
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,590
I saw the way you hesitated.

712
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,750
It didn't look like you can go home.

713
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,960
Don't worry.

714
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,270
The things you're worried about
won't happen.

715
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,400
I... I'm not worried.

716
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,790
Yanshi.

717
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,590
Your younger brother is at home.

718
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,070
Yeah.

719
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,310
I'll be here in the next few days,

720
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,440
so I brought him home.

721
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,880
Yanshi.

722
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:10,270
Why is this gossipy sister

723
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,640
also here?

724
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,400
She's my brother.

725
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,880
Isn't your brother me?

726
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,790
I'll take care of you today

727
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:24,270
and play with you.

728
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,680
Okay?

729
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Xu Chengli.

730
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,190
Can I finish this episode?

731
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:25,960
No.

732
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,800
Go do your homework now.

733
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,230
All right.

734
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,590
He's a better kid than I thought.

735
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,000
You, too.

736
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,510
What's wrong with me?

737
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,840
It's time to learn programming.

738
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,280
There is a computer in Xu Chengli's room.

739
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,920
I'll teach you later.

740
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:01,030
I haven't finished this level yet.

741
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,030
Give me some more time.

742
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,320
Look at this level.

743
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,150
There's a heart below

744
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,400
and "520" on top.
[*520 means I love you.]

745
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:07,880
What a thoughtful design.

746
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,110
Let me finish this round.

747
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,440
That's it.

748
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,630
Did you forget

749
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,960
what you promised?

750
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,880
Fine, I'll learn it.

751
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:51,510
I won't give up halfway.

752
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,230
Besides, I haven't fully understood it.

753
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,510
It's wrong.

754
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,400
Pay attention to this.

755
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,230
Go on.

756
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:51,030
What are you looking at?
Do your homework.

757
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,800
What are you doing?

758
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,400
To wake you up.

759
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,880
I wasn't sleeping.

760
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,190
If you weren't sleeping,

761
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:40,760
how could I possibly

762
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,190
pull your hair?

763
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,630
You're drooling.

764
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,590
I'm not.

765
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,960
Don't bother.

766
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,070
My brother doesn't like

767
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,510
girls like you.

768
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,550
What kind of girl am I?

769
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,070
You like snacks

770
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,280
and games.

771
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,510
You're lazy and unambitious.

772
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,400
And you like good-looking things.

773
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,000
Did your brother

774
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,150
like other girls before?

775
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,920
Of course.

776
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,710
What kind of girls?

777
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:17,320
Smart, hardworking,

778
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,800
and every optimistic.

779
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,550
They were good to my brother,

780
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,030
and they were not as gossipy

781
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,400
as you.

782
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,030
How am I gossipy?

783
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:29,320
You gossiped a lot

784
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,920
at the airport.

785
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,840
I still remember it.

786
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,480
Isn't that person from our class?

787
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,880
No wonder they're all talking about it
in the group chat.

788
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:39,920
Really?

789
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,030
Send me the video later.

790
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,960
I want to see it.

791
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,110
Okay.

792
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,630
I'll come to you later.

793
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,710
I remember now.

794
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,670
But you weren't a cute kid either

795
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,670
on that day.

796
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,110
You know what,

797
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,710
my brother

798
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,440
wouldn't be interested in

799
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,000
a girl like you.

800
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,510
Just give up.

801
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,800
What if

802
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,280
your brother asks someone like me

803
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,030
to be his girlfriend?

804
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:03,800
What would you do?

805
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,360
No way.

806
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,360
If he asks someone like you

807
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,550
to be his girlfriend,

808
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,230
I'll run away from home.

809
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,510
You two are too noisy.

810
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,800
Yanshi, she...!

811
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
We were talking about math problems,

812
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,000
right?

813
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:19,800
Nod your head.

814
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,840
Yes.

815
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:26,670
Go on.

816
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,800
Good boy.

817
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,800
Coming.

818
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,920
The dessert has arrived.

819
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,630
Thank you.

820
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,920
Have some fruit.

821
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,150
Xu Chengli.

822
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,960
Come out and have some fruit.

823
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:53,670
Okay.

824
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,030
There is a lot of fruit.

825
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,150
Yanshi, I want to eat tangerines.

826
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,360
Bro.

827
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,150
Eat this. It's good for your brain.

828
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,320
Are you sure?

829
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,840
It can provide some benefits.

830
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,070
You should eat it.

831
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,190
It's good for your brain.

832
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:31,760
Here.

833
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,110
Eat more.

834
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,110
Are you cold?

835
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,000
A little.

836
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,230
Thank you.

837
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,880
He peed on this blanket.

838
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,360
I'll go get you a jacket.

839
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,590
All right, I'm going to the toilet.

840
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,400
You mustn't go there.

841
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:33,800
It's a scary place.

842
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,230
I suggest you hold it.

843
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:36,630
There are ghosts.

844
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,840
Just hold it.

845
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:39,670
I'll go with you.

846
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,440
Are you kidding?

847
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,360
I'm an adult.

848
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,360
I don't need you to go with me.

849
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,670
Just tell me

850
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:45,150
where it is.

851
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,590
She's right.

852
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,550
Okay, turn left when you go out,

853
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,630
and it's in the next alley.

854
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,630
Okay.

855
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,670
It's really scary.

856
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:57,880
There are vampires

857
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,550
and cannibals.

858
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,780
(Public Toilet)

859
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,360
Should I turn left

860
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,550
or right?

861
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:10,320
That's...

862
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:39,230
Crazy woman.

863
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,480
That's not right.

864
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,710
What kind of place is this?

865
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:02,360
Well...

866
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:04,800
Is someone here?

867
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:09,630
It's me.

868
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,590
Why are you here?

869
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:15,760
I heard

870
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:17,710
a scream.

871
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:40,150
It took you so long to go to the toilet.

872
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:41,920
I was afraid you were kidnapped.

873
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,000
Do I have to run away from home?

874
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:08,360
All you do is buy stuff!

875
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,360
We can't go on like this!

876
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,030
I want a divorce!

877
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:11,630
Why are you making such a fuss?

878
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:12,760
Do you have to make

879
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,510
the whole neighborhood hear you?

880
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:14,840
Yes, we all hear you!

881
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,670
Why are you yelling at me?

882
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,760
How am I gonna sleep?

883
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:39,190
What are you doing?

884
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,320
Here.

885
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,710
Take cold medicine.

886
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:14,480
You sleep
in the living room tonight.

887
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,110
It's quieter here.

888
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,800
I've prepared the quilt for you.

889
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,440
What are you going to
cover yourself with?

890
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,440
It's okay, I'm not cold.

891
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:22,710
Go to sleep.

892
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,400
We still have a competition tomorrow.

893
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:25,510
Good night.

894
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:44,550
(Number 13!)

895
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:45,760
(Watch out for the defense!)

896
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,760
(Number 15 gets the ball!)

897
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,480
(Number 15 dribbles past)

898
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,840
(the opposing defender!)

899
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:53,480
(Son.)

900
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:55,550
(You must think it through.)

901
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:57,960
(If you marry a woman like this,)

902
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,190
(what about me and your father?)

903
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:01,190
(Right?)

904
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,230
(You can tell)

905
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:03,150
(she's spoiled.)

906
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:23,280
My mother set me up with someone again.

907
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,150
She asked me to meet him this week.

908
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:25,630
It's so annoying.

909
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:27,670
Drink it.

910
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,110
Why is it milk again?

911
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:33,510
It's milk every day.

912
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:35,070
Do we never run out of milk?

913
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,030
Yanshi.

914
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:37,510
Do you have a dairy cow

915
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:39,400
at home?

916
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:41,030
Just drink it.

917
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:42,480
I'll send you to school
after you finish it.

918
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:43,440
I won't drink.

919
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,920
I'm running away from home.

920
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:46,840
Run away from home?

921
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:49,110
You don't have to do it.

922
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,000
When you go to school,

923
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,320
I can move out.

924
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:05,670
I guess you like this.

925
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:07,440
That's more like it.

926
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:26,880
It's almost time to go.

927
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:28,230
In another five minutes,

928
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:29,440
your teacher, Ms. Liu,

929
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,280
will call me again.

930
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,480
Ms. Liu

931
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,590
wants me to be late every day

932
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,030
so that she can call you every day.

933
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,000
(Ms. Liu.)

934
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,030
(There are many women
who like him indeed.)

935
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:45,360
Drink it.

936
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,070
Impressive.

937
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:50,150
You finished it in one gulp.

938
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:50,630
Come on.

939
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,110
Let me give you a kiss.

940
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,630
Well,

941
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,710
you have never drunk this before?
