Don't worry about me.

195
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,000
Let's go. It's no big deal.

196
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,080
Thank you.

197
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,320
Are you all right?

198
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,670
I'm fine.

199
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,320
Are you okay?

200
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,240
I'm totally fine.

201
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,480
You can drink a lot.

202
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,150
By the way,

203
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,360
is there a tall guy

204
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,630
from the technical department

205
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,550
of your company,

206
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,480
the one we met last time

207
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,550
at the theater?

208
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,870
You mean Xu Yanshi?

209
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,600
Is his name Xu Yanshi?

210
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,320
Yeah.

211
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,870
Throw up in this.

212
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:55,960
Use it.

213
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,320
You just asked about Xu Yanshi.

214
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:02,840
What's wrong?

215
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,200
Nothing.

216
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,120
I just wonder

217
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,870
why he didn't come today.

218
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,120
He resigned

219
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,510
and now works in Shanghai.

220
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,790
Sir.

221
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,200
Please pull over.

222
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,670
Drop the act.

223
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,790
Why did you get off the car?

224
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,870
Let me take you home.

225
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,080
No need.

226
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,870
I'll take a taxi myself.

227
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,840
Okay.

228
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,200
Chen Shu!

229
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,480
Are we gonna get back together?

231
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,960
Grow up, will you?

232
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,480
I have a passion for cleanliness.

233
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,510
My spoon is clean.

234
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,320
You suddenly started eating
edible bird's nest,

235
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,390
and your dressing style has changed.

236
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,030
Miss Xiang,

237
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,320
are you secretly in love?

238
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,630
Do you have

239
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,150
nothing else to do?

240
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,960
You are pretty free today

241
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,080
huh?

242
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,120
And even have time
to gossip with me here.

243
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,670
I'm right about it.

244
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,870
I'm going to tell Boss

245
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,320
that you're not focused on work

246
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,240
but thinking about your boyfriend
all the time.

247
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,390
You must be Xu Yanshi's

248
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,840
long-lost son, huh?

249
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,080
You tell him everything.

250
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,440

about the conversion of the employees.

264

on the C-to-B quota?

276

and report to me.

00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,840
(Lu Dong; Xiang Yuan: Wow,
it's the play I really want to see.)

383
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,820
(Which lovely angle sent me the ticket?)

384
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,820
(Send to Wang Yifei)

385
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,480
(Wang Yifei)
Do whatever you can

386
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,310
to get me a ticket

387
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,640
for the seat next to hers.

388
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,860
(Lu Dong)

389
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,480
Lately,

390
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,110
things have been so unlucky.

391
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,110
We have not signed any

392
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,510
contract successfully recently.

393
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,960
Therefore, everyone,

394
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,590
we must make it work

395
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,270
with Mr. Duan today.

396
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,590
Treat him well,

397
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,790
otherwise

398
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,880
we'll have nothing

399
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,750
for the second half of the year.

400
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,830
Sorry.

401
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,070
Well,

402
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,270
is Mr. Duan not coming?

403
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,920
He is busy tonight.

404
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,070
He asked me to meet you on his behalf

405
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,720
and discuss the contract with you.

406
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,510
May I ask for your name?

407
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,550
You can call me Mr. Lu.

408
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,960
Mr. Lu.

409
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,960
It's a pleasure to meet you.

410
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,110
Have a seat.

411
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,030
Well, Yuntao,

412
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:25,920
pour a drink for Mr. Lu.

413
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,480
- Have a seat.
- Have a seat, Mr. Lu.

414
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,590
Mr. Lu, have a seat.

415
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,070
Since you're here,

416
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,110
we won't hold back.

417
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,110
Well...

418
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,680
Let's enjoy the meal,

419
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,070
just a way to relax.

420
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,200
You probably don't know

421
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,110
that we've put

422
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,750
a lot of effort into

423
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,350
improving the precision

424
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,480
of drones.

425
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,920
Miss.

426
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,880
Miss, pour a drink for me.

427
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,720
Come on.

428
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,830
But there is a problem.

429
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,240
The price is too high.

430
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,240
Don't worry.

431
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,000
We will

432
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,750
handle it.

433
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,350
I'll introduce you

434
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,200
to the system later.

435
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,350
Let's have a drink first.

436
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,960
Come on, cheers.

437
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,510
Come on, let's eat.

438
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,070
Mr. Lu, try this.

439
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,510
Thank you.

440
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,030
Mr. Lu.

441
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:09,590
It's a pleasure

442
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,350
to meet you.

443
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,960
I hope we can work together.

444
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,270
Yuntao.

445
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,030
Make a toast.

446
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,510
Mr. Lu, cheers.

447
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,110
Yuntao, drink it up.

448
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,440
Mr. Lu, do as you please.

449
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,550
Mr. Lu, have more.

450
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,880
Eat more.

451
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,400
Since Mr. Duan is not coming,

452
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,830
we definitely need to

453
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,240
give you a good introduction.

454
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,400
Cheers. Hope we can
work together successfully.

455
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,070
Yeah.

456
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,750
Cheers, Mr. Lu.

457
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:36,790
Pour the wine.

458
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,400
Mr. Lu.

459
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,070
I have to

460
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,160
take this call.

461
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,350
Excuse me for a moment.

462
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,270
Ms. Ye

463
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,270
and Yuntao

464
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,240
will take care of you.

465
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,110
By the way,

466
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,830
Mr. Xu

467
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:54,880
will also introduce to you

468
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,750
the main details

469
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,640
about our system upgrade.

470
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,240
All right?

471
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,790
Excuse me for a moment.

472
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,270
Take care of him for me.

473
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,110
Take good care of him.

474
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,960
I have to take this call.

475
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,920
Mr. Lu, enjoy yourself.

476
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,240
I'll give you a toast.

477
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,070
Xu Yanshi.

478
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,030
Long time no see.

479
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,830
We just met

480
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,070
during the Beidou+ Competition

481
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,680
not long ago, didn't we?

482
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,110
Do you two know each other?

483
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,070
I thought you were still playing it safe

484
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,030
at Velin.

485
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,880
I didn't expect Mr. Lin

486
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,830
to be so bold

487
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:38,270
about hiring someone like you

488
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,920
who behaves badly.

489
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,590
Well, Mr. Lu...

490
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,510
Mr. Lu.

491
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,880
Is there any misunderstanding?

492
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,880
Ms. Ye.

493
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,400
The improvement

494
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,310
in the navigation accuracy

495
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,960
of the system

496
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,510
must have required a lot of effort.

497
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,030
You've indeed worked hard.

498
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,550
However, we still have concerns

499
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,790
about your support
and development capabilities

500
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,510
in the later stages.

501
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,720
Here's the thing,

502
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,200
besides

503
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,510
what you have seen,

504
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,510
we also have

505
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,550
continuously upgraded

506
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:02,920
and improved the system.

507
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,240
I know.

508
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,590
Ms. Ye, I just want to remind you

509
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,680
out of goodwill,

510
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,880
considering Mr. Xu is my old schoolmate.

511
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:13,590
Sorry.

512
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,510
I had to take the call.

513
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,440
Sorry about it.

514
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,440
I just heard

515
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,720
that you and Mr. Xu

516
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,200
were schoolmates.

517
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,200
That's great.

518
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,440
That gives you another reason

519
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,160
to look out for Kaisheng.

520
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,920
I'll drink a toast to you.

521
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,110
Mr. Lin, you're mistaken.

522
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,550
Mr. Xu and I

523
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,110
were not that kind of old schoolmates

524
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,400
as you imagined.

525
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,510
Well,

526
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,720
then you must be

527
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,640
close schoolmates

528
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,480
that I couldn't imagine.

529
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,590
Anyway,

530
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,070
I'll drink another toast to you.

531
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:48,880
I'll drink it up.

532
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,030
Whatever conflicts

533
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,240
or misunderstandings you had in the past,

534
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,550
let's forget about them.

535
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,550
We're going to work together.

536
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,350
Mr. Lin.

537
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,960
It's not a misunderstanding,

538
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,510
and I can't forget about it.

539
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,920
You probably didn't know

540
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,070
that this guy

541
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,830
who received a job offer from Xingheng

542
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,680
right as an undergraduate

543
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,720
was the heartthrob

544
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,590
of all the girls in our school,

545
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,960
but he almost

546
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,440
ended up in prison for hacking into

547
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,240
a company's system.

548
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,790
Broken bones well set become stronger.

549
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,350
Though it's an old saying,

550
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,400
I agree with it.

551
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,400
Xu Yanshi.

552
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,200
As long as you bow down to me today,

553
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,400
admit your mistake,

554
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,160
admit that you're not better than me,

555
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,960
admit that you're nothing

556
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,310
but a complete coward,

557
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,270
a criminal...

558
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,550
Mr. Lu!

559
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,960
You must be

560
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,680
joking.

561
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,750
We're all men.

562
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,750
We're all proud men.

563
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,830
The past is past.

564
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,920
A grown man

565
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,270
should know

566
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,790
when to stop.

567
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,480
Besides, we're in Shanghai.

568
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,070
Who do you think you are?

569
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,000
Everyone, listen to me.

570
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,200
Right now,

571
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,310
we're facing

572
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,310
a serious problem.

573
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,200
Soaring just called

574
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,960
and said they will
terminate the contract.

575
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
It must be because of that jerk.

576
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,750
It's all your fault.

577
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:31,830
They said

578
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,920
that they want to

579
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,240
collaborate with Wujiang

580
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,030
because their accuracy is higher than ours

581
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:36,640
and they've

582
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,350
offered a lower price.

583
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,550
How about

584
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,070
we also lower the price?

585
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,160
We can sell more at a lower price.

586
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,830
No way.

587
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,640
The drone navigation system,

588
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,880
in terms of technology and cost,

589
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,070
should be 70-30

590
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,750
with 70% for technology.

591
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,110
We need to improve

592
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,960
the accuracy of the system.

593
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,750
What's your plan?

594
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,590
I don't have a specific plan yet.

595
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,750
It depends on how we execute it.

596
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,400
Do you have any ideas?

597
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,830
Our team

598
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,960
has put in a lot of effort over the years

599
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,070
to enhance the performance

600
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,680
of the drone navigation system.

601
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,590
We've always struggled with

602
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,160
accuracy issues.

603
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,720
Are you saying

604
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,550
that you alone

605
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,880
can surpass all of us

606
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,440
and achieve what we couldn't
in all this time?

607
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,960
I think we can give it another try.

608
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:20,750
Fine.

609
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,240
Since you're not convinced,

610
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,310
go ahead and give it a try.

611
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,510
We'll see what happens.

612
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,400
I'll deal with my girl.

613
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,440
Mr. Xu.

614
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,790
It's okay.

615
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,510
I have confidence in you.

616
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,400
But Mr. Xu,

617
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,720
over the years,

618
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,720
we have put a lot of effort

619
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,400
into improving

620
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,920
positioning accuracy.

621
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,440
It may

622
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,750
sound easy,

623
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:05,240
but it's actually quite challenging.

624
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:06,790
If it were easy,

625
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:07,880
it wouldn't be the core technology

626
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,640
that dominates the market.

627
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,160
Instead of complaining,

628
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,200
let's start working.

629
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:23,750
Mr. Xu.

630
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,110
Are you currently

631
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,680
in a long-distance relationship?

632
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,720
How is it?

633
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,830
Being in a long-distance relationship

634
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,110
must be tough.

635
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,270
Try being in one yourself,

636
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,160
and you'll know it.

637
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,480
I had one before,

638
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,590
but we broke up.

639
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,240
Anyway, I can never see myself

640
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,200
getting into

641
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:43,880
a long-distance relationship again.

642
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,480
He had a girlfriend

643
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,310
in his hometown,

644
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,270
but that girl dated

645
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,510
someone locally.

646
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,030
They went to see a movie together

647
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,070
and even had a physical relationship.

648
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,590
Later, Tao caught them cheating.

649
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,790
Well, Mr. Xu,

650
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,200
you better be careful.

651
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,000
There are many third parties

652
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,110
who won't hesitate to meddle

653
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:11,110
even when they know
you're the person she loves.

654
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,440
Thank you.

655
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,310
Mr. Xu.

656
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,270
Look at this...

657
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,350
How are things going?

658
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,310
Are we almost there?

659
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,110
It's okay.

660
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,440
As I said,

661
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,310
it's not a simple matter.

662
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,880
How is it possible?

663
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,200
It shouldn't be like this.

What are you doing?

668
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,830
I'm going to apply a face mask.

669
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,200
What's wrong?

670
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,510
Are things not going well?

671
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,720
I don't think

672
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,400
I can make it back this weekend.

673
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,480
Is it revenge on me?

674
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,550
I'm serious.

675
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,480
I encountered some trouble.

676
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,200
You just went there.

677
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,830
Work should come first.

678
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,000
Don't worry about me.

679
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,270
I can go to Shanghai to see you.

680
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,480
Is there anything

681
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,880
I can help you with?

682
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,550
You don't have to be

683
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,000
so considerate.

684
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,440
If you scold me now,

685
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,310
I might feel better.

686
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,510
But I can't bear to do that.

I...

689
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,790
The ticket is so expensive.

690
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,920
I'll go see it

691
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,030
and tell you about it afterward.

692
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,720
Don't worry.

693
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,240
I'll take a few days off
in a couple of days

694
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,200
and go to see you.

695

the drone positioning accuracy

732

and even a 10% improvement in accuracy

was difficult to be done.

00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,800
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

764
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,360
Please keep quiet, you two.

765
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,110
The play is about to start.

766
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,880
(Where are you?)

767
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,440
(Xu Yanshi)

768
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,440
I'm on my way to the theater.

769
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,400
Excuse me, miss.

770
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,630
(Spring of the Twenty-eighth Year)
The play has started.

771
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,510
Please wait and enter
until the intermission.

772
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:32,840
All right.

773
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:42,960
(Oh, no.)

774
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:45,190
(If Xu Yanshi asks me)

775
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,590
(what the play is about,)

776
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,510
(I won't be able to tell him.)

777
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,280
Have you made her mad again?

778
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:56,710
I haven't spoken to her

779
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,110
since I got off the car.

780
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,630
Do you know what a woman is?

781
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,670
Women

782
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,360
are like this,

783
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,510
when you talk to her,

784
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,440
she gets annoyed;

785
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,880
when you don't talk to her,

786
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,670
she gets angry.

787
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,880
If other women don't talk to you,

788
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,150
she thinks you're not attractive;

789
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,880
if other women talk to you,

790
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,920
she gets jealous.

791
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,110
Clearly, she likes to eat steak,

792
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,360
but she insists on saying
it doesn't matter;

793
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,110
she keeps saying
she wants to lose weight,

794
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,710
but she complains about being tired
for a short run.

795
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:37,500
(Spring of the Twenty-eighth Year)

796
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,280
Xu Yanshi?

797
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,030
Why are you here?

798
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,630
It seems that you don't

799
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,510
want me to be here.

800
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,030
What happened?

801
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,920
What's wrong?

802
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,760
Are we not going to watch it?

803
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,400
I haven't watched it.

804
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,180
(Xi'an Shangjia Theater
"Spring of the Twenty-eighth Year" Round 2)

805
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,670
(Post)
(What a great show.)

806
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,550
Xu Yanshi.

807
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,510
What's wrong?

808
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,510
Hello?

809
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,150
Is this Xiang Yuan,

810
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:43,840
the leader of Gao Leng?

811
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,510
Gao Leng is at the police station.

812
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,400
Please come over.

813
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,190
Boss?

814
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,320
(Police)

815
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,190
Yuan.

816
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,000
What's going on?

817
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,360
I saw it online...

818
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,710
This is so cool.

819
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:27,140
(The first step to being a grown man
is to get a new car.)

820

821
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,180
(Gao Leng)

822
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,110
Let's go for a ride.

823
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,880
Let's go.

824
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:57,030
It's dark.

825
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,510
It's not safe for a girl

826
00:42:58,510 --> 00:42:59,400
to walk alone at night.

827
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,000
I'll turn on a light for her.

828
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:07,840
That's what a gentleman should do.

829
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,400
It's dark here. She should be careful.

830
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,920
Help! Someone's tailing me!

831
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:29,590
No...

832
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:31,630
Police! Stop!

833
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:32,800
What are you doing?

834
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,590
Get out of the car.

835
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,920
Get out of the car! Turn off it!

836
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,840
Thank you.

837
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,190
(Window 2)

838
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,000
All right, don't do

839
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:49,190
such things again.

840
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:50,480
It can give people
the wrong impression.

841
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,030
You scared that girl pretty badly.

842
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,320
All right.

843
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,150
You can go.

844
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:01,580
(Zhongzhai Road Police Station)

845
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:02,400
Boss.

846
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:03,670
Yuan.

847
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,070
Sorry for

848
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:06,280
bothering you.

849
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,590
Have you ever stopped causing us trouble?

850
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,920
Am I that bad?

851
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:15,150
Never mind.

852
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:17,190
You also have your shining points.

853
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:19,480
Such as?

854
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:25,190
All right.

855
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,360
It's late.

856
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:27,480
Go back.

857
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,550
Boss.

858
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:32,710
I miss you.

859
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,440
Why did you suddenly come back

860
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,070
and why are you with Yuan?

861
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:37,630
- Something came up.
- I happened to meet her.

862
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,630
All right, it's business anyway.

863
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:48,590
Go home now.

864
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:50,280
Well...

865
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,400
I bought a new car.

866
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,670
How about I give you a ride?

867
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:53,840
- No need.
- No need.

868
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,590
Go back.

869
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:00,710
Boss.

870
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:01,920
Goodbye.

871
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:03,920
Come back and see us when you have time.

872
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,590
Yuan, see you tomorrow.

873
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:42,590
He's bad at driving.

874
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,070
I bet he'll be caught

875
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:46,400
by the police again later.
