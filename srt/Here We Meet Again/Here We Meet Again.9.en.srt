Hello?

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,040
This isn't Boss.

31
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,000
This is Gao Leng.

32
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,070
I hacked into your phone

33
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,590
and modified the caller ID.

34
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,840
I'm just this great.

35
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,760
ou can't beat me, huh?

36
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,040
I'm just this great.

37
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,870
You know wh...

38
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,120
When are you coming back?

39
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,590
Tomorrow.

40
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,350
I'll pick you up.

41
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,000
A dozen of beers over there.

42
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,590
OK.

43
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,560
(Did he know about)

44
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,030
(what I said in the live stream?)

45
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,750
Actually, just now I…

46
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,400
You actually do not need to…

47
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,710
What?

48
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,590
In the live broadcast, I…

49
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,590
I didn't watch it.

50
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,910
After I sent you a message on WeChat,

51
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,080
Gao Leng and I

52
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,080
went out for dinner.

53
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,080
What did you say?

54
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,630
Is it about me?

55
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,840
No, no, no.

56
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,870
I just used swear words

57
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,680
in the live stream.

58
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,000
I thought

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,560
it's a disgrace to our team's image.

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,750
It's OK.

61
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,030
I've asked Karma to delete it.

62
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,360
(I have to make Karma)

63

Mm-hmm.

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,120
I spent more time in Xi'an

67
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,150

68
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,590

when we start to worry

102
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,920
that the bald might have frostbite.

(Xi'an)

104
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:34,750
Are you blind?

105
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,920
You're so cool in this outfit.

106
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,390
I didn't recognize you.

107
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,120
Forgive me.

108
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,510
Perhaps I went blind for a second.

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,120
Let me see you again.

110
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,160
I've never seen you

111
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,830
in such style.

112
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,040
Let me have a look.

113
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,890
Wow!

114
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,040
They're gonna kiss!

115
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,000
Don't talk nonsense.

116
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,720
Sorry, don't mind him.

117
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,750
Let's go.

118
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,600
Since you're blind,

119
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,070
I'll give you a ride home,

120
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,040
though I'm reluctant to.

121
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,800
Got over the cold?

122
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,480
Mm-hmm.

123
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,630
When I was young,
my grandmother told me that

124
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,480
you'd get over your own cold

125
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,600
when you spread the cold to others.

126
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,920
Seeing that you're so lively now,

127
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,600
I bet some poor soul

128
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,600
somewhere

129
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,070
must be suffering now.

130
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,750
Don't look at me!

131
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,870
I don't have a cold.

132
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,950
It's just

133
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,240
because of the wind

134
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,560
when I got out.

135
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,800
I heard that

136
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,360
at the staff meeting,

137
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,190
you took the elevator with the chairman.

138
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,160
Words traveled

139
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,430
to your place so fast.

140
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,630
Didn't you cry after that reprimand?

141
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,750
Yeah.

142
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,070
Of course I did.

143
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,870
I cried so sadly.

144
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,430
(I know in the company)

145
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,950
(there are a lot of rumors about us.)

146
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,630
(And there are a lot of things)

147
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,310
(that I can't)

148
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,920
(make clear with you in a while.)

149
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,000
(But none of them are true.)

150
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,680
In just a few months,

151
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,120
I've experienced it.

152
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,830
In such a small cubicle,

153
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,510
rumors become ridiculous

154
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,950
as they spread.

155
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,560
If you're not feeling well today,

156
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,360
just stay home and rest.

157
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,190
I can't do that.

158
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,830
I'll lose half a day's pay.

159
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,560
Thank you very much.

160
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,950
I should go.

161
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,080
Who ties a scarf like this?

162
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,270
It's ugly.

163
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,440
I came to see Lin Qingqing

164
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,120
to get support

165
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,630
from the technical department

166
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,000
to protest against
the administration department.

167
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,750
Since you're all here,

168
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,270
let's make it clear

169
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,600
here and now.

170
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,790
There's nothing to say.

171
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,960
Tell it to Miss Xiang when she comes back.

172
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,910
Some people

173
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,960
are good at causing trouble.

174
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,030
Jingqi,

175
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,630
everyone

176
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,030
makes mistakes.

177
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,320
And we have reported

178
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,080
this problem many times.

179
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,390
Did Miss Xiang do wrong?

180
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,910
She only spoke up for us.

181
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,390
You know there's been a problem

182
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:54,840
with the travel expenses.

183
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,200
How can you blame someone
who helped you?

184
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,720
Are you men in the technical department

185
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,270
stupid or just simple?

186
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,720
She can do whatever she wants to do

187
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,840
with a pretty face?

188
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,720
Everyone should forgive her
for anything she did?

189
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,480
What my uncle said can't be wrong.

190
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,870
When he said the director was mad,

191
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,320
the director was mad.

192
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,200
Now he's convening an emergency meeting

193
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,750
to discuss this matter.

194
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,000
If because of her,

195
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,320
our year-end bonuses

196
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,320
is cut,

197
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,000
who will take the responsibility?

198
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,670
Don't drag the whole company into it.

199
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,840
Alright, I'll take the responsibility.

200
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,200
Boss.

201
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,030
(You'll take the responsibility?)

202
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,320
(What's it to do with you?)

203
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,840
Xiang Yuan
is from the technical department.

204
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,630
Her trouble is our trouble.

205
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,510
We all will take the responsibility.

206
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,600
If anyone thinks

207
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,750
that I have done wrong,

208
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,840
you can just come forward

209
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,120
and tell me.

210
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,240
You are just wrong.

211
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,150
What?

212
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,440
Why can't we talk about it?

213
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,750
Don't you all benefit from a raise

214
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,670
in travel expenses?

215
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,840
I'm afraid you won't get the approval

216
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,840
and will make it worse,

217
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,080
blowing up

218
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,720
our year-end bonuses.

219
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,480
That's right.

220
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,720
Let's go.

221
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,630
Let's go.

222
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,200
I'm so fed up.

223
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,750
Get out of here and go to work.

224
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,270
They're just being unreasonable.

225
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,320
Absurd.

226
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,670
I really don't understand.

227
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,870
What does this have to do with them?

228
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,550
Alright, go to work.

229
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,360
Miss Xiang, let me help you hang it up.

230
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,080
Thank you.

231

(Cold Remedy Granular)

232
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,120
Yuan,

233
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,790
did they make you ill?

234
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,440
Stand down.

235
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

236
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,100
(Article 24 Other Expenses...)

00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,540
(Revised Rules on Travel Expenses
Reimbursement of Xi'an branch)

238
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,120
Sir,

239
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,150
a call from Yuan.

240
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,080
She sounds quite serious.

241
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,750
What is it?

242
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,240
Hello? Hello?

243
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,080
Stop hiding.

244
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,200
I heard the pot lid.

245
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,120
Alright, cut to the chase.

246
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,270
What I want to ask

247
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,550
is for the benefit of all employees.

248
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,670
The reimbursement policy

249
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,670
of Velin company,

250
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,960
including travel expenses

251
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,510
and the time schedule for business trips

252
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,630
is really unreasonable.

253
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,120
So what do you suggest?

254
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,440
I just revised

255
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,670
the reimbursement policy

256
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,790
on travel expenses

257
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,240
of Velin company.

258
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,240
I will send it to you.

259
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,120
I want to put a human touch

260
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,000
on the reimbursement of

261
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,910
of Velin company.

262
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,910
I disagree.

263
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,720
A few days ago,

264
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,360
you offended a customer.

265
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,030
Velin's sales next year

266
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,600
will see negative growth, right?

267
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,320
We have a bet.

268
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,000
And now it's clear

269
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,630
who's winning.

270
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,550
You can go back to Shanghai.

271
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,440
Don't waste your time on Velin.

272
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,840
I told you before.

273
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,480
It's too early for you to say that.

274
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,080
We lost one customer.

275
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,030
That's all.

276
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,000
With our excellent technology,

277
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,200
I believe that in the market

278
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,790
we can still get a foothold.

279
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,080
Let me tell you.

280
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,550
In the business world, technology

281
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,320
plays only a small role.

282
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,720
The most important thing is sales.

283
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,080
Velin's sales are too poor.

284
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,000
It's beyond salvage.

285
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:03,840
Grandpa,

286
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,120
our company sells technology.

287
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,790
The sales

288
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,790
depend on

289
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,870
how good the technology is.

290
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,270
Besides,

291
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,240
nowadays, science and technology

292
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,360
are the primary productive forces.

293
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,550
My mom

294
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,670
devoted her life

295
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,960
to scientific research.

296
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,510
My grandma

297
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,000
supported her, didn't she?

298
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,120
Have you forgotten

299
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,720
what happened to your mom in the end?

300
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,360
Have you forgotten how lonely

301
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,720
a child you were?

302
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,320
Did you forget

303
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,270
what you promised me?

304
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,390
What?

305
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,960
Anyway, you have to do it on your own.

306
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,670
If you can keep

307
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,910
Velin from bankruptcy,

308
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,960
then from now on,

309
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,390
I'll do everything you say.

310
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,360
OK.

311
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,080
You cruel man!

312
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,270
I also have a request.

313
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,360
Say it, you cruel girl.

314
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,320
When I get to Velin,

315
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,440
I want three opportunities

316
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,550
to make independent decisions.

317
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,440
OK.

318
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,910
I promise you.

319
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,670
I'll give you
three life-saving opportunities.

320
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,080
Sir.

321
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,790
Xiang Yuan sent you an email.

322
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,720
Did you get it?

323
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,360
Yes, sir.

324
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,320
Shall we approve it?

325
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,790
Yeah, approve it. What then?

326
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,840
I promised her.

327
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,120
What else can we do?

328
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
Anyway, this company

329
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,840
will be closed next year.

330
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,750
Let's give the girl

331
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,440
an opportunity

332
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,550
to try it out

333
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,630
and gather some experience.

334
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,670
As for her proposal on travel expenses,

335
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,600
do what she wants.

336
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,320
Go ahead.

337
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,150
Understood.

338
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,600
Little girl,

339
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,320
you used the first opportunity.

340
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,030
After that,

341
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,960
let's see what happens.

351
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,310
This is not the point.

352
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,270
Look at the last page.

353
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,880
After careful consideration,

354
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,720
the management adopted the opinions

355
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,880
Miss Xiang Yuan, team leader of Group II,

356
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,350
Technical Department of Velin proposed.

357
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,640
We welcome the supervision

of all employees

359
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,400
and encourage your proposals
like what Miss Xiang offered.

360
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,440
Great.

361
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:36,550
The interim rules

362
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,400
apply to the official staff of the group,

363
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,240
excluding

364
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,920
trainees.

365
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,030
Trainees?

366
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,110
Who are the trainees?

367
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,160
Ying Yinyin.

368
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,960
She didn't get permission
from the head office.

369
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,720
So, she signed up as a trainee.

370
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,750
Just her.

371
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,240
What?

372
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:53,960
I'm...

373
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,310
Darn it, Xiang Yuan.

374
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,350
We'll see!

375
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,310
Usually, Velin

376
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,270
provides quotas

377
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,310
for regular employment.

378
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,550
But in these years, the group profit...

379
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,510
Coupled with competition,

380
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,110
the quotas decrease every year.

381
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:15,830
This year, Velin

382
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,070
doesn't provide quotas.

383
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,480
So Ying Yinyin

384
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,110
has not signed a full-member contract.

385
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,680
But,

386
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,880
this is not the point.

387
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,270
Hey!

388
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,590
There is another list here.

389
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,310
Let me see.

390
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,790
(Contract Descriptions of All Employees)
Contract Descriptions of All Employees.

391
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,510
Gao Leng,

392
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,590
I see your name.

393
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,830
You're in Class C.

394
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:33,880
So am I.

395
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,400
(Class B)
You Zhi is in Class B.

396
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,640
But why is Boss also in Class B

397
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,070
Shouldn't he be in Class A?

398
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,960
You don't understand.

399
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,000
Listen to me.

400
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,480
The staff of Donghe Group

401
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,550
is divided into Classes A, B, and C.

402
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,480
In Class A

403
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,510
are the earliest employees.

404
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,510
They are all the founding fathers

405
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,510
of the group.

406
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,960
And there are those with a Ph.D.

407
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,720
who are recruited on special terms

408
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,920
to work in R&D of Headquarters.

409
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,590
In Class B

410
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,960
are college graduates

411
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,640
who passed the written test

412
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,830
and interviews.

413
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,400
They're highly talented graduates

414
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,270
from prestigious universities.

415
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,550
Boss belongs to this kind.

416
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,480
But his talent has been

417
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,160
buried over the years.

418
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:09,750
So,

419
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,200
there is little chance for him
to get into Class A.

420
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,960
The last Class C

421
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,350
is for those through social recruitment.

422
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,680
Velin

423
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,790
was only established in 2012.

424
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,880
So we are assigned here

425
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,720
as Class-C employees.

426
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,480
Does that mean Miss Xiang

427
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,400
also falls into Class C?

428
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,350
Isn't she also assigned here?

429
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,440
But I just read the list.

430
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,960
I didn't seem to see her name.

431
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,920
Why not?

432
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,070
Scroll down.

433
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,820
(Class A: Xiang Yuan Technical Department)

434
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,880
I can't believe my eyes.

435
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,070
Neither can I!

436
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,160
Who is Xiang Yuan?

437
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,160
She's so mysterious.

438
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,880
That's why in our entire company

439
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,400
only Mr. Li and Miss Li are in Class A.

440
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,030
In addition to them,

441
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,590
there's also Yuan.

442
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,680
No wonder she has an annual vacation.

443
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,680
Their annual vacation

444
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,440
is five days longer than ours.

445
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,200
And their benefits are also good.

446
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,400
I envy them!

447
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,960
What a treasure girl!

448
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,310
I want to give up Shu

449
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,000
and go after Yuan.

450
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,030
I've recorded it.

451
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,510
I'll send it to Shu.

452
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,160
Hey!

453
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,790
What are you doing?

454
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,480
When did you

455
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,640
develop a habit of recording?

456
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,680
Give it to me.

457
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,880
Don't move.

458
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,880
I didn't record it. I lied to you.

459
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,590
I didn't send it.

460
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,680
I didn't.

461
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,350
Go away, go away.

462
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,110
Qingqing,

463
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,720
do you know how to delete this?

00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,720
Top right corner.

465
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,240
You must not click it.

466
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,400
Honey,

467
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,880
You Zhi did a great job

468
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,200
imitating my voice.

469
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,590
Come with me.

470
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,070
Honey!

471
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,830
Did you buy me this sweatshirt

472
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,270
because of the ropes?

473
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,720
How convenient!

474
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,200
My fault. I'm sorry.

475
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,590
Honey, they're all looking.

476
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,000
Honey, let me explain.

477
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,790
I'm loyal and honest to you.

478
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,480
I swear to Heavens!

479
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,480
My love for you

480
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,510
is as solid as gold.

481
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,750
Don't believe

482
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,440
what You Zhi and the others said.

483
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,830
In that case,

484
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,310
I have to reward you

485
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,830
for your love as solid as gold?

486
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,880
You don't have to.

487
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:13,830
You know me.

488
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,160
I'm just straightforward.

489
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,680
This...

490
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,000
This...

491
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,880
Isn't this

492
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,590
the razor I always want?

493
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,960
This is for me?

494
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,270
What do you think?

495
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,160
This cleans facial and
nose hairs and sideburns.

496
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,790
Isn't that what you need?

497
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:35,000
Honey, you're so nice to me.

498
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You're the gentlest

499
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,510
and the most understanding woman
in the world.

500
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,240
And you have a good taste.

501
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,030
Save your breath.

502
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,000
I have requirements

503
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,350
for my boyfriend's appearance.

504
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,920
So before you go out,

505
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,720
make yourself look good,

506
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,640
so I can feel happy when I see you.

507
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,720
Yes, ma'am.

508
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,310
To be a better man.

509
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:54,880
Good boy.

510
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,590
Uncle,

511
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,830
how did it

512
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,830
end up like this?

513
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,920
I've been in the company for so long.

514
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,830
How come a newcomer…

515
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,270
A newcomer

516
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,160
over-ranked me?

517
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,790
I haven't heard

518
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,550
anyone came to Velin

519
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:14,400
through nepotism.

520
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,400
Don't worry.

521
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,350
You're now

522
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,750
the most special employee in Velin.

523
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:23,030
No one can shake your position.

524
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,640
It seems the reform on travel expenses

525
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,400
was the will of the headquarters.

526
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,310
She was just

527
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,880
lucky to make it right.

528
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,030
That's probably true.

529
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,400
Alright,

530
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,270
I'm not going to talk to you anymore.

531
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,920
I'm here in Velin

532
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,240
for a lot of business.

533
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,590
All in all,

534
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,720
you just behave yourself.

535
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,680
Don't cause any trouble for me.

536
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,110

don't be mad at Ying Yinyin.

Anger will ruin your health.

574
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,030
I'm not an intolerant person.

575
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,830
There are always people like her

576
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,440
who think they're righteous

577
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,880
and judge others

578
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,030
from the moral high ground.

579
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,240
But in fact,

580
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,680
when they do something wrong,

581
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,310
they blame others for not being tolerant.

582
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,720
In fact, there's a saying

583
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,000
about this type of people.

584
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,510
Do you know what it is?

585
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,680
Use the standards of saints

586
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,920
on others

587
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,310
and never hold themselves to
the same standards.

588
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,720
Good morning!

589
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,880
Please come in. Please come in.

590
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,640
You're so early today.

591
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,480
Come on in.

592
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,750
Have you had breakfast yet?

593
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,720
You see,

594
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,640
it's a nice day.

595
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,160
Come on.

596
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,640
Hey!

597
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,440
Miss A is here.

598
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,110
What are you doing?

599
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,960
Get out of the way.

600
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,920
Quickly.

601
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:01,830
This way.

602
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,480
Please have a seat.

603
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,510
Miss A.

604
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,070
You've made a great contribution

605
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,720
to the funding.

606
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,070
Shall we…

607
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,440
go out tonight

608
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,400
to have a drink?

609
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,110
Miss A…?

610
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,030
(Does he…)

611
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:29,350
(find out I'm Ashers?)

612
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,590
Gao Leng said

613
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,000
he's gonna call you this

614
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,880
to show his respect

615
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,000
to the third Class-A employee

616
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,070
in Velin

617
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,350
except for Li Yongbiao and Li Qin.

618
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

619
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,590
I can't drink. I have a cold.

620
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:42,850
What?

621
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,480
Do you

622
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,000
really have a cold?

623
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,480
Why would I lie to you?

624
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:48,720
Who would lie

625
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,680
about having a cold?

626
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,550
Can I get a raise

627
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,750
for working while being sick?

628
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,310
No,

629
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,590
wrong intelligence.

630
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,680
I'll leave you.

631
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,030
Gao Leng thought you cried.

632
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,920
So he told Boss.

633
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,110
If Gao Leng

634
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,920
could use his attentiveness

635
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,550
in the work,

636
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,590
he would have been

637
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,400
paid enough to buy a house now.

638
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:18,960
Gao Leng said

639
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,510
the reason why

640
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,000
he can't afford to buy a house

641
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,110
is mainly that

642
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,680
his Boss, Mr. Xu,

643
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,160
can't afford to buy a house now.

644
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,160
(Velin)
The launch of this year

645
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,510
will still be prepared

646
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,440
by the Technical Department.

647
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,380
(Notice of the 2019 New Product Launch)

648
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I've been waiting for this launch.

649
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,200
Finally, I can take this opportunity

650
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,110
to give a good introduction

651
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:47,960
to our new products

652
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,590
and boost

653
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,640
our sales.

654
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,240
Don't be overexcited.

655
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,160
We don't have much money

656
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,920
to stage a big show.

657
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,270
To be frank,

658
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,110
the launch is just

659
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,720
a chance to get close to

660
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,400
old customers at dinner.

661
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,550
Understand?

662
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,750
As I said,

663
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,680
no need to go through the trouble

664
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,720
to prepare for a big event.

665
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,070
Go get it done.

666
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,440
About the launch,

667
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,270
I have an idea,

668
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,400
which is to

669
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,400
make some adjustments

670
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,160
to our products

671
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,680
and establish

672
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,680
(Market Analysis)
an online freight platform.

673
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,590
I checked the data.

674
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,440
In recent years,

675
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,400
our freight navigation usage

676
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,510
is a little higher.

677
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,590
From 2010 onwards,

678
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,510
the compound growth rate of

679
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,070
domestic logistics has reached

680
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,830
13.45 percent.

681
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:38,830
So with the rapid development

682
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,480
of the courier industry,

683
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,590
the logistics industry

684
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,790
is also developing rapidly.

685
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:43,640
This also leads to

686
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,400
the soaring growth

687
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,830
of trucks in use.

688
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,510
Then it also means that

689
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,830
the demand for freight navigation

690
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,680
will become

691
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,070
greater.

692
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:53,880
Miss Xiang,

693
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,200
are you possessed

694
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,240
by our Boss?

695
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,480
Don't interrupt.

696
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,110
But in fact, more people

697
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,590
only care about how fast

698
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,480
and how soon

699
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,240
they can receive their packages.

700
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,160
Few people

701
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,000
care about the truck drivers'

702
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,680
safety and health,

703
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,510
or convenience.

704
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,550
So while everyone

705
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,480
is looking at things,

706
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,030
should we also

707
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,960
pay attention to the people?

708
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:16,920
If we can

709
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,030
provide a one-stop solution for

710
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,880
the needs of

711
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,790
truck drivers,

712
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,240
I think it would be a

713
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,960
very marketable

714
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,350
development trend.

715
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,640
By then,

716
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,960
Velin

717
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,720
can make a big profit.

718
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,110
Could Xiang Yuan

719
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,310
be the granddaughter of

720
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,750
a founding father of the company
or something?

721
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,790
Otherwise, she wouldn't have

722
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,200
secured a Class A contract.

723
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,240
I think it's possible.

724
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,030
Xu Yanshi really has a keen eye.

725
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,640
You two are

726
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,030
so imaginative.

727
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,920
What's so great about Xu Yanshi?

728
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,960
He has nothing.

729
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,070
No money,

730
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,310
no power,

731
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,750
and no background.

732
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,720
Why do you want him?

733
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,240
To buy you milk tea?

734
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,680
He can't even afford to buy me a bag.

735
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,880
In my opinion,

736
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,750
he is one of those

737
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,240
kept men.

738
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,790
He's not pretty at all.

739
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,880
If it wasn't for Chen Shan,

740
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,640
he probably can't get into

741
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,880
Class B in Velin.

742
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,590
And that woman

743
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,830
hasn't married because of him.

744
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,720
Don't you know?

745
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,440
Xu Yanshi is such a clever man.

746
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,640
Aside from Chen Shan,

747
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,070
he also hooks up with Xiang Yuan.

748
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,110
Luckily, I was smart

749
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,640
and didn't fall for him.

750
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,750
Listen,

751
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,680
stop thinking about Xu Yanshi.

752
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:41,830
To be honest,

753
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,160
the salesman

754
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,440
from the milk tea store downstairs

755
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,110
is not bad.

756
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,110
Let me tell you.

757
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,790
Every time she goes to buy milk tea,

758
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,880
he can't move his eyes

759
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,400
away from her.

760
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,030
Like this.

761
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:51,830
What are you doing?

762
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,590
I'm good looking

763
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,480
and blooming.

764
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,030
It's normal I get people's attention.

765
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,350
Some girls

766
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,550
find all excuses

767
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,000
to buy milk tea.

768
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,440
For real,

769
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,200
he's really more reliable than Xu Yanshi.

770
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:07,000
That's true.

771
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,070
Let's go for milk tea a few more times.

772
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,880
And I'll take him down.

773
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,830
- Take him down.
- Take him down.

774
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:13,640
I suddenly

775
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,920
want to drink milk tea.

776
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:15,640
Let's go.

777
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,880
I'll buy you two a cup of milk tea.

778
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,590
Come on.

779
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,440
Let's go.

780
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,350
I'm telling you, the man is hot.

781
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,640
- I have seen him.
- Gossip girls.

782
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:24,960
Everyone,

783
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,750
I have good news for you.

784
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,510
Who wants to drink milk tea?

785
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:30,690
What?

786
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:31,790
Do you want it?

787
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,000
- Do you want it?
- Yes!

788
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:33,880
Quickly.

789
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,880
- Place an order.
- Who's buying?

790
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,070
Whatever you want.

791
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,880
Black tea latte with extra sugar.

792
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,110
Then I'll have the matcha milk cap.

793
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,480
I'll have matcha milk cap too.

794
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,240
Silk stocking milk tea.

795
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,160
Can I have two cups?

796
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,880
Slow down.

797
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,000
I can't even remember.

798
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,510
Send it to the WeChat group.

799
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,920
I'll go buy them for you!

800
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,750
OK.

801
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,400
Wang, Li,

802
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,680
send it to the WeChat group.

803
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,160
The milk tea you want.

804
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,830
Thank you.

805
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,830
Do you want anything to drink?

806
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,550
Anything is fine.

807
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,790
What do you want to drink?

808
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,070
Let's go together.

809
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,400
Come on.

810
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,750
Don't ruin my hair.

811
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,200
Yinyin, you're so nice.

812
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,200
Treat your colleagues to milk tea again?

813
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:12,680
Yeah, right.

814
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,400
- What do you want?
- Hi, sunshine.

815
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,350
You know Yinyin?

816
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,000
You're all Yin Yin's colleagues, right?

817
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,720
Yeah.

818
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,070
I'll give you a 20% off.

819
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,070
Since you've said so,

820
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,030
we'll accept it then.

821
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,160
What do you want?

822
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,510
Then I'll start ordering.

823
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,790
Let's see what they ordered

824
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,880
in the WeChat group.

825
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,510
Two cups of silk stocking milk tea,

826
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,440
one cup of black tea latte with sugar,

827
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,480
two cups of matcha milk cap,

828
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,830
one cup of brown sugar and ginger water.

829
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,030
And I've already chosen one for you.

830
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,310
An iced Americano.

831
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,160
I'll have a mocha,

832
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,030
iced.

833
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,000
When they're done,

834
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,110
please send them to

835
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:46,720
the Technical Department of Velin.

836
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,240
The bill will be on our Yinyin.

837
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,200
I...

838
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,070
Yinyin is so generous.

839
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:55,000
I know.

840
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,160
Thank you, Yinyin.

841
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,830
You are welcome.

842
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:58,960
Let's go.

843
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,840
Come on, let's go.

844
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,160
What do you two want?

845
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:02,830
Hurry up!

846
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,030
No, no, thanks.

847
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:04,680
They don't want anything.

848
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,270
How much?

849
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,440
They talked

850
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,480
behind your back today.

851
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,550
They've been bad-mouthing me

852
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,030
all the time.

853
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,110
I'll take the milk tea

854
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:21,960
compensation.

855
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,160
That's really not much to ask.

856
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,110
I'm really nicer

857
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,350
than before.

858
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:27,920
Are you happy now?

859
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,750
(Calm down, calm down.)

860
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,830
(You just held hands for a while.)

861
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,030
(Don't be so excited.)

862
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,020
(Bai)

863
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:18,960
Yuan,

864
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,190
I found out more

865
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,550
about Xu Yanshi.

866
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,440
I don't need it. I know all about him.

867
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,110
He seems to be

868
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,840
Chen Shan's boyfriend.

869
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,070
No way.

870
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,280
I asked Chen Shan about it.

871
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,070
Chen Shan told me

872
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,400
they're not in a relationship.

873
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,190
She wouldn't admit it.

874
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,440
After all, Xu Yanshi

875
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,710
is so much younger than her.

876
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,400
I have photos to prove it.

877
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,230
I'll send it to you.

878
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,360
This photo

879
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,510
is no secret in Donghe.

880
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,400
I asked around.

881
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,230
It seems many people

882
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,920
know about their relationship.

883
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,840
Grandpa only asked you

884
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,760
to check his background,

885
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,360
not rumors like this.

886
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:05,860
(Bai)

887
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,590
Liars!

888
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,760

889
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,480

896
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,920
Sign them before work and give them
to Lin Qingqing.

897
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,230

00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,800
(Step 5.)

956
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,000
(Physical contact.)

957
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,190
Come in.

958
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,710
Sorry to interrupt.

959
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,150
Hi, you guys.

960
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,070
I'll put the milk tea here.

961
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,190
Come on, put it here.

962
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,690
- Milk tea, yeah!
- Bye-bye.

963
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,510
Milk tea is here!

964
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,550
Which one is mine?

965
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,630
Where is mine? Where is mine?

966
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,920
Calm down. Easy.

967
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,280
Here.

968
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,590
- These two cups are yours.

969
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,280
Silk stocking milk tea.

970
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,760
Mine, thank you.

971
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,230
After you finish the tea,

972
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,230
remember to thank

973
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,400
Miss Ying Yinyin.

974
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,630
Ying Yinyin bought the tea?

975
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,510
Does she have a crush on me?

976
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,550
When I went to the toilet,

977
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:47,710
she smiled at me.

978
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,000
Don't be so confident.

979
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,030
Did you

980
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,400
go to the toilet again?

981
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,880
I hate you.

982
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,630
Where did Li Chi go?

983
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,000
I saw him this morning.

984
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,510
Probably fell out with

985
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:00,510
Ying Yinyin again?

986
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:02,030
He hasn't been

987
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,000
with Ying Yinyin

988
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,360
for a long time, right?

989
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,920
What are you looking for?

990
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,550
Brown sugar and ginger water.

991
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:09,920
You're infected by Shi Tianyou.

992
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,800
Having a period?

993
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,280
No, got tummy troubles recently.

994
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,880
Is this it?

995
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,070
Honestly,

996
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,000
this is the second time that Ying Yinyin

997
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,190
bought the technical group

998
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,070
milk tea.

999
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,280
When was the first time?

1000
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,630
When she was pursuing Boss.

1001
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,110
She bought everyone

1002
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,190
a cup of milk tea,

1003
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,110
plus French snacks.

1004
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:28,400
It was a very delicate afternoon tea.

1005
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,000
But Boss didn't take it.

1006
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,360
Why not?

1007
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,760
It's free.

1008
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,590
Because Boss said

1009
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:37,230
Ying Yinyin is too much trouble.

1010
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,070
Anyway,

1011
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,400
luckily, Boss

1012
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,320
didn't fall for her.

1013
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,800
This woman

1014
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:46,030
is a bit scary.

1015
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:49,110
Women are all scary.

1016
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,030
The more beautiful a woman is,

1017
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,000
the scarier she is.

1018
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,480
I think Miss Xiang

1019
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,840
is very cute.

1020
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,550
Well, I hope

1021
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,760
you can say I'm beautiful.

1022
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,070
What's the difference?

1023
00:41:59,070 --> 00:41:59,760
That's true.

1024
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:00,920
Alright.

1025
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,670
Let's go back to work.

1026
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:02,070
Go to work. Go.

1027
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:04,190
Let's go. Keep working.

1028
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,280
Shu is talking to Boss.

1029
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:16,760
I think it's about Mingxiong.

1030
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:18,880
Then,

1031
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,400
take this over to him later.

1032
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,590
Xiang Yuan asked me to ask Huang Qiming

1033
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:30,590
out tonight.

1034
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,920
Since you're all back,

1035
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,190
how about we go together?

1036
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:35,980
Mm-hmm.

1037
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,360
Xiang Yuan is so temperamental.

1038
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,710
She needs practical training.

1039
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,800
We can't let her

1040
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,550
fuss about everything.

1041
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,000
She can just make fun of

1042
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,280
Ying Yinyin sometimes.

1043
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,630
After all, Ying is a silly girl.

1044
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:48,900
Mm-hmm.

1045
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,280
But if she offends

1046
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,880
someone like Huang Qiming,

1047
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,550
she will suffer.

1048
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:55,760
She is…

1049
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:58,440
indeed rather wayward.
