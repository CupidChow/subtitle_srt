=Episode 31=

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,590
You had a quarrel?

30
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,280
No.

31
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,920
We're

32
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,230
breaking up.

33
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,920
Glad to hear that.

34
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,430
It's OK that she gets cranky.

35
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,120
But don't really piss her off.

36
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,400
Otherwise, she would

37
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,870
do anything.

38
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,950
She's... really...

39
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,790
You...

40
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,870
She is a girl

41
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,070
soft-hearted

42
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,640
to everyone.

43
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,710
But to herself,

44
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,400
she's harsh.

45
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,310
Just like her grandma.

46
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,000
Once,

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,360
I quarreled with her grandma.

48
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,000
For some trifles.

49
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,910
A couple usually bicker, you know.

50
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,710
We kept quarreling

51
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,360
and I was...

52
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,560
I could see

53
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,520
that she was feeling sad.

54
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,680
But she didn't apologize.

55
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,120
That was her temper.

56
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,680
And another time, she...

57
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,960
For something

58
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,470
I don't even remember,

59
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,750
just trifles.

60
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,560
We quarreled and quarreled

61
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,800
and then we...

62
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,310
We didn't even talk to each other.

63
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,150
You know, huh?

64
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,590
Then, I gave a tough talk.

65
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,910
I said, "If I listen to you again,

66
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,120
I would use your family name instead!"

67
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,280
Then later,

68
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,840
you changed your name

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,150
into Situ Mingtian.

70
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,430
Not later,

71
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,960
but the next day.

72
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,680
So,

73
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,680
in your relationship,

74
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,560
do whatever she wants.

75
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,910
If...

76
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,360
If she wants to break up,

77
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,590
however much she loves you,

78
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,030
she will break up.

79
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,120
She isn't afraid of being sad.

80
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,590
She doesn't care

81
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,310
whether she feels sad.

82
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,120
Isn't it horrible?

83
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,400
You had an appointment
with Mr. Liu, huh?

84
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,310
Yes.

85
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:24,870
Hi, President Liu.

86
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,630
There you are again, Miss Xiang.

87
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,430
It's OK.

88
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,520
Oh, Xiang Yuan.

89
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,750
I went to your office several times

90
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,470
but didn't see you.
I was told you were too busy.

91
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,710
No offense,

92
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,590
but I had to come here.

93
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,430
Yeah, I've been busy lately.

94
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,120
If you have time,

95
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,400
may I invite you to lunch?

96
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,630
I have an appointment with a client

97
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,800
and I'm not available.

98
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,750
I'll make it short, then.

99
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,080
I'm visiting you now

100
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,960
mainly for

101
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,360
Donghe's loan problem.

102
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,870
You must be aware.

103
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,630
I've made

104
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,150
a detailed loan program,

105
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,590
including the profit plan

106
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,430
and repayment details.

107
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,240
Please have a look.

108
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,960
I've made my point

109
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,310
about Donghe's loan.

110
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,520
(File Bag)
Our bank

111
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,030
really can't help.

112
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,710
President Liu,

113
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,560
I know

114
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,150
Donghe's condition

115
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,310
isn't positive yet.

116
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,560
But everyone

117
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,750
has his trouble.

118
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,520
Back in the past,

119
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,630
when you were in trouble,

120
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,160
we also

121
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,720
picked your bank

122
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,950
among so many banks.

123
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,160
So, this time,

124
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,160
hope you can also help us.

125
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,000
Give us some time,

126
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,270
review this program,

127
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,390
and consider it.

128
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,240
This isn't gonna work, Xiang Yuan.

129
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,680
Considering Donghe's condition,

130
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,870
however perfect your program is,

131
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,430
the loan

132
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,000
won't be granted.

133
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,430
But President Liu,

134
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,360
you should know

135
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,190
we really

136
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,800
need your help now.

137
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,830
I've got something else to do.

138
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,920
I should go.

139
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,870
Sorry.

140
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,920
Mr. Feng, chairman of Wanxing Group

141
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,240
called me today.

142
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,800
What for?

143
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,800
He said he would offer some money

144
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,750
to fill the fund gap

145
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,000
caused by Yang Pingshan.

146
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,800
Can Feng Lei be that warm-hearted?

147
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,240
Before the Spring Festival,

148
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,920
the intelligent medical rescue system

149
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,720
was just approved.

150
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,360
We then spent all our money

151
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,560
on this project.

152
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,800
On the books,

153
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,390
the cash flow isn't too much now.

154
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,480
And a lot of things have happened.

155
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,390
The severance pay
and the appeasement pay...

156
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,430
We need money for everything.

157
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,510
Banks

158
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,040
seem to have doubts

159
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,480
about our credit rating.

160
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,720
So, the loan hasn't been granted yet.

161
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,720
Mr. Feng

162
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,430
can really be our best choice.

163
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,680
He must have asked for something.

164
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,360
He asked Xiang Yuan to marry Feng Jun.

165
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,870
What the heck!

166
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,560
What... What does he want?

167
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,680
Yeah. I also didn't expect him

168
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,920
to ask for this.

169
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,750
Go tell Feng Lei.

170
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,310
Tell him.

171
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,000
Even if I have to apply for bankruptcy,

172
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,560
I won't sell my granddaughter

173
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,800
just for several hundred million yuan.

174
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,120
What a guy he is!

175
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,390
Calm down.

176
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,270
Do you remember?

177
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:24,680
Yes.

178
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,750
Go tell him. Tell him.

179
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,920
Give me the cup. Give it to me.

180
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,390
Don't... Don't forget to tell him.

181
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,000
Darn it!

182
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,040
After paying the balance

183
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,390
of this project,

184
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,270
we'll be totally

185
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,310
out of cash.

186
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,750
It can't hold onto the next season.

187
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,270
If someone offers you 500 million

188
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,190
to marry someone you don't love,

189
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,600
will you accept it?

190
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,070
What will you do?

191
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,720
Answer me.

192
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,390
Will you marry someone

193
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:57,950
you don't love

194
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,270
for Grandpa and me?

195
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,800
In the past,

196
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,040
I wouldn't.

197
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,120
But now,

198
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,720
I will.

199
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,920
Don't think too much.

200
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,750
Bai is right.

201
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,040
We've enjoyed

202
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,560
what others don't have,

203
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,480
and we have to bear

204
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,120
what others can't bear.

205
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:21,510
If I could

206
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,120
get Grandpa over this hard time,

207
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,680
marrying someone would be no big deal.

208
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,270
But listen.

209
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,430
You don't need to.

210
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,680
Grandpa won't approve.

211
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,270
Nor will I.

212
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,950
But Sister,

213
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,750
if someone gave me

214
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,600
ten billion now,

215
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,920
I would hold the wedding
for you immediately.

216
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,560
Xiang Yuan.

217
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,480
I came to pick you up

218
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,920
for Ms. Zhong's birthday party.

219
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,190
Why are you so cold to me?

220
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,070
I'm too busy to go.

221
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,120
What?

222
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,070
No banks grant your loan?

223
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,680
None of your business.

224
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,600
There's always a way out.

225
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,720
Did your grandpa tell you this?

226
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,510
My father said

227
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,800
as long as you married me,

228
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,390
he would

229
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,630
make your company

230
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,680
rise again.

231
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,480
But your grandpa didn't accept it.

232
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,310
He said

233
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,600
he wouldn't sell his granddaughter

234
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,600
just for several hundred million yuan.

235
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,870
And you?

236
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,080
What do you think?

237
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,200
My grandpa made his point

238
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,720
and I can't contradict him.

239
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,000
What about Xu Yanshi?

240
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,360
Do you want him
to sacrifice his lifelong dream

241
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,720
just to take care of

242
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,000
Donghe Group

243
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,240
that might not survive?

244
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,960
I don't think you should be disturbed

245
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,840
when making a decision.

246
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,550
Ask yourself.

247
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,480
What do you want,

248
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,080
Xu Yanshi or your grandpa

249
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,910
and his company?

250
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,670
Don't you know?

251
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,600
Only a kid makes a choice.

252
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,120
Xiang Yuan, don't be childish.

253
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,440
Open your eye

254
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,480
and see what's going on.

255
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,910
How can you have them all?

256
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,240
I still have some time.

257
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,630
Please don't bother.

258
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,000
How about this?

259
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,550
Accept my father's offer.

260
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,150
After my father transfers the money,

261
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,480
you can break it.

262
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,630
What can you get, then?

263
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,200
I want Xu Yanshi

264
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
to see clearly

265
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,320
that his pride is worthless

266
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,200
and I'm your choice.

267
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,260
(71 Notifications)

268
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,700
(Ms. Zhong's Birthday Party)

269
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:19,540
(XYS: Arrived.)

270
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,360
I'll call you

271
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,270
in front of them and say,

272
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,790
"Xu Yanshi, I miss you.

273
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,840
Come here quickly."

274
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,030
Then you rush there

275
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,630
without delay.

276
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,440
Then they'll think

277
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,510
you have a crush on me

278
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,360
but can't get me.

279
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,360
Still, you guard me hopelessly.

280
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,240
In that case,

281
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,510
I'll forget about Zhong Ling.

282
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,630
How about that?

283
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,240
OK.

284
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,630
Come on, Ms. Zhong. A toast to you.

285
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,510
Cheers.

286
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,080
Cheers.

287
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,120
Young guys like you

288
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,910
have a lot of work-related stress.

289
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,150
Pay attention to your health.

290
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,080
So do you, Ms. Zhong.

291
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,840
OK.

292
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:05,750
Cheers.

293
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,480
Look how elegant Ms. Zhong is.

294
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,440
And look at you.

295
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,630
How flamboyant!

296
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,550
You should check yourself first.

297
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,910
You're still so honey-lipped.

298
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,240
Ms. Zhong, you don't remember me?

299
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,270
I do.

300
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,550
I once bought you a big suitcase.

301
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,630
You look more handsome now.

302
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,440
That's another handsome guy

303
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,750
who keeps checking his phone.

304
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,720
Xu Yanshi,

305
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,150
come over.

306
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,120
What?

307
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,440
You haven't seen Zhong Ling
for a long time.

308
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,550
Now you're distant?

309
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,630
Yeah.

310
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,030
In high school,

311
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,080
you were very close, weren't you?

312
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,030
Really?

313
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,000
Is that true?

314
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,440
Here we meet again, Xu Yanshi.

315
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,200
Is there something between them?

316
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,440
Should we give them some privacy?

317
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,840
Oh, I have something to tell you.

318
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,550
I'm coming back to China.

319
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,790
Coming back?

320
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,200
W...

321
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,360
Why?

322
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,240
My tutor

323
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,960
rejected the high-pay offer

324
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,120
of at least three American companies

325
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,150
of information technology,

326
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,320
but has stayed in China for research.

327
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,000
So, anyway,

328
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,600
I shouldn't disappoint him.

329
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,200
So, I discarded my Green Card

330
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,000
and came back.

331
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,150
Good.

332
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,870
Feng Jun, you did the right thing.

333
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,670
Our country

334
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,600
needs ardent young men like you!

335
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,240
Here, a toast to you.

336
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,200
Come on.

337
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,480
To your patriotism.

338
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,030
OK.

339
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,510
Sorry, guys. I'm late.

340
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,550
- Xiang Yuan.
- Yuan, you're the last.

341
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,960
There you are, pretty.

342
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,150
Sorry, Ms. Zhong.

343
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,790
I'm late.

344
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,030
Glad you came.

345
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,670
I know you have blood sugar,

346
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,630
so I picked a xylitol cake.

347
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,390
Xylitol doesn't contain glucose.

348
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,440
Some crayfish, please.

349
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,270
It doesn't increase blood sugar

350
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,630
or weight gain.

351
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,600
It even prevents dental caries.

352
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,910
It can be a sweetener

353
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,080
for diabetics.

354
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,150
Ms. Zhong,

355
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,270
enjoy it.

356
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,630
You're so considerate.

357
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,240
Eat more.

358
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,840
Take a seat.

359
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,960
- Let's switch seats.
- Look.

360
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,240
What a beautiful cake!

361
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,870
You look better, Ms. Zhong.

362
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,870
Come on.

363
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,480
Ms. Zhong, let's take a group photo.

364
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,390
Let's do it.

365
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,120
Come over. All of you, come.

366
00:12:59,150 --> 00:12:59,870
Come on.

367
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,390
Hurry.

368
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:00,840
Come on.

369
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,320
Where shall we do it? Here, Ms. Zhong.

370
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,550
Feng Jun, where are you going?

371
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,480
Come take the photo.

372
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,630
Come on. Join us.

373
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,440
One, two, three.

374
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,840
One, two, three.

375
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,150
Come on.

376
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,910
Let's do the selfie.

377
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,670
OK.

378
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,320
Come on.

379
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,390
OK. Look at the camera.

380
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,510
Look at the camera.

381
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,600
All of you.

382
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,660
♪I open my heart to you♪

383
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,240
Excuse me.

384
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,120
- Crayfish you ordered.
- OK.

385
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:25,790
Thanks.

386
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:26,670
My pleasure.

387
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,320
Take a few more photos

388
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:27,960
and then we can pick some.

389
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,720
I'll stand here, then.

390
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,480
Let's change positions.

391
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,200
Your face is small enough.

392
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,240
I'll move. You come over.

393
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,200
I closed my eyes in this photo.

394
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,670
Take one more.

395
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,200
This one looks good. What do you think?

396
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,630
One more.

397
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,200
Let's take one more.

398
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,910
This one is good.

399
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,600
One more photo.

400
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,080
Light there is better.

401
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,120
Done.

402
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,030
Come and look.

403
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:43,790
Use my phone.

404
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,670
Take one photo with my phone.

405
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,120
OK?

406
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,440
Come on.

407
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,000
Done.

408
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,630
Take a photo with me.

409
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,080
Ms. Zhong must be tired.

410
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,000
All right, all right.

411
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,720
Back to dinner.

412
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,270
OK.

413
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,000
Let's enjoy the meal first.

414
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,390
Let's eat.

415
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:56,480
OK.

416
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,510
- Xu Yanshi,
- Enjoy the dishes.

417
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,440
do you also like crayfish?

418
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,750
I don't eat crayfish.

419
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,840
Then may I eat...

420
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,670
No.

421
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,360
My wrist just...

422
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,870
You don't eat it

423
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,390
and you don't give it to anyone.

424
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,360
What a waste!

425
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,120
People are encouraged not to waste food.

426
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,790
Don't you know?

427
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,440
Here.

428
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,600
Don't waste it.

429
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,750
No one did this for you before, huh?

430
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,910
So

431
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,600
you're in a relationship?

432
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,270
Who's in a relationship?

433
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,630
Who?

434
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,750
Who's in a relationship?

435
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,750
Feng Jun, who are you talking about?

436
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,750
Xu Yanshi,

437
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,270
did you take me as your friend?

438
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,150
You knew I loved Xiang Yuan

439
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,120
but you still seduced her.

440
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,270
Really?

441
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:04,960
Is that true?

442
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,870
This is so stunning.

443
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,080
How dramatic!

444
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,840
Like a TV play.

445
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,720
Feng Jun pursued Xiang Yuan?

446
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,480
Is Xu Yanshi that kind of guy?

447
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,150
And now

448
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,390
you don't dare to admit it?

449
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,910
Feng Jun, shut up!

450
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,200
- I can admit it.
- It's me...

451
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,840
I pursued Xiang Yuan

452
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,910
and she rejected me twice.

453
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,720
Brave.

454
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,390
A real man.

455
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,480
I thought they were a couple.

456
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,510
- But...
- He's brave.

457
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:27,870
What's all this about?

458
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,150
Umm...

459
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,000
Feng Jun, what did you do?

460
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,510
Why are they leaving?

461
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,030
He must be angry.

462
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,150
Let go of me!

463
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,840
Wake up, will you?

464
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,870
To be with Xu Yanshi,

465
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,320
you'll just watch Donghe go bankrupt.

466
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,030
Is that really necessary?

467
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,360
None of your business!

468
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,840
I have to interfere!

469
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,270
Xu Yanshi,

470
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,790
how does it feel
to have a rich girlfriend?

471
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,440
What did you say?

472
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,510
Stop pretending.

473
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,670
Xiang Yuan loves

474
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,360
your pretended decency, huh?

475
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,720
Answer me.

476
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,510
Do you love

477
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,080
to do nasty things

478
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,000
just like your father?

479
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,320
Feng Jun, are you insane?

480
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,680
Get back home.

481
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,200
What?

482
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,680
Am I wrong?

483
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,400
Besides,

484
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,240
shouldn't you thank me?

485
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,960
Without me,

486
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,200
how could you know her feelings?

487
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,640
However much you humiliate me,

488
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,830
I'm OK.

489
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,440
Over all these years,

490
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,790
I've never complained

491
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,480
about your escaping to a foreign country.

492
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,200
Do you know

493
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,310
why I didn't punch you just now?

494
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,270
In front of that many people,

495
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,960
whatever you said,

496
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,440
she wouldn't talk back.

497
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,440
She would only pretend

498
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,550
she didn't care.

499
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,640
Because she feared I would fight you

500
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,720
and others would laugh at us.

501
00:19:59,440 --> 00:19:59,960
You think

502
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,350
it's her honor

503
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,830
when two men

504
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,750
fight for her in public, huh?

505
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,440
I didn't punch you

506
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,640
because I didn't want her

507
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,440
to be a talking point

508
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,920
for someone like Zhong Ling.

509
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,070
A man like you

510
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:21,920
never knows

511
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,480
how to respect or love someone.

512
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,790
You only love yourself.

513
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,440
Stay in no touch.

514
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,110
And...

515
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,000
Feng Jun,

516
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
the relationship between her and me

517
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,000
is not up to you to decide.

518
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,640
Get to me if you dare.

519
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,680
Don't disturb her

520
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,880
or defame her.

521
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,790
Anyway,

522
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,750
I've been expecting

523
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,030
to tell you this.

524
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,350
Welcome back.

525
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,310
Professor Liang will be happy.

526
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,160

I just had my 27th birthday.

Why 37th?

547
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,680

you can open one.

553
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,030
You're deliberately upsetting

00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,030
my future husband, huh?

555
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,590

651
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,590
to understand what my mother was doing.

652
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:18,110
But to get close to her,

653
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,830
I tried hard to learn

654
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,750

655

659
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,590
And indeed, it was tough.

660
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,200
I'm grateful

661
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,400

on her scientific research,

663
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,550

00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,440

669
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,880
And just because of her persistence

670
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,030

00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,480
to be a research man

677
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,000

678
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,310

679
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,680
and realize

680
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,590
my dream and even my mother's dream,

681
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,070
instead of staying in Donghe

682
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,510
as you're now.

683
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,200
Don't worry.

684
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,480
When you're moving

685
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,240
toward your dream,

686
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,110
I will also

687
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,590
be strong enough

688
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,590
to bear the responsibilities

689
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,200
that I deserve.

690
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,270
But in that case,

691
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,590
- No buts.
- I...

692
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,880
I'm rich, after all.

693
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:52,960
All right.

694
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:53,920
I know.

695
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,480
I'm not rich enough.

696
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,960
But it doesn't matter.

697
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,790
I told Grandpa.

698
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,590
In the worst case,
we'd just file for bankruptcy.

699
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,880
The only problem is...

700
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,000
I can't take a first-class seat

701
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,110
or live in a five-star hotel.

702
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,720
And I can't often go

703
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,400
to upscale places.

704
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,640
Do you still want me?

705
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,640
Sounds pathetic.

706
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,310
Then I have to

707
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,550
think about it.

708
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,830
Now,

709
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,240
I'm used to first-class seats.

710
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,880
I may not like the economy class.

711
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,720
And restrictions to upscale places?

712
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,350
Every week,

713
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,640
I have to play golf,

714
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,720
or I would have that itch.

715
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,680
And unless I live in a suite,

716
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,000
I couldn't fall asleep.

717
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,200
Such bad habits.

718
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,480
Don't be silly, girl.

719
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,000
When have you ever seen me

720
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,350
play golf?

721
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,720
The other day,

722
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,310
what did you do in Grandpa's ward?

723
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,830
I briefed him.

724
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,790
Listen.

725
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:09,680
You must give priority to the Institute.

726
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,880
If you're asked to the interview,

727
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,880
you have to

728
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,030
go take it

729
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:14,680
immediately.

730
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,750
With no delay.

731
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,830
Don't waste even one second in Donghe.

732
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,030
I'll find someone

733
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,510
to take your place instantly.

734
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:24,960
OK.

735
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,310
Take your time. No hurry.

736
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,030
Don't get in with me.

737
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,200

738
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,550
for the interview.

739
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,680
I've been quite busy lately.

740
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,510
When you prepare for the interview,

741
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,160
don't call me or text me,

742
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,200

743
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,590

744
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,960
What?

745
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,880
Got it.

746
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,240

Feibai,

748
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,310
do you need to tell Mr. Situ

749
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,000
about this?

750
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,590
Time is really running out!

751
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,830
When it's Friday,

752
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,680
the repayment day,

753
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,640
and we still have no money,

754
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,550
we'll have to file for bankruptcy!

755
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,110
And by then, our creditors

756
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,440
will come.

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,840
of Donghe.

768
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,510
I want...

769
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:42,960
Right.

770
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,150
Sorry.

771
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,260
(1. Xu Yanshi's interview
2. Tomorrow is Repayment Day.)

772
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:22,550
(Mom,)

773
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,070
(I'm aboard.)

774
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,590
(Don't bother to pick me up.)

775
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,190
(I'll go straight to you.)

776
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:45,500
(Hurricanes in New York
may disturb recent flights.)

777
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:58,100
(1. Xu Yanshi's interview
2. Tomorrow is Repayment Day.)

778
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,070
Let's file for bankruptcy,

779
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,000
Bai.

780
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,030
Will Grandpa blame me?

781
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,590
He won't.

782
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,710
You tried your best.

783
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,980
(President Liu)

784
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,110
Hi, President Liu.

785
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,590
Miss Xiang,

786
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,510
here's the thing.

787
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,190
You applied for a loan

788
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,000
and Jiayi Group

789
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,320
offered to vouch for you.

790
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,360
OK.

791
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,280
What's wrong with you?

792
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,000
Why didn't you tell us

793
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,030
you had such big trouble?

794
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,670
Yeah.

795
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,760
We just returned from abroad

796
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,190
and got to know this.

797
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,110
All right.

798
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,800
Thanks.

799
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,230
Don't say that.

800
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,360
You deserve the money.

801
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,590
What do you mean?

802
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,710
When I started my business,

803
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,800
you gave me five million.

804
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,840
Without telling you,

805
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,190
I converted it into shares.

806
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,480
Over all these years,

807
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,590
it has multiplied.

808
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,190
Quite enough

809
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,590
for the vouching thing.

810
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,510
I really appreciate it.

811
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,800
Gu,

812
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,840
the five hundred million

813
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,440
Donghe needs

814
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,320
can't be filled.

815
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,440
Here's our chance.

816
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,400
Be patient.

817
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,670
Just a matter of time.

818
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,320
By then,

819
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,920
we can take over Donghe

820
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,150
for the right reason.

821
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,550
Gu,

822
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,150
bad news.

823
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,230
Last night,

824
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,070
the company account

825
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,760
received 1.2 billion.

826
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,510
Who transferred it?

827
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,480
Didn't the bank

828
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,800
disapprove our loan?

829
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,440
Jiamian got married!

830
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,920
With Jiang Xiaoman,

831
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,000
daughter of the chairman
of Jiang's Group!

832
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,190
His father-in-law

833
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,920
transferred 500 million
to our company account

834
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,000
that afternoon.

835
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,630
And 100 million dollars

836
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,550
was transferred

837
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,030
just in dollars!

838
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,000
Let me tell you something.

839
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,510
Your 3-minute passion is over?

840
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,110
What are you talking about?

841
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,440
You and Xu Yanshi.

842
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,670
Did you break up?

843
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,630
The 500 million

844
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,960
our company needs!

845
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,630
We got the money.

846
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,150
I knew that.

847
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,760
How did you?

848
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,230
Why did you and your brother

849
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,320
do the same thing?

850
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,590
You sold yourselves

851
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,960
without telling me.

852
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,510
Come on.

853
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,030
When did I

854
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,840
sell myself?

855
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,150
One transfer from Mr. Jiang.

856
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,590
The other from Xu Yanshi's mother
as the bride price.

857
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,800
You got more money than your brother.

858
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,360
Well, in your case,

859
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,440
you at least have the man

860
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,760
you love.

861
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,320
That's fine.

862
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:55,880
But your brother...

863
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,400
It's hard to tell.

864
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,880
Check this.

865
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,960
She said

866
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,280
she gave you the money

867
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,480
(Hello! I'm Isabel.)
as Xu Yanshi's mother.

868
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,760
(Dear Mr. Situ,)

869
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,440
(I'm sorry)

870
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,710
(to communicate with you like this)

871
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,360
(for the first time.)

872
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,710
(I grew up in the US)

873
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,000
(and I can't speak Chinese frequently.)

874
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,190
(Please forgive me.)

875
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,670
(I feel sorry)

876
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,230
(for what)

877
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,920
(your company is going through.)

878
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,880
(If I tell you)

879
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,710
(I feel a little bit happy,)

880
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,510
(will it be)

881
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:46,110
(disrespectful?)

882
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:50,150
(But indeed, it's the first time)

883
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,710
(my son has come to the US for me.)

884
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,670
(I'm happy)

885
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,190
(that he has met a girl)

886
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,000
(he loves.)

887
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:01,190
(I'll entrust you)

888
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,070
(with my son.)

889
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,110
Don't worry.

890
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,190
I will not

891
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,360
sell myself.

892
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,630
Neither will my brother.

893
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,510
Not at this lower price,

894
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,280
right?

895
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:19,880
(Hello.)

896
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,710
(I'm Xiang Yuan,)

897
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,840
(Xu Yanshi's girlfriend.)

898
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,510
(When I knew)

899
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,230
(he went to the US for me,)

900
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,670
(I felt sorry for him.)

901
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,960
(Maybe you don't know this.)

902
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,670
(We were classmates in high school.)

903
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,030
(I once saw him)

904
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,150
(on the phone with you several times.)

905
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,670
(He urged you to hang up.)

906
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,230
(But every time,)

907
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,710
(he didn't put away his phone)

908
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,280
(until you hung up.)

909
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,030
(I totally understood.)

910
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,710
(Because when I was little,)

911
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,230
(my mother wasn't often home, either.)

912
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,920
(I kept asking her,)

913
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,800
("Mom, what are you busy with?")

914
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,190
(She said)

915
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,840
(she was working on the satellite.)

916
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:54,150
(Back then,)

917
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,550
(I asked her innocently)

918
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,670
(whether she could take it back home)

919
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:58,030
(for the research.)

920
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,110
(She didn't answer.)

921
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,360
(I used to think)

922
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,550
(satellite was another home of hers.)

923
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,510
(Later, my father)

924
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,880
(kept quarreling with her.)

925
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:09,440
(Even when my father
forcibly took me away,)

926
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,880
(she didn't look back)

927
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,920
(at me.)

928
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,920
(I guess)

929
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,440
(Xu Yanshi hasn't been to the US)

930
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,760
(over so many years)

931
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,150
(because he wants the same with me.)

932
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,000
(He wants you)

933
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,510
(to come back for him.)

934
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,110
(100 million dollars)

935
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:26,030
(was transferred back to your account.)

936
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,480
(I reject the money)

937
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,360
(because I don't want)

938
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,710
(anything complicated)

939
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,320
(in our love.)

940
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,000
(Anyway,)

941
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,230
(thank you for giving birth to him.)

942
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,070
(If possible,)

943
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:39,760
(I'd like to invite you to China)

944
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,710
(Sent)
(for our wedding.)

945
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:43,760
(China Merchants Bank)
Return the money to Mr. Jiang.

946
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:46,030
We can apologize to him,

947
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,280
but you can't deceive his daughter.

948
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,150
No need.

949
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,480
I'm serious this time.

950
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,920
I really love Xiaoman.

951
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,230
I'm serious.

952
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:05,760
If I don't,

953
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,150
no one can force me.

954
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,150
And Yuan,

955
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:12,110
it's time we should learn to cherish.

956
