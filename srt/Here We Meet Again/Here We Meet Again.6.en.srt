=Episode 6=

29
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,510
An interview.

30
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,200
Why did you

31
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,150
give me the cake?

32
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,480
Guess.

33
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,150
See?

34
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,350
You were like that.

35
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,680
Last question.

36
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,150
Say it.

37
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,470
Is the bonus really split

38
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,960
with 70% for you and 30% for me?

39
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,520
You were very righteous

40
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,000
when you persuaded me,

41
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,430
saying that you would do it
even without money.

42
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,190
Well.

43
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,960
I said so because

44
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,240
you were depressed.

45
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,750
I don't want any.

46
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,400
Just share the money with Qing.

47
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,470
Really?

48
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,280
Why?

49
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,190
Nothing special.

50
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,710
Aren't you short of money?

51
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,000
Gao Leng said

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,310
that you even borrowed 200 yuan from him.

53
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,360
What a blabber.

54
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,150
I just have a bit of a problem

55
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,800
with cash flow.

56
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,560
Got it.

57
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,190
People who are short of money
generally say so.

58
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,460
(Velin)

59
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,560
I didn't expect Xiang Yuan

60
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,840
to be quite capable.

61
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,400
She is pushing

62
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,240
the technical department forward.

63
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,710
How long has Mingxiong's order
been delayed?

64
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,190
They always tell me that the budget
is not enough.

65
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,000
The budget is not enough?

66
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,840
But everything is done now.

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,840
It shows that they didn't
do a good job before.

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,360
It's hard for them.

69
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,680
The success this time

70
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,520
is due to

71
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,080
the upgraded supporting parts.

72
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,680
But it's a technological innovation.

73
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,910
It's not what

74
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,190
we can get everything we want,

75
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:38,840
right?

76
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,400
Fifty percent of the orders

77
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,560
are still pending.

78
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,560
It's just

79
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,960
luck.

80
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,360
Yes.

81
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,800
We should be optimistic.

82
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,860
(Big Prize! Go!)

83
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,710
(Xiang Yuan)
(Xu Yanshi.)

84
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,870
(Have you finished?)

85
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,000
(OK?)

86
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,560
(OK.)

87
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,680
(My idea is to)

88
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,040
(build a big data)

89
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,870
(electric power repair hotspot
prediction system.)

90
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:28,720
Miss Xiang.

91
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,950
What?

92
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,430
Why are you still here?

93
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,750
It's about

94
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,870
the annual launch event.

95
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,070
I just ran into Linda

96
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,950
from the marketing department.

97
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,680
She asked us

98
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,120
to provide a video introduction.

99
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,510
I will contact her.

100
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,070
Gao Leng

101
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,390
still has some work to do.

102
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,510
(Navigation system based on AR technology)
Miss Xiang, are you okay?

103
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,270
Yes.

104
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,480
I'm fine.

105
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,800
Alright.

106
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,000
Then I'm leaving.

107
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,390
Take care.

108
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,950
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

109
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,510
(I feel that)

110
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,360
(Lin Qingqing seems
to have discovered something.)

111
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,870
(I'll come to you later.)

112
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,740
(Okay.)

113
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,950
Come in.

114
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,040
I've had enough.

115
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,390
We can't hide from them anymore.

116
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,510
It's like we're having an affair.

117
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,160
It's more tiring to have an affair.

118
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,870
So you know this by experience?

119
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,750
I thought

120
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,480
Xu Yanshi

121
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,000
is a serious person.

122
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,870
How many unscrupulous things

123
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,390
have you done under the table?

124
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,120
No wonder I've heard gossip

125
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,430
about both of us in the bathroom.

126
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,070
You believe in them?

127
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,240
By the way, I listened to their gossip

128
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,070
about Yongbiao's

129
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,480
latest lame outfit.

130
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,310
Yongbiao actually knows everything.

131
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,120
I found it annoying.

132
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,480
So I recorded

133
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,560
and sent it to Yongbiao

134
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,000
to wake him up.

135
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,510
It can easily offend people.

136
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,390
If it happens again,

137
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,310
don't send it with your mobile phone.

138
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,190
I'm not a fool.

139
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,160
I sent it with Gao Leng's phone.

140
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,160
Don't use his either.

141
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,480
Gao Leng never enters the women's restroom.

142
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,800
As I expected,

143
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,750
Mr. Xu

144
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,270
is sometimes stupid.

145
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,920
You really think I sent it?

146
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,190
I'm here for business.

147
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,600
Let's discuss

148
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,720
the entry topic.

149
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,310
I just thought of a good one.

150
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,510
VR intelligent navigation system.

151
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,120
How is it?

152
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,920
This is in line with our company,

153
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,310
and I see someone wrote this

154
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,270
in the bidding case.

155
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,830
We can't use navigation.

156
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,600
Otherwise, lots of inherent thinking

157
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,040
in design will be told.

158
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,040
We need something different.

159
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,750
What about

160
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,600
an intelligent voice system?

161
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,270
I'll do the voiceover for you.

162
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,120
Calabash Brothers.

163
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,070
Chibi Maruko.

164
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,240
Crayon Shinchan.

165
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,750
Your choice.

166
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,510
Then call me

167
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,870
grandpa first.

168
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,270
You always

169
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,950
molest female colleagues.

170
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,680
They said

171
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,950
that you and Ying Yinyin

172
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,310
watched movies together.

173
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,800
Ying Yinyin also said
she and I were lovers.

174
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,510
Do you believe it?

175
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,510
Well, they didn't

176
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,480
tell that much.

177
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,920
It's true?

178
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,390
You fool.

179
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,600
Are we going to discuss the plan?

180
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,600
This is what I just sorted out.

181
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,220
(Team Leader of Technical Group I)

182
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,390
You are working overtime.

183
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,150
Remember to turn off the lights
when you leave.

184
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,390
You are working so hard.

185
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,200
We can no longer

186
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
stay so late in the company.

187
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,750
If someone from the company

188
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,080
finds out that the two of us

189
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,510
enter the competition in the name of Qing,

190
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,240
it will be very troublesome.

191
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,840
More than that.

192
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,870
We will be in big trouble.

193
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,120
What about my house?

194
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,390
I mean it.

195
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,630
I'll prepare food and drinks.

196
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,790
Ask Qing to come.

197
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,270
The three of us work together.

198
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,120
You don't have to worry about

199
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,440
what I'll do to you.

200
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,200
Okay.

201
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,550
I will tell Qing later.

202
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,030
Seven o'clock tomorrow night.

203
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,360
In view of the fact

204
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,360
that Mr. Xu has been working hard recently,

205
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,910
earning extra money with the competition,

206
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,150
and busy with his own work,

207
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,870
remember not to

208
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,360
leave any of them behind.

209
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,870
I will.

210
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,480
Great.

211
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,840
I am leaving.

212
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,150
What a failed copycat.

213
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,120
No! I don't have time.

214
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,240
(I...)

215
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,060
(Should I get changed?)

216
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:38,540
(I...)

217
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,140
No!

218
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,300
I'm not wearing any accessories.

219
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,420
Takeaway.

220
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,180
I haven't ordered any takeaway.

221
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,860
(Qing)
(Aren't you going to Shanghai tomorrow?)

222
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,060
(You may ask Chen Shan.)

223
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,540
(She has a lot of connections
in Shanghai.)

224
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,980
("Qing" withdrew a message.)

225
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,220
(Sorry, wrong message.)

226
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,820
(You arouse my curiosity,)

227
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,060
(but don't tell me.)

228
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,100
(Xiang Yuan)

229
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,300
(Xu Yanshi)
(It has nothing to do with you.)

230
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,900
(It has nothing to do with me?)

231
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,780
(You two,)

232
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,100
(come over after dinner.)

233
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,660
(So unreasonable and cold.)

234
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,100
Where is Qing?

235
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,460
He has something to do in his store.

236
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,020
He'll be here later.

237
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,860
Will this affect his business?

238
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,860
It should be fine.

239
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,260
Take a seat.

240
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,220
I'll get some fresh air.

241
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,580
I owe you money?

242
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,540
No.

243
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,660
Then why are you looking like this?

244
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,100
Are you blaming me for not

245
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,460
sharing instant noodles with you?

246
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,060
I have a friend who is seriously ill.

247
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,740
A close one?

248
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,580
We just met a month ago.

249
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,100
Your last meeting

250
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,500
was not pleasant?

251
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,460
Is it serious?

252
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,020
He has serious cardiovascular problems

253
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,860
and is currently under observation
in the hospital.

254
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,500
We found

255
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,740
our college professor.

256
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,340
If the situation gets worse,

257
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,300
we can ask him for help.

258
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,660
In a few days, I will ask for leave
to go to Shanghai.

259
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,660
I'll hand over

260
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,700
the project to Qing.

261
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,380
Wait for me to come back.

262
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:00,620
By the way,

263
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,140
my uncle

264
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,060
is a very famous cardiovascular surgeon

265
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,580
in Shanghai.

266
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,900
How about I send you

267
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,460
his contact information later?

268
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,340
I think it's okay

269
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,540
to have him around.

270
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,060
It's hard to get an appointment with him.

271
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,740
Even if you register half a month
in advance,

272
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,340
it may not work.

273
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,660
Don't feel like you owe me anything.

274
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,340
I will help

275
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,420
anyone else in the technical group.

276
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,020
Well.

277
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,260
We are classmates?

278
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,060
Our relationship should be

279
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,340
a little closer than others.

280
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,180
You can think of it as a bribe.

281
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:48,700
Bribe?

282
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,260
I joined the company for another purpose.

283
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,140
What purpose?

284
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,580
Take the place of Yongbiao.

285
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,020
Wish you success.

286
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,780
But

287
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,020
even if you don't bribe me,

288
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,060
I will help you.

289
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,860
After all,

290
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,380
we are classmates.

291
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,460
And we are closer.

292
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:35,700
Hello.

293
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,300
Hello.

294
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,580
Thank you.

295
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,940
Xiang Yuan.

296
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,620
The monthly rent of your house

297
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,700
must be very expensive.

298
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,420
This is my friend's house.

299
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,940
I have no idea.

300
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,140
Since you have such a rich friend,

301
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,580
why do you still work for Xu?

302
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,260
What does your friend do?

303
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,140
Real estate or?

304
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,460
I don't remember.

305
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,300
Let's work.

306
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,660
Xu.

307
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,580
What kind of friend do you think

308
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,260
is so generous

309
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,820
to lend her a house?

310
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,820
Could it be her boyfriend?

311
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,540
She has no boyfriend.

312
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,180
Miss,

313
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,860
you are single?

314
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,540
Are you gonna introduce someone to me?

315
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,940
I certainly can.

316
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,380
I have a couple of friends

317
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,660
who are handsome and rich.

318
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,060
Is there someone more handsome
than him?

319
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,300
No.

320
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,660
But they're definitely richer.

321
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,180
But I just like

322
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,460
handsome and poor men.

323
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,340
No way. No way.

324
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,220
Xu

325
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,900
has never had any girlfriend.

326
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,700
He has no experience.

327
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,900
No, no.

328
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,420
Practice makes perfect.

Are you reading the information
of products on sale?

348
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,140
Ask me if any questions.

349
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,220
I found

350
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,820
that our products

351
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,300
can be installed with dual systems.

352
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,140
However, according to

353
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,660
the later market evaluation

354
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,020
and data analysis,

355
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,100
the utilization rate of Beidou

356
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:45,860
is actually not high.

357
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,460
Then why are we

358
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,220
still cooperating with Beidou?

359
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,900
Beidou is China's positioning system.

360
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,540
GPS

361
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,380
is the US positioning system.

362
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,820
Are we doing it too late?

363
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,460
Or?

364
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,460
No.

365
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,660
Actually, we have always been
working on it.

366
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,220
This year, Beidou Navigation
Satellite System (BDS-3)

367
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,300
set a precedent in the history

368
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,340
of world navigation satellites,

369
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,060
launching 18 satellites

370
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,020
in one go.

371
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,380
It is expected to start providing
global services

372
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,140
by the end of the year.

373
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,460
That you're behind at first

374
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,740
doesn't mean

375
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,660
you'll always be behind.

376
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,620
I finally understand

377
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,900
why you keep working on

378
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,580
navigation technology.

379
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,980
Anything I can help?

380
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,740
Can you write code?

381
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,580
No.

382
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,780
But I can get you a drink.

383
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:42,780
Okay.

384
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,180
Thank you.

385
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,900
I love sparkling beverages.

386
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,540
It's not for you.

387
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:01,940
Okay.

388
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,300
I'll leave you two alone.

389
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,820
I am redundant.

390
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,780
Bye.

391
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,300
After I finish writing the plan,

392
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,220
I will send it to Qing.

393
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,220
Ask Qing to

394
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,260
release a beta version this week.

395
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,540
Then wait for me to
come back from Shanghai.

396
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:26,940
Okay.

397
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,820
There is still a long time to go
before the competition.

398
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,420
Calm down.

399
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,900
During my absence,

400
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,140
keep an eye on it.

401
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:40,500
It just so happens

402
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,980
that Mr. Yang will also be
having a meeting outside.

403
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,060
If you slack off,

404
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,700
believe it or not,

405
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,220
only you and Lin Qingqing

406
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,980
will be left to work in the technical group.

407
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,020
Don't we need to punch time clocks
with fingerprints?

408
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,260
Gao Leng and the others are so lazy.

409
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,100
What do you think?

410
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,620
Who's coming so late?

411
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,820
I'm sorry

412
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:13,980
to come by at this hour.

413
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,100
It's Hao's birthday today.

414
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,980
My friend bought too much cake.

415
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,340
So I brought you some.

416
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,300
Okay.

417
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,260
You have visitors.

418
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,260
Then you should

419
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,220
eat together.

420
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:27,740
Thank you.

421
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,620
Happy birthday to Hao.

422
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,180
Next time if you have a chance,

423
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,020
you can come to

424
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,180
his party.

425
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,020
It's quite interesting.

426
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,100
Sure.

427
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,660
Okay, I will leave you alone.

428
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,420
Sorry to bother you.

429
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:41,940
Thank you.

430
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,380
What happened?

431
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,220
Who is that guy?

432
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,340
Who is Hao?

433
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,380
My neighbor, a single dad.

434
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,780
Hao is his son, okay?

435
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,380
Do you girls

436
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,060
like this kind of

437
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,460
handsome

438
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,860
and rich man?

439
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,740
I am different.

440
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,500
As I just said,

441
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,620
I like those

442
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,380
who are handsome and poor.

443
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,740
Well, do you have

444
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,180
this type of woman

445
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,820
to introduce

446
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,940
to me?

447
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,500
You!

448
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,420
What?

449
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,580
Don't you allow me

450
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,780
to have dreams?

451
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,860
I just

452
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,500
don't want to work hard now

453
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,140
and want money to fall from the sky.

454
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,060
What's wrong with me?

455
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,060
So why don't you be

456
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,340
the turtle in the wishing well?

457
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,500
We've almost finished.

458
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,660
Turn off the computer.

459
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,180
Are you leaving?

460
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,340
Won't you eat the cake?

461
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,140
No.

462
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,620
I'll see you off.

463
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,740
No need.

464
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,580
It's getting dark outside.

465
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,660
It's not safe for you to go out.

466
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,220
We won't get lost.

467
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,100
I will eat a piece of cake.

468
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,420
Stop it.

469
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,740
You may mess up my car.

470
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,100
Xu.

471
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,340
To be honest,

472
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,580
if you were rich,

473
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,340
you would be much more handsome

474
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,580
than that guy just now.

475
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,460
And if you want to make money,

476
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,460
it will be

477
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,740
quite easy.

478
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,580
Have you forgotten

479
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,620
how fast we made money back then?

480
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,900
No need to talk about the past.

481
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,420
I really have no money now.

482
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,780
But Yuan said

483
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,380
that she likes poor guys.

484
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,020
Anyway, I think

485
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,220
you have a chance.

486
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,540
But, Xu,

487
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,140
at our age,

488
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,540
when looking for a girlfriend,

489
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,100
we have to consider

490
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,460
various factors.

491
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,300
Feeling is one thing.

492
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,140
Whether she's a good fit is another.

493
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,140
Chen Shan told me today

494
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,540
that I can leave my job next year.

495
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,180
Really?

496
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,020
Why is she suddenly

497
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,180
willing to let you go free?

498
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,300
Wasn't she determined

499
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,420
not to let you go before?

500
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,820
Your

501
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,020
multi-billion-dollar project

502
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,700
has been completed?

503
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,380
The project has long been stopped.

504
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,020
She said Velin

505
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:42,780
would close next year.

506
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,660
If she doesn't get the tender

507
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,900
by next May,

508
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,660
she will also resign.

509
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,540
Well...

510
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,420
Then you are free.

511
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:52,940
She wants me to work with her

512
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,300
after I leave the company.

513
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,300
What do you think?

514
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,300
No idea.

515
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,100
I have not decided yet.

516
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,380
But, Xu,

517
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,700
I still didn't figure out

518
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,340
who told you

519
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,900
that a real man shouldn't mention his past.

520
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,540
If I were half as good as you

521
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,460
back then,

522
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,660
I would not only

523
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,020
brag to my neighbors,

524
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,540
but also advertise myself on TV.

525
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,100
Why am I so...?

526
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,140
Forget it.

527
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,740
He won the first prize

528
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,380
of the Youyun Cup

529
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,100
National Innovation Competition.

530
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,580
Let me introduce.

531
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,260
His name is Liang Liang.

532
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,500
He is the director

533
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,540
of technology R&D department of Xingheng.

534
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,180
Hello.

535
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,220
Xu.

536
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,220
Do you still have an impression of me?

537
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,860
(Liang Liang)

538
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,660
You are a well-known technical expert

539
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,540
in Xingheng.

540
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,500
The judge

541
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,820
who's been the hardest on the contestants.

542
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,940
How can I forget you, sir?

543
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,220
Alright.

544
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,060
I will get to the point.

545
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,020
I was

546
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,460
deeply impressed

547
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,220
by your advanced ideas

548
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,460
in this competition,

549
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,900
your unique insights into the industry

550
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,900
and your careful observation.

551
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,380
So I asked Professor Liang

552
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,140
to set up the meeting,

553
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,380
hoping to persuade you

554
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,380
to join

555
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,300
our technology R&D department

556
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,980
after graduation.

557
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,900
Xingheng has never

558
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,820
recruited undergraduates.

559
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,260
This way.

560
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,860
I'll walk you to the door.

561
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,380
No need, please stay.

562
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,020
Here.

563
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,260
Let's have a good chat

564
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,780
with Professor Qian

565
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,060
another day.

566
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:51,540
Okay.

567
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,300
Looking forward to your strong support.

568
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,100
Of course.

569
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,180
I hope

570
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,900
there will be more and more talents...

571
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,420
Thank you.

572
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,460
Like Xu.

573
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,260
Okay.

574
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,900
- Waiting for your good news.
- Okay.

575
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,860
It's my own choice.

576
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,540
I have no one to blame.

577
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,700
Besides,

578
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,460
I have never given up

579
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,940
all these years,

580
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,660
and I have been helping the professor.

581
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,300
Really?

582
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,500
You are a genius

583
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,980
in navigation system applications.

584
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,580
How can you work on car navigation

585
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,540
in Velin all the time?

586
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,500
But

587
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,940
what about Yuan?

588
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,580
I don't deny that I have a crush on her.

589
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,900
There's nothing to deny either.

590
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,740
But it's just a crush.

591
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,700
Xu.

592
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,740
That man even

593
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,260
came to her door.

594
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,300
Are you determined to be

595
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,740
a "spare tire" for the rest of your life?

596
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,660
Whatever you think.

597
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,780
I will go to Shanghai tomorrow
to see Gui.

598
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:55,780
I will leave the competition

599
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,820
to you first.

600
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,580
Call me if anything happens.

601
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,460
Don't worry.

602
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,100
Also,

603
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,220
when I'm away,

604
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,740
don't go to her house alone,

605
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,260
even if she invites you there.

606
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,260
Xu.

607
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,860
As a "spare tire",

608
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,620
how can you order me as her boyfriend?

609
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,820
Try me.

610
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,780
Seriously?

611
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,060
Am I so handsome

612
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,700
that you feel a little stressed?

613
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,860
(Insufficient tire pressure)

614
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,180
If you were fatter,

615
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,540
my sense of crisis would be even greater.

616
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,060
I got a flat tire, man.

617
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,700
What does it mean?

618
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,380
The tire pressure of the "spare tire"

619
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,500
is unstable,

620
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,300
and the future is worrying.

621
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,420
Get off the car

622
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,060
and check it for me.

623
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,700
Hello.

624
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,740
Okay, I see.

625
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,460
What happened?

626
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,780
Gui's inspection results came out.

627
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,620
He needs

628
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,500
a total aortic arch replacement surgery,

629
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,780
which is quite risky.

630
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,180
What then?

631
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,100
Would he...?

632
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,260
No worries.

633
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,740
I'll go to Shanghai first.

634
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,820
I have to tell Xiang Yuan

635
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,180
that my trip to Shanghai this time

636
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,580
may take a long time.

637
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,940
During my absence,

638
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,380
you have to keep an eye on it.

639
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,020
Miss Xiang, what have you done?

640
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,820
No wonder

641
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,420
you have good attendance,

642
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,900
though I seldom see you in the office.

643
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,620
Does your formalism

644
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,500
work?

645
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,580
Yes.

646
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,540
I came to talk to your leader.

647
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,060
But I didn't expect to come across this.

648
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,060
Is this how Xu Yanshi

649
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,620
indulges

650
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,700
the technical department?

651
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,020
(Deputy General Manager)

652
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,460
As you can see,

653
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,580
those of the technical department

654
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,860
are so slack.

655
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,540
Is it okay to go on like this?

656
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,420
I told

657
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,980
Xu Yanshi before

658
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,580
that discipline rectification

659
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,460
is a must.

660
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,620
But he always takes sides with you.

661
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,700
And he doesn't want me
to get involved.

662
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,060
Now that

663
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,140
you are here,

664
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,820
I believe

665
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,740
you can make the right choice.

666
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,340
Our department

667
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,020
is indeed undisciplined,

668
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,340
but not lazy.

669
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,660
After all,

670
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,700
their work efficiency is okay.

671
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,140
I'm glad that you know it.

672
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,420
But I still hope

673
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,860
that you can rectify the discipline
as soon as possible.

674
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,220
You have to be tough on them

675
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,300
in order to establish prestige, right?

676
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,220
Otherwise, if you are kind to them

677
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,540
all day long,

678
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,700
they will not

679
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,540
take your orders seriously.

680
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,300
Ms. Li, you are right.

681
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,620
I will implement

682
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,740
the attendance system immediately.

683
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:36,900
Okay.

684
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,420
Announce it at the afternoon meeting.

685
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,660
Remember to call me.

686
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,860
I will be there supporting you.

687
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,820
Thank you, Ms. Li.

688
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,780
I am leaving.

689
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,740
(Hello, Dr. Gu Yan.)

690
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,100
(I am Xu Yanshi,)

691
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,340
(a friend of Xiang Yuan.)

692
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,860
(Please answer the phone)

693
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,100
(or add my WeChat account.)

694
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,980
(Looking forward to your reply.)

695
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,100
(Thank you.)

696
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,060
I heard you had a quarrel

697
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,620
last time you met.

698
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,020
He told you this?

699
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,140
They have seen your depression

700
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,020
in the past few years.

701
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,260
Gui just hopes

702
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,580
that you can go back to Shanghai

703
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,740
to do some business in an upright manner

704
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,740
instead of staying at Velin

705
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,780
like a coward.

706
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,380
Gui and the others feel guilty about you.

707
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,660
In the past few years,
everyone's life has been better,

708
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,860
except for you.

709
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,460
That's why I don't want to see you.

710
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,500
It's boring to see

711
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,260
all of you with sad faces.

712
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,300
Our company

713
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,620
has always had a rule of
going to work at nine in the morning

714
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,300
and leave at six in the afternoon.

715
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,980
Although the attendance
of the technical group

716
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,140
has always been complete,

717
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:01,980
there are indeed some people

718
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,180
who arrive late and leave early.

719
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,980
From now on,

720
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,020
once such cheating

721
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,420
is discovered again,

722
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,420
I will immediately report to
the headquarters

723
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,340
and dismiss that violator.

724
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,340
Did you understand?

725
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,060
Velin's performance

726
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,420
is declining year after year

727
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,020
because of you slobs.

728
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,380
If you don't want to be fired,

729
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,220
just listen to Miss Xiang.

730
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,860
Strictly observe the discipline.

731
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,300
Ms. Li.

732
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,500
You may go to work.

733
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,460
The details are way too complicated.

734
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,900
I can explain to them myself.

735
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,380
Thank you.

736
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,140
It's what I should do.

737
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,580
I counted your workload

738
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,140
over the past few months.

739
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,700
I found that your salary structure

740
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,900
is the basic salary

741
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,700
plus the year-end bonus

742
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,820
determined by the company's performance

743
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,260
in the year.

744
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,860
I don't think such a structure

745
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,260
is suitable for the technical group.

746
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,260
So, in the future,

747
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,380
we will implement

748
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,780
the flexible working hours system.

749
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,380
That is, you don't need
to punch in anymore.

750
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,500
What you have now

751
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,100
is a workload sheet.

752
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,100
You need to fill in

753
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:19,900
the project name,

754
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,940
project leader,

755
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,540
(Workload Sheet)
start time and end time,

756
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,420
et cetera.

757
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,420
If your workload for the year

758
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,020
exceeds the basic amount,

759
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,660
I will apply to the headquarters

760
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,940
for an additional bonus.

761
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,500
Great!

762
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,900
We finally don't have to
work overtime for nothing!

763
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,180
I seem to see

764
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,820
the bonus beckoning to me.

765
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,380
Miss Xiang, I'm going to

766
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,220
do more projects now.

767
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,460
What if I didn't complete

768
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,340
your so-called basic workload?

769
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,100
If your workload of the year

770
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,540
is lower than the basic amount,

771
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,860
not only will there be no bonus,

772
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,100
but I will reduce your basic salary

773
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,500
in the second year

774
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,900
as appropriate.

775
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,260
Poor man.

776
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,900
Why do I feel

777
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,060
that there are no projects

778
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,620
wanting Mr. Li recently?

779
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,100
Can he support himself

780
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,460
on a basic salary?

781
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,460
He didn't study technology
in the first place

782
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,460
and is still a learner.

783
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,180
How can there be a good project
that needs him?

784
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,980
What if

785
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,820
no project comes to me?

786
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,060
You are targeting me on purpose.

787
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,620
That's your problem.

788
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,740
What you should be doing now

789
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,140
is to improve your work attitude

790
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,460
and your performance,

791
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,660
instead of complaining here.

792
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,540
What does the reform of Group II

793
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,060
have to do with Group I?

794
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,500
Just take care of Gao Leng.

795
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,700
You are not qualified to control me.

796
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,340
I forgot to tell you.

797
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,660
Before Xu Yanshi left,

798
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,500
he entrusted me

799
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,140
with full responsibility

800
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,780
for the entire technical group,

801
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,620
including you.

802
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,460
You overestimate yourself.

803
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,060
Miss Xiang.

804
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,700
I was scared.

805
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,460
Why does he always lose his temper

806
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,140
at the company?

807
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:55,980
Exactly.

808
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,260
Does he really think

809
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:57,780
that he is still the young master

810
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,060
who had no worries about everything?

811
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,580
Miss Xiang, are you okay?

812
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,420
Do you need this?

813
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,860
It's done.

814
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,780
Qingqing.

815
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,060
What's the background

816
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,700
of Li Chi?

817
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,900
Li Chi?

818
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:29,020
He used to be a rich second generation.

819
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,460
But I heard

820
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,700
that his father was cheated of
tens of millions

821
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,900
after a joint venture with someone.

822
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,620
Then he went bankrupt.

823
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,580
After his father ran away,

824
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,100
he went out to work.

825
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,980
But he does have

826
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,820
character flaws.

827
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,780
He was spoiled by his family

828
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,820
since he was a child.

829
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,940
Ever since the accident in their family,

830
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:49,900
he felt

831
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,220
that everyone was targeting him.

832
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,100
And he thinks

833
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,820
that your new rules are also targeting him.

834
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,460
That's why he got so angry.

835
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,500
He's right.

836
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,700
I am targeting him.

837
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,260
Miss Xiang, you are so honest.

838
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:08,580
(Intensive Care Unit)

839
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,140
Hurry up.

Dr. Gu Yan?

845
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,620
Professor Liang also contacted him.

846
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,340
If this operation

847
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,620
can be performed by him,

848
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,380
Gui will be fine.

849
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,460
That's him.

850
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:57,740
This is

853
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,740
that will start next.

854
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,620
Excuse me.

855
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,860
You still haven't contacted

856
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,060
Dr. Gu Yan, have you?

857
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,420
His assistant got back to me.

858
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,660
Dr. Gu Yan

859
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,900
is currently on vacation abroad.

860
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,100
Sorry.

861
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,780
I really can't get in touch with him.

862
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:16,940
Thanks.

863
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,260
Thanks.

869
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,460
How is the surgery?

870
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,700
The operation was a success.

871
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:07,700
Watch closely

872
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,740
for the next fifteen days.

873
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,540
Thank you, Dr. Wang.

874
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,780
You are welcome.

875
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,540
I'm not Dr. Wang.

876
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,020
I'm Dr. Gu.

877
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,780
Dr. Gu?

878
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,140
You are Dr. Gu Yan?

he should be fine.

883
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,500
Visit him

884
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,700
according to

885
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:31,820
the relevant requirements.

Go.

888
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,660
Excuse me, sir.

889
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,780
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

890
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,260
I haven't been in touch with you before.

891
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,060
I thought you wouldn't come.

892
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,940
May I ask you something?

893
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,300
My niece...

Yuan.

895
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:50,900
Is it not easy

896
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,100
to discipline her?

897
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,820
It's okay.

898
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,060
So what is the relationship

899
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,460
between two of you two?

900
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:00,140
She said you are her leader.

901
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,780
Sort of.

902
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,300
Good boy.

903
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,740
That girl

904
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,780
has never come to me

905
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,780
for anyone.

906
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,020
This time she not only

907
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:11,900
asked me in person,

908
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,980
but also kept asking me

909
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,420
for you.

910
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,060
Hello.

911
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:38,900
Sorry, sir.

912
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,740
There is a lady Miss Xiang looking for you.

913
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,580
Would you answer it?

914
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,620
Okay.

915
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:44,660
Uncle.

916
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,820
Why is your cell phone
turned off all the time?

917
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,220
Good for you.

918
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,100
You found me

919
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,340
even with my phone turned off.

920
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,260
I can hardly sleep late.

921
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,580
What?

922
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,140
You got into trouble again?

923
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,220
How come?

924
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,140
I just need your favor.

925
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,260
Say it.

926
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:05,020
A friend of my leader is sick.

927
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,020
He's now in your hospital.

928
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,660
I want you to help with the operation.

929
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,420
Leader? Which leader?

930
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:12,300
You are not even afraid
of your grandfather,

931
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,700
but you are afraid of your leader?

932
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,260
He can control me.

933
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,460
It's a life-and-death matter.

934
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,700
Tell me if you will save him.

935
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,380
Okay, let's do this.

936
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:20,900
After I finish my vacation,

937
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:22,580
I will arrange for someone

938
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,260
to operate on the friend of your leader.

939
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:26,300
That will be too late.

940
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,580
He is now in a serious condition

941
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,060
and will have surgery this afternoon.

942
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:29,860
I've booked you

943
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,540
a first-class flight back
at eleven o'clock.

944
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,820
First-class.

945
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,740
My lady.

946
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,700
It is eight o'clock.

947
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,220
And it's my first day here.

948
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,980
You have time to pack up.

949
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,660
It's my first day here!

950
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,220
Which is more important,
life or vacation?

951
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:50,580
Do you know how tired a doctor is?

952
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,100
This is my first vacation

953
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,740
in five years.

954
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,660
For the first time in five years,

955
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,340
(Oath of medical students)
I can sleep in.

956
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,580
Have you forgotten

957
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,500
the medical student oath you took

958
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,660
when you entered school?

959
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:05,380
What do you mean?

960
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,060
When I step into

961
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,780
the sacred medical school,

962
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:15,060
I solemnly swear.

963
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,900
I volunteer to devote myself to medicine,

964
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,980
love the motherland,
be loyal to the people,

965
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:21,540
abide by medical ethics,
respect teachers and discipline,

966
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,700
study hard, work tirelessly,

967
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:26,100
strive for excellence,
and develop comprehensively.

968
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,940
I am determined to do my best

969
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,260
to eliminate man's suffering,

970
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,780
to enhance man's health conditions,

971
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:33,460
and to uphold the holiness and honor
of the medical profession.

972
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,620
I'll save lives and help the injured,

973
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:37,180
to pursue with perseverance.

974
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,300
I'll strive for

975
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,940
the development of medicine
and health care in our country

976
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,620
and for the physical and mental health
of human beings

977
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,500
for the rest of my life.

978
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:44,060
Alright.

979
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,460
Stop. Stop.

980
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:45,980
Okay.

981
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,140
Which is more important now,

982
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,420
to save a life or to take a vacation?

983
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,060
Okay.

984
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,180
I got it.

985
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:56,860
I've never seen her

986
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,180
so verbose.

987
00:44:58,780 --> 00:44:59,780
Look at her.

988
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:01,620
Thank you, Dr. Gu.
