00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,480
This is a celebration.

193
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,240
Lighten up the mood.
Have some beer.

194
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,510
Let's have some beer.

195
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Excuse me, beer, please.

196
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,960
Sorry, guys. I'm late.

197
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,360
Miss Xiang, where have you been?

198
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,960
Come on. Sit here.

199
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,320
You finally came.

200
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,200
Take a seat and enjoy the food.

201
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,910
Miss Xiang,

202
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,000
we miss you so much.

203
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,360
Come on. Pass it over.

204
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,390
Here.

205
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,910
Miss Xiang, this is for you.

206
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,840
Miss Xiang,

207
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,270
you've been missing for days.

208
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,390
Where have you been?

209
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,080
What could she do?

210
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,630
She went to Shanghai

211
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,510
and redressed the injustice
for your Boss.

212
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,450
What?

213
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,270
Didn't the investigation team

214
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,630
come to a conclusion?

215
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,270
If it weren't for Miss Xiang,

216
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,080
how could he leave with dignity?

217
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
Where is he going?

218
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,440
Didn't he tell you?

219
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,440
Are you quitting?

220
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,030
Do you all know?

221
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,120
When did it happen?

222
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,910
I just submitted my resignation.

223
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,480
So, were you going to

224
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,510
tell me about this?

225
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,200
Boss,

226
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,510
it's good for you to quit.

227
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,390
Why do you have to
stay in the lame company?

228
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,150
To tell you the truth,

229
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,360
I wish all you guys will leave.

230
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,550
If Boss wasn't here,

231
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,840
I would leave long ago.

232
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,270
Gao Leng is right.

233
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,550
There are serious problems

234
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,910
with our company,

235
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,600
such as employee welfare

236
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,720
and leadership factions.

237
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,550
If Boss is leaving,

238
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,080
I want to leave, too.

239
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,080
I agree.

240
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,480
Take annual leave for example.

241
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,750
They never approved my leave.

242
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,480
Exactly.

243
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,840
They ask us to work overtime
whenever they want,

244
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,390
but when it comes to overtime pay,

245
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,150
we have to submit

246
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,960
various proofs.

247
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,630
Boss,

248
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,670
why don't you take me with you?

249
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,270
Enough.

250
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,600
Anyone else?

251
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,120
Anyone else wants to

252
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,960
go with your Boss?

253
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,550
Speak out.

254
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,080
I won't stop any of you.

255
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,150
No, Miss Xiang,

256
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,080
we just...

257
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,790
Velin isn't

258
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,750
what they say.

259
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,360
Don't push yourself...

260
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,150
Haven't you resigned?

261
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,440
Stop giving me advice.

262
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,030
Let me tell all of you,

263
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,510
nobody's leave can
stop Velin from developing.

264
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,550
But as long as I'm here,

265
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,120
I won't treat anyone of you

266
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,000
unfairly.

267
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,750
Miss Xiang.

268
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,360
Xiang, Xiang...

269
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,750
Boss.

270
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,150
Look at you.

271
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,790
I'm not cold.

272
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,360
When did you decide to leave?

273
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,790
When I was in Shanghai.

274
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,240
So the other day,

275
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,320
when you asked me to go back first,

276
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,120
did you go to deal with this?

277
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,320
Then I should

278
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,480
congratulate you

279
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,960
on rising quickly,

280
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,150
realizing your ambition,

281
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,270
having a bright future,

282
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,200
and gaining wealth in Shanghai.

283
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,670
Are you saying goodbye?

284
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,030
Or what?

285
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,360
Xu Yanshi, if you want to leave,

286
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,720
you should tell me openly.

287
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,240
You needn't hide it from me.

are we really together?

382
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,720
Do you have to ask?

383
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,830
Will you kiss

384
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,200
an ordinary friend in this way?

385
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,510
Don't drink so much again.

386
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,640
Xiang Yuan,

387
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,400
people change.

388
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,960
I may not

389
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,590
be the same man

390
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,070
you used to know.

391
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,480
I know.

392
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,000
But comparatively speaking,

393
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,400
I prefer what you are now.

394
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,920
Be confident.

395
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:53,790
OK.

396
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,030
I've been in Xi'an for a long time,

397
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,400
but it's the first time

398
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,830
I've felt warm in the room.

399
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,030
Only warm?

400
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,200
Stop it.

401
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,000
So,

402
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,310
how many were there before me?

403
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,070
What do you mean?

404
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:32,830
Didn't you

405
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,070
date Chen Shan

406
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,240
when you started to work?

407
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,160
Who told you?

408
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,200
I saw the photo of you two in a hotel.

409
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,480
We were at an annual party
held by the company.

410
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,550
Chen Shan was drunk

411
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,480
and almost fell.

412
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,680
I helped her.

413
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,680
I'm not lying.

414
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:56,960
But the gossip

415
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,640
seemed to have been

416
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,480
spread around for a long time.

417
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,110
Why didn't you explain?

418
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,480
Of course I explained.

419
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,310
Then why weren't you
willing to meet me

420
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,640
when we were at college?

421
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,030
Alright. Alright.

422
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,550
Then why didn't you tell me?

423
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,590
I had too many concerns

424
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,350
at that time.

425
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,030
So the girl you said that

426
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:40,960
wasn't in the same world as you

427
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,750
was me?

428
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,350
Who else could she be?

429
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,070
Actually, in Shanghai,

430
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,160
when I considered resigning,

431
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,270
I did think that

432
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,160
you were right to refuse me.

433
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,880
It was meaningless

434
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,070
for us to put things off.

435
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,550
We might let it go as well.

436
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,310
But every time when I see

437
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,550
the look in your eyes,

438
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,750
I'm not reconciled to it.

439
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,160
I think I can make you happy.

440
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:25,960
Really?

441
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,480
Can I?

442
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,750
Since we've decided to be together,

443
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,830
I must make it clear in advance.

444
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,640
Go ahead.

445
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,920
Even though you have me now,

446
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,880
I won't ask you to change your life

447
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,640
just because you have to

448
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,550
consider my feelings.

449
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,880
I have no problems

450
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,920
with other men

451
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,160
except those

452
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:58,920
who chase you.

453
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,680
So,

454
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,160
you'd better

455
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,640
keep a distance from them.

456
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,480
As for other men, I don't care.

457
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,000
Have I got

458
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,350
such a good boyfriend?

459
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,550
And also,

460
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,070
a man shouldn't let his woman

461
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,720
help him keep up appearances.

462
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,350
You should

463
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,270
be yourself.

464
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,510
Buy whatever bags you like.

465
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,000
Wear high heels as you like.

466
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:35,880
Don't take off your "heels"

467
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,160
just because you don't want to

468
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,160
hurt my self-esteem.

469
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,350
I know a couple should

470
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,830
mutually make compromises.

471
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,440
But when you're with me,

472
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,790
just be yourself.

Latte?

490
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,480
Double milk, no ice.

491
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,480
Your treat.

492
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,310
Did you hear the howls of the guys

493
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,270
from the technical department

494
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,240
last night?

495
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,720
I think everyone in the building
heard them.

496
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,750
Isn't it because Xu Yanshi

497
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,790
was going to leave?

498
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,110
I assume

499
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,350
he was forced to leave

500
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,270
after the investigation.

501
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,070
Exactly.

502
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Mr. Xu,

503
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,160
morning.

504
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,160
Did you stay up late yesterday?

505
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,590
Don't you know

506
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,640
where I was last night?

507
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,200
What would you like?

508
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,030
An iced Americano.

509
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,350
A latte. Double milk. No ice.

510
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:41,880
Thanks.

511
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,830
Though it's the last week
for you to work here,

512
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,000
as your leader,

513
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,400
I must remind you

514
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,310
of finishing your last shift well.

515
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,400
I'll go to your office

516
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,400
and check your work plan.

517
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,000
We're running out of time.

518
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,270
OK, Miss Xiang.

519
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,440
Actually, I don't

520
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,830
recommend you to quit.

521
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:01,720
After all, we can pay you

522
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,270
an annual salary of two million yuan

523
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,400
as they offer you.

524
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,270
Two million yuan?

525
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,590
If you're not satisfied,

526
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,000
we can offer you some
performance shares.

527
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,200
After all,

528
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,880
we have a great

529
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,960
corporate culture.

530
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,110
Our colleagues

531
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:16,240
usually buy coffee in groups.

532
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,200
Would you consider it again?

533
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,110
Do you think it's real?

534
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,310
I don't.

535
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,310
Everyone saw that

536
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,550
he was investigated.

537
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,720
Don't believe her.

538
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,350
It's impossible.

539
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,510
Keep your voice down.

540
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,110
He is

541
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,160
here.

542
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,750
Forget it.

543
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,640
When you get time,

544
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,480
remember to come back
and buy us coffee.

545
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,400
But forget about Ying Yinyin

546
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,480
and the other two,

547
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,200
or they'll say...

548
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:41,590
It's me.

549
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,720
That you're squeezed out

550
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,720
by me.

551
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,680
Don't you think so?

552
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,160
You...

553
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,030
No. No. No.

554
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:49,880
No. No.

555
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,070
Thanks.

556
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:51,440
Miss Princess.

557
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,200
Calm down.

558
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,160
Even Ms. Li dare not provoke her.

559
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,680
Don't make trouble.

560
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,480
Let it go. Let it go.

561
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,310
Thanks.

562
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,110
If I were you,

563
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,790
I would come earlier.

564
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,830
It feels bad to drink

565
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,790
what people have left over.

566
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,070
And don't gossip next time

567
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,510
when you're in line.

568
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,110
Otherwise,

569
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,480
when someone jumps the queue,

570
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,200
how can you reason with them?

571
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,680
What do you say, Mr. Xu?

572
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,270
How can you jump the queue?

573
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,510
Didn't you see me?

574
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,480
I can't provoke them.

575
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,480
But I can deal with you.

576
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,160
Your look almost pierces a hole in me.

577
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,590
Really?

578
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,030
Then let me see

579
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,000
where the hole is.

580
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,440
We're in the company. Stop it.

581
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,030
Petty guy.

582
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,310
See you later.

583
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,660
(Monday Cute buns)

584
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,270
It's too bad. Too bad.

585
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,480
Too bad.

586
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,750
I repeated it.

587
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,750
What should I do?

588
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,160
I noticed

589
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,240
that the breakfast I made today

590
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,240
was the same as three days ago.

591
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,350
Don't freak out so easily.

592
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,680
It's just breakfast.

593
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,440
I eat congee every morning

594
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,960
for almost 20 years.

595
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,640
It's normal.

596
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,720
It's different.

597
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,960
I made it for Chen Shu.

598
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,590
I plan to make her breakfast

599
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,680
for 100 successive days

600
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,720
non-repeatedly

601
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,200
to show her my sincerity.

602
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,880
100 days?

603
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,310
Are there

604
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,510
enough ingredients in the world?

605
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,400
Probably.

606
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,750
I recommend

607
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,750
this food processer.

608
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:58,750
It'll definitely help you.

609
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,200
We can use a groupon,

610
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,640
and get a big discount.

611
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,440
Come on.

612
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,070
I remember you told me

613
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,270
about it last year.

614
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,640
Haven't you got it yet?

615
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:07,830
Forget it.

616
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,480
I have no time.

617
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,280
I plan to go to the grocery,

618
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,360
buy some ingredients,

619
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,760
and make her another breakfast.

620
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:15,960
Do you think I should

621
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,070
apologize to her?

622
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,840
After all, I'm late
to deliver the breakfast.

623
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,590
Are you kidding me?

624
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,070
You've made her breakfast for days.

625
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,190
Has she ever tried it?

626
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,960
She'll try it eventually.

627
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,440
You're practically harassing her.

628
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,710
Moreover,

629
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,000
what will you do after 100 days?

630
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,440
What do you mean?

631
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,280
100 days later,

632
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,960
if Chen Shu still ignores you,

633
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,710
what will you do?

634
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,030
Will you make her

635
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,150
non-repetitive lunches

636
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,190
and suppers

637
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,030
for another 100 days?

638
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,110
Your words sound reasonable.

639
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,190
Why didn't I come up with that?

640
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,800
Yes! Yes!

641
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,440
Don't tell Chen Shu

642
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,630
it's my idea.

643
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,030
I'm afraid she'll hit me.

644
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,480
Suppers and lunches for 100 days.

645
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,480
Boss.

646
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:08,880
This is for you.

647
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,590
Didn't Chen Shu accept it?

648
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:13,880
Don't give me heartache

649
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,110
early in the morning, OK?

650
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:15,630
Your resignation

651
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,960
has already upset me.

652
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,190
Boss,

653
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,440
you're entitled to a long annual leave.

654
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,590
Don't you take it before leaving?

655
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,280
No.

656
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,920
I want to spend more time with you.

657
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:26,760
Thanks.

658
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,880
Don't you think

659
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,030
Boss has changed?

660
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,230
Yeah.

661
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,110
Joy puts heart into a man.

662
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,320
He's so happy after quit

663
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,800
like he's in love.

664
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,440
Files.

665
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,070
Well...

666
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,510
Gao Leng,

667
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,480
let me help you.

668
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:07,840
OK.

669
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,710
Is it because of your Boss?

670
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,840
You'd better talk with You Zhi.

671
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:24,960
I think

672
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,550
he can't get your resignation

673
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,630
off his mind.

674
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,190
Let me finish

675
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,110
my work at hand first.

676
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,400
Boss's resignation

677
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,710
seems to be a huge blow to You Zhi.

678
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:51,880
Morning.

679
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,110
Morning.

680
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,630
Do you want a food processer?

681
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,800
We can use a groupon.

682
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,630
- The price is good.
- No.

683
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,480
Ask the people upstairs.

684
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,070
I'm not interested.

685
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,670
Are you not going to

686
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,400
make our relationship public?

687
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,000
Why?

688
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,670
Do you want to make it public?

689
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,480
I have nothing to fear.

690
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,190
How about this,

691
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,360
Gao Leng and these guys are outside.

692
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,550
You go and tell them

693
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,800
I'm your boyfriend.

694
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,710
I'm not afraid to tell them.

695
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,440
(Grandpa hates Xu Yanshi so much.)

696
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,150
(What if someone)

697
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,000
(embroiders the truth to him?)

698
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,190
Well...

699
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,280
Don't hesitate.

700
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,000
You'd better emphasize to them

701
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,670
that I'm your last boyfriend.

702
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,320
Don't dare me.

703
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,480
You know

704
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,440
my grandpa...

705
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:01,670
No.

706
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,840
What should I know?

707
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,510
Your grandpa has arranged

708
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,510
your marriage
when you were little,

709
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,670
or you actually have

710
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,360
a fiancé that

711
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,670
you've never met?

712
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,030
Your imagination

713
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,190
has a standard pattern,

714
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,670
like your face.

715
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,760
I'm worried that

716
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,190
people's gossips

717
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,630
will affect you.

718
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:23,640
Yes.

719
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,400
This is indeed

720
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,760
not a good time.

721
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,800
It's better to save trouble.

722
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,070
Anyway, I...

723
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,150
I know you don't care.

724
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,960
But I don't want to

725
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,280
give them any chance
to gossip about you.

726
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:44,880
I heard it.

727
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:50,280
Miss Xiang

728
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,590
tries to stop Boss from leaving

729
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,070
regardless of her own dignity.

730
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,150
Look,

731
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,480
she even sinks to her knees.

732
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,000
Indeed.

733
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,280
Do you think

734
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,440
we should do something

735
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,510
for our Boss?

736
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,920
What about this food processer?

737
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:05,670
Let's buy a food processer

738
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,190
for our Boss.

739
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:24,550
Shall I give you

740
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:25,800
a big red pocket?

741
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:28,030
Consider it new year money
in return for your kowtow to me.

742
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,110
Stop it.

743
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,760
What's this?

744
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,670
100 Ways to Get On

745
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,920
with Your Beloved.

746
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,940
(100 Ways to Get On with Your Beloved)
What does this mean?

747
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,960
Explain to me.

748
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,920
Gao Leng!

749
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,110
Group meeting, now!

750
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,880
Mr. Xu,

751
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:05,000
you've submitted your resignation.

752
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,440
But you still have to
work for another week.

753
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,150
Your work plan

754
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,030
is too perfunctory.

755
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,400
Redo it.

756
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,400
OK.

757
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,280
Boss seems to be determined

758
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,400
to quit this time.

759
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,150
Miss Xiang couldn't change his mind

760
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,000
even by kneeling to him.

761
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,230
Now she's retaliating against him.

762
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,960
Boss is miserable.

763
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,230
What's this?

764
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,550
Take a look.

765
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,070
This is a list of my clients

766
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:44,880
in the last few years.

767
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,070
The circled ones

768
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,320
are those I have connections with

769
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,190
and I think are trustworthy

770
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,760
and helpful to you.

771
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,280
I'll spare a few days

772
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,760
to take you to visit them

773
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,590
this week.

774
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,280
If you can no longer carry on,

775
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,070
come to me anytime.

776
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,230
I'll support you.

777
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,230

why you're here for so long?

784
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,840
I told them that

785
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,880
I would deal with the handover

786
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,000

You should go now.

796
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,480
I'm almost done.

797
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,840
I've finally got a chance

798
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,590
to spend some time alone with you.

799
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,400
Then stay.

800
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:56,960
Boss,

801
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,000
I'm here to help you.

802
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:57,920
Boss,

803
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,150
I know

804
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:00,230
you must be moved now.

805
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,360
But

806
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,630
men don't cry easily.

807
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,440
You mustn't cry

808
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,550
behind my back.

809
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,360
You don't want that, right?

810
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:09,190
I...

811
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:09,920
Let go.

812
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,400
I'll take this.

813
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,710
You're here to steal his stuff.

814
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,400
No.

815
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,400
I'm worried that
he can't take so much stuff

816
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,230
with him.

817
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:28,480
Nice.

818
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:34,070
Wasn't it taken

819
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:36,280
when You Zhi started to
work in the company?

820
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:41,030
But Gao Leng,

821
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:42,880
your hair seems...

822
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:46,150
Never mind. It's OK.

823
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,710
(Velin)
Am I getting bald?

824
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,760
I don't believe it.

825
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:54,880
You're almost bald.

826
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:56,710
Oh?

827
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:57,710
Seriously?

828
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:13,590
Boss,

829
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:17,000
may I...

830
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:23,440
OK.

831
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:24,710
Keep it.

832
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:31,070
Are we cool now?

833
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,590
Do you think I leave
because I'm deeply wronged?

834
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:39,800
You quit at such a

835
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,760
crucial moment.

836
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:43,000
Everyone feels that way.

837
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:44,400
It isn't a sudden decision.

838
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:45,880
Kaisheng is eager to

839
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,840
launch a new project.

840
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:50,280
Are you going to

841
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:52,070
stop me from

842
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:53,110
making a fortune?

843
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,670
That's not what I mean.

844
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:58,400
I know.

847
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,000
Boss was so young back then.

848
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,400
And handsome.

849
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,070
He's still handsome now.

850
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,190
But soon,

851
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:37,880
we won't be able to see him.

852
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:40,440
