29
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,400
Where is she?

30
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,150
She seems to have gone
to meet Huang Qiming.

31
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,310
Huang Qiming?

32
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,070
Yeah.

33
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,510
He kept hanging up on her

34
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,200
today.

35
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,870
I assume she has gone to Mingxiong

36
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,870
to intercept him directly.

37
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,310
Boss,

38
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,150
I'm leaving then.

39
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,780
(Xiang Yuan)

40
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,680
(Where are you?)

41
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,180
(Xu Yanshi: Where are you?)

42
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,940
(Xiang Yuan: Baixiangfang Restaurant.)

43
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,560
I think

44
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,000
you're much smarter than Xu Yanshi.

45
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,120
I mean it.

46
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,240
A wise man submits to circumstances.

47
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,470
I didn't mean to make it hard for you.

48
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,750
The market for vehicle navigation

49
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,470
is sluggish now. You know?

50
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,000
You need to survive.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,800
So do we.

52
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,120
Moreover,

53
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,190
your products

54
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,280
have a limited market.

55
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,630
I cut your order.

56
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,520
Isn't that OK?

57
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,080
It's OK. It's OK.

58
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,750
This girl is not only beautiful,

59
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,240
but also smart.

60
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,430
If only Xu Yanshi

61
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,470
could be half as smart as you,

62
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,240
he would go much farther

63
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,030
than as a team leader.

64
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,590
He is

65
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,120
too lofty.

66
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,520
He thinks

67
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,080
everyone should beg him.

68
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,630
That team leader

69
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,360
is indeed tough to deal with.

70
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,240
I've been in the company

71
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,430
for about one month,

72
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,240
but I have barely said

73
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,240
ten words

74
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,520
with him.

75
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,430
Everyone can see that

76
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,590
you're a reasonable man,

77
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,520
Mr. Huang.

78
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,430
You are so sweet.

79
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,280
Tell me.

80
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,840
How did you find out

81
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,240
that I was, you know,

82
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,080
a reasonable man?

83
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,430
Have the dishes. Come on.

84
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,720
Only Liang Qin

85
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,830
favors Xu Yanshi.

86
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,190
He really thinks of himself
as something,

87
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:28,950
and the whole world

88
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,480
should beg him like a dog.

89
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,630
Xiang,

90
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,390
it is unfair for you.

91
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,720
You work for

92
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,870
such a loser.

93
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,070
It's unfair to you.

94
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,680
Come. Come here.

95
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:49,680
Come closer.

96
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,390
If I had a daughter like you,

97
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,270
I wouldn't allow you

98
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,120
to work for him.

99
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,430
Xu Yanshi is good at drinking.

100
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,270
How about I find a chance one day

101
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,560
and let him show you?

102
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,800
He can't do it.

103
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,800
How do you know?

104
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,190
Tell me.

105
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,040
Why can't he?

106
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,000
He isn't good at anything.

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,630
Xu Yanshi is a loser.

108
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,800
Come to me directly

109
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,040
if you have any problem.

110
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,780
(Haishixuan)

111
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,310
He can't do it.

112
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,390
How do you know?

113
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,600
Tell me.

114
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,680
Why can't he?

115
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,630
He isn't good at anything.

116
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,190
Xu Yanshi is a loser.

117
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,240
Come to me directly

118
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,680
if you have any problem.

119
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,310
We have a deal then.

120
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,750
Three days.

121
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,680
We'll offer you

122
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,560
a satisfactory answer.

123
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,950
Three days.

124
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,680
We want products

125
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,360
that meet performance requirements.

126
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,160
If you can do it,

127
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,600
I'll order

128
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,830
another fifty percent of goods.

129
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,190
Rest assured.

130
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,510
We won't let you down.

131
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,600
OK.

132
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,510
Don't let me down.

133
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,360
Goodbye, Mr. Huang.

134
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,390
Let's go. I'll give you a ride.

135
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,630
No.

136
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,870
Come on. Sister.

137
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,720
Huang Qiming has no daughter.

138
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,040
I'm his only son.

139
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,920
Why do you drive me then?

140
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,430
Then you should thank me.

141
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,310
Bye.

142
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,220
(Xiang Yuan
Xu Yanshi: Be careful on your way home)

143
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,480
(Be careful on your way home.)

144
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,480
Zhang Jun.

145
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,600
Where is he?

146
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,320
Ying Yinyin just called him out.

147
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,000
Why did she look for him?

148
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,120
I don't know.

149
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,750
It seems to be

150
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,480
because of videos.

151
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,440
(What videos?)

152
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,870
(Could it be...)

153
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,870
Yinyin told me that

154
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,790
she invited Xu Yanshi

155
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,390
to go to movies
when she just came here.

156
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,320
He can only deceive newcomers.

157
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,320
Old colleagues like us

158
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,720
all know his dirty laundry.

159
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
Yes.

160
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,080
What?

161
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,550
Did someone

162
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,080
shoot private videos about you?

163
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,080
Were you

164
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,550
with Ying Yinyin before?

165
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,750
Did she keep the evidence?

166
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,750
Share with me.

167
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,960
Let me watch it.

168
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,200
Do you really want to watch it?

169
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,480
(Xu Yanshi is good at drinking.)

170
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,910
(He can't do it.)

171
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,480
(He can't?)

172
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,390
(Tell me.)

173
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,720
(Why can't he?)

174
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,390
Huang Qiming has promised me.

175
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,550
If we get the chips
that meet his requirements

176
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,150
in three days,

177
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:01,960
he will order

178
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,720
another fifty percent of goods.

179
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,750
We can't.

180
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,000
Forget it.

181
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,120
Why?

182
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,870
Didn't you say I can't do it?

183
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,120
But...

184
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,120
Don't you

185
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:13,840
want to

186
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,480
prove

187
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,440
yourself?

188
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,240
It's immoral

189
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,590
to shoot such secret videos.

190
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,630
Shooting these secret videos is immoral.

191
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,310
Don't see these afterwards.

192
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,080
To get the products

193
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,390
that meet the requirements,

194
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,150
Fengyu's chips are required.

195
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,720
But Fengyu has

196
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,910
long-term cooperation
with Huang Qiming.

197
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,240
Do you think

198
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,960
they will let us make a profit

199
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,360
as middlemen?

200
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,960
I believe

201
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,360
there are alternatives.

202
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,390
Don't waste your time.

203
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,600
I suggest

204
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,670
you find

205
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,320
another job

206
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,080
that suits you.

207
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,670
Do you want me to resign again?

208
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,600
I won't leave.

209
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,030
I am passing by. See this.

210
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,910
Why do you always argue with her?

211
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,750
Can't you tolerate her a little bit?

212
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,200
I also want to know

213
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,910
why I always argue with her.

214
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,550
What's going on?

215
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,080
Feels like

216
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,360
the two refrigerators in our company

217
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,670
are generating electricity.

218
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,630
You're right.

219
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,600
Did they bicker?

220
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,550
I think so.

221
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,600
Sign it.

222
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,960
I'm going.

223
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,600
I feel warm again.

224
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,000
Thanks.

225
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,840
Send me the files.

226
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,200
And

227
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,550
tell others

228
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,480
to work overtime.

229
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,270
I know you can do it.

230
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,270
Work overtime! Work overtime!

231
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,360

239
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,390
We worked overtime so late.

240
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,870
I didn't get enough sleep

241
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,150
and you get me out so early.

242
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,390
I don't even know where we're going.

243
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,240
To see someone.

244
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,240
What's so curious?

245
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,750
To see your parents?

246
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,870
I'm only afraid to meet a boy's parents.

247
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,480
Looks like

248
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,720
a boy has taken you to his parents.

249
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,030
No. OK?

250
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,080
Are we here

251
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,080
to see Xingheng's people?

252
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,910
The director of Xingheng's
R&D Department,

253
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,030
Liang Liang.

254
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,240
How did you know him?

255
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,120
At the school job fair
before I graduated,

256
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,120
he was the examiner of Xingheng.

257
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,910
We met during the interview.

258
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,510
Then we keep in touch.

259
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,630
Did you join Xingheng after graduation?

260
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,320
No.

261
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,120
I've been in Velin.

262
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:28,910
(Looks like a top student)

263
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,440
(also fails sometimes.)

264
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:37,550
Mr. Liang.

265
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,480
It's hard to meet you.

266
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,630
(Xingheng Technology)

267
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,670
Mr. Liang, nice to meet you.

268
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,080
This is Xiang Yuan,

269
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,630
the team leader of Technical Group II.

270
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,030
Hello, Mr. Liang.

271
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,000
Hello.

272
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,030
Sit.

273
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,390
Why did you come to me suddenly?

274
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,120
Do you run into trouble?

275
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,030
We do need your help this time.

276
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,480
We produced

277
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,630
some signal-processing modules

278
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,240
and got some problems.

279
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,750
Mingxiong asked us

280
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,630
to find up-to-standard accessories

281
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,320
in three days.

282
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,790
But our budget is not enough.

283
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,910
Several days?

284
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:17,870
That's how Huang Qiming

285
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,270
makes things difficult for others.

286
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,030
I have some new ideas.

287
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,150
Mr. Liang, please look.

288
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,440
I've upgraded the system.

289
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,240
If the existing chips

290
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,870
are combined with its chips,

291
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,120
the size and power consumption

292
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,390
will be reduced,

293
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,120
and it'll be

294
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,120
one and only in the market.

295
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,120
Let me take a look.

296
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,750
♪It's the day we do happy things♪

297
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,290
♪Ready today♪

298
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,150
Awesome.

299
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,120
It can be patented.

300
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,670
This way,

301
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,270
even Level-B chips

302
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,630
can meet Level-A standards.

303
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,510
Your cost

304
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,870
will be greatly reduced.

305
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,030
You are good

306
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,910
to have such an excellent idea.

307
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,200
Awesome.

308
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,870
On the one hand, I'm still thinking

309
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,670
if this idea is feasible.

310
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,840
All our employees

311
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,320
are working overtime

312
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,240
in the test and experiments.

313
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,670
On the other hand,

314
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,390
we do need

315
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,200
some new parts.

316
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,030
But Huang Qiming

317
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,440
only gave us three days.

318
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,630
So, I'm wondering

319
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,960
if you can go to

320
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,870
part suppliers in person

321
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,270
and talk about

322
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,120
additional orders.

323
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,960
To be frank,

324
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,510
I'm an outsider.

325
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,030
If I go to part suppliers

326
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,960
and humbly ask for urgent orders,

327
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,670
is that appropriate?

328
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,320
It's inappropriate indeed.

329
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,150
You're honest.

330
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,320
I like that.

331
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,480
If I can do anything to help,

332
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,960
be sure to tell me.

333
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,480
I can't go

334
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,030
for an outsider.

335
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,670
But Yanshi,

336
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,000
what if you are not an outsider?

337
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,480
Mr. Liang, you know

338
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,910
I can't

339
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,910
resign from Velin this year.

340
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,030
Not to resign.

341
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,480
I mean

342
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,350
your contract will terminate next year.

343
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,640
Then work for me as a free man.

344
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,640
How is it?

345
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,590
(So Xingheng wants him.)

346
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,310
(Many scientific talents)

347
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,880
(wish to come,)

348
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,160
(yet Xu Yanshi is hesitating.)

349
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,510
Rest assured, Yanshi.

350
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,200
I am

351
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,960
not like Chen Shan of Donghe Group.

352
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,720
I won't hinder your freedom.

353
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,160
(Does Chen Shan from the headquarters)

354
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,880
(hinder his freedom?)

355
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,590
(Was he)

356
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,440
(cheated)

357
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,720
(by Donghe Group?)

358
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,720
OK.

359
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,720
You don't have to say yes now.

360
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,110
But

361
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,550
I'd like to show my sincerity.

362
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,790
I'll go with you
to talk with part suppliers

363
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,000
about the urgent order.

364
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

365
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,310
Come on.

366
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,920
Let me see it.

367
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,310
How will you

368
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,880
implement it?

369
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:18,160
Night snacks!

370
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,440
- Night snacks! Night snacks!
- Go! Go! Go!

371
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,960
Thank you, Miss Xiang.

372
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,480
I thought you were slacking.

373
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,270
So

374
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,550
you went to buy snacks for us.

375
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,200
Sit here.

376
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,240
Chopsticks.

377
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,550
This is my favorite.

378
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,400
Boss is not here.

379
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,400
Finally I can eat something not spicy.

380
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,030
Yeah.

381
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:38,480
Boss is

382
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,720
a quiet man,

383
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,680
but he orders spicy food each time.

384
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,550
I can't even bear to see it.

385
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,680
Do you notice it?

386
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,960
Boss rarely

387
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,920
wears red,

388
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,590
yellow or green clothes.

389
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,830
Is there any special connection?

390
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,550
Yes.

391
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,720
That proves Boss is

392
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:54,920
cold outside but passionate inside.

393
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,640
You have so many topics about him.

394
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,640
He physically

395
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,830
went to Luocheng,

396
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,200
but his spirit
is still here with us in Velin.

397
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,440
Only Boss can

398
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,680
handle such a complicated problem

399
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,030
in such a short time,

400
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,270
quickly and well.

401
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,070
Yeah.

402
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,920
Boss has been in good spirits lately.

403
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,440
He's been kind of excited.

404
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,030
He's under the control of someone.

405
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,750
Am I in a fan club

406
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,000
of Xu Yanshi

407
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,590
or something?

408
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,550
How is your food?

409
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,920
- Try it.
- Here. Try it.

410
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:31,640
Meat for you.

411
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,480
Thanks. Thanks.

412
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:33,920
Is it tasty?

413
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,550
Thanks.

414
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,680
My noodles have lumped.

415
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,270
You Zhi, the files.

416
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,310
Miss Xiang. The files you wanted.

417
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,200
You look

418
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,070
kind of haggard

419
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,640
because of working overtime.

420
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,550
Too tired maybe.

421
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:03,960
Go back to work.

422
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,680
OK.

423
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,640
Hello.

424
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,880
It's settled.

425
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,030
I'll be right back.

426
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,880
Take care.

427
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,480
(No. My face.)

428
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:44,030
Is that my illusion?

429
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,070
Why is Boss's face on the plant

430
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,030
at the door?

431
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,790
I am back.

432
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,240
Thanks for your work, guys.

433
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,480
Boss.

434
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,640
Boss.

435
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,680
I'm so sleepy.

436
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,480
You're back.

437
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,110
What's going on?

438
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,030
You looked so bad just now.

439
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,070
Beauty. Who are you?

440
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,030
What's wrong?

441
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,030

I've informed Yongbiao.

469
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,000
Have a good sleep tomorrow morning.

470
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,590
Thanks.

471
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,720
(What?)

472
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,750
(What is he doing?)

473
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,200

(suddenly.)

476
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,070
(I even had no time to fix the makeup.)

477
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,830
Looks like I worried too much.

478
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,350
About what?

479
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,160
Velin is not a good company

480
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,440
for personal development.

481
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,400
So, are you worried

482
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,440
about my future?

483
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,350
I'm worried about your passion.

484
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,680
You did worry too much.

485
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,720
You know I lack no passion

486
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,310
since childhood.

487
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,830
If you think Velin isn't a good company

488
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,270
for personal development,

489
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:00,960
why don't you resign

490
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,510
and leave the department to me?

491
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,070
I'll manage it for you.

492
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,750
You haven't changed a bit,

493
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,510
bold

494
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,720
and audacious.

495
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,200
Why are you so confident?

496
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,240
Because of you.

497
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,920
Be honest.

498
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,310
If you don't want me

499
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,480
to be your colleague,

500
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,510
then you can leave the department

501
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:22,680
to me.

502
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,310
After all, the department still

503
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,920
runs well without you,

504
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,240
doesn't it?

505
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,240
It's you who doesn't want me

506
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,310
to be your colleague.

507
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,720
The same to you.

508
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,740
(Your credit card bill is overdue.
Please pay immediately.)

509
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,350
(The arrears are 199,990.00 yuan.)
199,990?

510
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,720
Oh, right.

511
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,790
I bought a bag after the business trip.

512
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,660
(Total asset: 7.82)

513
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,160
I am really

514
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,550
down and out

515
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,350
now.

516
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,260
(Post it to the community.)

517
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,310
(Sale)

518
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,720
(to pay the credit card bill.)

519
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,880
(Genuine.)

520
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,750
(Go to hell if it is fake.)

521
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:03,430
(Check it at the counter. Do you dare?)

522
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,400
(Of course.)

523
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,400
(But a tip for you.)

524
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,270
(No counter)

525
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,750
(is willing to)

526
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,110
(check its genuineness.)

527
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,680
(The check of counters)

528
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,920
(is just a stunt.)

529
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,720
(I have all the certificates.)

530
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,590
(No invoice.)

531
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,200
(Buy it if you believe.)

532
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,830
(Or don't waste time meeting.)

533
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,400
Hey.

534
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,400
This...

535
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,240
This is a secret between us.

536
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,200
Don't tell anyone about it.

537
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,720
It's out of production,

538
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,200
so I bought it.

539
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,000
I never buy second-hand things.

540
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,510
Rest assured.

541
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,680
I'm tight-lipped.

542
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,750
I believe you for now.

543
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,680
Qi. Jessica.

544
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,790
Look what I've bought.

545
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,400
Yinyin. This bag!

546
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,680
This bag!

547
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,510
How did you buy this bag?

548
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,240
This bag...

549
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,550
It suits you so well.

550
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,400
Does it?

551
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,440
It's like a princess's bag, right?

552
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,110
It's beautiful.

553
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,200
I've never seen this bag

554
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,240
in the counter.

555
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,590
I guess only VIPs

556
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,960
can buy it.

557
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,550
Not ordinary VIPS.

558
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,880
Only

559
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,440
super VIPs.

560
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,480
This bag is

561
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,030
a limited version.

562
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,030
Very rare.

563
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,350
You can't buy one
even if you have money.

564
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,030
Only for noble guests.

565
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,340
(Personal consumption account)

566
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:07,260
(Old Man Situ)

567
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,070
(Grandpa.)

568
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,110
(Please do me a favor.)

569
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,000
Qingqing.

570
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,720
Did you see my moments

571
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,680
yesterday?

572
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,310
Which one?

573
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,000
The one I forwarded.

574
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,550
Look.

575
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,480
Didn't you like it?

576
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,440
The one Boss forwarded?

577
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,620

579
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,340
(Team Leader of Technical Group I)

580
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,640
There ain't no such thing

581
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,110
as a free lunch.

582
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,270
Mr. Xu, are you thirsty?

583
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:58,960
Look.

584
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,590
Coffee especially for you.

585
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:02,590
It's warm.

586
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,550
Perfect temperature.

587
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,110
Your favorite Americano.

588
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,350
No sugar or milk.

589
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,960
What's the matter?

590
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,720
Well...

591
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,550
I'm just caring about you.

592
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,310
Are you so kind?

593
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,550
Say it.

594
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,400
Do you need my help?

595
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,510
I saw

596
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,200
the information

597
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,880
you posted

598
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,400
about an innovation competition.

599
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,400
Then it was deleted.

600
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,350
What?

601
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,590
I...

602
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,680
I want to participate in it.

603
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,350
You?

604
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,830
How?

605
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,750
In the name of the company, OK?

606
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,720
The reason?

607
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,640
To do what I can
for the technical development

608
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,160
of our company.

609
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:05,480
To be an aspiring youth.

610
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,830
To be ambitious.

611
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,160
Go all out

612
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,030
for the course.

613
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,310
I'd rather believe

614
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,160
it's for the prize.

615
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:15,680
Yes.

616
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,110
Are you interested?

617
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,070
Or we can

618
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,510
split the prize half and half.

619
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,310
70 to 30 split?

620
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,400
I'm a nice person.

621
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,310
Or just

622
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,350
tens of thousands.

623
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,640
Just tens of thousands.

624
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,240
The rest is yours. How is it?

625
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:36,680
I have no interest.

626
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,640
Please. Mr. Xu.

627
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,310
You can surely

628
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:41,920
win the prize

629
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,720
if you participate in it.

630
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,030
Right?

631
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:45,480
I'm sure you can.

632
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:48,920
Or just

633
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,200
give me several team members.

634
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,350
The technicians.

635
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,350
You posted it.

636
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:55,240
That means you want to participate.

637
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,270
I'm not purely

638
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:00,030
going for the prize.

639
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,000
You know,

640
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,590
going with you...

641
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,030
with you guys...

642
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,350
This is

643
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:09,790
already

644
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:10,920
a rare chance.

645
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,880
We can learn

646
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,790
from the competition.

647
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,750
No one

648
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,400
is born a winner.

649
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,240
There must be failures.

650
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,350
Failure is the mother of success.

651
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:17,920
Right?

652
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,110
You hoped that

653
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,830
all my wishes could come true.

654
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,110
This is my biggest wish

655
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,720
recently.

656
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:39,720
It's already very difficult for Success.

657
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,510
Can't it have another mother?

658
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,270
Yanshi.

659
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,880
I saw your post

660
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,240
about Xingheng Cup Beidou+Innovation
and Entrepreneurship Competition.

661
00:33:58,790 --> 00:33:59,920
Will you participate in it?

662
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,920
Please get to the point.

663
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,240
You participated for three years

664
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,920
and all failed.

665
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,710
Haven't you given up?

666
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,440
Actually,

667
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:13,920
Yanshi,

668
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,760
the problem is not with you.

669
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:16,880
I know.

670
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,550
Yes. You know everything.

671
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,760
It's your company.

672
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,550
The whole industry bets that

673
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,480
Velin will close down next year

674
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,030
and exit the navigation market.

675
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:31,000
No investors are willing to

676
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,360
invest or vote for your company.

677
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,880
You've lost

678
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,550
most of your partners, right?

679
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,710
Participating in it

680
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,670
will only make your company

681
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,110
a joke in the industry.

682
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,150
Sorry.

683
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,630
I can't help you.

684
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,230
Go. Go. Go. Come on.

685
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,190
Boss.

686
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,070
How can you do this?

687
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:11,760
Right?

688
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,550
Let us do it.

689
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,590
Boss.

690
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,320
We make coffee for you.

691
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,800
You should answer our questions.

692
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,670
Say it.

693
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,360
Boss.

694
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:27,320
Was Xiang really your classmate?

695
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,800
How was she like back then?

696
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,710
Which aspect?

697
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,670
All aspects, of course.

698
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,920
Students now

699
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,960
develop

700
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,000
in an all-round way.

701
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
For example, how was her study?

702
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,960
She was average in study.

703
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,110
Did she have a boyfriend?

704
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,190
Boyfriend...

705
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,320
I don't know.

706
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,510
Maybe she did.

707
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,550
Was her family wealthy?

708
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,590
She even borrowed 200 yuan

709
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,360
from Gao Leng. Right?

710
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,550
200 yuan?

711
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,400
Yes.

712
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,920
You Zhi teased her

713
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,000
to buy the screenshot

714
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
you withdrew

715
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,030
with 200 yuan.

716
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,400
She believed

717
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,960
and borrowed money from Gao Leng.

718
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,760
Did Gao Leng lend it?

719
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,360
No, Gao Leng didn't have money.

720
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,320
But they said

721
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,710
she asked Shu then.

722
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,760
Shu lent it.

723
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,800
But Xiang Yuan didn't want
the money then.

724
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,400
I don't know

725
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,320
what she was

726
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,670
thinking about.

727
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,510
I don't know much

728
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,760
about her family.

729
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,280
Did you have a crush on her

730
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,150
on campus?

731
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,670
You're so boring.

732
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:27,880
Have you finished asking?

733
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,630
Go back to write the data.

734
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,360
Go. Go. Go.

735
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,800
Is she so poor?

736
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,800
Miss Xiang. We're getting off work.

737
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,480
Goodbye.

738
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,590
Goodbye. Goodbye.

739
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,510
Goodbye. Miss Xiang.

740
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,000
Goodbye. You Zhi.

741
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,280
Wait for me.

742
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,400
I'm waiting at the door.

743
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,630
Be sure to wait.

744
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,110
Don't leave after work.

745
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,440
I'll take you to a place.

746
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,630
No.

747
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:14,030
Just say yes.

748
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,550

00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,880
You seem to

773
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,000
be familiar with Santa Claus.

774
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,900
(This man is very fierce)

775
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,620
(Computer repair)

776
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,190
(Naked hunk)
Christmas gifts.

777
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,630
Here. Yours.

778
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,070
And

779
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,400
yours too.

780
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,760
Go and wash them.

781
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,030
What brings you here?

782
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,590
Come.

783
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,800
Beauty. Have some water.

784
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:44,880
Thanks.

785
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,320
Wang Qingyi.

786
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:48,400
Xiang Yuan.

787
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,320
I am that...

788
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,630
Xingheng Cup Beidou+Innovation and
Entrepreneurship Competition.

789
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,150
Qing, we'll participate

790
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,550
in your name.

791
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,550
We'll come out with the program.

792
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,150
Do you agree to participate?

793
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,630
You said no before.

794
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,760
You said

795
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,960
you'd never participate, didn't you?

796
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,670
You two split the prize.

797
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,030
Why don't you want the prize?

798
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,920
Split by company then.

799
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,960
Don't take advantage of Qing.

800
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,000
We need a lot of help

801
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,550
from him later.

802
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,480
How to split between us?

803
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,030
Thirty to you. Seventy to me.

804
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:27,760
Alright.

805
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,000
I will participate,

806
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,000
but I won't take the prize.

807
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,110
It's all yours.

808
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,150
I'm asking you for help.

809
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:35,630
You deserve it.

810
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,760
Next week,

811
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,230
we'll discuss the plan together.

812
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,030
You need to prepare in advance.

813
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:41,920
OK.

814
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,030
Will we really participate?

815
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,070
Isn't this a private business?

816
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:02,840
And you know,

817
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,510
if people in the company find it,

818
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,960
won't they tell on us?

819
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,630
We'll be

820
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,230
doomed then.

821
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,800
Will you participate or not?

822
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,920
Yes.

823
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,440
That's it.

824
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,320
I'll let Qing

825
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,150
be careful.

826
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:19,510
About this,

827
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,360
you can't tell Gao Leng, Lin Qingqing,

828
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,360
Li Chi, and You Zhi.

829
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,320
None of them should know it.

830
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,710
People in the company will gossip.

831
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,880
Be careful.

832
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,510
I'm not a fool.

833
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,230
How did you get the idea

834
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,920
to participate in Qing's name?

835
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,000
You want all your wishes

836
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,190
to come true, right?

837
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,000
You wanted cakes at eight o'clock,

838
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,150
but wouldn't eat

839
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,320
at nine o'clock.

840
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,000
Maybe you won't participate

841
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,440
in the next competition.

842
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,440
Can you read minds?

843
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,230
I just regret that

844
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,630
I bought the cake at eight o'clock.

845
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,400
I'm so hungry.

846
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,840
I want to eat Mizhilin's cake.

847
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:59,960
What can you do?

848
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,480
The doorman won't let you go out.

849
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,670
I know the doorman very well.

850
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:08,480
But the next class is given

851
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,400
by the dean Mrs. Wang.

852
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,000
You haven't finished the test papers.

853
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,360
She has kept an eye on you
for a long time.

854
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,960
If today you get caught again,

855
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,070
you're dead.

856
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,480
Why does a woman make things hard
for another woman?

857
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:28,000
Everyone.

858
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,670
The college entrance exam
will be in 500 days.

859
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,630
Do you think

860
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,920
it's 500 years?

861
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,590
Even Bai Suzhen
[*Character of Legend of the White Snake]

862
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,480
is about to meet Xu Xian,
[*Character of Legend of the White Snake]

863
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,440
yet you haven't studied literature well.

864
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,400
We're humans, not demons.

865
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,320
Be quiet.

866
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,630
Are you already hungry?

867
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,190
Dismissed.

868
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,500
(Literature)

869
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,700
(To Xiang Yuan)

870
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,670
Xiang Yuan.

871
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:05,110
Someone gave you the cake.

872
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,000
Mizhilin.

873
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:10,230
Xiang Yuan.

874
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,880
What you said came true!

875
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,230
I want five million yuan.

876
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,070
Wish me

877
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:16,360
to be wealthy.

878
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:18,360
Well...

879
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,510
There is no name of the sender.

880
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,840
It should be a boy in our class

881
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,280
who cares about you.

882
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,550
Let my radar scan

883
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:28,710
to see

884
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,190
if anyone is caring about you.

885
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,480
Bei.

886
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,070
Is this from you?

887
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,510
No.

888
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,230
Forget it. Forget it.

889
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,880
I was lectured by Mrs. Wang.

890
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,110
I have no appetite for it.

891
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,190
You can eat it.

892
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:56,320
It's really delicious.

893
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:57,840
Are you sure you won't take a bite?

894
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:00,670
I wanted the cake at eight o'clock,

895
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:01,630
but it came at nine.

896
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:02,590
Now I don't want it.

897
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:04,440
You are so demanding.

898
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,760
Xu Yanshi.

899
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:19,670
Was the cake from you?

900
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,760
Or what?

901
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:22,710
Why didn't you write your name?

902
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:24,190
I thought it was from someone else.

903
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:27,510
It was the cake you wanted.

904
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,480
Does the sender matter?

905
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:32,320
Of course.

906
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,590
If I had known it was from you,

907
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:35,150
I wouldn't have given it
to my deskmate.

908
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,280
An interview.

909
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:43,920
Why did you

910
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,920
give me the cake?
