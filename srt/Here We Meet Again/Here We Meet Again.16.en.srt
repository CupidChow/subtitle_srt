29
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,870
Did you use the jammer

30
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,120
when it was our team's turn?

31
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,200
What do you mean?

32
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,480
What jammer?

33
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,680
Isn't it in your pocket?

34
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,630
It's really you.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,470
I apologize to you, okay?

36
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,960
Sorry.

37
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,030
So...

38
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,470
You get to where you are today

39
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,400
in foreign countries for so many years

40
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,560
relying on this?

41
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,470
Are you holding me accountable?

42
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,750
Where is Xu Yanshi?

43
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,150
And also ask Qing over.

44
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,840
Hold a tripartite trial.

45
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,910
I will apologize to you, okay?

46
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,470
You take yourself so seriously.

47
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,240
You are nothing

48
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,080
to them.

49
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,000
It is impossible for them to

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
treat you as an opponent.

51
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,520
When you were in college,

52
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,870
you hacked into a company

53
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,710
and almost went to jail.

54
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,240
But they wanted

55
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,030
Xu Yanshi,

56
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,680
and made Xu Yanshi
take the blame for you.

57
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,710
Even little kids know

58
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,280
that the one
who can't take care of himself

59
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,240
should wear a diaper

60
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,520
all the time.

61
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,910
Why do you let others

62
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,360
take care of you all the time?

63
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,030
You are always like this.

64
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,680
After you have hurt others recklessly,

65
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,360
you just make an apology

66
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,190
that is insincere
and even slandering others.

67
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,120
Why should others accept it

68
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,030
despite being disgusted?

69
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,800
Do you think

70
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,120
that everyone has to give in to you

71
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,840
and put up with you?

72
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,430
Xu Yanshi told you all about it, right?

73
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,030
What else did he say?

74
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,910
I thought he is noble.

75
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,190
Now he learned sadfishing.

76
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,710
He is so unlucky.

77
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,150
But he never complained.

78
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,360
How could he say these things to me?

79
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,520
Whatever.

80
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,240
Xiang Yuan.

81
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,000
We grew up together.

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,280
We are childhood friends.

83
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,710
Are you going to turn against me
because of him?

84
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,120
Childhood friends?

85
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,400
What's this?

86
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,240
Mr. Feng.

87
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,520
Now that we have reached this point,

88
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,710
will you

89
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,430
go to the organizing committee yourself

90
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,240
or me?

91
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,800
I know that

92
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,870
you've been persisting in your old ways.

93
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,030
You are sure that

94
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:02,910
even if Xu Yanshi knew that

95
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,750
you had done such a thing,

96
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,400
he would not go to
the organizing committee to expose you.

97
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,680
But don't forget that

98
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,030
I will.

99
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,710
Xiang Yuan.

100
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,000
This competition

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,360
is very important to me.

102
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,950
What about this?

103
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,920
Regardless of the result

104
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,830
of the competition,

105
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,160
I will share half of the award money
with you.

106
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,950
Did you meet me on the first day?

107
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,360
Do you think I care about money?

108
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,310
Stay away from

109
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,950
Xu Yanshi.

110
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,160
Where have you been?

111
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,510
Where is Qing?

112
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,510
He couldn't wait and just left.

113
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,720
What?

114
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,270
I remembered that

115
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,630
you had taken a lot of blame
for us back then.

116
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:26,920
What?

117
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,430
You finally remember that?

118
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,240
So where have you been?

119
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,680
I was with Feng Jun.

120
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,180
Okay.

121
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,480
Don't worry.

122
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,870
I will cover you from now on.

123
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,070
Were you a cover
in your previous life?

124
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,720
Let's go home.

125
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:16,950
(Old Man Situ)
(Where are you?)

126
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,240
(Why don't you answer the phone?)

127
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,680
Who's this?

128
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,070
Listen.

129
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,800
We can't be found out

130
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,870
about our private work.

131
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:24,630
Let's go.

132
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,700
(Xingheng Cup Beidou+Innovation
and Entrepreneurship Competition)

133
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,630
Miss Xiang.

134
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,240
Let's go.

135
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,750
Hello, chairman.

136
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,680
Hello, chairman.

137
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,680
Miss Xiang, you just

138
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,240
finished the competition?

139
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,430
Chairman.

140
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,750
Actually, the competition...

141
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,560
Don't you want to say something,
Miss Xiang?

142
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,510
Chairman.

143
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,270
Mr. Xu and I

144
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,560
came here today

145
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,870
to inspect and learn
from the competition.

146
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,000
Since Donghe wants to achieve excellence,

147
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,830
we need

148
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,630
a deep understanding of Xingheng,

149
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,600
the industry leader.

150
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,560
After all, we have to know both ourselves

151
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,950
and our adversaries.

152
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,000
Xu Yanshi.

153
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,240
When I was selecting the person

154
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,240
to take Yang's place,

155
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,160
someone mentioned you to me.

156
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,240
They said you are capable.

157
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,720
It's a pity that

158
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,310
you are still an employee of Class B
until now.

159
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,120
I wanted to

160
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,870
inspect you.

161
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,870
I didn't expect to meet you

162
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,240
to participate in Xingheng's competition

163
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,160
behind our company's back today.

164
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,390
Chairman.

165
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,480
Mr. Xu and I

166
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,190
really came to

167
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,390
inspect and study today.

168
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,560
For you.

169
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,830
For the development

170
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,390
of Donghe Group.

171
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,000
It is also for the words

172
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,830
of Mr. Lu Xun

173
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,750
that where there is light,

174
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,000
there is heat.

175
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,390
For the youth of our country,

176
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,390
with passion

177
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,390
and love,

178
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,600
we will continue

179
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,430
to move forward.

180
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,480
Save it. Let's go.

181
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,270
Miss Xiang.

182
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,270
I want to have a private chat
with you.

183
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,720
What is the relationship

184
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,560
between you and Xu Yanshi now?

185
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,480
Ordinary relationship.

186
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,480
It's a ready answer, right?

187
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,960
Ordinary relationship...

188
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,790
I don't think it's ordinary.

189
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,630
You kept mentioning him

190
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,080
the last time you called me.

191
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,080
Today you went out

192
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,750
alone with him.

193
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,670
Not alone.

194
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,360
I have to tell you.

195
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,720
We didn't come out alone.

196
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,480
There were other colleagues together.

197
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,720
And...

198
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,840
Well.

199
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,120
I mainly want to keep talents

200
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,790
for our company.

201
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,480
Keep talents?

202
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,320
And then he will be

203
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,240
your boyfriend.

204
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,960
No way.

205
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,670
Why not?

206
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,390
It better be.

207
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,120
Let's go home.

208
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,910
You should go home first.

209
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,080
I have something to do later.

210
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,840
Where are you going?

211
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,440
Please let me go.

212
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,440
I really have something to do.

213
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,480
Could Xu Yanshi

214
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,790
let you go?

215
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,240
I'm leaving.

216
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,510
Come back.

217
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,080
Listen.

218
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,270
I've met so many people.

219
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,720
I know what's going on

220
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,750
in that kid's mind.

221
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,840
It's normal.

222
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,000
Please understand.

223
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,510
After all,

224
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,630
your granddaughter is so excellent.

225
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,270
Your grandma is even better.

226
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,150
Look.

227
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,270
I really have something to do.

228
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,270
May I leave now?

229
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,240
Listen.

230
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,120
Keep your distance from him.

231
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,720
Or I'll transfer you
back to the headquarters.

232
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,320
Let's see.

233
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,360
Alright.

234
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,440
Deal.

235
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,320
Okay.

236
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,510
Bye.

237
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,840
I will pay the bill. Don't worry.

238
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,390
What are you nervous about?

239
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,750
Did the chairman embarrass you

240
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,840
about the competition?

241
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,960
No.

242
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,550
I said we were there for inspection.

243
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,440
So it's fine.

244
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,840
Are you worried about me?

245
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,840
Stop talking. Eat.

246
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,000
What are you doing?

247
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,480
Eat now.

248
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,750
You still have to study later.

249
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,030
Here.

250
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,480
Eat some fish

251
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,910
to replenish your brain.

252
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,390
There is a problem

253
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,440
with your previous code.

254
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,870
The spelling here is wrong.

255
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,000
And here.

256
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,080
You can invoke this function.

257
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,030
Also this method

258
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,120
lacks a return type.

259
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,670
This parameter is wrong.

(The meal is in the refrigerator.)

301
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,390
When you meet

302
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,630
someone,

303
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,440
you just have this feeling

304
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,480
that it's him.

305
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,320
I had that feeling

306
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,270
when I first met Yi Shi.

307
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,480
But it happened too fast.

308
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,960
Do you know him well?

309
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,790
Quite well.

310
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,390
I also know

311
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,150
that he had

312
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,270
two exes.

313
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,480
And?

314
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,440
It doesn't matter.

315
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,360
What I like

316
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,790
is the person

317
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:26,550
who is with me right now,

318
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,200
not his past.

319
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,440
When you

320
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,000
truly care about someone,

321
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,720
all you can think about

322
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,840
is the future with him,

323
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,790
not what he did before.

324
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,500
(Received salary of RMB 15,000)

325
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,360
The joy of a worker.

326
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,200
Okay, thank you.

327
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,550
Cheers.

328
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,120
Opus One.

329
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,030
The king of the wine of America.

330
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,910
I wanted you to try it

331
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,840
when we were at Well.

332
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,960
No need.

333
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,550
I have no interest.

334
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,150
How much is your annual salary now?

335
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,320
Do you know

336
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,360
how much income

337
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,150
Well makes in a year?

338
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,440
I know you always think that

339
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,870
the grass is greener on the other side.

340
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,510
But you have no idea

341
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,550
of China now.

342
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,600
Xu Yanshi.

343
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,720
Don't always act as if

344
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,120
you don't want anything.

345
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,670
You don't care about money.

346
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,080
What about Xiang Yuan?

347
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,270
I just want to tell you

348
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,080
that you and Xiang Yuan

349
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,480
have completely different values.

350
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,600
With your current conditions,

351
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,870
what can you give her?

352
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,790
I admit

353
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,750
that you are more talented

354
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,630
and handsome than me.

355
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,440
But with our current conditions,

356
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,550
do you think

357
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,000
a girl

358
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,390
will choose you?

359
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,870
Okay, even if she chooses you,

360
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,320
will she regret it

361
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,670
ten years later?

362
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,510
A good look and personality

363
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,720
can't buy anything.

364
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,120
Ten years later,

365
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,360
will she regret

366
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,150
not choosing me back then?

367
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,480
Maybe I really can't give her

368
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,630
the life she wants.

369
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,270
Maybe she really will regret it.

370
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,910
But she won't choose you either.

371
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,640
Are you planning to

372
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,240
settle in my house?

373
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,350
I think we deserve a good meal

374
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,160
after the competition.

375
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,440
So I bought some seafood

376
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,920
to treat ourselves.

377
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,880
The recipe says

378
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,920
the oven is a must.

379
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,640
So I bought it.

380
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,680
And I also have to buy the rest

381
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,110
of the matching pots and pans.

382
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,070
Leave me alone.

383
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,510
The meal will be ready soon.

384
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,550
You said you have no money
to stay in a hotel.

385
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,160
How could you buy so many things?

386
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,640
Today is a happy payday

the candlelight dinner with me

or my instant noodles?

417
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,510
I'm afraid the instant noodles
are too salty.

418
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,750
You think too much.

419
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,960
It's sweet.

420
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,830
Take your time. Don't choke yourself.

00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,640
(I admit)

422
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,200
(that you are more talented)

423
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,680
(and handsome than me.)

424
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,030
(But with our current conditions,)

425
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,200

426
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,440

(will choose you?)

428
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,400
(A good look and personality)

429
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,680
(can't buy anything.)

430
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:00,960
(Ten years later,)

431
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,350
(will she regret)

432
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,030
(not choosing me back then?)

433
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,350
Yanshi, you are heading out?

434
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,750
Hurry up.

435
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,480
Morning.

436
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,110
Xiang Yuan.

437
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,510
Didn't you two

438
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,960
sleep last night?

439
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,960
Why are you so sleepy?

440
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,550
Don't talk too much in the morning.

441
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,830
You always bully honest people.

442
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,240
What date is your ticket
rescheduled to?

443
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,920
Won't you go back with us?

444
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:13,880
I have other things to do

445
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,110
in Shanghai.

446
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,960
Alright.

447
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,000
Go.

448
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,440
There will be traffic jams
during the morning rush hour.

449
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,160
Okay.

450
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,350
Xu.

451
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,400

452
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,310
has been sent out.

453
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,750
The award money will also be distributed
in these days.

454
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,160
Come on, the second prize is good.

455
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,160
Go now.

456
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,680
Don't miss me.

457
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,550
Xu.

458
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,240
Good for you.

459
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,070
If you don't leave now,
you'll miss the plane.

460
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,960
Do you want me to stay with you
for a few more days?

461
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,270
Don't you have to work?

462
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:00,720
Gao Leng and the others

463
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,790
are waiting for you to go back

464
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:02,880
at the company every day.

465
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,880
It doesn't matter to me to delay
for another day or two.

466
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,640
Wait for me to come back.

467
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,510
I will go for you then.

468
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,480
Go.

469
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,720
Look at

470
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,400
the two of you.

471
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,440
How can I get in the car?

472
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,550
Should I sit in the trunk?

473

Where is the problem?

479
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,240
How about I help you?

480
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,550
You also play it?

481
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,680
Happy Elements is my favorite

482
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,550
mobile game.

483
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,110
Okay.

484
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,860
(Happy Elements)

485
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,830
Hold on.

486
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,830
Did I miss anything?

487
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,590
Did you cheat?

You are really good at it.

491
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,200
We need to help each other

492
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,030
to clear the game,

493
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,790
don't we?

494
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,440
In return,

495
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,480
do me a favor.

496
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:05,960
Say it.

497
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,000
As long as it is within my ability.

498
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,550
What is Xu Yanshi doing in Shanghai?

499
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,400
Come on.

500
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,240
I have no idea about this.

501
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,590
You two are together every day.

502
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,350
Even you don't know,

503
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,960
how could I know?

504
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:18,030
You always know more than I do.

505
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,790
Are you jealous of me?

506
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,590
Something's wrong.

507
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,110
Do you have any objections?

508
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:29,830
No.

509
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,680
It's good to be jealous.

510
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,510
Good for your health.

511
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,750
If

512
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,750
you were rejected by a girl,

513
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,880
would you still go after her?

514
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,350
No.

515
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,920
I never ask for a snub.

516
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,550
It makes sense.

517
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,030
Yuan.

518
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,270
How about

519
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,790
you help me pass this level?

520
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,590
I'm not in the mood.

521
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,270
It's okay. I can wait.

522
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,400
Let me know when you're
in the mood.

523
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,000
When will the project

524
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,200
you mentioned start?

525
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:27,750
Within a month.

526
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,270
We have signed a contract

527
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,240
with Soaring.

528
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,350
Well.

529
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,790
We are waiting for your news.

530
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:33,750
Okay.

531
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,830
I just quit my job.

532
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,070
Faster than I thought.

533
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,270
What about you?

534
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,400
How is your talk with Kaisheng going?

535
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,110
What conditions does Mr. Lin offer?

536
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,750
A basic salary of 600,000 yuan.

537
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,960
Project commission
plus year-end dividends.

538
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,480
Not bad.

539
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:07,350
I've been in this business
for so many years.

540
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,510
The conditions Weilan offered me

541
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,920
are not much different from yours.

542
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,440
Why doesn't Lin Kairui

543
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,200
play by the rules?

544
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,440
He wants to disrupt the market?

545
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,790
To be honest,

546
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,750
I don't think it's enough.

547
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I'd like to

548
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,000
ask for more.

549
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,920
How did you become

550
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,920
so high-spirited again?

551
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,720
Or are you short of money?

552
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,640
I thought your rough edges were smoothed

553
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,350
after all these years.

554
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,480
I was the one

555
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,440
who dragged you down

556
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,270
back then.

557
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,030
How is it?

558
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,240
Do you hate me?

559
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,920
I was sorry for you.

560
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,750
All I could think about

561
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,790
was realizing my ambition

562
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,400
in Velin.

563
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,070
But now it seems that

564
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,590
I was simply taking advantage of others.

565
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,750
I also have regrets in the past few years.

566
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,400
I felt as if

567
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,030
I had ruined

568
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,310
a teenager's dream.

569
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,550
It's all over.

570
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,590
Maybe this is destiny.

571
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,350
If I hadn't joined Velin,

572
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,240
I might have lost something else.

573
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:34,920
Hello.

574
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,270
I am Xiang Yuan,

575
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,110
the team leader of Technical Group II.

576
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,240
With your personality,

577
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,550
Xingheng is not

578
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,750
a good fit for you.

579
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,030
Once you are there,
you won't be back.

580
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,830
There are too many predecessors

581
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,200
who sacrificed
on the battlefield of science,

582
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,750
just like my professor.

583
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,270
Your professor?

584
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,400
I told you before.

585
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,350
You were replying to a text message
on your phone,

586
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,510
so you missed it, did you?

587
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,000
My professor

588
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,510
is Xiang Yuan's mother.

589
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,480
In 1994,

590
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,550
the construction of

591
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,400
the BDS-1 satellite navigation system

592
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,640
officially started.

593
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,680
Xiang Yuan was only two years old
at the time.

594
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,880
My professor didn't
have time for Xiang Yuan at all,

595
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,110
and immediately threw herself into

596
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,480
the work of the research
and development team.

597
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,200
Until the system was built
and put into use

598
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:51,070
in 2000,

599
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,720
my professor spent

600
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,110
very little time at home.

601
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,920
As a result, the relationship between her
and Xiang Yuan's father

602
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,240
was getting worse and worse.

603
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,480
Do you have to leave now?

604
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,270
Do you have to go?

605
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,200
Which do you choose

606
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,110
between family and work?

607
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,110
There is an emergency
in my unit.

608
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,070
I have to go back.

609
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,680
It's not easy for our family

610
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,640
to go out for a trip.

611
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,110
We've just arrived
and you're leaving.

612
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,720
Don't make trouble
for no reason, okay?

613
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:15,160
Dad, Mom, stop arguing.

614
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,920
Look, this is my drawing.

615
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,160
Leave as you wish.

616
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,110
You don't care about
our family at all.

617
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,350
Mom, look.

618
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,000
This is the picture
I drew for you.

619
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,310
This is a satellite.

620
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,240
This is you.

621
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,400
This is me.

622
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,270
Good girl.

623
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,030
I have to leave.

624
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,720
Listen to your dad, okay?

625
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,350
Mom!

626
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,830
Mom!

627
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,440
Mom!

628
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,880
Take me to the airport.

629
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,750
(Xiang Yuan's mother)

630
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,000
(knew the responsibility she bore.)

631
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,240
(Although her health was
getting worse and worse,)

632
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,880
(she still insisted on the front line
of research and development,)

633
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,310
(and shared no time for Xiang Yuan.)

634
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,720
(Every time Xiang Yuan
wanted to share with her)

635
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,960
(after winning an award)

636
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,270
(or drawing,)

637
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,160
(she was absent-minded.)

638
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,350
(After dealing with her daughter,)

639
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,680
(she returned to the laboratory.)

640
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,750
What did Xiang Yuan draw?

641
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,960
An ideal world.

642
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,350
Can you imagine?

643
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,400
The ideal world

644
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,480
for a child that young

645
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,070
is a globe

646
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,270
surrounded by satellites.

647
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,720
Her mother is holding a satellite

648
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,030
in her hand.

649
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,110
Xiang Yuan drew herself

650
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,030
in a small corner

651
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,160
of the painting.

652
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,400
It was only later that

653
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,480
we found

654
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,640
a line of twisted

655
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,750
and ugly pinyin

656
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,030
behind the painting.

657
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,350
It's written that

658
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,350
I wish

659
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,510
I was that satellite.

660
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,040
♪How far can it be♪

661
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:47,100
♪Thought if we could meet again,
I could dream♪

662
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:51,800
♪To get closer to you♪

663
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,790
Look.

664
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,830
During this summer vacation,

665
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,310
my mother took me to Australia

666
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,240
to see koalas.

667
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,440
They are lazy and cute.

668
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,160
My mother

669
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,550
wanted to buy me one.

670
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,480
But I think it's too pitiful for it

671
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,310
to be taken away from its mom.

672
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,200
So I bought a doll.

673
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,030
You are lying!

674
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:10,000
I never met your mother.

675
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,240
How could she take you

676
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,030
to see koalas?

677
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:16,440
Liar! Liar!

678
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,110
She's just a liar.

679
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,000
My mom loves me so much.

680
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,720
Just wait and see.

681
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,240
She said that she would take me

682
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,590
to the Antarctic next time.

683
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,790
Your koala is so cute.

684
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,160
May I have a look?

685
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,110
Sure.

686
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,720
Look.

687
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,440
This adult koala

688
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,160
is carrying a baby koala.

689
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:49,830
Mr. Li, cheers.

690
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,400
Okay.

691
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,240
Have fun.

692
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,270
Come on.

693
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,110
Cheers together.

694
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:57,590
Come on.

695
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,440
Let's eat.

696
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:04,070
Xiang, don't just sit there.

697
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,550
Drink with Mr. Wang.

698
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,550
Be happy.

699
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,750
Mr. Wang.

700
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,440
You haven't even

701
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,880
finished a glass of wine.

702
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,510
That's your fault.

703
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:12,960
Yes.

704
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,030
Come on.

705
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,270
Cheers.

706
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,160
Drink it all.

707
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,860
(Leader of the Other Group)

708
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,000
Mr. Wang, eat.

709
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,380
(Occupied, Xi'an Taxi)

710
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,900
(Xu Yanshi)

711
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,400
Hello, Xu.

712
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,920
Do you know where Xiang Yuan is?

713
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,240
How could I know?

714
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,030
Can't you two talk directly?

715
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,440
She didn't answer my calls.

716
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,790
Well.

717
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,070
Did you take her home?

718
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,480
Yes.

719
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,550
She said she had an emergency.

720
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:51,070
So I sent her

721
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,070
to your company.

722
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,350
Sir.

723
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,350
Take me to Velin.

724
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,680
No.108, Xingyang Road.

725
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:02,960
Miss Xiang.

726
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,720
I brought some more friends here

727
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,550
to cheer up.

728
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,510
Do you mind?

729
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,670
How come?

730
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,630
Just have fun

731
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,150
with Mr. Wang.

732
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,070
So,

733
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,880
(Portfolio)
about the contract...

734
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,710
Only drink.

735
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,800
No work.

736
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,710
Our two companies

737
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:22,550
have cooperated for so long.

738
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,710
Do you still worry?

739
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,000
Let's drink.

740
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,880
You said I am a girl.

741
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,480
And I've drunk a lot.

742
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,400
Well.

743
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,670
Let's forget about this.

744
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,670
Miss Xiang.

745
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,670
Are you

746
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,280
disrespecting me

747
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,030
or Soaring?

748
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,440
Boss, you are back.

749
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:48,480
Boss.

750
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,280
Aren't you coming back
in a few days?

751
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,920
Has Xiang Yuan ever returned?

752
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,760
Yes.

753
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,800
She came back and got something,

754
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,880
then she went with the customer.

755
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,880
She didn't even take the luggage.

756
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,360
Okay.

757
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,030
Send me the location
and I'll pick her up.

758
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,920
Hold on, Boss.

759
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:00,960
I have something important

760
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,760
to report to you.

761
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,320
Say it.

762
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,710
I think Miss Xiang

763
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,670
might like you.

764
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,760
Any evidence?

765
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,360
Yes, when you were on
a business trip

766
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,760
to Shanghai last time,

767
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,880
I saw Miss Xiang

768
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,110
sniffing your shirt secretly.

769
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,230
I also think so.

770
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:16,070
Li Qin just blamed Boss,

771
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,800
and Miss Xiang went directly

772
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,710
to Li Qin's office

773
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,510
to quarrel.

774
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,150
Yes.

775
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:20,880
Save it.

776
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,280
Send me the location.

777
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,190
Okay.

778
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:30,150
Even the iceberg Boss

779
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,630
has melted.

780
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,710
I should also have a chance

781
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,070
to get Chen Shu back.

782
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,920
Boss is

783
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,000
different from you.

784
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,070
You are not

785
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,710
the same creature at all.

786
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,550
Nuts!

787
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,070
I won't give up.

788
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,110
I'm leaving.

789
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:44,880
Bye.

790
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,820
(Leader of the Other Group)

791
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:52,960
Miss Xiang.

792
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:53,710
Come on.

793
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,190
Let's drink.

794
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,510
Let's drink.

795
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:00,710
Hello.

796
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,110
Mr. Li.

797
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,440
I can't stay here any longer.

798
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,190
I just got a call from home

799
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:06,880
saying

800
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,320
my child has a fever.

801
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,630
(Leader of the Other Group)
I have to go home.

802
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,880
My husband is out.

803
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,400
I...

804
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,510
I have to go back

805
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,510
and deal with the divorce first.

806
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,510
Right?

807
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,710
I'll be right there.

808
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,110
Mr. Li.

809
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,400
Cheers.

810
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,630
Why don't we discuss

811
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,480
the matter of sending
the child to the hospital first?

812
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:24,670
Why are you...?

813
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,150
Wait for me downstairs.

814
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,070
Mr. Li.

815
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,000
Here.

816
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,000
Take the contract.

817
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,510
Tomorrow, go to Velin to find me

818
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,440
with the contract.

819
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,030
I will wait for you.

820
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,510
I'm going to buy the bill first.

821
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,000
Okay?

822
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,960
Have fun today.

823
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,550
It's all on me.

824
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,510
Sorry, I have to go.

825
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,510
Let's continue tomorrow.

826
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,280
Go ahead.

827
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,320
Hello, take your time.

828
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,630
8888.

829
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,280
Check, please.

830
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,360
Okay, the bill.

831
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,590
What's going on?

832
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,840
Hello, the total cost is

833
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,360
58,046 yuan.

834
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,920
Why so expensive?

835
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,840
Which company?

836
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,840
Soaring.

837
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,710
Soaring?

838
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,030
What business?

839
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,070
The recent drone positioning project

840
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,510
of Velin.

841
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,710
Already signed the contract?

842
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,110
They said they would go to the company
with the contract tomorrow.

843
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,110
They are still inside?

844
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,440
I will pay.

845
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,510
Wait for me in the car.

846
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,800
Vomit if you want.

847
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,800
And you will feel better.

848
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,150
I will spit in your car.

849
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:46,920
Never mind.

850
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,920
I will wash the car tomorrow.

851
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,710
Go, take care.

852
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,180
(Kaisheng-Lin Kairui)

853
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:24,630
Hello.

854
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,150
Yanshi.

855
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,630
I just asked.

856
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,710
Mr. Duan of Soaring said

857
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,110
that he hadn't been to Velin this week.

858
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,190
The people who went

859
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,190
were the other two managers
of their branch,

860
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,320
who used to be in charge of
communicating with Donghe.

861
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,670
They probably want to
take advantage of her

862
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,630
before terminating the contract.

863
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,150
Well.

864
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,400
Duan has the contact.

865
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,880
How could they have one?

866
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,920
Your girlfriend

867
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,670
must have been tricked by them.

868
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:44,960
Got it.

869
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,630
Do me a favor.

870
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,480
Okay, no problem. Wait for me.

871
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,740
(Mr. Duan)

872
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,880
Mr. Li, your call.

873
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,400
Who's calling?

874
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:13,800
Who's that?

875
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,550
So annoying.

876
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,150
So busy.

877
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:18,510
So much work.

878
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,110
Duan.

879
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,670
Pick it up.

880
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:25,520
Hush.

881
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,440
Music off.

882
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,480
Lower the voice.

883
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,840
Go pick up the phone.

884
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:34,960
Hello.

885
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:35,880
Mr. Duan.

886
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:36,920
Where are you two?

887
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,590
We are with the client.

888
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,800
Get back.

889
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,230
Didn't I

890
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,280
give you anything?

891
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:43,920
You are

892
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,070
so shameless.

893
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,590
Well, we have something
to do here.

894
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,400
No more nonsense.

895
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,070
If you don't

896
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,400
come back tonight,

897
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,320
I'll dismiss you immediately.

898
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:06,510
Don't catch a cold.

899
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,760
Paid the check?

900
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,880
Miss Xiang.

901
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,030
We have to finish the show.

902
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,360
How could Mr. Duan know this?

903
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,480
Who knows?

904
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,590
They didn't pay the bill.

905
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,800
Sir, hold on.

906
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,360
What's going on?

907
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,670
Xiang Yuan paid the bill.

908
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,110
No one paid the bill.

909
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,920
Please pay for it.

910
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:04,960
This...

911
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,280
How come?

912
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,030
Take care.

913
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,070
Stay right there! Stop!

914
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:20,670
Call the police!

915
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:21,190
How dare you run?

916
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:21,840
Don't pull me.

917
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,480
Come on.

918
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:22,840
Let me go.

919
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,510
Man.

920
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:24,400
Let me go.

921
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:24,710
Go.

922
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,670
Listen to me.

923
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,230
Don't call the police.

924
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:27,960
Pay the bill.

925
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,510
Give us the ID cards first.

926
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,960
We are in a hurry to go back
to Shanghai.

927
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,960
We have an emergency.

928
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,360
Yes.

929
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:33,480
Did you pay the check?

930
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:33,920
Well.

931
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,630
Shall we mortgage a watch?

932
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,760
It's hard for me

933
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,630
to make a deal.

934
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,880
Don't ruin it.

935
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,480
I came straight from the plane.

936
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,960
They sang, danced

937
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,630
and drank.

938
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,440
I endured nausea
to accompany them.

939
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:46,760
Would you believe me

940
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,510
if I said

941
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,710
you were cheated?

942
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:54,920
Tell me the reason.

943
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,440
I will tell you later.

944
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,510
But I'm sure you've been tricked.

945
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:01,960
They just wanted

946
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,920
to take advantage of you.

947
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:05,380
- They won't go to Velin tomorrow.
- The belt...

948
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,960
Trust me.

949
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,440
They won't be there.

950
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,320
So you're telling me

951
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,230
that all my hard work the whole day

952
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,280
was wasted?

953
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,150
It's all

954
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,590
in vain?

955
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,670
Yes, it is destined to be in vain.

956
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,590
Okay, no more talking.

957
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,230
Okay?

958
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:38,960
Ask your friend here.

959
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,510
Make a call.

960
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:40,630
Okay, come in.

961
