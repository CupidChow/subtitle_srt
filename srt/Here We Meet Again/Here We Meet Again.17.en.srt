00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,420
In Shanghai,

195
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,700
you were like a couple on honeymoon.

196
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,060
What does she need to think about?

197
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,020
Our child's name,

198
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:34,860
perhaps.

199
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,540
Be nervous, could you?

200
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,300
If I weren't nervous,

201
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,740
how could I run out of the car battery?

202
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,420
I'm going to leave Velin,

203
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,020
for Kaisheng.

204
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,220
(Never underestimate a man)

205
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,700
(who still queues in the wee hours.)

206
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,020
Why did you suddenly decide it?

207
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,380
Not suddenly.

208
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,660
I planned to return to Shanghai

209
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:35,860
in a year or two

210
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,220
after paying off my debt to Chen Shan.

211
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,540
But the coming of Xiang Yuan

212
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,860
advanced my plan.

213
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,340
I told Gui about it.

214
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,940
Just then,

215
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,540
Kaisheng gave me an offer

216
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,100
and I accepted it.

217
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,660
(Planetarium
Joyous Computer Repair)

218
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,860
Come on.

219
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,620
How could I spend the whole night

220
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,860
thinking about Xu Yanshi?

221
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,620
Can I be having a cold?

222
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,340
My head feels so bad.

223
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,460
Morning.

224
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,300
Morning.

225
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,180
Have a cold?

226
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,260
On my business trip the other day,

227
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,260
I might have caught a cold.

228
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,820
Just checking if you have a fever.

229
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,460
Have you taken your temperature?

230
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,780
Do you need to see a doctor?

231
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,300
There has been a serious flu.

232
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,500
It's OK.

233
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,300
Just a cold.

234
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,500
I'll take some medicine.

235
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,740
What about Hao?

236
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,220
Has he had the vaccine?

237
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,420
Recently, shouldn't children

238
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,460
be more carefully looked after?

239
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,260
We had an appointment.

240
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,180
He'll have the vaccine next month.

241
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,540
Let me drive you.

242
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,140
I'm going somewhere near your company

243
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,060
for some business.

244
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,780
Just a lift.

245
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,140
You turned me down

246
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,020
but got off his car.

247
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,580
Tell me.

248
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,260
Who did you give the chance to?

249
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,220
I'll take a taxi. Thanks, anyway.

250
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,940
When you were on a business trip,

251
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,380
you didn't watch the news, huh?

252
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,260
Something's wrong with my project

253
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,260
and I've been really busy.

254
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,140
That explains.

255
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,220
A figure sale

256
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,580
was held last night

257
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,180
near our community.

258
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,500
A lot of people were queuing.

259
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,660
Quite long queues.

260
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,300
Now, the neighborhood is so crowded.

261
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,220
If you don't believe it,

262
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,140
check the taxi-hailing app.

263
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,100
Hundreds of people must be waiting.

264
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,580
(You're No.237 in the queue.)

265
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,100
Fine.

266
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,220
Mr. Lu,

267
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,020
could you drive me
to the subway station?

268
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:17,860
Sure.

269
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,620
Thanks.

270
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,500
It's OK.

271
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,300
There you go.

272
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,300
Thank you.

273
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,900
Get in the car.

274
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,380
(Gao Leng: Never underestimate a man
who still queued in the wee hours.)

275
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,260
(Seriously? Just for a figure? I haven't
even queued up for the Spring Rush.)

276
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,460
(Jie)
(I got two tickets for the play)

277
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,460
(you asked for.)

278
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,660
(You're lucky.)

279
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,060
(The sponsor is a good friend of mine.)

280
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,260
(You'll have VIP seats.)

281
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,380
(Thank me.)

282
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,180
(Jie)
(Many thanks, bro.)

283
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,220
(And the figure you wanted...)

284
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,180
(I bought it!)

285
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,500
(Later, I'll give it to you)

286
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,500
(and you give me the tickets!)

287
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,180
(Gao Leng)

288
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,060
What my girlfriend bought me
is really good.

289
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,540
Here comes the cool guy.

290
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,460
Honey, wait.

291
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,820
I'll get you back.

292
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,700
Did you especially drive there

293
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,500
to pick me up?

294
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,180
But it takes over an hour

295
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,460
to drive from your flat to mine.

296
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,020
And I heard a figure sale

297
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,300
was held

298
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,460
in our neighborhood.

299
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,060
You must have left home

300
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,140
even before daybreak.

301
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,540
To pursue a girl,
I should do as much as I can.

302
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,220
I knew about that sale

303
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,140
and then picked you up

304
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,500
in case you couldn't get a taxi.

305
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,460
This...

306
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,820
This morning,

307
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,300
I happened to meet him

308
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,180
in the elevator.

309
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,700
Considering the traffic jam,

310
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,980
he offered to drive me.

311
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,020
You don't need to explain.

312
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,620
I'm not jealous.

313
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,140
I had you choose

314
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,500
whose car you would take.

315
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,820
Can't you see

316
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,260
he wants to pursue me?

317
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,100
I'm not Gao Leng.

318
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,580
How can I not tell

319
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,740
when someone wants you?

320
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,500
After he drove out of your community,

321
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,460
in no case

322
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,580
could he give you a lift

323
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,940
to our company.

324
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,700
Then why can you still be so generous?

325
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,260
My view on Lu Dong is simple enough.

326
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,380
He wants to pursue you,

327
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,220
OK.

328
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,940
I don't mind competing in love.

329
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,420
The choice rests with you.

330
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,620
Now that you have options now,

331
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,140
make your choice carefully.

332
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,220
You have the right.

333
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,260
Don't be nervous.

334
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,380
I'm not mad.

335
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,580
Really?

336
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,540
How about I go to the hospital,

337
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,820
take an electrocardiogram

338
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,100
and give you a heart rate report?

339
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,060
OK.

340
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,650
Hey.

341
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,180
The play on Saturday night...

342
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,140
Did you manage to buy a ticket?

343
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,260
Not a chance.

344
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,540
It's nearly impossible to buy a ticket.

345
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,300
And I heard

346
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,660
(Gardens in the Deep Sea)
a star was in it.

347
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,060
Yes, yes.

348
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:46,500
I love him.

349
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,220
No tickets, no tickets.

350
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,260
Stop trying.

351
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,980
There he came again.

352
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,380
Chen Shu is away.

353
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,540
Yeah.

354
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,900
I didn't see her the whole morning.

355
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,500
(But today,)

356
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,420
(she isn't on her period.)

357
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,860
Umm... Is she...?

358
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,620
Is she sick?

359
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,660
No.

360
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,580
She wants to invite an important client

361
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,220
to watch a play.

362
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,260
She's gone for the tickets.

363
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,540
Gardens in the Deep Sea
on Saturday night?

364
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,340
Yes.

365
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,860
Shu has been having a headache.

366
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,300
Last week, she lost two clients.

367
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,780
If she can't get this one this week,

368
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,540
she would...

369
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,780
"Kill herself" right downstairs.

370
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,180
Seriously?

371
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,020
Just a client... Does she have to?

372
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,260
Why not?

373
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,380
Yes, she does.

374
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,780
So much money?

375
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,100
Hello.

376
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,620
(This Is A Serious Technology Company)
Surprised, aren't you?

377
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,140
You've received the money
for the first prize.

378
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,340
Cherish the hard-won money

379
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:00,220
that was doubled.

380
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,380
First prize?

381
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,860
But we won the second prize.

382
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,860
Feng Jun cheated

383
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,940
and it was exposed.

384
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,740
His first prize was canceled

385
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,980
and we took his place.

386
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,380
It's just lucky for Lu Junliang

387
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,220
that he remained

388
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,700
the second prize.

389
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,820
You know what?

390
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,580
Feng Jun deserved this

391
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,140
for what he has done.

392
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,980
A fortune!

393
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,900
(Qing)
(I snapped up the tickets.)

394
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,300
(The program Gui designed)

395
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,100
(has never failed once.)

396
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,580
(He's more or less wasted.)

397
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,860
(Thanks.)

398
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,740
What delights you? Pennies from heaven?

399
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,620
How do you know?

400
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,660
We won the second prize, huh?

401
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,540
But Feng Jun was caught cheating

402
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,620
and then we won the first prize.

403
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,700
First prize! First!

404
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,020
You already knew it?

405
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,420
Dull.

406
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,140
How shall I transfer the money to you?

407
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,980
You keep it.

408
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,500
Why?

409
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,860
I never serve

410
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,380
as a free financial manager.

411
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,980
Then will you do me the honor

412
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,540
of watching a play

413
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,500
this Saturday night?

414
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,100
Gardens in the Deep Sea?

415
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,220
It's really hard to buy the tickets.

416
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,220
You bought some?

417
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,500
Qing did it for me.

418
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:32,820
Will you go?

419
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,740
OK.

420
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,260
Shall we first discuss

421
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,340
the launch thing?

422
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,140
OK.

423
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,820
This afternoon,

424
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,620
let's discuss it with Chen Shu.

425
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,580
Come in.

426
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,580
In the middle of something?

427
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,220
Waiting for you.

428
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,500
What?

429
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,820
Xiang Yuan

430
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,740
emailed you a proposal.

431
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,380
Did you review it?

432
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,700
Yes.

On the whole,

440
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,420
I don't have any problem with it.

441
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,140
However,

442
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,220
I still want to give you

443
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,260
a warning.

445
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,420
This launch is

446
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,100
a particularly critical step

447
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,580
of Velin's transition.

448
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,060
Once anything goes wrong

449
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,140
during it,

450
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,620
all the money and effort

451
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,100
we have invested

452
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,660
might be wasted.

453
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,860
And your transition plan

454
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,180
may also fail.

455
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,300
Rest assured.

456
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,860
We won't let anyone down.

457
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,740
Don't stress yourself out.

458
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,860
Where were you this morning?

459
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,980
I didn't see you anywhere.

460
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,580
Don't mention it.

461
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,140
This morning,

462
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,980
I thought

463
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,180
there would be a play

464
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,500
on Saturday night.

465
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,620
Then I wanted to invite

466
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,060
a very important client to it.

467
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,820
I got up early for the tickets

468
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,740
but failed to buy any.

469
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,260
Now, I'm worrying about it.

470
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,660
Gardens in the Deep Sea?

471
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,300
It's OK.

472
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,700
For the ticket thing,

473
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,220
I'll try some other ways.

474
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,980
But for the launch thing,

475
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:43,620
you two

476
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,620
have to be more mindful.

477
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,540
I won't say

478
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,140
I wish you a wonderful comeback

479
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:49,940
or something like that.

480
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,620
Anyway,

481
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,860
don't let anything bad happen

482
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,620
and that's all.

483
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,900
This positioning module

484
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,540
should be installed properly.

485
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,020
Who did this?

486
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,260
The RF connector

487
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,500
should be installed here.

488
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,340
Pay attention, this facility

489
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,220
has requirements for installation.

490
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,140
Stop yawning.

491
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,380
Get it started.

492
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,140
OK.

493
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,780
Xu Yanshi!

494
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,980
I've invited a heavyweight guest.

495
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:19,940
Who?

496
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,220
Karma.

497
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,500
Karma?

498
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,500
Miss Xiang, I remember you were

499
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,940
in his livestreaming room, right?

500
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,420
I analyzed the target users.

501
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:34,060
Most truck drivers

502
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,660
are young man

503
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,860
from 24 to 38 years old.

504
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,820
So, I want

505
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,940
young esports players

506
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,460
like Karma and Xiaoxiao

507
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,700
to give a warm-up publicity

508
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,980
to our launch.

509
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,620
Well, Miss Xiang

510
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,540
really has a wide network of contacts.

511
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,740
But,

512
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,660
Karma has too much negative news.

513
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,100
If we invite

514
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,220
such a controversial player,

515
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,300
would it have bad effects

516
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,780
on our launch?

517
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,980
Don't be silly.

518
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,700
He's a trending topic, OK?

519
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,660
If only we could invite Down,

520
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,020
my idol.

521
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,300
Stop daydreaming.

522
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,980
Down is a guru of the old time.

523
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,300
He's been out of games for years.

524
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,380
Besides,

525
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,180
even if he returned to esports,

526
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:09,820
he wouldn't come

527
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,940
to our launch.

528
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,340
Can he be dead?

529
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,500
Shut up!

530
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,580
Are you being too idle?

531
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,020
No work, huh?

532
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,380
Go, go, go. Get to work.

533
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,820
I want you to do something.

534
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,260
Give the tickets

535
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,700
to Chen Shu.

536
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,260
You guessed it?

537
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:37,700
(Gardens in the Deep Sea)

538
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,740
Impressive.

539
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,820
You bought such tickets.

540
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,340
Give them back to me.

541
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,580
Just looking. I won't snatch them.

542
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,220
Which girl will you watch it with?

543
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,860
Give them back to me.

544
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,060
What's the secret for?

545
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,540
(Gardens in the Deep Sea)

546
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,580
For me?

547
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,180
Is it appropriate?

548
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,900
Give the tickets to Chen Shu.

549
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,780
She can watch it with anyone she wants.

550
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,780
But don't tell her they're from me.

551
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,500
Why don't you give them to her?

552
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,700
Then she might reject them.

553
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,140
(Gardens in the Deep Sea)

554
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,660
(Xi'an Shangjia Theater, The Third Round
of Gardens in the Deep Sea)

555
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:56,940
Shu,

556
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,900
the tickets are real,

557
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,500
I guess.

558
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,260
I don't mean that.

559
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,660
It's just so surprising

560
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,620
and unexpected.

561
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,180
Shi Tianyou,

562
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,340
thank you.

563
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,500
You really did me

564
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,940
a great favor.

565
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,100
You're welcome.

566
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,780
This morning, Jessica said

567
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,860
you were trying so hard

568
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,060
for the tickets.

569
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,300
Yes, I was.

570
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,340
You have no idea

571
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,380
how hard it is to buy such tickets.

572
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,460
I failed to snap up

573
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,540
or buy a single one.

574
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,620
Oh,

575
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,260
you must have paid a premium price.

576
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:25,900
How about this?

577
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,580
I'll transfer the money to you.

578
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,380
How much?

579
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,020
Don't bother, Shu.

580
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,100
I didn't pay any money.

581
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,580
A friend of mine is

582
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,340
a ticket broker.

583
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,380
He gave me two free tickets.

584
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,700
No way.

585
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,620
I can't take them for free.

586
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,580
How about this?

587
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,220
I'll transfer the money to you

588
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,780
and then invite you to dinner

589
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,140
in Xiaodaiji.

590
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,420
Thank you, Shu.

591
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,860
(Shangjia Theater)

592
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,820
Over there, I guess.

593
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:13,900
There, right?

594
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,580
I'll go in front.

595
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:17,500
OK.

596
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:19,700
It's too dark.

597
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,740
I'll go in front. Follow me.

598
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,220
Excuse me.

599
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,300
Excuse me, let us pass.

600
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,020
Mr. Lu?

601
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,100
Chen Shu.

602
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,660
What a coincidence!

603
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,820
You know each other?

604
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:02,620
Neighbors.

605
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,180
I didn't expect you

606
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,340
to be the important client

607
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,500
Chen Shu talked about.

608
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,020
Let me

609
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,780
give you

610
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,500
a simple self-introduction.

611
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,540
I'm 27,

612
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,060
male.

613
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,140
My name

614
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,380
has a special meaning.

615
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,820
My father's family name is Nan.

616
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,860
My mother's family name is Wan.

617
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,620
Then my name is Nan Bowan.
[*The pronunciation of No.1]

618
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,780
So clearly,

619
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,220
I'm the first child.

620
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,060
And because of that,

621
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,060
my family members

622
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,100
spoiled me really a lot.

623
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,220
But I knew.

624
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,140
I couldn't grow up,

625
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,460
being spoilt like this.

626
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,940
Then what should I do?

627
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,740
I should study hard.

628
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,940
So, I bought a desk

629
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,900
and put it at home.

630
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,580
Every day, I studied very hard

631
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,940
at my desk.

632
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,980
I kept studying

633
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,300
really, really hard.

634
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,340
Unexpectedly, a month later,

635
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,060
because I didn't go to school,

636
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,700
I was expelled.

637
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,460
Life is so unpredictable.

638
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,100
Actually,

639
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,220
I don't think this is real.

640
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,260
I'm so happy

641
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,860
and positive.

642
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,500
Depression is the last thing I can have.

643
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,740
It's just that every night,

644
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,740
I remain sleepless.

645
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,780
Why hasn't Chen Shu come out yet?

646
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,820
(Shangjia Theater)

647
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,740
We came out.

648
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,220
Come pick me up.

649
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,260
Let's go.

650
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,540
Chen Shu.

651
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,340
Chen Shu!

652
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,340
Chen Shu!

653
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,380
Are you OK?

654
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,860
Sorry, Mr. Lu.

655
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,340
Stop calling me Mr. Lu.

656
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,820
Call me Lu Dong.

657
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,900
Sounds close.

658
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,740
I'm getting in, then.

659
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,900
OK. Good night.

660
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,580
Bye-bye.

661
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,220
Where's the milk tea?

662
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:24,180
(Chen Shu: I really want a MoMoZhaZha.)

663
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,620
(I really want a MoMoZhaZha.)

664
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,820
(Xiang Yuan)
(I'm just about to order one for you,)

665
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,740
(sweetheart.)

666
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,500
(You're indeed my best friend.)

667
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,900
Hello.

668
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,540
Is Velin's launch

669
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,660
about to be held?

670
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,500
This is

671
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,860
a chance for us.

672
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,380
You know what I mean.

673
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,540
Don't worry.

674
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,220
I've had everything arranged.

675
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,260
OK.

676
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,460
I think

677
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,180
I'm indeed a genius at clothing.

678
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,700
I've picked such a suit.

679
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,300
Oh, gosh.

680
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,740
What's so funny?

681
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,940
It looks great.

682
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:24,980
Look at this one.

683
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,020
Look.

684
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:27,940
What poor taste!

685
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,020
The red one looks awful, too.

686
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,220
You both have poor taste.

687
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,100
How could you complain about mine?

688
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:31,700
Look at the green thing

689
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,980
you've picked.

690
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,820
Looks so bad.

691
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,420
Your...

692
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,220
What on earth is this?

693
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:37,780
You know what?

694
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,620
I hide something in it.

695
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,100
What's all this about?

696
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,540
Boss will get onto the stage

697
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,380
to present our products, huh?

698
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,340
We're picking a suit for him.

699
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,220
Miss Xiang,

700
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,820
you're just in time.

701
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,620
Look.

702
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,300
The yellow one

703
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,060
suits Boss most, doesn't it?

704
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:54,900
Not at all.

705
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,820
The red one looks great,

706
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,340
right?

707
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,500
Red is so cheesy.

708
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,420
Check this.

709
00:35:59,420 --> 00:35:59,980
Green.

710
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,500
It looks normal,

711
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,740
but with the light

712
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,860
- on the stage...
- Stop.

713
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,620
Are you expecting

714
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,340
Xu Yanshi to play traffic lights?

715
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,700
But they're good suits.

716
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,020
Yeah.

717
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:17,500
Look.

718
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,380
What about this suit?

719
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,900
A good color, isn't it?

720
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,060
What a terrible color!

721
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,020
And this one?

722
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,140
Isn't it gorgeous?

723
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,780
Do you really take it as a fashion show?

724
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,420
Another one.

725
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,940
This... This one.

726
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,500
This one must be OK.

727
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,140
Perfect fit.

728
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,660
Do you think this color

729
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,900
works with his skin?

730
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,620
Xiang Yuan,

731
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,100
you know what?

732
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,900
I exchanged something great

733
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,180
with the costume designer

734
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,180
for the borrowing

735
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,380
of a suit.

736
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,220
Don't be so picky,

737
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,140
OK?

738
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,700
I cherish this chance

739
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,820
so much

740
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,820
that I'm choosing carefully.

741
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:55,740
Oh.

742
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,100
What do you really cherish,

743
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,620
this chance or Xu Yanshi?

744
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,300
I cherish you,

745
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,580
OK?

746
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,340
That's more like it.

747
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,100
Come on.

748
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,740
The best one is here.

749
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,300
The brand staff member just told me

750
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,780
Xiao Ran wore this suit

751
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,420
for an event the other day.

752
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,740
It's just Xu Yanshi's size.

753
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,260
What do you say?

754
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,660
I'll pick it.

755
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,060
Anyway,

756
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:30,260
Xu Yanshi is really in great shape.

757
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,940
He has my idol's size.

758
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,420
Size of the suit!

759
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,820
Fair warning,

760
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,660
ask Xu Yanshi

761
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,700
to be very and very careful

762
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,380
when wearing this suit.

763
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,860
Don't have it snagged.

764
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,980
It's... It's quite costly.

765
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,900
I can't pay for it.

766
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,100
And you...

767
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,220
Be careful, too.

768
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,380
Don't rub your makeup or lipstick

769
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,700
to this suit.

770
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,500
Got it?

771
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,020
Then I should really be careful.

772
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,230
Don't be kidding.

773
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,420
Tell me something.

774
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,820
How far have you gone?

775
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,620
He's such a cool guy.

776
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,060
Has he got at you?

777
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,420
Does a married woman

778
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,900
always dare to ask about anything?

779
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,820
Fine,

780
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,980
talk later.

781
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,460
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

782
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,980
(Xu Yuan)

783
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,740
I think he still needs something.

784
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,380
(Miss,)

785
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,140
(do you want this pair of cufflinks?)

786
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,340
(I think)

787
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,740
(it makes a couple)

788
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,020
(with your necklace.)

789
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,260
Couple?

790
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,780
Wear this for the launch.

791
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,100
It must be very expensive.

792
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,380
I won't wear it.

793
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,900
How do I deserve it?

794
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,100
I'm not your boyfriend.

795
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,220
Leave it for your boyfriend.

796
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,500
Fine.

797
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,220
Then wait to wear

798
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,780
one of the colorful suits

799
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,740
your subordinates prepared for you.

800
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,460
Awful.

801
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,380
When the launch is over,

802
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,900
I have something to tell you.

803
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,020
I have something to tell you, too.

804
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:15,860
Let's get started.

805
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,460
The first thing you do

806
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,740
is to give a speech.

807
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,180
Before you get onto the stage,

808
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,660
I'll cue the audience,

809
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,220
"Let's welcome Mr. Xu,

810
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:29,660
the tall and cool leader
of our technical group!"

811
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,380
At this time,

812
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,580
you stand up

813
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,340
and passionately wave to the audience.

814
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,620
Don't say "tall and cool".

815
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,820
So modest?

816
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,900
Even if you don't say that,

817
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,060
others can see with their eyes.

818
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,540
The second question...

819
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:47,780
It is,

820
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,740
"Do you have a girlfriend?"

821
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,820
After I ask,

822
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,380
you think about it for seconds.

823
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,020
And then...

824
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,380
Are you sure you'll ask this?

825
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,900
The... The third question is...

826
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,700
"Mr. Xu, an excellent man like you

827
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,340
has been working in Velin for years.

828
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,620
Our company must be having

829
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,900
some advantages."

830
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,580
Then you should give

831
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,100
some exaggerated compliments on Velin.

832
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,940
Sounds difficult.

833
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,180
May I compliment you instead?

834
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,260
OK.

(Velin New Product Launch of 2019)

836
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,220
Up, up.

837
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:36,620
Up a little bit.

838
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,660
This picture...

839
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,460
Could you use

840
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,180
a better one?

841
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,060
Yes, a little bit over here.

Are you sure

869
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,620
you didn't get me the wrong size?

870
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,140
How come?

871
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,500
You used to wear this size.

872
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,660
How could you not put it on?

873
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:56,700

00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,100
how busy I've been lately.

875
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,500
I had no time to weigh myself.

876
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,260
I gained some weight, I'm afraid.

877
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,020
Good.

878
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,580
Xu Yanshi lived up

879
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:06,500
to my expectations.

880
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,180
He made you gain some weight.

881
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,180
Shut up.

882
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:11,140
Why are you still in the mood

883
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:11,940
of joking?

884
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:12,340
I warn you.

885
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,620

00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:16,780
Anyway,

888
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:17,740
you invited

889
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,180
Karma and Xiaoxiao.

890
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,260
Would they expose

891
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,100
your identity as Ashers?

892
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:22,940
No, of course.

893
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:23,780
Ahead of time,

894
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,300
I told them to keep the secret.

895
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:27,100
For this launch,

896
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,300
why didn't you invite

897
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,660
your grandpa?

898
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,780
What big difference can you make

899
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,460
through that simple launch?

900
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:35,340
I won't go.

901
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:38,820
It'll be good enough

902
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:40,580
if he doesn't make trouble.

903
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:42,860
All the time,

904
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,500
he even wished Velin would close down.

905
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,500
It starts at seven, huh?

906
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:01,820
Then ask Liu

907
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:03,100
not to make dinner.

908
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:03,980
You order some food

909
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,100
and let's eat together.

910
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,140
You've brought the projector, right?

911
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,820
The television...

912
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,260
Is it available

913
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:13,860
to the livestreaming app?

914
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,060
What's...

915
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,260
What's the name of the app?

916
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,220
It's eight.

917
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,580
Seven is the opening time.

918
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,980
At eight, the presentation
officially starts.

919
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,420
I've ordered some food.

920
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,380
This afternoon,
I installed the projector

921
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,380
in the video room.

922
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:31,700
The livestreaming app is Fat Duckling.

923
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:32,340
Right.

924
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:33,540
Fat Duckling.

925
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:35,180
That's right.

926
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,380
Did I ask you

927
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,420
the same questions before?

928
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,620
Sir, this is the eighteenth time

929
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,140
you've asked me.

930
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,140
I have?

931
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:47,820
Seriously?

932
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,820
I was too embarrassed to remind you.

933
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:52,900
By the way,

934
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,100
this afternoon,

935
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,140
I registered an account for you.

936
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,420
I asked Liu.

937
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:58,700
We can

938
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,060
cheer for Yuan

939
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,260
in the livestreaming room

940
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,420
by showering her with gifts.

941
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:03,220
In this way,

942
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,660
more people will be watching.

(Situ Mingtian,
Chairman of Donghe Group)

944
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:12,580
No, no.

945
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,220
This name is way too flashy.

946
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:16,460
Get me another one.

947
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,060
Get me

948
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,180
a name that young people usually use.

949
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:20,780
I mean,

950
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,740
it looks trendy

951
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:23,740
but doesn't look like
