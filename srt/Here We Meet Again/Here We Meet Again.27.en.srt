Come have dinner,

30
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,510
- promising young men.
- Be right there.

31
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,760
There we go.

32
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,040
Oh, Grandpa.

33
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,070
For every year's reunion dinner,

34
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,280
we have the same dishes

35
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,040
and you must be fed up.

36
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,950
This year, we have something different.

37
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,870
Different, indeed.

38
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,230
(Xu Yanshi)
(Can you believe that?)

39
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,840
(For dinner, we have)

40
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,710
(fried chicken and beer.)

41
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,120
Come on. If you keep eating meat,

42
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,430
you may get fed up.

43
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,680
But if you keep eating vegetables,

44
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,040
you won't.

45
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,840
Every year,

46
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,630
I have this reunion dinner with you two.

47
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,240
Is it possible that I can

48
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,310
see new members?

49
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,310
That's right.

50
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,470
Grandpa, you know what?

51
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,560
This year, Xiang Jiamian...

52
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,910
Yuan, eat it.

53
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,190
Don't only complain about him.

54
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,560
I keep picking some young men

55
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,630
so that you can

56
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,560
feel good.

57
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,360
Pick one, at least.

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,630
Tastes great.

59
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,630
Yuan, would you like one?

60
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,280
Sure.

61
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,000
Come on, let's drink.

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,680
Cheers.

63
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,800
- Happy Spring Festival!
- Happy Spring Festival!

64
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,380
Very good.

65
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,400
I'll have it later.

66
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,710
Peel it off.

67
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,360
Leave it to me.

68
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,800
Brother, someone's knocking.

69
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,470
Then go open the door.

70
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,590
Oil on my hands.

71
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,360
Be right there.

72
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,000
Yanshi.

73
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,520
Come in for dinner.

74
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:02,960
Yanshi,

75
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,960
I've been unreliable these years

76
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,560
and brought you a lot of trouble.

77
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,840
But...

78
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,470
Now,

79
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,150
I've finally made some money.

80
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,960
See?

81
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,870
I came to you, then.

82
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,920
Chengli's mother is back.

83
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,870
She misses him

84
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,560
and wants to get him back.

85
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:30,830
Here.

86
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,480
Eat more.

87
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,040
Go.

88
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,390
Brother,

89
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,920
I want to stay with you.

90
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,000
I don't want to leave.

91
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,750
Sometimes,

92
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,000
I can't take care of you

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,310
very thoughtfully.

94
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,070
It'd be better if you live

95
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:47,920
with your parents.

96
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,390
Brother,

97
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,630
do you think when I leave,

98
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,720
you'll get rid of a burden?

99
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,720
I've never told you

100
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,870
why I named you

101
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,390
Xu Chengli,

102
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,480
have I?

103
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,360
Chengli

104
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,040
means the best gift for me.

105
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,120
You're never a burden.

106
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,630
Brother.

107
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,390
All right.

108
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,190
Don't cry.

109
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,430
You're a boy.

110
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,630
You're gonna

111
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,830
meet your parents.

112
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,040
And it's New Year's Eve.

113
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,510
Be happy.

114
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,270
Brother,

115
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,360
what about you?

116
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,720
If you feel unhappy,

117
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,120
come back to me.

118
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,750
I'm always there for you.

119
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:37,680
Go.

120
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,000
Come on. Arms.

121
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,720
Brother,

122
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,000
does she make you happy?

123
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,480
She's gossipy

124
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,270
and she loves playing games.

125
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,950
She likes to tease me, too.

126
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,600
But if she can make you happy,

127
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,190
that's enough.

128
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,870
Brother,

129
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,200
take good care of yourself.

130
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,720
OK.

131
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,030

(fried chicken and beer.)

00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,630
I can rarely
have so much fried chicken.

173

Feels so good.

174
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,630
Grandpa,

175
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,630
it's OK to eat.

176
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,150
But pay attention to
your blood pressure.

177
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,790
Yeah.

178
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,240
It's nearly as high

179
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,360
as my KPI.

What are you doing there?

186
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,200
Drinking!

187
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,240
Grandpa,

188
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,360
she must be doing something.

00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,480
I won't force you

192
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,480
to have blind dates.

00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,030

00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,480
your boyfriend

195
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,320
isn't a research guy,

196
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,480
just like your mother.

197
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,480
If he's a research guy,

198
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,790
he must be too busy

199
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,720
to take care of you.

200
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,120
Who said that?

201
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,550
OK.

202
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,120
The dinner is over.

203
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,550
Here goes the game

204
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,910
we play every year,

205
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,240
Aeroplane chess.

206
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,670
Give me your phones.

207
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,790
I have to sigh.

208
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,030
Too hard for you.

209
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,750
When I see your torturing faces,

210
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,720
I feel relieved.

211
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,150
You must be up to something.

212
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,200
So are you.

213
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,660
(Xiang Yuan)

214
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,260
(Power off)

215
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,340
(Slide to power off)

216
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,600
Happy Spring Festival!

217
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,790
I knew you were home.

218
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:44,630
I failed

219
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,910
to go home for the Spring Festival.

220
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,270
Then I came

221
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,750
to get something to eat.

222
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,510
Where's Xu Chengli?

223
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,550
Dice, little dice.

224
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,510
Roll and roll.

225
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,550
Here you go.

226
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,550
It bumped on my leg.

227
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,360
Where did it go?

228
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:08,870
Grandpa, check

229
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:09,870
if it's in the crack.

230
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,630
Grandpa, have you found it?

231
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,320
No. Maybe it's in the crack.

232
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,080
Is it hard to find it?

233
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,150
Too dark, huh?

234
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,440
Yes. It's too dark in the crack.

235
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,480
- Let's look here.
- Well...

236
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,510
- We...
- Let's look together.

237
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,510
We can use the flashlight

238
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,550
to give some light, OK?

239
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,030
Sure, use the flashlight.

240
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,840
OK.

241
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,940
(No. Enjoy your dinner.)

242
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,390
(Come on, Xu Yanshi.)

243
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,870
(What on earth happened to him?)

244
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,600
It's gone. Look.

245
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
Are you giving the light?

246
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,440
Yes, yes!

247
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,750
Look. Light!

248
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,670
Found it. Found it.

249
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,510
You did?

250
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,360
What's the point?

251
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,440
Don't move. Don't.

252
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,200
Take it out.

253
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:42,840
Five...

254
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,870
Look, look.

255
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,910
Five?

256
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,630
It was five when you found it, huh?

257
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,000
It's just five.

258
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,750
Well, I have to win.

259
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,840
One, two, three, four, five.

260
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,630
Done.

261
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,720
Jiamian,

262
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,200
(No. Enjoy your dinner.)
I've got all my pieces here.

263
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,840
But yours are still in your spot.

264
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,720
Why don't you

265
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,630
close down your flight base?

266
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,750
All right. Just listen to me.

267
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,320
Bye-bye.

268
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,720
Incredible.

269
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,080
Your father is incredible.

270
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,720
Now, he wants a family reunion.

271
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,870
What did he do before?

272
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:25,720
When he sent Xu Chengli

273
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,390
to you,

274
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,440
why didn't he want that?

275
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,360
He left a bank card,

276
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,670
with two million yuan in it.

277
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,720
Maybe he thinks

278
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,790
he can pay it off.

279
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,360
Pay off?

280
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,270
Come on. Stop the cleaning.

281
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,670
Let me take you out for fun.

282
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,840
Come on.

283
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,440
Have a try.

284
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,720
Don't just stand still.

285
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,550
It feels great.

286
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,960
Have a try.

287
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,550
If you keep smashing like this,

288
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,960
that old lady will

289
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,870
scold you again.

290
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,240
I'm so scared.

291
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,080
That's what I'm expecting.

292
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,390
Idiot, what are you doing?

293
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,200
How scary!

294
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,750
Don't you know

295
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,150
you can't play this in downtown?

296
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,840
What if it's on fire?

297
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,840
Will you be responsible?

298
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,150
Do it in the suburbs

299
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,390
and no one will stop you.

300
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,600
What? Continue?

301
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,150
Are you deaf?

302
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,720
Or are you out of your mind?

303
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,320
Believe it or not,

304
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,510
I'm gonna call the police

305
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,030
and put you in jail.

306
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,320
You total idiot!

307
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,630
What's wrong with you?

308
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,080
You silly man!

309
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,550
What an uneducated and impolite

310
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,670
bounder!

311
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,870
How could there be such a silly man?

312
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,550
Don't stop, huh?

313
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,360
Try me.

314
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,840
I'm gonna call the police right away.

315
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,000
Just you wait!

316
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,790
Smash, smash...

317
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,000
Are you out of your mind?

318
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,910
She was cursing you.

319
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,080
Don't you feel good to hear that?

320
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,200
Come on.

321
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,960
Don't think she's cursing you.

322
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,150
Instead,

323
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,670
she's cursing your father,

324
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,390
his mistress, villains,

325
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,000
hypocrites,

326
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,750
and anyone else who once hurt you.

327
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,000
Does it make you feel better?

328
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,310
Who's this?

329
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,550
You drive a Bentley and so what?

330
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,200
Why did you flash the light?

331
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,790
Xu Yanshi.

332
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:19,830
What are you doing here?

333
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,030
To pay you a visit.

334
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,440
He's your friend?

335
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,960
Quite quick-tempered.

336
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,510
You know each other?

337
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,720
This is Lin Kairui,

338
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,070
my boss.

339
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,270
This is Qing, my good buddy.

340
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:31,590
Why...

341
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,480
Why am I

342
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,830
your boss?

343
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,160
I'm also his good buddy.

344
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,790
You didn't go back to Hangzhou?

345
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,680
I don't want.

346
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,480
If I went back,

347
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,000
my mother would urge me to get married.

348
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,720
Annoying.

349
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,160
Then why did you come here

350
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,790
instead of staying at home?

351
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,200
You have to ask Ye Siqin.

352
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,200
She told her parents

353
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,920
she bought a flat in Shanghai.

354
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,200
Her parents

355
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,510
insisted on coming

356
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,200
and checking it.

357
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,160
She had no choice,

358
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,680
but to borrow my flat.

359
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,000
And I had no choice,

360
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,720
but to come to your flat

361
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,640
for a few days.

362
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,550
Your father is upstairs, huh?

363
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,880
I should go say hello.

364
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,400
I'll stay over for nights, after all.

365
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,240
What's wrong?

366
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,510
His father...

367
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,110
His father wants his brother back now.

368
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,590
Isn't it outrageous?

369
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,310
Wait, wait.

370
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,070
A minute.

371
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,510
Let me straighten it.

372
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,030
Umm...

373
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,030
After your mother went abroad,

374
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,640
your father

375
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,440
married his secretary

376
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,920
and had a son.

377
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,640
Right?

378
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,920
Then,

379
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,550
after having this boy,

380
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,440
his mother

381
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,030
took away

382
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,030
all your father's money.

383
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,960
Your father was in huge debt.

384
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,590
You worked hard

385
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,880
to pay off

386
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,110
all his debts.

387
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,590
Then this woman came back,

388
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,030
saying she would give your brother

389
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,440
a complete home.

390
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,920
Then your father

391
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,400
kicked you away.

392
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,350
He totally ignored you, his own son.

393
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,830
Am I right?

394
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,510
Incredible.

395
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,880
Seriously, Yanshi,

396
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,510
your story is even more dramatic

397
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,160
than a TV drama.

398
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:27,830
However,

399
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,240
I think

400
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,960
your condition of having

401
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,480
no family burden

402
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,270
kind of makes me jealous.

403
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,920
Think about it.

404
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,830
You'll get married sooner or later.

405
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,550
And you'll have your children.

406
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,750
Let's talk about nothing,

407
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,920
but Xiang Yuan.

408
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,030
Think about her temper.

409
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,240
Not to mention your father,

410
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,790
she can't even get along
with your mother.

411
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,830
Isn't this great?

412
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:47,960
Before marrying her,

413
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,550
you solved the problem between them.

414
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,750
He's absolutely right.

415
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,750
Think about Zhang Yi.

416
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,270
Every day,

417
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,920
he watches his wife quarrel
with his mother.

418
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,880
Rather a fierce struggle.

419
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,030
Quite a lot of trouble.

420
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,030
And who's he?

421
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,160
Qing,

422
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,240
speaking ill of me
behind my back again?

423
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,440
This is the truth.

424
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,000
You came so soon.

425
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,720
My mother didn't allow me to go home.

426
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,680
What a bother!

427
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:11,920
So, when Qing called me,

428
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,030
I came right here.

429
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,240
Hello. I'm Lin Kairui.

430
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:14,920
Nice to meet you.

431
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,750
There you are, guys.

432
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,480
Such a great car, huh?

433
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,640
Whose is it?

434
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,830
Come on, don't bother.

435
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:23,920
Just sit on it.

436
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:24,880
I'll sit on it.

437
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,510
OK.

438
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,720
Now that we're all here,

439
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,110
I'll arrange something.

440
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,550
OK.

441
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,880
Good idea.

442
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,540
Shh.

443
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,030
Why is it you again?

444
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,110
Where are you going?

445
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,350
Same old rule.

446
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,110
Before Grandpa gets up
tomorrow morning,

447
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,640
pretend we stay there in bed.

448
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,200
OK.

449
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,480
Bye-bye.

450
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,590
Bye-bye.

451
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,480
But Xu Yuan is married.

452
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,160
Who is she hanging out with?

453
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,270
Xiang Yuan!

454
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:55,920
(Sorry,)

455
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,790
(the phone you are calling
is powered off.)

456
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,310
(The phone you are calling
is powered off.)

457
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,110
(Sorry...)

458
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,920
You?

459
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,790
What?

460
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,480
Can't I come?

461
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,790
You followed me?

462
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,350
Why would I follow you?

463
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,440
It's New Year's Eve.

464
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,790
What are you doing here?

465
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,460
(Zhang Yi)

466
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,350
They're outside the downtown.

467
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,160
Guys,

468
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,400
it's the Spring Festival

469
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,510
and the pubs are closed.

470
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,750
Only this one is open.

471
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,830
But the atmosphere is good.

472
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:46,550
Come on.

473
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,400
Cheers.

474
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:47,750
Cheers.

475
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,790
- Happy Spring Festival!
- Happy Spring Festival!

476
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,480
Come on. Let's play games.

477
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,510
- Games.
- Come on.

478
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,880
You and I do this.

479
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,400
- I do this.
- Hello.

480
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,350
- And you do this.
- Where are you?

481
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:01,830
And...

482
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:02,550
Come on, you lost.

483
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,920
- Drink.
- I'm sorry.

484
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,720
- When people live,
- When people live,

485
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,070
- they get hurt.
- they get hurt.

486
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,550
- One for that.
- One for that.

487
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,960
- Three for that.
- Three for that.

488
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,640
Fine, I lost.

489
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:10,960
Come on.

490
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,270
Next.

491
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:16,830
What?

492
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,720
Where are you going?

493
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,400
Xiang Yuan?

494
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,110
Your bouquet.

495
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,310
Feng Jun?

496
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,440
What's he doing here?

497
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,110
Who?

498
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,160
Who's that?

499
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,200
Calm down.

500
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,070
Why did you come together?

501
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,960
Why is your phone powered off?

502
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,270
What about you?

503
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,000
You told me you were
accompanying your grandpa.

504
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,590
Why did you come with him to a pub?

505
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,200
You're also in the pub!

506
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,310
You didn't answer the phone or text back.

507
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,070
How could you complain about me?

508
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,070
Hey, pretty.

509
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,550
Looking for someone?

510
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,030
- Have a drink with me.
- Get your hand off me!

511
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:04,880
Drink with me.

512
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,510
Let me go.

513
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,920
Don't walk away. Let's drink.

514
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,440
I said, let me go!

515
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,680
- Get your hand off me!
- Pretty.

516
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,480
I said, let me go!

517
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:12,920
What are you doing?

518
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,920
What do you think you're doing?

519
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,240
Who are you?

520
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,160
Don't push it.

521
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,830
Do you hear?

522
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,310
Xiaoman, stay away.

523
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,240
What will you do?

524
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,750
- That's our wine!
- That's our wine!

525
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,720
What do you want?

526
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,350
Brother?

527
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,510
Whose brother?

528
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,270
That's Xiang Jiamian, my brother!

529
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,000

Smells like

you drank a lot, too.

540
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,270
When I was away,

541
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,110
you had quite a good time.

542
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,000
Feng Jun is really thoughtful.

543
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,790
The bouquet looks great, too.

544
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,640
It has to be.

545
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,310
I picked the bouquet

546
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,790
for someone

547
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,640
and delivered it to him personally,

548
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,680
as a surprise for New Year's Eve.

549
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,510
Sadly,

550
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,440
I didn't see who I wanted to see

551
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,110
but met

552
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,160
who I didn't want to meet.

553
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,110
You went to my home?

554
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,440
If I hadn't

555
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,030
come here with Feng Jun,

556
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,270
I wouldn't see you today, right?

557
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,310
Why did you avoid it?

558
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,160
Watch out for the steps.

559
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,640
OK.

560
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,480
Xiang Yuan!

561
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,030
Xiang Yuan?

562
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,350
Xiang Yuan!

563
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,030
Hey, bro,

564
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,160
did you see my sister?

565
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,270
No idea.

566
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,550
But she can't be here.

567
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,640
I'm going home with my brother.

568
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,680
Why did you avoid me?

569
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:36,590

♪Slowly approaching you

577
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,750
What's wrong?

578
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,000
Feeling bad?

579
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,200
My father took away Xu Chengli.

580
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,310
Xiang Yuan's brother.

581
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,200
Umm...

582
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,160
I got a taxi for you.

583
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,400
It's waiting at the door.

584
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,400
Your sister left, too.

585
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,590
You should go back home.

586
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,310
What? She left?

587
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,680
What about the man who hugged her?

588
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,830
He left, too.

589
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,960
And I saw them

590
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,030
leave separately.

591
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,110
During the festival time,

592
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,720
it's hard to get a taxi.

593
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,720
Don't keep the driver waiting.

594
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,110
Fine. Thank you, then.

595
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:39,480
See you.

596
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,030
OK. I should go.

597
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:40,400
Bye-bye.

598
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,030
Why aren't you leaving?

599
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,590
I'm waiting for the designated driver.

600
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,310
- OK, got it.
- See you.

601
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,110
Happy Spring Festival!

602
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,160
Happy Spring Festival! Be happy!

603
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,880
- OK.
- Farewell.

604
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,550
Be careful.

605
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,750
Promise me.

606
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,200
Whatever happens,

607
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,830
don't keep it from me.

608
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,400

No idea.

674
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,920
Watching a movie, maybe.

675
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,160
He doesn't like us,

676
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,030
indeed.

677
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,400
He would rather watch a movie

678
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,790
than play mahjong with us.

679
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,110
Think about his head.

680
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,270
How could he be so clever?

681
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,590
You don't know, huh?

682
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,400
His mother is clever.

683
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,640
Don't tell anyone else.

684
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,350

685
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,160
His mother is

686
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,400
a very famous architect abroad.

687
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,880
Very, very famous.

688
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,720

689
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,240
Princeton Prize.

00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,400

693
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,200
Almost.

694
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:16,830

00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,550
No one knows why,

696
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,240
but she married Xu's father.

697

His father, after all,

698
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,110
isn't a very decent guy.

699
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,720

725
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,480
It's OK. Tell me.

726
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,750
I won't tell Jiamian.

727
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,920
Do you need any help?

728
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:11,320
I can cheer for you.

729
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,070
Or I can ask Bai to buy you a bouquet.

730
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:16,070
Or shall I write a banner for you?

731
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,280
(Banner?)

732
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,800

00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,760

739
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,510
(There was a little boy)

740
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,320
(who had never tasted any chewing gum.)

741
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,000
(One day, you gave him)

742
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,070
(a chewing gum,)

743
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,190
(lying to him)

744
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,000
(that your grandpa)

745
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,840
(brought it back from abroad)

746
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,590

750
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,400
(But you told him)

751
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,760
(it was ordinary chewing gum)

752
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,440
(and within seven days,)

753
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,800
(he would die
of intestinal strangulation)

754
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,230
(unless he got an immediate operation.)

755
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,320
(Soon,)

756
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,360

(It was the first time)

760
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:25,320
(that he had felt
how bad a girl could be.)

761

(Did I meet him that early?)

931

00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,960
Whenever she had time,

936
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,030

Three days?

954
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,510
Yes, indeed.

955
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,280
Explain.

956
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:06,360
Why did it take you three days?

957
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,360
Grandpa,

958
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,440
it's done.

959
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,280
I'll get back and tell you

960
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,000
what I did.

961
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:36,630
I was thinking, now that I was there,

962
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:37,800
I...

963
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,630
I should at least taste some food.

964
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,000
Like hot-dry noodles, Doupi,
[*Glutinous rice with minced meat]

965
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,150
Chinese doughnuts,

966
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:46,880
and eggnog. Right?

967
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:52,920
Just...

968
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:54,760
Just break up.

969
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,150
Come on, just...

970
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:59,280
(Breakup)
Just break up.

971
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,400
Isn't it great?

972
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,510
It's good.

973
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:03,800
Grandpa, doing calligraphy, huh?

974
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:05,670
Let me tell you what.

975
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,190
I successfully broke

976
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:08,280
into them

977
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,320
and caused some trouble

978
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,400
to them.

979
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,110
Cool, aren't I?

980
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:13,150
Yes.

981
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,670
You nearly fail in everything.

982
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:16,880
But in bullying your sister,

983
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,000
you're always the best.

984
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:18,670
Come on.

985
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,400
It's just because

986
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,280
I have your genes, Grandpa.

987
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,480
OK. Tell me about it.

988
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,400
How did you break into them?

989
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,320
Well,

990
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,480
I told Xu Yanshi that Xiang Yuan

991
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,880
was once in love with Down.

992
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,880
Xu Yanshi

993
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,480
got immediately embarrassed.

994
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,000
She isn't back yet.

995
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,510
I guess they're breaking up.

996
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,920
Come over.

997
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,510
What, Grandpa?

998
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:45,030
I'll break you up first!

999
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:45,880
What the heck!

1000
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:47,400
Are we so poor

1001
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,710
that you can't afford the Internet

1002
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:49,230
or did you forget

1003
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:50,190
the password

1004
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:51,110
of your Wi-Fi?

1005
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:51,510
Come on.

1006
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:52,880
What does Xu Yanshi

1007
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,030
have to do with Wi-Fi, Grandpa?

1008
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:55,630
Down is Xu Yanshi.

1009
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:56,630
Don't you know?

1010
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:58,480
Xu Yanshi is Down?

1011
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,280
All right.

1012
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,110
Stop working

1013
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:01,710
on your flight base.

1014
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,670
I beg you.

1015
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:04,550
Surf the Internet more often, OK?

1016
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:05,440
Not to mention

1017
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,480
those young people,

1018
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,280
you can't even make conversation
with me,

1019
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:08,880
Jiamian.

1020
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:09,480
But...

1021
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:11,920
Xu Yanshi is Down?

1022
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,630
Or you can say, Down is Xu Yanshi.
