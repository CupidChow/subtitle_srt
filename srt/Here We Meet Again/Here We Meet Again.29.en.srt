72
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,360
we should always

00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,190
or if he's tired

192
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,160
to manage such a big company alone?

00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,480
to take over the company?

196
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,390
Why didn't you

197
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,430
push your grandchildren?

198
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,920
Their grandma told me

199
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,830
not to make them choose.

200
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,830
She asked me

201
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,000
not to push them.

202
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,950
I had wanted to say this.

203
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,600
And you, Xiang Yuan.

204
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,720
You were born

205
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,720
in this rich family

206
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,950
and have enjoyed a lot.

207
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,270
You should bear

208
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,870
corresponding responsibilities.

209
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,480
Sometimes, really,

210
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,750
I feel sorry for Mr. Situ.

211
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,870
Where are you going?

212
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,270
Don't worry.

213
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,670
Let's not rush.

214
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,790
Now,

215
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,000
it hasn't been verified.

216
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,790
Wait, please.

217
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,000
Later, we will give you

218
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,600
a... a...

219
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,480
A definite answer.

220
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,540
(Yang Pingshan proposed a divestment,
Donghe might lose the power of control.)

221
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,270
Those are

222
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:29,840
just rumors.

223
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,150
Don't be nervous, OK?

224
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,740
I called you a couple of days ago.

225
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,420
(Donghe will not survive.)

226
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,380
(Donghe has huge staff changes.
Donghe lost its core technology.)

227
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,120
Hello.

228
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,630
Interview?

229
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,270
Talk later.

230
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,360
OK. Bye-bye.

231
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,480
Wang, you're resigning, too?

232
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:44,910
Yes.

233
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,910
What about you?

234
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,030
Me, too.

235
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,960
Yes, yes.

236
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,870
OK, OK.

237
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,870
Don't worry. Wait, please.

238
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,390
We're verifying this.

239
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,750
(Yang Pingshan, Vice Chairman)
Now, I'll take

240
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,790
Yang Pingshan's place.

241
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,600
OK.

242
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,630
Show me the report of last month.

243
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:23,440
OK.

244
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,620
(Yang Pingshan, Vice Chairman)

245
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,870
Miss Xiang,

246
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,630
many websites

247
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,840
are having news and topics

248
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,150
about our company.

249
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,240
Do we need to give

250
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,480
some emergency explanations?

251
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,320
No.

252
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,150
The more we explain,

253
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:41,960
the more netizens will think

254
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,720
we're covering something.

255
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,240
Solving problems would be better.

256
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,840
Covering problems wouldn't help.

257
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,790
Our own problems

258
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,600
can't be neglected.

259
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,550
Go tell our employees

260
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,080
to keep screenshots

261
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,200
of all rumored reports.

262
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,600
Whether to sue them later

263
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,910
will be decided

264
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,240
after things die down.

265
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,200
Got it.

266
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,360
Hello, Miss Xiang.

267
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,750
I'm the HR director.

268
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,870
Mr. Lyu took away

269
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,080
many backbone technicians.

270
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,870
Now,

271
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,870
several important projects

272
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,360
need technical support.

273
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,550
We have to recruit suitable technicians

274
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,790
as soon as we can.

275
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,320
Transfer some from our branches first

276
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,910
and ask headhunters to poach some.

277
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,120
OK. Got it.

278
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,200
Miss Xiang,

279
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,360
this is the report you asked for.

280
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,240
Please review it.

281
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,200
Put it here.

282
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,720
OK.

283
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,200
(At this moment,)

284
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,750
(where can I get some technicians?)

285
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,740
(Xu Yanshi)

286
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,870
(Are you back?)

287
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,600
(Is the Conference over?)

288
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,120
It's a little bit hot.

289
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,240
Drink it later.

290
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,240
- Xiang Yuan.
- Shan?

291
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,390
I came to check up on Mr. Situ.

292
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,630
Is he all right?

293
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,030
Hi, Mr. Situ.

294
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,360
Oh, Chen Shan.

295
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,320
Hi.

296
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,510
According to the doctor, I'm all right

297
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,510
and I just need some recuperation.

298
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,870
You look well.

299
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,240
Thanks.

300
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,080
I know what happened to Donghe.

301
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,870
Mr. Situ, are you

302
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,390
in need of technicians?

303
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,550
I've worked in Donghe

304
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,840
for many years, after all.

305
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,840
I know

306
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,240
how hard it was

307
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,390
to cultivate Lyu Zeyang.

308
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,840
Our top priority

309
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,120
is to find a new CTO

310
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,510
in Lyu Zeyang's place.

311
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,510
Technicians can be transferred

312
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,670
from our branches

313
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,870
or be poached

314
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:03,840
from other companies.

315
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,510
For the technical department,

316
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,120
the biggest problem is

317
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,670
we can hardly find

318
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,790
a suitable CTO.

319
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,150
Do you have anyone

320
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,750
to recommend?

321
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,870
Do you know

322
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,480
Xu Yanshi?

323
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,670
Recently, he has helped Kaisheng

324
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,240
develop several projects

325
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,870
and even had the patents.

326
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,320
It made

327
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,550
a big splash in our industry.

328
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,120
He's very capable.

329
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,440
I think

330
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,720
he's the best candidate

331
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,960
for CTO.

332
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,030
You just didn't

333
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,120
cherish him.

334
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,750
When you asked him to leave,

335
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,510
he left.

336
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,030
Now you want him back.

337
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,790
Do you think he will?

338
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,000
Fine, fine, but now,

339
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,320
he's in Hainan

340
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,320
with Professor Liang

341
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,120
for the Global Navigation Conference.

342
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,550
When he's back,

343
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,720
I'll ask him about it.

344
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,720
Thank you.

345
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,510
You've been very tired these days.

346
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,960
Go back home for some rest.

347
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,200
OK.

348
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,440
Excuse me.

349
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:41,910
Hello.

350
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,600
Professor, where are you?

351
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,630
I just landed.

352
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,840
I'm going home now

353
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,670
and I'll go to the lab tomorrow.

354
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,840
Professor, here's the thing.

355
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,550
Duan Kehao and Wenwen

356
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,840
have been preparing for the paper

357
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,360
of lightweight solar wing material,
right?

358
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,840
Just now, they finally found

359
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,720
a new proportioning.

360
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,390
They plan to do the experiment later.

361
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,200
Is the director in?

362
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,510
He's out for some business.

363
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,360
But time's running out

364
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,480
for their paper.

365
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,080
So,

366
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,550
they plan

367
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,870
to do the experiment privately.

368
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,390
But I think

369
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,750
this experiment is very risky.

370
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,270
I can't stop them.

371
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,870
So, I'm calling to tell you

372
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,870
about this.

373
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,000
OK. I get it.

374
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,510
Hold them off

375
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,360
and I'll be right there.

376
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,080
OK.

377
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,320
What's wrong?

378
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,750
Some students

379
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,030
want an illegal operation.

380
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,790
I have to go to the lab.

381
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,630
I'll go with you.

382
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,840
OK.

383
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:29,870
Sir,

384
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,720
please divert

385
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,080
to 201 Material Research.

386
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,750
(Lab of the Institute of Material Research)
Which lab are they in?

387
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,790
The one ahead.

388
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,440
OK.

389
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,390
Here, here.

390
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,080
There it is.

391
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,830
(Xu Yanshi)
(You're back?)

392
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,620
(Xiang Yuan)

393
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,780
(Leader of the Other Group)

394
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,790
Why doesn't he answer?

395
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,510
Hello.

396
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,110
Xiang Yuan, what's up?

397
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,310
Lin Kairui,

398
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,110
do you know where Xu Yanshi is?

399
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,000
He's supposed to be back today.

400
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,720
But I can't get through to him.

401
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,790
I don't know, either.

402
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,480
Fine. I'll ask someone else.

403
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,270
Thanks, anyway.

404
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,440
Hello.

405
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,640
Do you have

406
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,550
Professor Liang Qin's phone number?

407
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,830
Thanks.

408
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:35,830
Hello.

409
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,750
Miss Xiang,

410
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,640
headhunters found some technicians.

411
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,310
Would you like to see them now?

412
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,750
OK. I'll be right back.

413
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,140
(Hospital)

414
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,240
Whose shirt is this?

415
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,070
Xiang Yuan?

416
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,720
Xiang Yuan, don't worry.

417
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,960
He's all right.

418
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,720
I just knew he was wounded.

419
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,350
He asked me not to tell you

420
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,680
in case you were worried.

421
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,030
He said he was all right,

422
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,590
as normal as before.

423
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,310
Don't worry.

424
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,200
Here we are.

425
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:33,830
Mrs. Qin,

426
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,720
it was

427
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,680
just a little accident.

428
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,480
No big deal.

429
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,000
There you are.

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,460

What's sound out there?

443
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,240
So weird.

444
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,000
Umm...

445
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,440
They're eating oranges.

446
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,510
Come on.

447
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,960
When you were back in Shanghai,

448
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,200
why didn't you go to the lab

449
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,750
instead of going home?

450
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,480
If Yanshi hadn't protected you,

451
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,270
you might have been dead.

452
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,400
I didn't...

453
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,640
I just didn't know

454
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,750
technical research

455
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,960
can also be highly risky.

456
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,240
It is.

457
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,960
I warned him many times

458
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,920
but he just didn't listen.

459
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,680
All right.

460
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,960
Say no more.

461
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,350
Come on.

462
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,590
Why haven't they stopped yet?

463
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,880
Will they finish a box of oranges?

464
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,640
Umm...

465
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,030
Just too many oranges.

466
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,310
What?

467
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,960
Does it hurt?

468
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,200
Wounded?

469
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,310
Nothing.

470
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,640
On my way back,

471
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,750
I went to the lab with Professor Liang

472
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,400
and had a little accident.

473
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,880
Why do you sound

474
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,160
you just did some shopping?

475
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,200
When I woke up,

476
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,240
I heard your grandpa was sick.

477
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,680
I didn't want you to worry about me.

478
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,400
I thought

479
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,750
when I recovered,

480
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,790
I could come and see you.

481
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,750
If you don't believe it,
ask the nurses.

482
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,680
I'm the most obedient patient

483
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,030
in this hospital.

484
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,030
Xu Yanshi,

485
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,240
I want to ask you...

486
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,550
Sorry.

487
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,720
Sorry to disturb you.

488
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,510
Here's the thing.

489
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,880
Liang just received a call.

490
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,070
It's about you.

491
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,960
How about you come in and talk?

492
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,400
Come in, both of you.

493
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,550
The Navigation Research Institute
just called,

494
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,350
saying you have to

495
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,790
submit your paper one month earlier.

496
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,480
After it's verified,

497
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,240
professors will interview you
immediately.

498
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:42,680
Of course,

499
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,310
restrictions are eased now.

500
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:45,720
Besides,

501
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,550
the Institute has a file for you.

502
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,270
And professors

503
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,960
are familiar with you.

504
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,240
(Congratulations, Xu Yanshi.)

505
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,030
(After enduring for five years,)

506
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,350
(you've finally got this chance.)

507
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,310
(CTO...)

508
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,550
(I'll find another one.)

509
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:05,790
Yanshi,

510
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,640
you finally get
what you've been expecting.

511
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,960
Yes,

512
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,960
but don't be too proud.

513
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,640
Maybe,

514
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,550
something unexpected would happen.

515
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,110
What if they don't hire you?

516
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,240
That's possible.

517
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:22,400
Don't talk nonsense.

518
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,310
Actually,

519
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,920
if something unexpected happens,

520
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,590
I won't be too surprised.

521
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,160
I've been used to it.

522
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,720
I'll go home

523
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,110
and get some dishes here.

524
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,880
We can

525
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,830
have a simple lunch here

526
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,920
for the celebration.

527
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,680
What do you think?

528
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,720
Lin,

529
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,240
have lunch before you leave.

530
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,240
- OK.
- Mrs. Liang,

531
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,400
don't bother.

532
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,680
My grandpa is staying upstairs.

533
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,830
I have to go.

534
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,960
I'm getting up, Professor Liang.

535
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,750
Go ahead.

536
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,550
What a good girl!

537
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,680
The orange from Professor Liang

538
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,960
tastes very sweet.

539
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,000
Is Mr. Situ getting better?

540
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,830
Yes, much better.

541
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,680
Here, taste it.

542
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,200
Wai, wait.

543
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,550
Umm...

544
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,300
(HR-Dai: An interviewee
at five this afternoon.)

545
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,550
I have some business.

546
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,550
I should go.

547
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,720
I'll come to you next time.

548
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,180
(Zheng Hesheng
Job Intention: CTO)

549
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,070
Thank you for coming.

550
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,160
Thanks.

551
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,000
OK. Thank you.

552
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,830
Today's interviewees are unqualified.

553
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,720
No other applicants?

554
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:53,830
Miss Xiang,

555
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,440
no other applicants.

556
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,270
I've given you

557
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,720
all the resumes.

558
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,440
I'll try it myself.

559
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,030
Miss Xiang,

560
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,350
I also received replies

561
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:05,200
from the managers of some branches.

562
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,550
No technicians want to come.

563
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,000
Find more headhunters.

564
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,880
OK.

565
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,820
(Honor Display)

566
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,590
Done?

567
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,680
Let's go.

568
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,110
What's wrong with you lately?

569
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,550
Tell me.

570
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,270
What's wrong?

571
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,310
Is your paper verified?

572
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:54,440
Mm.

573
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,240
Yes.

574
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:59,440
Congratulations. Your dream came true.

575
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,750
Are you fed up?

576
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,310
No.

577
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,880
How could it happen?

578
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:07,880
Do you think

579
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,110
it's dull to be with me

580
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,030
and it's reluctant to break up?

581
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,310
What are you talking about?

582
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,000
That's impossible.

583
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,880
All right, all right.

584
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,750
Let's go.

585
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,310
Put your overcoat on.

586
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,550
Don't catch a cold.

587
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,830
Bye-bye, Mr. Lin.

588
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,110
Yanshi,

589
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,350
why are you working

590
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,400
after you just got out of the hospital?

591
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,440
Don't you rest?

592
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,270
I'm leaving next month.

593
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,750
Before that,

594
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,590
I'll complete the GPS

595
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,830
of Augmented Reality.

596
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,550
Only the actual operation is left undone.

597
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,830
I'll have Bi Yuntao

598
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,680
take care of that.

599
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,830
OK.

600
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,750
Wait.

601
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,750
Your dream is about

602
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,680
to come true.

603
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,310
Why do you still look

604
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,550
so worried?

605
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,240
What are you struggling for?

606
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,680
Not for business.

607
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,720
You...

608
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,480
Had a quarrel

609
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,830
with Xiang Yuan?

610
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,590
Are women

611
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,920
all changeable?

612
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,510
If they weren't,

613
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,640
they wouldn't even be women.

614
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,270
But of course,

615
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,720
some women

616
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,920
can be different.

617
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,160
Umm...

618
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,440
Does Xiang Yuan

619
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,440
love someone else?

620
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,160
I don't know.

621
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,240
I just feel

622
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,550
she's been cold to me lately.

623
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,680
I get it.

624
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,640
You and Xiang Yuan

625
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:18,350
are having some love problems,

626
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,030
I assume.

627
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,400
Right.

628
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,790
Now that you're in trouble,

629
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,680
I have to help you,

630
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,720
my good buddy.

631
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,750
I've accumulated

632
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,110
some life tips.

633
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:30,880
Let me forward them to you,

634
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,030
as technical support.

635
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,160
They'll definitely work.

636
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,750
Don't look at me like that.

637
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,880
Feels like

638
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,070
I was cheated on.

639
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,350
I don't mean that.

640
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,240
I mean...

641
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,510
If a wonderful man like you

642
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,350
was cheated on

643
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,640
by a woman,

644
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,680
I...

645
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,270
Umm...

646
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,590
That woman

647
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,830
would be

648
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,960
rather supercilious.

649
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,110
But I have to

650
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,270
tell you something.

651
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,790
Xiang Yuan

652
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:06,750
was back in the headquarters.

653
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,680
You know, huh?

654
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,440
She said,

655
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,110
because her grandpa was in the hospital,

656
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,270
she had to take over the company.

657
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,160
Lately in Shanghai,

658
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,270
a new company was founded,

659
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,750
named Pingshan Technology.

660
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,750
It mainly develops

661
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,880
AI healthcare.

662
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,880
Do you know who started this company?

663
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,790
Yang Pingshan and Lyu Zeyang

664
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,200
from Donghe.

665
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,920
Yang Pingshan?

666
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,000
When?

667
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,510
I guess you were so busy

668
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,480
that Xiang Yuan didn't tell you.

669
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,790
When you were in Hainan,

670
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,960
Yang Pingshan

671
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,590
resigned with some employees

672
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:45,000
and backbone technicians of Donghe.

673
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,160
So,

674
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,350
Donghe is now

675
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,640
in a rather dilemma.

676
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,510
Some in our industry said

677
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,790
Donghe would close down.

678
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,400
Come on.

679
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,480
Don't have glum looks.

680
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,830
Time to knock off.

681
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,070
Let's go have a drink.

682
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,200
I'll wait for you.

683
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,400
Donghe is the company

684
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,720
I've been expecting to join.

685
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,830
- I really hope...
- It's been long...

686
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,400
- to be involved in the innovation...
- since we had a drink last time.

687
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,480
of China's medical technology.

688
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,400
I'm very satisfied with your resume.

689
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,590
I wonder if you agree

690
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,270
to be our CTO.

691
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,350
Let's take this table.

692
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,920
Sir, what would you like to drink?

693
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,000
So, what problems

694
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,550
do you need us

695
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,920
to solve?

696
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,160
Here.

697
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,830
Here's more.

698
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,030
Come on, Dog Ray

699
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,160
chose a girl over his friends.

700
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,200
When Ye Siqin called him,

701
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,030
he went right away.

702
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,920
Let's drink his wine.

703
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,880
He's like that, indeed.

704
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,750
I had planned to invite Ye Siqin

705
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,550
and we could drink together.

706
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:06,000
But Dog Ray refused.

707
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,240
Now, only you and I

708
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:07,920
can drink here.

709
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:08,640
Thank you.

710
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,440
My pleasure.

711
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,070
Enjoy it.

712
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,030
Mr. Xu,

713
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,310
do you know Zhou Yuchen?

714
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,200
Heard about him.

715
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,400
Look.

716
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,070
There he is.

717
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,510
Isn't that

718
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,550
your girlfriend?

719
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,030
Don't you go say hello?

720
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,350
No.

721
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,160
Let's drink. Come on.

722
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,640
Cheers.

723
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,160
Cheers.

724
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,720
Mr. Xu,

725
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,880
you just got out of the hospital.

726
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,200

Why didn't you tell me

744
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,030
you met such big trouble?

745
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,480
I can take care of it.

746
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,550
Yeah.

747
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,630
The way you take care of it

748
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,840
is to go to Zhou Yuchen,

749
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,190
instead of me, right?

750
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,400
You're drunk.

751
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,000
Go back home and get sober.

752
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,920
(Professor Liang,)

753
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,840
(for some personal reasons,)

00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:17,110

I still have a chance)
