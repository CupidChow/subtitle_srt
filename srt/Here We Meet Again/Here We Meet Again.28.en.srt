=Episode 28=

29
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,560
Let's do something.

30
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,560
But the problem is,

31
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,560
what can we do?

32
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,200
Including this time,

33
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,680
Dog Ray has visited Mr. Situ 19 times.

34
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,710
Even if he were a centipede,

35
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,200
he would lose his legs.

36
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,680
But Mr. Situ

37
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,310
has said nothing.

38
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,510
He's like an iron bastion

39
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,710
that can't be broken into.

40
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,430
Come on, don't talk like that.

41
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,120
You're not helping.

42
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,310
However hard it is, we have to break in.

43
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,280
We have to try.

44
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,790
Xu is our good buddy.

45
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,280
Let's think of a way now.

46
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,350
How about

47
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,790
we invite Mr. Situ

48
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,680
somewhere

49
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,680
and recommend Xu Yanshi

50
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,120
to him?

51
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,840
We can do this.

52
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,520
Print out all the certificates of merit

53
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,310
Xu has achieved

54
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,310
and show them to Mr. Situ.

55
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,470
And make a short movie

56
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,520
of Xu's love for Xiang Yuan

57
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,870
and play it on a loop.

58
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,590
- Good idea.
- Stop, stop.

59
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,400
Such ridiculous ideas.

60
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,080
Be serious, OK?

61
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,000
I get one.

62
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,910
You indeed

63
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,560
inspired me.

64
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,150
I've got an idea.

65
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,750
Let's go separately

66
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,710
near Mr. Situ's house.

67
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,430
Here, have a look.

68
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,630
Have a look, please.

69
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,360
Take a look.

70
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,360
Hello, sir.

71
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,840
Kaisheng Technology, take a look.

72
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,240
(Xu Yanshi)
Our company is

73
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,470
a leading brand

74
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,240
in automatic navigation.

75
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,750
We have many young talents.

76
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,520
Have you heard of Xu Yanshi?

77
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,560
He is

78
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,400
our project leader.

79
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,080
Look.

80
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,310
Handsome face, outstanding ability,

81
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,150
and outstanding performance.

82
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,080
Does he have outstanding herniated discs?

83
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,590
No, I guess.

84
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,120
Do you know Xu Yanshi?

85
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,710
Xu Yanshi...

86
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,120
Prince Charming of Wuqing University, huh?

87
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,840
Right, right. That's him.

88
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,870
You know what?

89
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,960
When he was in college,

90
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,520
he was the most famous student.

91
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,840
Always the best in his department.

92
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,680
He got every year's scholarships.

93
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,430
Yes, yes.

94
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,750
And I heard

95
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,870
he was so excellent

96
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,150
that Xingheng recruited him.

97
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,750
He's also doing great now.

98
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,710
I'll tell you what.

99
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,710
Once,

100
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,960
there was a problem

101
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,680
during the bidding for satellite payload.

102
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,470
Professor Liang Qin wanted some help.

103
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,840
The first man he went to

104
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,470
was Xu Yanshi.

105
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,960
He's way too excellent.

106
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,680
Indeed a model

107
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,310
for men like us.

108
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,150
Great man.

109
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,630
We must learn from him.

110
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,590
Yes, indeed.

111
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,470
He's brilliant, seriously.

112
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,080
Xu Yanshi...

113
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,560
He isn't even like a man.

114
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,710
What do you mean?

115
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,630
He's like a god, I think.

116
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,400
He is?

117
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,710
I hear

118
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,800
he pursued a girl for ten years.

119
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,190
Except for this girl,

120
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:19,950
he cared about no one.

121
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,830
He's been only attentive to her.

122
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,160
Rather a model for men.

123
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,750
You reminded me of something.

124
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,630
Once,

125
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,950
our company had

126
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,950
a very important project.

127
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,120
Xu Yanshi

128
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,240
didn't want

129
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,070
to miss the date with his girlfriend,

130
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,680
and he worked for three days and nights.

131
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,600
After his work was done,

132
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,750
he took a plane

133
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,680
for the date

134
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,630
with his girlfriend.

135
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,510
Not to mention his girlfriend,

136
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,480
even I was touched then.

137
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,070
Yeah, what a good man!

138
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,430
- Would you like to know about Xu Yanshi?
- Would you like to know about Xu Yanshi?

139
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,000
- Get to know Xu Yanshi!
- Get to know Xu Yanshi!

140
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,680
Get to know Xu Yanshi!

141
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,240
Honey?

142
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,190
Honey,

143
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,950
I'm so relieved to see you.

144
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,390
Do you know Xu Yanshi?

145
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,630
They can't even have talked to my wife,

146
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,040
can then?

147
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,720
No problem.

148
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,560
(At eight tomorrow morning,)

149
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,360
(I'll see you in Viburnum Hot Spring.)

150
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,560
(Situ Mingtian.)

151
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,480
What?

152
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,390
Oh, my!

153
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,630
Mr. Situ must have been convinced.

154
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,720
No, he wasn't.

155
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,480
You're just too young

156
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,680
and inexperienced.

157
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,630
Where will they meet?

158
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,800
In a hot spring.

159
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,360
Doesn't it mean

160
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,560
"down the drain"?

161
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,480
If Mr. Xu goes,

162
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,750
he'll have to break up with Xiang Yuan,
huh?

163
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,190
What can he do?

164
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,870
There you are.

165
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,360
Yuan has

166
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,560
instant enthusiasm for everything.

167
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,240
She gets whatever she wants

168
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,630
and does whatever she likes to do.

169
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,390
I remember,

170
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,870
when she was in high school,

171
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,680
she admired a boy.

172
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,270
It didn't last long

173
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,870
before she stopped.

174
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,120
So, I didn't care.

175
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,240
I want her to get more experience

176
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,800
in the love thing.

177
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,560
So, she'll find someone right for her

178
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,510
or someone she's right for.

179
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,870
This is her temper.

180
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,270
Can you last long with her?

181
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,600
Mr. Situ,

182
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,120
actually,

183
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,870
the boy in high school

184
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,160
you talked about

185
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,480
is me.

186
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,160
Theoretically,

187
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,560
Xiang Yuan and I

188
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,720
have known since little.

189
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,800
But we've been getting along

190
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,720
for less than six months.

191
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,360
At first, I felt a little bit sorry,

192
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,270
thinking I worried too much.

193
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,870
Maybe,

194
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,510
if I were more confident,

195
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,430
Xiang Yuan and I

196
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,480
wouldn't have missed each other for long

197
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,720
or wasted so much time.

198
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,240
But later,

199
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,920
I asked her

200
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,800
what she had done in the past few years.

201
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,510
She merrily told me

202
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,040
she played games

203
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,560
and traveled around the world.

204
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,670
On the snow mountain in Switzerland,

205
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,390
she met Leonhardt

206
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,910
and he bought her roasted codfish.

207
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,720
Would you be jealous when hearing that?

208
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,200
Not at tall.

209
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,510
Her past is full of

210
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,910
wonderful and joyful things,

211
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,150
I no longer

212
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,150
feel sorry.

213
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,910
In life,

214
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
not every moment

215
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,030
has to be meaningful.

216
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,840
It's OK

217
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,750
to waste some of them,

218
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,150
as long as she's happy.

219
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,630
I once read about a sentence.

220
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,360
"A man doesn't live"

221
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,600
"for a lifetime,"

222
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,480
''but for some moments."

223
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,080
Mr. Situ,

224
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,790
as long as I'm with Xiang Yuan,

225
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,000
either a lifetime

226
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,720
or some moments

227
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,030
would be enough for me.

228
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,030
When she no longer wants to see me,

229
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,840
I will respect her wish.

230
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,720
For everything,

231
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,440
man proposes, God disposes.

232
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,480
In most cases,

233
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,960
we have to wait and see.

234
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,360
Let's drink.

235
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,200
How about next time,

236
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,030
we meet somewhere else?

237
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,550
Enjoy it now.

238
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,120
Don't be picky.

239
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,360
Just a hot bath.

240
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,550
Don't forget I'm still examining you.

241
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,870
Be careful, or you may wash out.

242
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,550
(Old Man Situ)
(Pasternak,)

243
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,480
(the former Soviet Union poet, said,)

244
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,510
(a man doesn't live for a lifetime,)

245
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,320
(for years, months, or days,)

246
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,910
(but for moments.)

247
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,440
Grandpa,

248
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,150
when you get sick,

249
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,720
take more rest and more hot water.

250
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,840
Get more sleep.

251
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,440
But read less of this.

252
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,440
Be good, huh?

253
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,840
Coffee.

254
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,720
Thanks.

255
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,630
I just want to tell you.

256
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,440
Since you established

257
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,120
the sales incentive mechanism,

258
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,000
everyone has really been

259
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,750
more energetic.

260
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,550
And they actively proposed

261
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,750
many new sales plans.

262
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,270
The order volume keeps going up.

263
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,320
Our sales performance is really good.

264
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,910
I wonder

265
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,790
how everything's going with the platform?

266
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,630
The usage of the platform

267
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,150
has been increasing, too.

268
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,030
Guess what?

269
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,030
The number of registered trucks

270
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,960
has gone over 600,000.

271
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,790
Look at you.

272
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,550
You're glowing.

273
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:07,960
You must have had

274
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,550
a great Spring Festival.

275
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,270
Not...

276
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,870
Not bad.

277
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,440
Are you available today?

278
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,960
Yes, for the moment.

279
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,390
Well...

280
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,150
I'm sorry to say this.

281
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,000
But could you...

282
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,670
Could you help me pick up Hao?

283
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,960
I'm suddenly occupied

284
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,550
and I can't get away.

285
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,150
I know

286
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,270
this is quite abrupt.

287
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,030
But could you do me the favor?

288
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,150
OK. No problem.

289
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,120
OK? Deal, then.

290
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,790
You...

291
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,120
Hurry.

292
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,790
Drive me home.

293
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,600
But...

294
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,080
We...

295
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,960
We live

296
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,480
in opposite directions.

297
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,720
Drive your boss back home.

298
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,630
Any problem?

299
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,910
No, no, no.

300
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,600
It's my honor.

301
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:20,550
Here we go.

302
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,120
Gao Leng, be faster, will you?

303
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,790
Yuan,

304
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,480
safety first. Safety first.

305
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,270
Why do these people

306
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,000
drive so fast?

307
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,630
Miss Xiang,

308
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,910
here we are.

309
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,200
Finally.

310
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,790
Gao Leng, open the door for me.

311
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,550
Lu... Lu Dong is our big client.

312
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,840
It's normal

313
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,030
that Chen Shu talks with him on business.

314
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,240
Don't overthink.

315
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,480
I... I know.

316
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,720
I should go.

317
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,240
OK.

318
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,720
Drive safe.

319
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,720
Thanks for picking up my son for me.

320
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,870
You're welcome.

321
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,380
(Life means making some soup
for my sweetheart.)

322
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,940
(Life means making some soup
for my sweetheart.)

323
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,240
What?

324
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,070
You seem

325
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,830
to be stronger.

326
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,200
Why are you sweating?

327
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,030
I...

328
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,350
Programming takes too much effort.

329
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,160
Don't fool me.

330
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,440
I wasn't born yesterday.

331
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,000
May Day is coming.

332
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,160
I want to visit you.

333
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,240
On May Day,

334
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,240
I'm going to the USA

335
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,480
for Lin Kairui.

336
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,200
You can't see me in Shanghai.

337
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,400
How long will you be there?

338
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,240
For four days.

339
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,160
Then the holiday will be over!

340
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,720
What about April 30?

341
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm available that day.

342
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,200
To make it up for me,

343
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,240
say you miss me.

344
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,590
I love you.
[*"I love you" in French.]

345
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,000
What?

346
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,550
I mean

347
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,590
there's only one month

348
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,790
before May 30.

349
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,960
You thought I didn't know French?

350
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,110
Too shy, huh?

351
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,350
I've completed two thirds

352
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,440
of the chip-based navigation

353
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,270
for drones.

354
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,880
After the total completion,

355
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,750
the volume and consumption

356
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,270
will decline by 50%.

357
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,680
Go recheck the codes.

358
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,240
OK.

359
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,340
(Deputy General Manager)

360
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,400
What's up, Miss Xiang?

361
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,510
For today's dinner,

362
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,510
I need a male companion.

363
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,550
Go with me.

364
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,480
Is it...

365
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,880
Is it because

366
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,640
I'm too handsome?

367
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,680
Because only you're so idle
that you play with your feet.

368
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,000
Fine, fine.

369
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,880
I'll continue.

370
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,310
Mr. Lu,

371
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,000
how are you doing lately?

372
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,160
Not bad.

373
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,790
Mr. Lu, a few days ago,

374
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,070
you were getting close

375
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,550
to Chen Shu of Velin, huh?

376
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,400
But these days, I saw

377
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,240
you date Meng

378
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,480
from Tengfei.

379
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,880
You have no idea.

380
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,310
Those women

381
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,640
only want money from Mr. Lu.

382
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,350
There are plenty of women

383
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,830
like them.

384
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,030
Am I right, Mr. Lu?

385
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,310
Mr. Lu.

386
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,310
There you are.

387
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,070
OK. Sit there for some rest.

388
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,880
Life is hard for girls.

389
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,550
We just get what we want.

390
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,240
Got it.

391
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,960
Don't... Don't stop me.

392
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,270
Why do you stop me?

393
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,480
Why are you still that impulsive?

394
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,550
Did you hear

395
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,270
what he just said?

396
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:59,030
How could he say that about Chen Shu?

397
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,350
What do you want to do, then?

398
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,510
Punch him?

399
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,750
You think you're Zhang Jun?

400
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,790
Go back there.

401
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,350
But I...

402
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,590
Go back there.

403
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,720
Calm down.

404
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,400
Hello.

405
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,310
Zhang Jun.

406
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,590
What's up?

407
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,030
Do me a favor.

408
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,880
I can give you anything.

409
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,200
Really?

410
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,550
Within 100 yuan.

411
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,350
I'll hang up.

412
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,200
500, OK?

413
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,310
Deal.

414
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,830
Do you see the man

415
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,720
walking on the right

416
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,790
and playing a part?

417
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:11,640
Yes.

418
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,030
The cool guy in a sweater,

419
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,750
right?

420
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,270
I...

421
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,640
It hurts.

422
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,680
Listen.

423
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,720
Later,

424
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,880
I'll rush out first

425
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,400
to get this guy under control.

426
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,480
You follow up

427
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,750
and do the best you can.

428
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,200
Clear?

429
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:24,920
OK.

430
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,640
Here I go!

431
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,680
Hey, you. Stop!

432
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,310
Wait!

433
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,480
That man is my...

434
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,310
What do you want, man?

435
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,720
Be gentle. Be gentle.

436
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,400
Be gentle, please.

437
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,440
Please.

438
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:00,550
His driver is

439
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,830
your Kungfu master in jail.

440
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:02,920
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

441
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,070
Any better?

442
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,640
Before I told you,

443
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,000
you rushed out.

444
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,500
Shh.

445
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,350
Yes.

446
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:27,100
(Deputy General Manager)

447
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:27,830
There's something I need to do,

448
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:28,960
I'll talk to you later.

449
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,720
What's wrong?

450
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,510
Why is the long face so early?

451
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,790
It's just...

452
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,720
Gao Leng had a fight again.

453
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,960
(Looks like)

454
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,750
(I failed to stop him last night.)

455
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,790
I really hate this.

456
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,590
I don't understand.

457
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,310
Why is he always

458
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,350
so impulsive?

459
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,480
Doesn't he ever think before he acts?

460
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,510
Do you know why he had that fight?

461
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,270
I don't care.

462
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,480
Can nothing be solved

463
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,000
unless we fight?

464
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,880
Or is he

465
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,000
so insane

466
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,880
that he doesn't know

467
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,960
that's illegal?

468
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,960
Then I wish

469
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,070
he could fight harder.

470
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,880
Humph, easy for you to say.

471
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,590
I don't believe

472
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,750
you can still say this

473
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,550
if Xu Yanshi fights someone.

474
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,030
I feel you've been having huge prejudice

475
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,400
against Gao Leng.

476
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,640
I haven't.

477
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,510
Let's put it another way.

478
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,440
Life, actually,

479
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,240
is like a train.

480
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,640
Every one of us

481
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,880
gets on the train happily

482
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,790
with our own destination.

483
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,110
On the way, we meet

484
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,640
some friends.

485
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,350
These friends

486
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,830
have their own destination, too.

487
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,070
So, they will get off the train
as they wish.

488
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,200
In the end, you'll realize

489
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,830
like-minded friends

490
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,030
get fewer and fewer.

491
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,680
We get lonelier and lonelier, too.

492
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,480
Suddenly one day,

493
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,310
when you look back

494
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,480
and see a man

495
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,110
accompany you all the way,

496
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,720
you'll think he has the same destination

497
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,590
as yours.

498
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,270
No, actually.

499
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,750
Just to keep you company,

500
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,160
he discarded his destination

501
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,030
and many chances

502
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,680
to get off along the trip.

503
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,160
Come on.

504
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,310
Why do you say this

505
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,400
in the early morning?

506
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,750
I just mean that.

507
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,000
You can understand, right?

508
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,480
Don't keep me guessing.

509
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,440
I'm not keeping you guessing.

510
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,640
I'm talking about Gao Leng.

511
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,070
To make you happy,

512
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,350
Gao Leng has changed a lot.

513
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,960
I hope you can be fair to him.

514
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,240
He's really done a lot for you

515
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,480
and changed a lot, too.

516
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,440
He's no longer what he used to be.

517
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,480
I know Lu Dong is pursuing you.

518
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,270
But he isn't

519
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,790
a very good guy.

520
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,590
So, I don't want you

521
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,790
to be deceived by him.

522
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,830
What are you talking about?

523
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,790
He's just a client.

524
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,680
Fine.

525
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,310
Then, I'll give his order

526
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,480
to Shi Tianyou.

527
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,510
You don't get involved.

528
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,920
What do you mean?

529
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,920
Why can you take away my client

530
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,310
without telling me before?

531
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,590
What's wrong?

532
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,920
What's going on?

533
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,680
Chen Shu, I don't want a quarrel.

534
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,480
I just want to tell you...

535
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,960
- Xiang Yuan...
- Gao Leng actually...

536
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,790
Do you think

537
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,590
a woman like me

538
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,240
only deserves someone like Gao Leng?

539
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,680
What are you talking about?

540
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,830
What's bad about Gao Leng?

541
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,240
He's fine.

542
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,270
But you're not.

543
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,030
I'm not like you.

544
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,590
You never need to worry

545
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,440
about anything in life.

546
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:34,960
Do you know

547
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,000
how hard

548
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,640
I have to try

549
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,960
to live a life

550
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,590
I've been living now?

551
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,680
It's my freedom

552
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,720
to pick a boyfriend.

553
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,880
Please don't interfere

554
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,440
with my life

555
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,880
or any of my clients.

556
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,200
I never want to interfere

557
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,960
with your life or clients.

558
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,310
That's your freedom.

559
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,350
But if you met someone

560
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,160
who truly loved you,

561
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,030
I wouldn't be interfering

562
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,110
like this!

563
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,550
At the party last night,

564
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,880
Lu Dong brought another woman.

565
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,350
If you really want

566
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,830
to be one of his women,

567
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,480
go ahead.

568
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,510
Fine.

569
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,200
I'll go ahead.

570
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,510
Hijack.

571
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,400
I don't want the money.

572
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,590
I want you.

573
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,510
Xu Yanshi?

574
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,270
What?

575
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,160
Can't you even recognize

576
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,350
my voice?

577
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,720
But you're supposed
to be on a business trip.

578
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,440
I stood Dog Ray up.

579
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,720
What happened?

580
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,750
You don't look very happy.

581
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,550
In my office,

582
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,830
I quarreled with Chen Shu.

583
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,720
For business?

584
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,640
For Lu Dong.

585
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,200
He's still pursuing you?

586
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,160
No, no.

587
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,160
He's pursuing Chen Shu.

588
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,270
In short,

589
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,270
Gao Leng and I

590
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,310
went to a party last night.

591
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,750
We heard Lu Dong said

592
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,350
he just messed around with Chen Shu

593
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,160
and was playing all the time.

594
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,310
Gao Leng was annoyed.

595
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,270
He brought Zhang Jun there,

596
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,160
to punch Gao Leng...

597
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,750
No, no, to punch Lu Dong.

598
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,510
And then...

599
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,070
I don't know why,

600
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,200
but he came back,

601
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:36,640
beaten black and blue.

602
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,960
Then Chen Shu thought

603
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,750
Gao Leng was too impulsive and childish.

604
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,510
So, I quarreled

605
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,030
with her.

606
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:41,790
Because I think

607
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,200
Gao Leng defended her.

608
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,440
Am I clear?

609
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:47,930
Yes.

610
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,750
So, so...

611
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,750
Gao Leng is really pathetic.

612
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,590
How about you talk to Chen Shu?

613
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,350
I think your words

614
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,790
work better than mine.

615
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,480
I think

616
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,550
I should talk to Lu Dong first.

617
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,270
About what?

618
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,550
What do you think?

619
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,240
I swear. I swear.

621
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,160

you have to be here.

857
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,110
OK. Bye-bye.

858
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,030

859
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,030
What are you doing here?

860
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,400
To ask him about some business.

861
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,360
You don't even work in the same company.

862

However important it is,

863
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:17,710
you don't need to talk

864
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,440
so late, do you?

865
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:22,840
Turn around.

866
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,030

00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,480

872
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,230

The Global Navigation Conference

912
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,190
I told you about has been scheduled.

913
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,230
At the end of October.

914
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,630
Are you available?

915
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:36,840
In 1993,

916
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:39,510
the American government

917
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,550
closed down the GPS

918
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,960
so that our ships

919
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,710
didn't know where to go.

920
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:46,710
At that time, we thought

921
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:47,760
we had to build

922
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,400
a satellite navigation system

923
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,710
of our own.

924
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,320
In 2000,

925
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:54,710
BDS-1

926
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,510
was built.

927
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:01,070
We became the third country

928
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,030
that had

929
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:04,550
its own navigation system.

930
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,510
In 2012,

931
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,440
BDS-2 was built.

932
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:11,190
Now,

933
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,030

934
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:15,030
would you make contributions

00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:16,880
for BDS-3?

936
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,110
- Yes!
- Yes!

937
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:19,760

00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:37,630
As for the Conference,

946
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:38,800
you'll go with me.

947
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,320

submit a paper.

952
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,150

953
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:49,230
that's a problem for you.

00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:54,630
I'll show it to other professors

958
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,710
so that they can write
letters of recommendation.

959
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:58,440
Don't be too modest.

960
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,190
Make your resume detailed.

961
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:02,110
Professors are demanding.

962
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,360
And you should be mentally prepared.

963
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,920
In the Research Institute,

964
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,510
the job is quite different.

965
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:12,000
Lower pay

966
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:13,190
but more work.

967
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:15,070
It's dull, too.

968
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,030
It's OK.

969
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:19,840
Professor Liang,

970
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:21,000
excuse me.

971
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:21,510
OK.

972
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:28,630
Miss me?

973
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,360
I knew it.

974
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:40,150
You don't hug me just on the second day.

975
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:46,920
Who's that?

976
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:48,280
Professor Liang.

977
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,070
Don't worry.

978
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:02,510
No matter what happens,

979
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:03,960
he's always very calm.

980
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:07,670
How long have you been together?

981
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,880
- For half a year.
- For half a day.

982
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,480
You pursued him?

983
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,880
I pursued her.

984
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:20,960
When are you getting married?

985
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:23,480
It's too soon.

986
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,960
It's not within our plan, yet.

987
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:26,110
Why?

988
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:28,480
You're afraid that he gets your properties?

989
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,880
No, I...

990
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,550
Professor Liang, don't tease her.

991
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,110
She'll take it seriously.

992
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:35,710
Fine, fine.

993
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:36,590
I won't disturb you

994
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:37,230
young guys.

995
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:38,030
I should go.

996
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:38,880
Have a quick review

997
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,000
of this file.

998
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:44,670
Get married soon.

999
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,840
And have a baby as soon as possible.

1000
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,440
Let me walk you out.

1001
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,070
Did Professor Liang tell you

1002
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:00,760
about the Global Navigation Conference?

1003
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:01,760
You knew that?

1004
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,150
Yes, before the Spring Festival.

1005
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,880
In case your hope would be in vain,

1006
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,150
I didn't dare to tell you in advance.

1007
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,150
In case I had bad luck again?

1008
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:12,440
It wouldn't happen.

1009
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,440
You have me.

1010
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:14,920
With me around,

1011
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,960
you'll always have good luck.

1012
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,070
