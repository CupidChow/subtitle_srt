Xu Yuan,

30
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,400
I'm dead!

31
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,760
What? Who killed you?

32
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,430
What happened?

33
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,400
Why didn't I know?

34
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,510
Ask Zhong Ling.

35
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,070
Zhong Ling,

36
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,280
what's wrong with you?

37
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,680
You're about to win.

38
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,040
Sorry,

39
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,230
I didn't see

40
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,400
Xiang Yuan in front of me.

41
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,590
Tossed my flash bang
at the wrong target.

42
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,920
I'm so sorry.

43
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,480
Be careful next time.

44
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,680
Xu Yuan.

45
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,840
I'm down again.

46
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,800
Zhong Ling, what the heck!

47
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,840
Did you do that purposefully?

48
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,190
You just want Bei and Xiang Yuan

49
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,560
to go watch a movie, huh?

50
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,190
Sorry, sorry.

51
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,840
I really didn't mean that.

52
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,400
Bei, let me check for you

53
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,630
what movies are on tonight.

54
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,870
Romantic movie!

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,870
Romantic movie, please.

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,030
OK.

57
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,870
Sorry.

58
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,710
I blundered.

59
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,240
You...

60
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,400
It's OK, Bei.

61
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,560
I'll go with you later.

62
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,030
Go away.

63
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,240
Li Yang,

64
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,870
- it took you so long in the toilet.
- He's pissed off.

65
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,120
Where are they?

66
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,030
No idea.

67
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,800
Is Xu Yanshi

68
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,150
courting Xiang Yuan?

69
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,030
But I think Xiang Yuan
is courting Xu Yanshi.

70
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,310
You know what?

71
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,360
Just now,

72
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,560
to stop Xiang Yuan

73
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,840
from watching a movie with Bei,

74
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,590
Xu knocked out Zhong Ling
who was hindering Xiang.

75
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,240
Shut up.

76
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,680
Is there a pharmacy nearby?

77
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,280
Turn left and you'll see one.

78
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,960
Why?

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,800
What would you like to buy?

80
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,030
Xu Yanshi seems to have a cold.

81
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,120
I'll go get some medicine.

82
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,520
It's so considerate of you.

83
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,470
He's more considerate, though.

84
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,310
To stop you

85
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,910
from watching a movie with someone else,

86
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,310
he just knocked out

87
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,310
his unskillful and inconvenient teammate!

88
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,400
On my Official Account,

89
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,470
I can crow about this to my readers

90
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,800
for my lifetime.

91
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,590
The taxi is supposed to come.

92
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:50,710
See?

93
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,520
I told you.

94
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,680
- You don't want me to talk about it.
- Come on.

95
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,630
Let's just go.

96
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,750
Here, let me open the door for you.

97
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,520
OK, OK.

98
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,960
Bye-bye.

99
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,430
Shall I drive you home?

100
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,830
Let's walk.

101
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,560
You were

102
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,070
having a good time with them, huh?

103
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,160
Why did you come out, too?

104
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,480
Because you don't like it

105
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,720
when I get along with them.

106
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,870
There are many things I don't like.

107
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,040
Will you not do any of them, then?

108
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,680
Any examples?

109
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,430
I don't like Zhong Ling.

110
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,000
I can see that.

111
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,190
Walk properly.

112
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,510
How did you see that?

113
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,040
If you fall, I won't carry you.

114
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,430
You haven't told me

115
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,920
how you managed

116
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,240
to see that?

117
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,480
Your eyes always give you away

118
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,680
when you dislike someone.

119
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,750
What do you see in my eyes now?

120
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,310
Do I like you

121
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,390

139
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,720
ever had a girlfriend?

140
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,360
What if I say yes?

141
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,070
Really?

142
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,310
Can it be Ying Yinyin?

143
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,000
In this world,

144
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,560
except Ying Yinyin,

145
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,720
is there no other woman?

146
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,040
So, it's not Ying Yinyin.

147
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,630
Then who else could it be?

148
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,510
Who?

149
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,560
Who's she?

150
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,510
An online girlfriend.

151
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,360
How did you have an online girlfriend?

152
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,160
When?

153
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,190
When I was a freshman.

154
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,480
How did you know her?

155
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,480
In a game.

156
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,120
It's hard to imagine.

157
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,870
What could you be like

158
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,870
in a relationship?

159
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,040
And you played games?

160
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,270
Then why did you break up?

161
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,750
She asked to break up.

162
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,480
You deserve it.

163
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,920
I mean, you'll get a better girl.

164
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,920
Online dating is unreliable, after all.

165
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,720
Who knows

166
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,310
if that's a slovenly man

167
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,040
behind the screen?

168
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,160
What do you mean?

169
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,950
I had an online boyfriend, too,

170
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,310
when I was in college.

171
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,680
His name is Down.

172
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,040
He's kind of my first teacher

173
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,120
in playing games.

174
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,190
I learned to play

175
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,560
under every instruction of his.

176
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,480
Sadly,

177
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,870
he was irresponsible.

178
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,000
Totally irresponsible.

179
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,240
Irresponsible?

180
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,360
In the beginning, honestly,

181
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,960
I didn't mean to meet him.

182
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,150
So,

183
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,200
with no worries,

184
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,910
I spoke my mind to him a lot.

185
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,150
I talked to him every day.

186
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,120
I didn't know why,

187
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,670
but he always rejected a video chat.

188
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,000
So, sometimes,

189
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,510
I proposed a video request

190
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,240
very unexpectedly.

191
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,550
On one occasion,

192
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,750
he accepted it by accident.

193
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,790
He wasn't dressed, I guess.

194
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,870
Hastily,

195
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,270
he moved the camera downward.

196
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,550
Then I saw his pectorals.

197
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,440
I'm not talking about you.

198
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,480
He doesn't sound

199
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,150
that irresponsible.

200
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,360
Later one day,

201
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,030
I visited him by plane.

202
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:16,960
However,

203
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,550
he refused to see me.

204
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,510
Then, he disappeared.

205
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,670
Maybe,

206
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,270
he has some reason for that.

207
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,750
You think I'd believe that?

208
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,030
I guess he's just bad-looking

209
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,630
and faked his information on the Internet.

210
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,600
During your college life, did you

211
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,390
play Crossfire?

212
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,320
No.

213
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,030
Where are you going?

214
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,560
Wait a minute for me.

215
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,550
It's getting cold lately.

216
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,630
I saw you cough.

217
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,480
I guess you have a cold.

218
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,270
(Anti-Influenza Granule)

219
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,000
This is for you

220
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,240
and take it back home.

221
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,000
I count on you

222
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,150
to win the competition
and get the reward money.

223
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,150
If you don't mind,

224
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:13,960
I should go.

225
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,480
I called a taxi.

226
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,750
I'll get you home.

227
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,600
(Gao Leng)
(Two leaders)

228
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,440
(of our department)

229
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,240
(have been gone for two days,)

230
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,440
(and even don't reach out to us?)

231
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,120
(Calling Boss and Miss Xiang!)

232
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,910
(You Zhi)
(Why do you bother about them?)

233
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,030
(The Spring Festival is coming.)

234
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,720
(Have you bothered)

235
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,120
(about the balance of your bank card?)

236
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,670
(Gao Leng)
(I'm just caring)

237
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,720
(about single guys. You got a problem?)

238
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,270
(Shi Tianyou)
(Boss can easily have a girlfriend.)

239
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:52,960
(Look.)

240
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,480
(Even during the midnight meal,
some girls asked him)

241
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,360
(for his WeChat account.)

242
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,390
(He just didn't approve.)

243
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,080
(If he wants a girlfriend,)

244
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,960
(he can get one quickly.)

245
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,320
(The problem is he doesn't want one.)

246
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,630
(Gao Leng)
(Why doesn't he want one?)

247
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,960
(Shi Tianyou)
(According to him,)

248
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,510
(a love relationship costs too much.)

249
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,320
(That's why he only had)

250
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,600
(simple and cheap online dating.)

251
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,120
Hello.

252
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,000
Yuan,

253
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,240
I checked up

254
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,630
on those around you.

255
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,080
Who asked you to do that?

256
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,270
Your grandpa was worried

257
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,550
and he ordered me.

258
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,150
Well,

259
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,360
there is a man named Xu Yanshi.

260
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,600
Pay more attention to him.

261
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,240
He seems close with Chen Shan.

262
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,840
Chen Shan gave Xu Yanshi

263
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,870
1,500,000 yuan

264
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,720
so that Xu Yanshi

265
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,000
agreed to work in Velin.

266
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,630
Is that true?

267
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,080
Yes, of course.

268
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,480
When you went to Velin this year,

269
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,000
you were supposed

270
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,720
to be the team leader.

271
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,200
But Chen Shan objected.

272
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,750
She urged your grandpa

273
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,960
to retain Xu Yanshi's position.

274
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,960
(He can only fool those rookies.)

275
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,870
(All the veterans)

276
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,480
(have got him taped.)

277
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,240
(Sure.)

278
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,480
(His younger brother is a drag on him.)

279
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,750
(He wouldn't refuse no matter which woman)

280
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,790
(spends money on him.)

281
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,080
What did Gao Leng say?

282
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,480
How do you know it's Gao Leng?

283
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,600
Except him,

284
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,630
no one would be this bored.

285
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,670
He asked how you were doing in Shanghai.

286
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,270
(He seems close with Chen Shan.)

287
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,360
(Chen Shan gave Xu Yanshi)

288
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,550
(1,500,000 yuan)

289
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,320
(so that Xu Yanshi)

290
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,670
(agreed to work in Velin.)

291
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,000
(Even for Chen Shan,)

292
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,550
(that's a lot of money.)

293
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,960
Xu Yanshi,

294
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,600
don't you have something to...

295
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,440
(What's that to you?)

296
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,750
(You don't want to get married, anyway.)

297
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,510
(Even if he had)

298
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,440
(some love affairs,)

299
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,750
(why would you bother?)

300
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,270
(Xiang Yuan,)

301
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,750
(don't forget)

302
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,600
(what you came for.)

303
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,510
What?

304
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,670
Is anything wrong?

305
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,320
No. I just want to tell you

306
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,750
that I might be very busy later.

307
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,550
So, I have no time

308
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,720
to meet your friends with you.

309
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,960
Take my regards to him.

310
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,150
In a day or two,

311
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,270
I'll return to Velin,

312
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,360
after I've done the training.

313
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,320
Then I'll prepare for the competition.

314
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,510
How about we meet

315
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,390
at Qing's place?

316
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,720
My flat would be unavailable.

317
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,720
If you don't mind,

318
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,270
I should go.

319
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,480
Xiang Yuan,

320
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,910
you have to ask Qing

321
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,150
if his place is available.

322
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,390
If it isn't, I'll rent a coffee room.

323
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,440
After all, it won't be needed

324
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,510
after the competition.

325
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,790
My flat is unavailable, anyway.

326
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,630
Then we can prepare it in the office.

327
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,030
We can come back after dinner,

328
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,630
and no one will notice.

329
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,870
(Sounds like a secret dating.)

330
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,080
So,

331
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,440
why are you angry?

332
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,630
I'm not angry.

333
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,240
What?

334
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,480
Shall I prove it?

335
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,320
I just

336
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,320
think through something.

337
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,360
What is it?

338
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,360
Something that will never

339
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,480
work out.

340
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,870
So I don't want to waste my time anymore.

Bai!

357
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,510
Yes, sir.

358
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,600
I think I have a cold.

359
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,600
Shall I send for Dr. Zhang

360
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,910
or shall I go buy some medicine?

361
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,510
No, no.

362
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,870
Any word on Xiang Yuan?

363
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,360
Has she called?

364
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,390
I always think

365
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,440
she's been up to something wicked.

366
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,600
Xiang Yuan is back for training.

367
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,550
She's back?

368
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,160
Yes.

369
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,640
Then lock the door.

370
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,400
Three more locks wouldn't even be enough.

371
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,350
Come on. No wonder I sneezed

372
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,350
for no reason.

373
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,160
By the way,

374
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:15,110
I heard she made trouble yesterday.

375
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:21,720
Well...

376
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,640
Honey,

377
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,310
pass me the drink, please.

378
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,160
I'm a little bit full.

379
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:27,880
I need probiotics to improve

380
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,070
intestinal tract movement before sleep.

381
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,160
Thank you, Honey.

382
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,380
(Alarm clock)

383
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,510
So much for today.

384
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,400
It's getting late.

385
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,720
Stay safe on your way back home.

386
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,510
No, no, no, Honey.

387
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,680
The best part is just about to begin.

388
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,000
Let me watch it for another while.

389
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,510
I'm begging you.

390
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,200
You don't want it, huh?

391
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,590
I...

392
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,160
The next nurse will come

393
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,640
to give me a new infusion.

394
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,110
Director Gu

395
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,240
is really good.

396
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,680
His nurses are so active.

397
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,750
Here it comes.

398
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,000
He's your friend?

399
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,070
Like him?

400
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,640
You're not his type.

401
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,960
Tomorrow morning, I'll fly back to Xi'an

402
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,030
and I don't think I can often come here.

403
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,790
Don't worry.

404
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,240
I'm not a baby.

405
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,030
Anyway,

406
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,200
I have Zhang Yi.

407
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,550
You're right.

408
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,790
How have you been feeling lately?

409
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,310
Good.

410
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,480
Director Gu told me

411
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,830
that young men of our age

412
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,880
should care most

413
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,350
about our feelings.

414
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,350
I'm just thinking

415
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,030
if I should

416
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,350
get a girlfriend.

417
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,880
What's wrong?

418
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:58,830
You...

419
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,440
You've got a girl?

420
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,550
Xu, I realized something.

421
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,200
When a man falls in love,

422
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,720
however indifferent he is,

423
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,680
he will get a little bit shy.

424
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,160
What do you mean?

425
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,680
Compliment.

426
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:20,550
A transaction of 80,000 yuan on Alipay.

427
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,750
Why did you...?

428
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,110
I love the sound of the transaction.

429
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:24,960
But what...

430
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,480
Who would give me

431
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,590
so much money?

432
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,440
Except me,

433
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,070
who would give you

434
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,110
that much money?

435
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,310
Most of my money is locked up in the fund.

436
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,480
This is all I have now.

437
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,880
Keep it.

438
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,510
I don't need it.

439
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,030
Take it back. I have enough money.

440
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,750
Stop this charade.

441
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,750
Just take the money.

442
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,640
Fine.

443
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,720
I'll take it now

444
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,400
and pay you back later.

445
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,920
Really?

446
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,350
That depends.

447
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,030
Fine.

448
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,350
Take a good rest.

449
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:56,790
Text me if you need anything.

450
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,720
I'm going back to Xi'an.

451
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,440
OK.

452
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:14,980
(Donghe Group)

453
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,110
You know what?

454
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:20,830
Unexpectedly,

455
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,920
chairman has come to the company today.

456
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,160
When he was young,

457
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,960
he must be very charming.

458
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,640
Yeah.

459
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,590
He's gentle and agile.

460
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,240
That's right.

461
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:32,030
He wasn't that charming, actually.

462
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,030
Agile?

463
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,550
Just because his wife got him

464
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,750
up against the wall as a punishment.

465
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,640
He had to be very agile.

466
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,880
How do you know that?

467
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,880
Don't...

468
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,880
Don't you read gossip news?

469
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,070
Punishment? Up against the wall?
So funny.

470
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,240
Sorry, but please take the next lift.

471
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,240
No one else is here.

472
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,590
I... I have a plane to catch.

473
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,270
Young lady,

474
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,790
please take the next lift.

475
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,350
Young... Young lady?

476
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,400
Young lady, you have a plane to catch?

477
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,640
Then when you come next time,

478
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,480
leave more time

479
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,680
for transportation.

480
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,510
I wanted.

481
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,590
Then you should have given

482
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,750
more funds.

483
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,110
Or I wouldn't

484
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,920
pick a plane at this time of day

485
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,310
just to save a few hundred bucks.

486
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,440
She's daring.

487
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,240
Who's she?

488
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,790
And when the schedule is not reasonable

489
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,960
for employees,

490
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,030
isn't this really a case of

491
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,000
the boss?

492
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,000
Who's she?

493
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:29,830
How dare she talk like that!

494
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,160
She's been harsh.

495
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,720
The door is open for quite a while.

496
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,640
You get in.

497
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,720
Thank you, chairman.

498
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,030
- My luggage, please.
- Hello.

499
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:47,510
Here.

500
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,270
Here it is.

501
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:48,750
Thank you.

502
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,510
You're welcome.

503
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,200
Got it. Got it.

504
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,270
OK, OK.

505
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,310
(The driver is dashing to you.)

506
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,240
About Velin's affair,

507
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,110
don't bother.

508
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,030
I can take care of it.

509
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,680
Prepare the contract for Zhenghua soon.

510
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,960
How soon?

511
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,680
As soon as possible,

512
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,880
I think.

513
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,750
OK. I'll hang up.

514
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,480
Xiang Yuan?

515
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,830
It's really you.

516
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,350
Do you remember me?

517
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,000
I'm Chen Shan,

518
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,400
your mom's student.

519
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,310
I do.

520
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,110
Hi, Chen Shan,
it's been a long time.

521
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,070
Indeed.

522
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,110
Are you used to the work in Velin?

523
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,750
Did Xu Yanshi

524
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,030
give you a hard time?

525
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,480
If he did,

526
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,480
do tell me.

527
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,550
I'll avenge you.

528
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,500
(Schedule canceled)

529
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,640
Chen Shan,

530
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,160
who is Xu Yanshi to you?

531
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,830
What have you heard about us?

532
00:23:59,240 --> 00:23:59,960
I heard

533
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,000
when he first worked in Velin,

534
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,030
you helped him quite a lot.

535
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,440
I did.

536
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,310
Do you know Xu Yanshi?

537
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,160
He and I were classmates in high school.

538
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,510
Then you must be aware.

539
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,880
Xu Yanshi has

540
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,790
his bottom line and principles

541
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,680
that people can't usually break.

542
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,400
I know there are many rumors

543
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,550
about us in the company,

544
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,030
and for the moment,

545
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,200
there are many things

546
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,350
I can't explain.

547
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,400
But those rumors aren't true.

548
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,640
I indeed helped him a lot.

549
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,480
But he helped me, too.

550
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,400
Without him,

551
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,240
I wouldn't have gone

552
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,880
through my toughest moments.

553
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,960
Sorry for asking,

554
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:48,960
Chen Shan.

555
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,550
I'm sorry.

556
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,680
It's OK.

557
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,960
No big deal.

558
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,070
Don't worry.

559
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,750
He's a nice guy.

560
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,000
Get along with him.

561
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:01,720
No...

562
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,880
He and I aren't...

563
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,750
Here's my car.

564
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,550
Let's talk next time.

565
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,400
Bye-bye.

566
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,750
(How could you suspect him?)

567
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,310
Oh, no.

568
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,240
My plane!

569
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,860
(Indoor slippers)

570
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,310
Why do I suddenly feel

571
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,550
the office is deserted?

572
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,510
I feel the same way.

573
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,070
Qingqing, come over.

574
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:54,920
Guys,

575
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,030
in case we have varicosity

576
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,160
after sitting for too long,

577
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,790
I'll buy some indoor slippers.

578
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,440
Zhang Jun, what's your size?

579
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,160
Me?

580
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,310
I'm Size 42.
[*26 centimeters]

581
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,160
And you, Gao Leng?

582
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,160
Size 41.
[*25.5 centimeters]

583
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,270
You Zhi?

584
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,160
Size 44.
[*27 centimeters]

585
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,750
OK.

586
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,510
You...

587
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,240
Why are you Size 44?

588
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,240
What's the problem?

589
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,440
I'm a bigger size

590
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,510
because I'm tall.

591
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,750
You're not much taller than me.

592
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,790
I'm a head

593
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,480
taller than you.

594
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,480
Come on.

595
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,830
Let me check.

596
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,160
Bring it on.

597
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,200
Bring it on.

598
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,310
Come on.

599
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,790
Forget it.

600
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,160
By the way,

601
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,110
who knows the size

602
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:31,920
of Miss Xiang?

603
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,640
You have to ask Boss.

604
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,030
I'll go, then.

605
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,440
I kind of miss Miss Xiang.

606
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,480
It's weird.

607
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,680
She hasn't been here for a long time.

608
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,680
But when she's away,

609
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,400
I feel something missing.

610
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,830
Indeed.

611
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,680
Boss, tell me

612
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,830
Miss Xiang's shoe size.

613
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,720
You think I know that?

614
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,240
Size 37.
[*23.5 centimeters]

615
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,160
OK.

616
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,550
Grandpa, you're back.

617
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,830
You missed the plane?

618
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,830
Enjoy the food.

619
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,110
Yes, because of you.

620
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,960
You haven't been back home
for a long time, anyway.

621
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,310
It's good to stay for another night.

622
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,400
Try this.

623
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,880
I heard

624
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,110
you contacted Gu Yan, huh?

625
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,920
He told you?

626
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,640
Some days ago,

627
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,350
I called Gu Yan but didn't get through.

628
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,310
I was told he was
having a vacation abroad.

629
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,720
I'm confused, then.

630
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,160
Now that he was on vacation abroad,

631
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,790
why did he come back today?

632
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,440
I've never heard

633
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,750
that he rushed back

634
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,550
just for an unscheduled patient.

635
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,310
I then asked Bai about it.

636
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,750
Just a friend of mine.

637
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,720
I've never heard

638
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,510
that you asked your uncle for help

639
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,550
for a mere friend.

640
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,790
Who is he?

641
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,480
My classmate in high school.

642
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,110
Does...

643
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:14,790
Does he

644
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,310
have a chance to be your boyfriend?

645
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,350
I said I wouldn't get married.

646
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,880
I wouldn't. I just wouldn't.

647
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,510
Just boyfriend, OK?

648
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,640
Forget it.

649
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,270
I heard

650
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,350
that you've messed with big clients

651
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,790
of Velin

652
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,590
and they canceled

653
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,550
all their orders for next year.

654
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,590
The bet between us

655
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,680
can be temporarily over.

656
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,030
Come back home, girl.

657
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,350
It hasn't been a year yet.

658
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,310
For the rest of the time,

659
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,920
I promise I'll accomplish the mission.

660
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,070
Don't worry.

661
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,000
Fine, fine.

662
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,270
I'm almost full.

663
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,680
You are?

664
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,790
I have to work on the turnover!

665
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,240
Time is money!

666
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,070
She's just like an eel.

667
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,960
So slippery.

668
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:21,720
Hello.

669
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,880
Where are you?

670
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,680
I want you for something.

671
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:24,590
Give me your address.

672
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:25,920
Come on,

673
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:26,720
will you never call me

674
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,750
unless you want something from me?

675
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,640
Will you give it or not?

676
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,960
I will.

677
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,640
Yuan,

678
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,200
where are you going so late?

679
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,830
If Xiang Jiamian asks about it,

680
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,000
tell him I got my debt.

681
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,240
You only tanked your car with 50 yuan?

682
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,680
Yeah, what?

683
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,160
I did a calculation.

684
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,270
With the AC off,

685
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,720
it can go 40 kilometers.

686
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,240
Didn't the petrol station assistants

687
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,550
get mad?

688
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,680
They're very professional,

689
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,480
OK?

690
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:11,960
Besides,

691
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,550
I don't believe
no one else did that before.

692
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,070
Someone else did.

693
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,200
But not a lot of men

694
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,110
did that

695
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,750
on a luxury car like this.

696
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,350
Get off. I won't drive you.

697
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,480
That's exactly what I want.

698
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,960
I was tired with overtime work

699
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,510
and now, I have to go with you

700
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,440
for your ex-boyfriend.

701
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:27,960
Life is so hard for me.

702
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,750
Stop.

703
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,830
Not my ex-boyfriend,

704
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,000
but a rumored boyfriend.

705
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,640
To be exact,

706
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,000
he's the rumored boyfriend

707
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,830
of Ashers, the virtual account.

708
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,030
Not me, Xiang Yuan.

709
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,110
Since you know it's a rumor,

710
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,590
why don't you stay out of this?

711
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,830
Instead, you go there

712
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,400
to watch his livestreaming.

713
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,070
There's nothing between us,

714
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,270
so I don't need to stay away.

715
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:50,920
Most importantly,

716
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,510
I'm going to him for help.

717
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,640
With what?

718
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,590
Business.

719
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,750
Official business.

720
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:12,740
(Always the Best
Love You)

721
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,790
It's really hopping.

722
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,200
Can he be so popular?

723
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,400
(Karma, Shanghai Exhibition Game)
Yes, he is.

724
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,400
He's the top

725
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,270
(Karma)
professional CF player

726
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,000
of international CF games.

727
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,310
But I think

728
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,110
you, Ashers,

729
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,350
have as many fans as him.

730
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,200
I do, of course.

731
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,510
Look.

732
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,480
My friend.

733
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,680
The guest for tonight's livestreaming.

734
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,750
Go get her here later.

735
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:51,640
OK.

736
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,060
(Karma, Always the Best
Love you, Bright Future)

737
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,420
(Karma)

738
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,000
I'm exhausted.

739
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,160
I'm afraid

740
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,790
Miss Xiang can't get back tonight.

741
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,680
She emailed me

742
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,510
the related file

743
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,480
and the expansion questionnaire,

744
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,270
saying she would return tomorrow.

745
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,300
(Karma is way too lucky.)

746
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,590
Oh, my!

747
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,000
Guess who I saw

748
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,960
in Karma's livestreaming room.

749
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,510
Karma?

750
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,550
That player?

751
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,070
Yes, Karma.

752
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,110
I saw Miss Xiang

753
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,550
in Karma's livestreaming room.

754
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,160
Miss Xiang?

755
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:48,830
Xiang Yuan?

756
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,350
Does she play games?

757
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,310
Why is she there

758
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,350
with an Esports master?

759
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,920
Every day, Karma invites

760
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,510
a lucky fan as his audience.

761
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,920
What a surprise!

762
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,830
Yuan is the lucky dog for today.

763
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,750
Karma must be having sharp eyes.

764
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,030
In such a dark environment,

765
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:03,880
he managed to find Yuan

766
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,920
from the crowd.

767
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,590
He must

768
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:07,160
have had careful consideration.

769
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,440
But what

770
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,400
would Miss Xiang do?

771
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:13,750
Play a game with Karma?

772
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,790
What a wicked way to pick up a girl!

773
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:16,510
It's OK.

774
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,440
- He just wants to hit on her.
- I'll take care of this.

775
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,160
Wait.

776
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,420
Let me watch for a moment.

777
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,440
Come on, I'm the one with a shotgun.

778
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,140
(Remember to press WS to slow it down.
Small steps are the best skill, haw-haw.)

779
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,100
(I came for the award thing.)

780
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,240
No.

781
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,000
What she would do is sit beside Karma

782
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,350
and watch him show off.

783
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,460
(When Karma shot,
what were his teammates thinking?)

784
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:45,830
Look.

785
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,940
(When will he press G?)
Here, here.

786
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,750
I think Karma is so cool.

787
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,440
I can't believe it.

788
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,440
Yuan is so close

789
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,590
with Karma.

790
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,590
Umm, this...

791
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,360
Miss Xiang...

792
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,000
(Weibo)
Why did Boss log onto Weibo?

793
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,400
Excuse me.

794
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,440
Boss,

795
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,630
why did you log onto Weibo?

796
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,920
You forgot the password, didn't you?

797
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:49,960
Would you also watch

798
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,510
the livestreaming of Karma and Yuan?

799
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,440
Ouch.

800
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:54,880
The link.

801
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,070
OK. I'm on it.

802
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,550
Something's happening.

803
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,630
Look.

804
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,880
Just now,

805
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,710
(Following)
Boss followed Karma.

806
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:15,110
From now on, keep our voices down.

807
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,230
Copy.

808
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,030
Do you think

809
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,550
Boss is also watching

810
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,320
Karma's livestreaming?

811
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,840
It's not out of the question.

812
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,960
After all, Miss Xiang

813
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,030
has been picked

814
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,800
to sit beside Karma and watch him play.

815
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,670
Think about it.

816
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,630
Karma has a handsome face.

817
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,280
He plays the game excellently

818
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,400
and is good at hitting on girls.

819
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,840
If you sat beside him,

820
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,840
would you have a crush?

821
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,280
Boss has been

822
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,360
the most handsome man

823
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,550
Miss Xiang has ever met.

824
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,590
It's normal

825
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,840
that he is jealous.

826
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,190
It's just caused

827
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,190
by the male ego.

828
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,590
No way!

829
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,670
I must do something

830
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,480
for Boss.

831
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,070
He can't just give in!

832
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,510
Come on.

833
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,550
What are you going to do?

834
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,540
(Karma is way too lucky.)

835
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:06,960
Go on.

836
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,230
(Boss, I know you're watching.)
It's OK. I can handle it.

837
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,480
Why are bullet comments gone so quickly?

838
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,080
(Ship Miss Xiang and Boss!)
Challenge me?

839
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,840
How can I make

840
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,590
a colorful bullet comment?

841
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,480
It's so conspicuous.

842
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,320
How can I make it?

843
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,710
(Recharge)
It's OK. I'll get some HP.

844
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,670
Let me see.

845
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,780
(Do you confirm to pay?)

846
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,800
Don't worry. I can handle it.

847
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,800
Challenge me?

848
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,840
(Do you confirm to pay?)
Let's do this.

849
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,670
Go!

850
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,820
(Boss, I know you're watching.)

851
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,360
Go on!

852
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,590
Four.

853
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,440
Come on!

854
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,030
Left, left.

855
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,960
Shoot, shoot.

856
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,960
A headshot.

857
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,900
(I paid for my first
colorful bullet comment for you.)

858
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,660
(Ship Miss Xiang and Boss!)

859
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,550
(Boss, I know you're watching.)

860
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,550
(I paid for my first)

861
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,800
(colorful bullet comment)

862
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,670
(for you.)

863
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,360
(Ship)

864
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,630
(Miss Xiang and Boss!)

865
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,710
(Nerds of the technical group...)

866
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,440
(They must be fooling as usual.)

867
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,030
Is this guy a fake fan?

868
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,110
Why is he seeking attention

869
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,960
for his boss in my livestreaming room?

870
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,030
What's his problem?

871
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,800
Don't bother.

872
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,760
When people are watching,

873
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,960
you just go on with it.

874
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,550
Besides,

875
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,480
you met some fake fans before.

876
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,590
At the airport,

877
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:24,550
some fans

878
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,880
called you someone else's name,

879
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,760
and you replied happily, huh?

880
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,960
Gao Leng,

881
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:32,670
tonight,

882
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,070
why are you so daring?

883
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,760
Guess.

884
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,280
Think about it.

885
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,070
If Boss

886
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,630
isn't watching this,

887
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,280
he wouldn't know

888
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,480
Gao Leng used green bullet comments
[*Green here indicates a cuckold.]

889
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,000
in the livestreaming room.

890
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,280
However,

891
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,590
tomorrow,

892
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:52,920
if Boss beats Gao Leng,

893
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,230
that means

894
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,630
he watched this livestreaming.

895
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,550
Usually,

896
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,630
Boss doesn't play games

897
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,000
or pay attention to Esports.

898
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,440
For what reason

899
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,960
would he watch this?

900
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,440
Xiang Yuan is the point

901
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,630
exactly!

902
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,360
In case

903
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,840
we have something on him,

904
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,920
he will pretend

905
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,960
nothing happened

906
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,590
even if he is angry.

907
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,480
So, tonight,

908
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:22,070
Gao Leng is standing up

909
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,360
and doing what he wants.

910
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,440
Finally, he can tease Boss this once.

911
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:30,760
Good point, You Zhi.

912
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,800
You always know what Boss thinks.

913
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,280
You flatter me.

914
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:39,060
(Karma, Shanghai Exhibition Game)

915
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,110
The tenth death

916
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,710
is for you, my lovely girl.

917
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:55,000
(A helmet man shoots you from behind.
Get up and take him down.)

918
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,150
(I'm so jealous!)

919
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,920
(I wish I could be this lady!)

920
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,150
(Will Xu Yanshi see me?)

921
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,360
(Am I insane?)

922
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,880
(Why would I care about him?)

923
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,760
(Are you watching the livestreaming?)

924
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:21,290
(Yes.)

925
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,150
(How I wish to know)

926
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,590
(what man this lady is texting!)

927
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,760
(Pity for Karma.)

928
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,320
(Yeah.)

929
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,550
(The most charming man is sitting)

930
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,230
(right beside you.)

931
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,280
(Who else do you want?)

932
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,110
(These honey fans are annoying.)

933
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,510
(When facing such a great man)

934
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,150
(like Karma,)

935
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,590
(this lady can still be calm.)

936
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,550
Who are you texting?

937
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,880
My boyfriend.

938
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,360
Your microphone is still on.

939
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,150
(You have a boyfriend, huh?)

940
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,510
(Karma failed to hit on a girl.)

941
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,880
(Her boyfriend must be charming.)

942
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,030
(It's OK to say that,)

943
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,760
(but please don't be so impatient.)

944
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,320
(Weird.)

945
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,960
Does Yuan have a boyfriend?

946
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,280
She didn't mention it.

947
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,630
(Xu Yanshi)
(Boss, Yuan has a boyfriend?)

948
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,550
Are you sure?

949
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,590
Never heard of that.

950
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,550
When did she...?

951
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,190
Would you like some midnight snack?

952
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,280
My treat.

953
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,880
- Good idea.
- OK.

954
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,230
- OK.
- Nice!

955
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,460
(Game Over)

956
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,820
(Karma, Shanghai Exhibition Game)

957
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:48,380
(Prince Charming)

958
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:03,100
(Authentic Harbin BBQ)

959
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:03,840
Excuse me,

960
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,840
let me find your seats,
indoors or outdoors?

961
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,400
Outdoors.

962
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,190
- OK. This way, please.
- Sure.

963
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:06,880
Your treat?

964
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,760
Your treat, isn't it?

965
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,440
You promised that.

966
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:23,880
Boss,

967
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:25,960
can we really

968
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,280
order whatever we want?

969
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,000
Yes, if you don't have any conscience.

970
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,070
I don't have any conscience.

971
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:35,670
I just don't.

972
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:36,320
I don't have any conscience.

973
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,320
I just don't.

974
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:38,440
Waitress, take the order, please!

975
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,280
Coming.

976
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,550
Excuse me.

977
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:40,840
Thank you.

978
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,510
Have some water first.

979
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:44,320
I'd like a dish of spicy crayfish,

980
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,320
and one roast fish.

981
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:46,550
Two dishes of pig's knuckles.

982
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,630
20 skewers of lamb kidney.

983
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,550
One plate of pig ears.

984
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,030
60 lamb skewers!

985
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,510
Eight oysters!

986
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:52,510
OK.

987
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,920
Would you like something else?

988
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,510
So much for now.

989
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,880
We'll order some more if we're not full.

990
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,630
Thanks.

991
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,760
Please wait.

992
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:06,710
Wait.

993
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,190
Five grilled squids.

994
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,760
- Five grilled squids, OK.
- Thanks.

995
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,960
It feels so good.

996
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,190
Pity for Miss Xiang

997
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,710
that she isn't here.

998
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,230
Boss,

999
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,800
how about you call her

1000
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,190
with your phone?

1001
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,960
I know she isn't in Velin now.

1002
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,360
But you seldom buy us something to eat

1003
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,550
and we should let her know.

1004
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,360
Do you know

1005
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,150
what she said about you last time?

1006
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:33,510
I told her

1007
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,400
you cooked for us personally

1008
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,960
and she said you did that
just to save money.

1009
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,230
Call her, then.

1010
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:43,800
Right here,

1011
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,360
you order what she wants to eat

1012
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:46,510
and eat it for her.

1013
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,880
Pretend I invited her, too.

1014
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:50,760
Boss,

1015
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:51,960
I wonder

1016
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,510
if you'll ever find a girlfriend.

1017
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:56,710
Do you think

1018
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:57,550
Miss Xiang

1019
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:58,760
was forcing a smile

1020
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,480
during the livestreaming?

1021
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,440
Forcing a smile?

1022
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,710
Boss,

1023
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,320
you didn't know that?

1024
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,550
What?

1025
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,960
I heard

1026
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:10,590
Miss Xiang argued with the chairman

1027
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:12,030
in the headquarters

1028
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:13,440
and got a dreadful scolding.

1029
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:14,840
According to Ying Yinyin,

1030
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,920
Miss Xiang even cried.

1031
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,400
How could you believe her?

1032
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:18,710
Yeah.

1033
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,880
Actually, Miss Xiang

1034
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,190
looked good in the livestreaming.

1035
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:22,710
I don't think things were that bad.

1036
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:25,070
So, all of your group members

1037
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:26,230
watched the livestreaming,

1038
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,760
including Xu Yanshi?

1039
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,920
You know the situation.

1040
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,230
I just slipped that.

1041
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:33,760
I said, "My boyfriend."

1042
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,150
I...

1043
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:40,280
Think about it.

1044
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:42,550
If he heard that,

1045
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,150
would he think I was flippant?

1046
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:45,960
Maybe, I guess.

1047
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,920
But I understand you.

1048
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:49,150
In that livestreaming,

1049
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:49,840
you must have been worried

1050
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,150
that Karma would woo you.

1051
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,800
So, you made him drop that idea.

1052
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,030
I just didn't know

1053
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,800
his microphone was still on.

1054
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:59,000
I guess

1055
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,760
it's what always bothers a pretty girl.

1056
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,140
(Leader of the Other Group)

1057
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:09,030
If you don't want it,

1058
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:10,150
let me answer it for you.

1059
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,800
I'd like to see

1060
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,710
how charming this man can be

1061
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:13,510
that he has distracted my bestie

1062
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:14,960
the whole night.

1063
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,280
I dare you.

1064
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:18,190
Fine.

1065
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:20,230
I'll let him go this time.

1066
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:25,230
Hello.

1067
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:28,630
This isn't Boss.

1068
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:29,590
This is Gao Leng.

1069
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:30,670
I hacked into your phone

1070
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,190
and modified the caller ID.

1071
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:34,440
I'm just this great.

1072
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,360
You can't beat me, huh?

1073
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,630
I'm just this great.

1074
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:40,480

00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,710
