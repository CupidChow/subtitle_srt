30
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,760
a minute, please.

Miss Chen,

33
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,950
I know a very good pub.

34
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,560
Shall we go have a drink?

35
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,200
Mr. Li, you...

36
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,590
You're drunk.

37
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,040

Chen,

39
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,280
you didn't drink enough tonight.

40

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,840
If you don't stop,

42
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,640
I'll call the police.

Chen,

44
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,480
you're quite insensitive.

45
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,560
Do you know the relationship

46
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,960

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,240
If you lose this order,

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,030
what can you explain to him?

00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,870

to discuss business here.

55
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,000

56

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,120
Almost.

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,120
Almost done.

I'm just done talking with her

60
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,120
about our contract.

61
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,430

63
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,870
is this the car for me?

64
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,520
Yes.

65
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,080
Thanks. I should go.

66
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,590
Are you OK?

67
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,470
Yes.

68
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,310
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

69
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,590

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,240
How about I buy you a drink?

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,150
You can drink more?

72
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,240

pick whatever restaurant you like,

I asked him.

157

He rejected me.

158
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,040
He said he didn't believe

159
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,070
he would be that unlucky.

160
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,750

161
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,430

190

00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,950
how were you doing your work?

194
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,360
You...

195
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,830
Mr. Li.

196
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,630
Be careful.

197
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,920
Come on.

198
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,870
Why didn't you dry the floor?

199
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,950
Trying to get us to fall?

200
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,200
This is where people work.

201
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:33,630
I...

202
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,440
I've set up the warning boards.

203
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,360
(Caution, Wet Floor)
You must not notice it

204
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,510
since you walked

205
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,080
while checking your phone.

206
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,840
What's your attitude?

207
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,870
How could you talk like this
to your leader?

208
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,910
I checked my phone for work!

209
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:49,910
You...

210
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,240
What's your name?

211
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,440
Tian.

212
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,120
And?

213
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,270
Tian Guixiang.

214
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,670
Tian Guixiang?

215
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,790
Hired from outside, huh?

216
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,870
No, no.

217
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,670
Cao.

218
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,480
Yes, Mr. Li.

219
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,200
Have her bonus cut!

220
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,030
And tell her how she should work!

221
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,080
Dry the floor!

222
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:05,750
But Mr...

223
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,030
OK.

224
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,440
Mr... Mr. Li.

225
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,100
(Li Qin,

227
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,200

(Mr. Tian's aunt?)

232
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,320
(Oh, no. Oh, no.)

233
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,790
(I... I annoyed her.)

234
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,270
(What... What do I do?)

235
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,240
Ms. Tian.

236
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,240
Mr. Li.

237
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,720
You want coffee

238
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,240
or tea?

239
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,600
No, no, no.

240
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,120
You must be Situ Xiangyuan, huh?

241
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:37,790
Stop pretending.

242
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,240
Situ Mingtian is your grandpa.

243
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,550
You must be Situ Xiangyuan.

244
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,390
You three...

245
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,510
Come for the meeting.

246
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,150
(It's my favorite shade. Pure red.)

247
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,550
Yinyin!

248
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,000
Come on, what's the fuss?

249
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,600
The list of connections

250
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,670
has been spreading in the company.

251
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,750
Guess who the biggest connection is.

252
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,120
Who else can it be?

253
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,750
Xiang Yuan.

254
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,600
She is the granddaughter

255
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,510
of Situ Mingtian,

256
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,030
- the chairman!
- The chairman!

257
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,600
- Look!
- Look!

258
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,150
She's more powerful than you.

259
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,120
Shall we screw her?

260
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,030
No, no, no.

261
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,000
I can't even speak smoothly.

262
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,750
I don't dare.

263
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,150
Go alone if you want it.

264
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,440
Oh, gosh. How can this be?

265
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,360
Thank you.

266
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,360
- Hope we'll cooperate well.
- Hope so.

267
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,840
- Hope we'll cooperate well.
- Hope so.

268
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,670
I'll walk you out.

269
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,200
OK.

270
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,080
What would you have for dinner?

271
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,320
I don't know. No idea.

272
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,390
What about you?

273
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:48,960
I'll just go home.

274
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,240
Xiang Yuan, and Shu,

275
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,000
you're going for dinner?

276
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,480
I know

277
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,150
a very good restaurant.

278
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,440
Shall we go have dinner there?

279
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,550
But we just plan to go home

280
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,120
and order some food.

281
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,000
Speaking of that,

282
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,790
I'm really good at ordering food.

283
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,510
I know

284
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,360
a very good BBQ restaurant.

285
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,360
It even offers

286
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,390
a free grill.

287
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,870
What do you say?

288
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:16,750
Fine.

289
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,720
Let's have dinner together.

290
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,600
OK, OK.

291
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,630
Just so we're clear, you do the grilling.

292
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,750
Sure, sure.

293
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,200
I'm very good at that.

294
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,390
One more thing.

295
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,750
Your lipstick.

296
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,200
Wipe it first.

297
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,440
It tastes so great.

298
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,550
You can eat more...

299
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,240
No, or I'll have to drink more water.

300
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,440
A sprinkle...

301
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,630
A sprinkle of chili powder.

302
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,790
And this side.

303
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,510
Come on, stop.

304
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,270
Leave it to me.

305
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,080
Not my fault.

306
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,720
That's just... Very hot.

307
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,080
OK. I know, I know.

308
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,750
What has she done?

309
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,120
Umm...

310
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:12,870
Are you...

311
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:13,790
Are you really

312
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,320
Mr. Situ's granddaughter?

313
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,910
It's clear on the list, isn't it?

314
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,200
Right, right.

315
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,550
I'm sorry about what I did.

316
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,440
- Stop.
- I...

317
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,360
You wanna make an apology

318
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,240
in the way of eating and drinking
at my place?

319
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,200
Seriously?

320
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,750
Rather insincere.

321
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,960
How about this?

322
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,120
I'll treat you to some delicious food.

323
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,240
Chen Shu said you loved Japanese cuisine.

324
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,200
I know

325
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,080
a very good and authentic
Japanese restaurant.

326
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,720
It's on me.

327
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,750
Come on.

328
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,870
Propose a toast and that's all.

329
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,630
You should have told it. Easy work.

330
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,480
I... I'll drink it up.

331
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,390
You drink as you wish.

For today's meal,

352
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,080
I didn't even

353
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,150
have dinner last night.

354

356
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,200
always our director.

357
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,670
She won't only buy us one meal,

358
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,120
right?

359
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,150
Not the director,

360
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,150
but the deputy general manager.

361
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,200
Why hasn't she come yet?

362
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,600
She said she was parking her car

363
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,390
and would come soon.

364

Velin... Velin will be closed down?

368
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,000
Did the headquarters assign Xiang Yuan here

369
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,360
to close down

370
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,790

371
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,510
Im... Impossible.

372
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,030
It's possible.

373
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,750
Her grandpa is the chairman.

374

When Velin is closed down,

375
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,000
she can go back to the headquarters
and take over the company.

00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,360
But my father and I

383
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,320
don't get along very well.

384
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,240
Call him, please.

385
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,030
Just ask him.

386
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,150
If it's true,

387
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,440
we can make early plans.

388
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,000
That's right.

389
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,390
Yeah, we're buddies, aren't we?

390
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,030
This is

391
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:28,960
concerning our future.

392
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,240
Come on. Call him.

393
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:30,790
Hurry.

394
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,720
Hello, son.

395
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:38,960
Dad,

396
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,720
let me ask you something.

397
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,080
I heard Velin would be closed down

398
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,030
this year.

399
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,000
Is that true?

400
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,360
Oh, this thing...

401
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,910
Don't bother about that.

402
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,670
I've got everything arranged.

403
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,150
You can rest for half a year

404
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,720
and then take a certification test.

405
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,440
So, will it be closed down or not?

406
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,200
The senior management

407
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,390
indeed has this plan.

408
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,150
But it is

409
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,270
not your concern.

410
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,160
So, did Xiang Yuan know this in advance?

411
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,440
She did, of course.

412
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,070
Her grandpa is the chairman.

413
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:12,880
But she just became

414
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,640
the deputy general manager.

415
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,110
Maybe

416
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,160
this is the reason she came here.

417
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,480
Or why did she come

418
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,270
to Velin?

419
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,440
Sorry, I'm late.

420
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,400
Dishes aren't served yet?

421
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,480
Serve the dishes, waiter!

422
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,440
OK.

423
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,000
Enjoy your meal.

424
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,350
Why are you so quiet?

425
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,000
Come on. Let's drink.

426
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,510
(What's wrong with them?)

427
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:20,300
(Proposal to Close Down Xi'an Velin)

428
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,160
Can it be true?

429
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,590
Get in and you'll know.

430
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,160
What do we do?

431
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,420
(Deputy General Manager)

432
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,790
What's going on?

433
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:48,550
No idea.

434
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,480
What?

435
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,920
Have you got anything?

436
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,480
Get back to work.

437
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,750
Waiting here won't help.

438
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,680
It can't be true, can it?

439
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,590
Just do our jobs.

440
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,480
Thank you, Miss Xiang.

441
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,550
Come in.

442
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,160
I've been waiting for quite a while

443
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,720
before you were finally all alone.

444
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,960
So,

445
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,270
the closedown of Velin

446
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,070
is not true, right?

447
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,160
It's true.

448
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,400
But Velin's business has just picked up.

449
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,880
I'm working on it.

450
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:36,750
It can't be closed down.

451
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,440
But as the news spreads,

452
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,070
all our employees

453
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,400
are very worried.

454
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,440
Even if it's not really closed down,

455
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,240
most of them would resign.

456
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,780
(Donghe Group)

457
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:55,400
Fine, fine.

458
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,200
You've come 18 times.

459
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,030
I get it.

460
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,110
I really get it.

461
00:19:59,110 --> 00:19:59,880
Just go back.

462
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,880
Mr. Situ...

463
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,310
Repeating is always useful!

464
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,160
- I assure you,
- We get it.

465
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,030
Xu Yanshi is really a right-minded man!

466
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,440
Do remember this!

467
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,640
Sir,

468
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:13,640
what about your decision

469
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,880
on Velin?

470
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,070
I've decided

471
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,590
to give her one more year.

472
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,830
As long as Velin can

473
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,000
remain self-financing,

474
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,750
I won't close it down.

475
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,640
Looks like

476
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,240
Yuan has submitted a good report.

477
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,440
What report? I didn't read it.

478
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,270
Then why did you change your mind?

479
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,680
Because Xu Yanshi is in Shanghai.

480
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,200
What?

481
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,070
So casual?

482
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,480
That matters more than the report.

483
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,590
(Your grandpa agreed)

484
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,350
(to give you one more year.)

485
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,310
(Keep trying.)

486
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,350
(Now, I can write)

487
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,310
(really good reports.)

488
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,000
Think about it.

489
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,960
There are too many loans to pay.
I'm so stressed out.

490
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,200
Look, everyone is here.

491
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,000
What's all this about?

492
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,030
No one has explained it.

493
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,200
What's this meeting about?

494
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:36,480
Look.

495
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,400
So formal?

496
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:42,880
Oh, no.

497
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,480
Xiang Yuan will announce the closedown

498
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,350
of Velin.

499
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,720
I think,

500
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,720
even if she closes it down,

501
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,000
she must be having a reason.

502
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,720
She's no longer

503
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,160
our lovely director.

504
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,480
I'm gonna lose my job!

505
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,310
I've been working here for ten years!

506
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,270
What do I do?

507
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,640
My daughter just started primary school.

508
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,640
What could I do?

509
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,000
Yeah.

510
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,200
I have a house loan to pay.

511
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,350
There she is.

512
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,310
(Xi'an Velin Technology Co., Ltd.)
I know you're very concerned

513
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,750
about this official file.

514
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,200
This is

515
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,680
a proposal to close down Velin

516
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,070
from the headquarters.

517
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,960
Now, I can

518
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,310
officially tell you

519
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,400
that this isn't faked.

520
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
- Isn't faked?
- Isn't?

521
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,830
What do we do?

522
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,920
What can we do?

523
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,030
Will Velin really be closed down?

524
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,830
It'll be closed down, right?

525
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,440
Really?

526
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,720
Xiang Yuan, I was wrong about you!

527
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,160
Why?

528
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,830
How could it be closed down like this?

529
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,270
Will we really be dismissed?

530
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,350
Calm down, guys.

531
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,270
In the past few years,

532
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,920
our performance has been declining.

533
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,550
You must be aware

534
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,000
that we don't have a say

535
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,960
or sustainable competitiveness

536
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,480
on the market.

537
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,440
Considering the poor sales performance

538
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,240
and the bleak prospect

539
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,880
of our positioning navigation,

540
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,590
the headquarters

541
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,440
once planned

542
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,030
to close down Velin.

543
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,830
Once?

544
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:03,830
Yes.

545
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:04,750
Once.

546
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,640
Only when we do independent R&D

547
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,920
can we remain invincible

548
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,000
and find our core competitiveness

549
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,830
in this industry.

550
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,880
So, we developed

551
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,070
the Cargo Link Navigation System.

552
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,880
It's the beginning of everything.

553
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,400
So far, on our platform,

554
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,510
over 200,000 trucks

555
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,830
have been registered.

556
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,790
According to the latest feedback

557
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,880
from our users,

558
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,440
the praise rate

559
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,720
goes up to 93%.

560
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,640
As of last week,

561
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,000
18 companies

562
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,790
have been cooperating with us,

563
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,480
including Ruidong,

564
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,270
the industry leader.

565
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,030
And in 2018,

566
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,480
we've achieved the KPI

567
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,510
required by the headquarters

568
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,270
ahead of schedule.

569
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,550
The turnover is nearly 40 million.

570
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,310
So, taking advantage of

571
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,680
the development of Beidou,

572
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,680
we've found

575
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
That is

576
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,480

of Beidou, Internet, and logistics.

577
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,310
At present,

578
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,030
some platforms only offer trucks

579
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,680
while some others only offer drivers.

580
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,110
There isn't a one-step platform

581
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,480
for cargo transportation.

582
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,160
But our company

583
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,720
- has drivers, trucks, and cargo.
- Sounds like a chance.

584
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,000
When we perfectly

585
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,270
combine them,

586
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,640
we can build

587
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,640
a truck logistics ecology

588
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,310
one of a kind.

589
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,070

590
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,680
Sounds great.

591
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,350
Velin will have a bright future.

592
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,480
Guys,

593
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,790
you're the core team of Velin.

In the future,

595
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,110
Velin will have its IPO

596
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,750
and give some equity

597
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,400

598
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,550

00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,440

825
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,590
You really don't need me to drive you?

826
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,440
No.

827
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,110

00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,440

00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,360
Are you a naughty boy?

837
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,630
Are you?

838
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,190
No.

839
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,800
Did you have fun in the UK?

840
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,000
Yes, yes.

841
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,190
Let me hold you up.

842
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,630
You're getting heavy.

843
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,550
Did you eat snacks on the sly

844
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,630
in the UK?

845
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,280
Come and look.

846
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,400
Presents for you.

847
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,150
This, this, and this.

848
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:45,800
You only bought me

849
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,030
such cheap presents?

850
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:47,760
These are all for you.

851
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,670
And this is not.

852
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,550
Just kidding.

853
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:50,440
Here.

854
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,880
Kidding me?

855
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,150
What's this?

856
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,630
A bus model.

857
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,630
How do you know I like this?

858
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,480
I guessed.

859
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,070
What's that on you?

860
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:01,760
What?

861
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,630
A black spot.

862
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,630
Turn your head.

863
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,000
Come on.

864
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,320
Let's go shopping
for the Spring Festival.

865
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,880
OK.

866
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:13,460
(Happy Spring Festival,
Luck and Happiness)

867
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,510

868
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,400
What a freak!

869
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,190
Don't you think I look cool?

870
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,110
For tonight's reunion dinner,

871
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:35,670
have you figured out

872
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,030
how to deal with Grandpa?

873
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,190
The excuses

874
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,760
that my boyfriend had busy work,

875
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,710
was wounded, dead or disabled

876
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,510
have already been used.

877
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,150
I taught you so many tricks

878
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,280
and you used all of them?

879
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,190
You're clever, aren't you?

880
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,920
Joke and you'll easily get through.

881
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,760
Don't be scared.

882
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,400
You look so calm.

883
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,550
Have you really got a girl?

884
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,000
Guess.

885
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,920
I don't believe that.

886
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,590
You know what?

887
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,280
Rest assured.

888
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,800
Tonight, I'll be there.

889
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,960
You won't be pushed.

890
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,550
But if I have a boyfriend now,

891
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,190
would Grandpa push you harder?

892
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,230
So,

893
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,710
you might have to stop dreaming.

894
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,000
Then you can do this like me.

895
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,320
Kiss in front of Grandpa.

896
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,190
It's you who bought so many snacks.

897
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,670
I want them.

898
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,000
Go.

899
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,150
Store the pork

900
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,960
in the fridge.

901
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:36,800
OK.

902
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,800
We don't need it now.

903
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:49,760
Brother,

904
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,880
for the sake of the Spring Festival,

905
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:52,960
I'll share this with you.

906
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,070
Share?

907
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,280
I bought them for you.

908
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,030
Why did I fail again?

909
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,590
Come on.

910
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,400
Here.

911
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,360
OK.

912
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,320
Shall I not drink it

913
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,480
until the reunion dinner?

914
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,670
It's OK.

915
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,800
Someone said

916
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,190
we should live in the moment.

917
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:24,840
Cheers.

918
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,510
Cheers!

919
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:34,360
Continue your work.

920
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,030
OK.

921
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,400
So,

922
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,670
that lady will come, huh?

923
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,230
Yes, in a day or two.

924
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,920
But I don't like her.

925
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,440
It doesn't matter
whether you like her or not.

926
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,880
It matters that I like her.

927
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,000
You...

928
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,110
Brother, you've changed.

929
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,550
All right.

930
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,880
At dinner,

931
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,480
you'll have your favorite shrimp.

932
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,510
Happy?

933
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,400
Yes, yes.

934
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,800
It's not time to celebrate yet.

935
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,630
Do you see these things?

936
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,150
You can't have dinner

I know good things happen
at the end of the year.

963
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,320
(Level 2,000)
Level 2,000, passed.

964
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,590
Come on, Miss Xiang.

965
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,000
After a famous live streamer of game

966
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
retired,

967
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,800
she just played mini-games at home?

968
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,880
Situ, the Day after Tomorrow?
[*Mingtian Means tomorrow]

969
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,280
Isn't it Grandpa's account?

970
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,320
Grandpa promised

971
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,550
he would give me the lucky money

972
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,920
based on how many levels I pass for him.

973
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,320
Come on, Grandpa.

974
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,110
This isn't fair.

975
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:26,670
Whenever anything great happens,

976
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:27,760
you never think of me.

977
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,590
Try maxing out fewer credit cards

978
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:31,280
and I'd be thankful.

979
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,510
That's right.

980
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,710
Before I went to Velin,

981
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:35,400
what card did you give me?

982
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,510
I haven't got to you yet.

983
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,320
Didn't we

984
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,000
make a deal

985
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,480
that whoever used it would be a doggy?

986
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,070
I'll call you Doggy Xiang, then.

987
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,190
Go away.

988
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,280
Move it here.

989
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,280
Here.

990
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:50,590
Remove prejudices

991
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,030
and remove misunderstandings.

992
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,630
Next year, once again,

993
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,760
we'll be a loving family.

994
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,360
Xu Chengli,

995
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,110
have you got changed?

996
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:02,150
Dinner's ready. Hurry.

997
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,280
Not yet. In a minute.

998
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,230
Come on, hurry up.

999
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,880
Coming.

1000
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:14,400
What's the hurry for?

1001
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,800
It looks good on you.

1002
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:17,800
What do you think?

1003
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,840
I have good taste, huh?

1004
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,630
Not too bad.

1005
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,510
The size is just big.

1006
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,400
Not too bad?

1007
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,880
Say it again. Is it good?

1008
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,230
Very good.

1009
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:31,000
Super good.

1010
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,840
Impressive.

1011
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,280
Go have dinner.

1012
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:34,190
OK.

1013
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,320
Yeah.

1014
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,840
Have you washed your hands?

1015
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,440
Here.

1016
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:56,960
