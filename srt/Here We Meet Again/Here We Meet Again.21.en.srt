Umm...

31
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,000
I bought you a food processor.

32
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,350
No, thanks.

33
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,150
Please don't turn me down.

34
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,120
I just hope

35
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,150
you can have healthy food.

36
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,870
You don't want a food delivery
for every meal, do you?

37
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,760
I appreciate this,

38
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,840
but I really don't need it.

39
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,680
How about this?

40
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,350
Pretend I would lend it to you.

41
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,360

42
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,680
No, every week...

43
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,000
Give me one yuan every week.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,590
In this way, you'll have

45
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,710
no psychological burdens.

46
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,470
Did Shi Tianyou

47
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,310
get you in the group purchase?

48
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,470
So... Sorry to have disturbed you.

49
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:43,750
Come in.

50
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,120
We're familiar, anyway.

51
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,710
I will

52
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,910
just get something straight.

53
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,800
I want Zhang Jun

54
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,590
to take my place as the team leader.

55
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,120
I can't.

56
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,560
Why not?

57
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,590
You skipped three grades
in primary school.

58
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,360
At 15,

59
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,590
you were in
the Early-Entrance-to-College program

60
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,430
and got all the credits within two years.

61
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,080
At 17, you studied abroad

62
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,400
and returned to China at 20.

63
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,430
You?

64
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,310
Boss,

65
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,910
that was the old story.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,030
I really can't be the team leader.

67
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,840
Why not?

68
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,680
You sound

69
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,360
much more capable than Xu Yanshi.

70
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,120
When he was 22,

71
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,190
he was swindled of 2,000 yuan.

72
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,840
In a fit of anger,

73
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,560
he hacked the fraud's computer

74
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:36,840
and transferred away

75
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,430
200,000 yuan from their account.

76
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,750
He was in jail for this.

77
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,120
But for the sake of good performance,

78
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,400
he was released ahead of time.

79
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,360
I'm already grateful

80
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,000
to work in Velin, Boss.

81
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,470
I've never wanted

82
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,800
to be a team leader.

83
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,240
And...

84
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,560
I'm not really qualified.

85
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,870
So, what did you do

86
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,120
with that money?

87
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,240
Paid my mother's medical bill.

88
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,590
That's OK.

89
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,630
Everyone makes mistakes.

90
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,030
I trust Xu Yanshi's choice.

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,190
You get to work.

92
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,750
I'll have a quick chat with him.

93
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,680
You're leaving tomorrow,

94
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
but you left your car to me.

95
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,070
What if you want a date?

96
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,870
If I want a date,

97
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,750
driving can't help.

98
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,040
I'll have to take a plane.

99
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,680
Who knows? In Shanghai,

100
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,120
there are so many pretty girls.

101
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,950
If someone can't help himself,

102
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,240
what would he do?

103
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,310
I wouldn't have any problem,

104
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,160
but you have to hold yourself.

105
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,630
I really wonder

106
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,720
who confessed love to a man

107
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,070
she just knew on the Internet
for two days.

108
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,510
Why haven't you gone to Shanghai yet?

109
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,070
Go home.

110
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,560

00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,160
(I call it Luoxia Mountain.)

192
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,060
(I didn't know about it in this game.)

193
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,620
(Why haven't I been here before?)

194
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,740
(Only the top five players of PVP
have access to this place.)

195
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,810
(I'm not a top five yet.)

196
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,530
(Now, you're my wife.)

197
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,610
(And you can certainly get in.)

198
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,390
Tired, huh?

199
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,240
It's half past twelve.

200
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,360
- I should go.
- (I should have had you handle this,)

201
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,770
(but a lot of players were watching.)

202
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,870
- (So, I took care of it quickly.)
- Really?

203
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,390
How about I leave after you fall asleep?

204
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,550
If I don't fall asleep,

205
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,870
will you not leave?

206
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,080
No way.

207
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,840
I have to leave before half past three.

208
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,630
Then I'll stay awake until then.

209
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,360
From tomorrow on,

210
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,120
we can seldom see each other, huh?

211
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,360
You can see me whenever you want it.

212
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,200
I can't.

213
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,270
You must focus on your work.

214
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,630
If you have time, come back.

215
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,910
If you don't,

216
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,790
that's OK.

217
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,670
Lin Kairui

218
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,240
doesn't give me too much time.

219
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,600
After I arrive,

220
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,080
the contract will be signed.

221
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,670
And the duration is six months.

222
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,320
If you miss me,

223
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,720
call me.

224
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,390
I'll spare some time.

225
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,120
Sleep.

226
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,200
Stay for a few more minutes.

227
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,390
OK.

255
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,110
(and some in dirt.)

256
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,590
(I'm just the one in dirt.)

257
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,680
(But whatever it costs,)

258
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,030
(I'll give you)

259
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,160
(all the best in the world)

260
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,680
(to get you dipped in flat)

261
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,440
(and gloss.)

262
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,070
Why the long face

263
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,440
in the morning?

264
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,720
My boyfriend left.

265
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,590
I can't help feeling sad.

266
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,640
Do you mean

267
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,640
the tall young man

268
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,960
who often drove you back?

269
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,270
Oh, I see.

270
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,830
At half past three this morning,

271
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,000
when I was patrolling,

272
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,070
I saw that young man

273
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,200
come out of your building.

274
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,160
I guessed

275
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,440
he was your boyfriend.

276
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,000
- Wang.
- Here.

277
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,780
(Velin Technical Group
Shi Tianyou: Today is a new day.)

278
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,350
(Today is)

279
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,480
(a new day.)

280
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,510
Velin Technical Group

281
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,000
has again started

282
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,270
to brownnose.

283
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,960
Sadly, you can't see it.

284
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,310
(Without you,)

285
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,030
(the technical group is soulless.)

286
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,240
(Look, Gao Leng and other men)

287
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,510
(don't even talk.)

288
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,720
I have a car.

289
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,000
Thanks.

290
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,920
(Xu Yanshi)
(You have a meeting this morning, huh?)

291
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,750
(I guess they're rushing)

292
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,480
(to the office.)

293
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:30,640
Wait, wait.

294
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,640
Sorry, sorry.

295
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,350
We're getting late.

296
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,030
- Make way, please.
- Excuse me.

297
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,030
Sorry, sorry.

298
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,920
Sorry for this.

299
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,130
Sorry...

300
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,590
Sorry, sorry.

301
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,640
Sir,

302
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,350
please tighten up your belly.

303
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,590
I can't.

304
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,550
You two take the next lift.

305
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,270
Can't you see we're squeezing up?

306
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:51,640
But...

307
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,000
It's not overloaded yet.

308
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,680
Just tighten up your belly.

309
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,830
Sir, sir,

310
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,350
listen to me.

311
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,200
This action

312
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,240
will stimulate intestinal peristalsis

313
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,510
and help you lose weight.

314
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,920
It's true. Trust me.

315
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,680
Follow me.

316
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,960
One, two, three, breathe in!

317
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,310
Breathe in.

318
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,880
Right, right.

319
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,200
- Try harder.
- Breathe in.

320
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,200
- Harder.
- Breathe in.

321
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:13,880
Try harder.

322
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,270
- Harder, harder.
- Harder.

323
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,960
Now, we're in, huh?

324
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,220
(Velin)

325
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,550
Give it back to me.

326
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,240
The first day Boss is away,

327
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,350
(Team Leader of Technical Group I)
I miss him.

328
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,310
Guys.

329
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,440
Will Boss really not come back?

330
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,310
Then no one will

331
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,160
complain about my carelessness

332
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,400
or clean up the mess for me.

333
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,480
(Watch the video of ten past eight.)

334
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,030
(It might help you.)

335
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,680
(The password is your birthdate.)

336
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,340
(Put in the password to enter.)

337
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,830
Ten past eight?

338
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:13,830
When Karma and I

339
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,270
were locked up?

340
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,740
(Surveillance video
of Velin New Product Launch)

341
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,350
Li Chi was so close to us.

342
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,030
He must have heard us yell.

343
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,550
I didn't get this video

344
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,070
until yesterday.

345
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,640
As for what's in it,

346
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,830
I'm not very sure.

347
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,440
Yesterday?

348
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,790
When we were knocking off,

349
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,030
I gave it to Xu Yanshi.

350
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,640
Yesterday, you two

351
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,240
visited a client, right?

352
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,070
I don't think

353
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,270
he had time to watch it.

354
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,960
He did.

355
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,160
He did?

356
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,680
When?

357
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:27,940
(Director of the Technical Department)

358
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:59,300
(Surveillance video
of Velin New Product Launch)

359
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,720
To finish watching

360
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,720
this three-hour video,

361
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,070
he had to start from...

362
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,590
Half past three?

363
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,030
You...

364
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,070
What did you do?

365
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,680
Before he left,

366
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,350
he just told me something.

367
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,240
This isn't the point.

368
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:10,830
The point is...

369
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:11,790
Where we were locked up

370
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,510
is a blind spot of surveillance,

371
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,750
but Xu Yanshi

372
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,830
found the surveillance video

373
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,880
of the staff entrance

374
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,790
that is next door.

375
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,830
Most importantly,

376
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,720
Li Chi was in the corner.

377
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,070
You and Karma

378
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,240
were locked up in the dark room

379
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,270
next door.

380
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,270
When Li Chi was there,

381
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:27,750
how could he

382
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,030
not hear you yell?

383
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,180
Uh-huh.

384
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,160
I'm going to ask about this

385
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,310
with Li Chi's photo in the hotel.

386
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,200
I guess we'll get something soon.

387
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,590
Come on.

388
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,790
When he's away,

389
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,960
do you adapt yourself?

390
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,960
It's only been a couple of hours.

391
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,640
Why can I not adapt myself?

392
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,590
(However,)

393
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,510
(my love for him is more)

394
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,880
(than I thought.)

395
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,070
(What are you doing?)

396
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,350
Looks like

397
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,510
his body walked away,

398
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,550
but his heart has stayed.

399
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,680
Come on. Look.

400
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,070
Look at that on your desk.

401
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,580
(For Chen Shu only)

402
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,480
I don't mean to push you,

403
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,510
but even I'm nearly moved

404
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,400
by Gao Leng.

405
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,920
A woman

406
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,480
shouldn't be too merciless.

407
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,940
(For Chen Shu only)

408
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,550
Guys,

409
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,750
I created a voting link.

410
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,550
Check it.

411
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,680
(Guess and Vote)
Who will get the breakfast

412
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,720
Gao Leng made for Shu this morning?

413
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,030
You're being so mean.

414
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,270
Then don't vote.

415
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:45,920
I will.

416
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,920
I pick Qingqing.

417
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,480
I pick Ying Yinyin.

418
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,240
Don't think Shu

419
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,880
only gives breakfast
to female colleagues.

420
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,790
I think

421
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,310
giving it to a male colleague

422
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,790
will make Gao Leng more desperate.

423
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:56,880
So,

424
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,110
I pick myself.

425
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,110
Lin Qingqing, who do you pick?

426
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,030
I won't support
your nonsensical behaviors.

427
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:05,720
I won't vote.

428
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,160
Vote for what?

429
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,510
Why didn't I receive the link?

430
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,960
You want it, too?

431
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,030
OK. I'll forward it to you.

432
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,070
Sure. Go ahead.

433
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,480
Who will get the breakfast

434
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,240
Gao Leng made for Shu this morning?

435
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:22,960
Who made this?

436
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,550
I knew it would annoy you!

437
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,750
You made this?

438
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,490
Yeah.

439
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,160
Don't you think

440
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,640
there's a bug in the options?

441
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,480
There should have been an option

442
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,240
indicating that Shu ate the breakfast.

443
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,440
I didn't plan

444
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,160
to set this option

445
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,480
just for your illusion.

446
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,400
Illusion?

447
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,270
What time is it?

448
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,270
Half past ten.

449
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,000
It's half past ten.

450
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,110
Have you had

451
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,000
Chen Shu's breakfast?

452
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,830
And you two?

453
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,400
Let me tell you something.

454
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,790
I just went to the sales department

455
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,510
for a walk.

456
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,510
Today, no one has had

457
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,590
the breakfast I made.

458
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,550
Instead, Chen Shu was seen

459
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,480
taking the breakfast out.

460
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,790
What does it mean?

461
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,400
She dumped it.

462
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,440
Shut up!

463
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,310
Chen Shu has never

464
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,200
wasted any food.

465
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Ruling out all possibilities,

466
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,720
there can be only one truth.

467
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,480
Chen Shu ate the breakfast

468
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,960
I made this morning.

469
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,720
Really?

470
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,310
If she really ate

471
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,920
Gao Leng's breakfast,

472
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:19,880
did it suggest

473
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,960
Gao Leng was gradually

474
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,640
wearing her down?

475
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,240
No way.

476
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,270
It can be!

477
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,480
It can be!

478
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,110
Feeling bad, huh?

479
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,160
Feeling bad?

480
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,400
Feeling bad?

481
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,510
- You must be feeling bad.
- Gao Leng.

482
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,590
Some advice for you.

483
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,200
The rice ball you made today

484
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,400
was a little bit salty.

485
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:47,960
What's wrong?

486
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,640
In only ten seconds,

487
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,440
he experienced
the most pain and pleasure.

488
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,640
You can hardly imagine.

489
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,680
It's remarkable that

490
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,200
he's only stunned.

491
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,350
If I were him,

492
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,030
I would be dead.

493
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:07,960
Isn't it the seat

494
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,070
for Xu Yanshi?

495
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:09,790
Yeah.

496
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,480
Why is Zhang Jun sitting there?

497
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,440
Yeah.

498
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,680
- Why is it him?
- What's this about?

499
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,110
No idea.

500
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,590
At today's meeting,

501
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,310
let me announce

502
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,310
the new team leader

503
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,920
of the technical department.

504
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,790
It's Zhang Jun.

505
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,590
Guys,

506
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,720
applaud.

507
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,070
Zhang Jun?

508
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,680
Why is it him?

509
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,640
Boss picked him.

510
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,270
I thought it would be You Zhi.

511
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,480
Shut up.

512
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,550
Boss decides everything

513
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,550
for a reason.

514
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,640
Say something.

515
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,110
Umm...

516
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,680
Thank you, everyone.

517
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,720
I'll cooperate with you

518
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,240
- during our work...
- Now, even someone like Zhang Jun

519
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,070
who has a criminal record

520
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,960
can be the team leader

521
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,640
of the technical department?

522
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,240
He has a criminal record?

523
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,640
Really surprising.

524
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,480
Cri... criminal record?

525
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,830
What does it mean?

526
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,590
How strange!

527
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,070
In this case,

528
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,550
I can get Li Chi back
to the technical department,

529
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,680
can't I?

530
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,680
Of course, you can,

531
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,270
as long as

532
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,640
you take full responsibility

533
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,270
for every mistake

534
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,200
he makes at work.

535
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,270
Can you guarantee

536
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,110
that your subordinates
won't make mistakes?

537
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:41,590
We...

538
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,640
I'll be responsible for their mistakes

539
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,310
and you'll be responsible for his.

540
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,440
OK?

541
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,510
As the director,

542
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,070
you should be fair.

543
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,550
Why must I

544
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,920
take responsibility

545
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,110
for Li Chi's mistakes?

546
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,440
Because

547
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,070
I don't want him back,

548
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,440
but you insisted.

549
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,790
So,

550
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,790
if you answer for whatever he does,

551
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,550
we can have him back.

552
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,680
Well,

553
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,510
Miss Xiang will decide

554
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,920
whether Li Chi can come back.

555
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,030
What if I insist

556
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,920
that Li Chi should return?

557
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,590
Ms. Li...

558
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,440
Well, he can.

559
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,270
I didn't mean to make it public too soon,

560
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,270
but Ms. Li insisted.

561
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,960
Let's watch a video

562
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,070
before deciding

563
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,510
whether Li Chi can come back.

564
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,830
Everyone, pay attention

565
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,070
to the time on the screen.

566
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,550
Ten past eight that night.

567
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,720
It was the time when

568
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,960
my friend and I

569
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,750
were locked up in that dark room.

570
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,830
Li Chi was

571
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,070
right next door,

572
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,880
but he turned a deaf ear
to our yell for help.

573
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,590
Just now, the hotel worker

574
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,160
sent me a sound recording.

575
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,240
The speaker is

576
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,480
the chef's assistant

577
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,640
and the witness of that case.

578
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,510
You can listen to it.

579
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,240
(At that time,)

580
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,160
(I heard some noises.)

581
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,590
(Then I ran out of the kitchen.)

582
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,550
(I saw a man)

583
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,590
(put a board with "For Repair")

584
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,830
(in front of the door.)

585
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,350
(But I remember)

586
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,960
(nothing was for repair.)

587
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:21,960
(Then I asked him,)

588
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,110
("What are you doing?")

589
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:24,550
(That guy)

590
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,480
(asked me to get lost very rudely.)

591
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,440
(I didn't dare to stay)

592
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,750
(in case of trouble.)

593
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,110
(Then I ran away.)

594
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,070
(Yes, yes, that's him.)

595
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,030
(This is the man.)

596
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,000
- (I remember his face clearly.)
- So, it's true.

597
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,110
(Anyway,)

598
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:37,960
(he was)

599
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,310
(guarding the door.)

600
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,830
(I didn't dare to get closer.)

601
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,920
(Then I left.)

602
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,030
(That's what happened.)

603
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,590
Screw you, woman!

604
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,750
Sorry, sorry.

605
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,160
Fight?

606
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,110
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

607
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,550
Let go of me!

608
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,550
Sorry, sorry.

609
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,200
Don't struggle. Don't.

610
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,000
It hurts! Let me go!

611
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:09,480
It hurts!

612
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,680
The harder you struggle,
the more it hurts.

613
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,640
Sorry, sorry.

614
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,510
Sorry, sorry.

615
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,830
I'm so sorry.

616
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,440
Let me go!

617
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,030
Sorry.

618
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,310
Zhang Jun, you must be
having a death wish!

619
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,400
Let go of me!

620
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,640
- Let me go!
- Go!

621
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,880
Let me go!

622
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,310
Let me go!

623
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,000
I'm sorry!

624
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,480
What else

625
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,070
can you surprise me?

626
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,510
An inmate of mine

627
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,790
was a Kungfu master.

628
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,400
When I was in jail,

629
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,160
I practiced Kungfu for years.

630
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,480
I didn't know

631
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,480
I could use it here.

632
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,240
Sorry, sorry.

633
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,720
What are you applauding?

634
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,680
Dismiss!

635
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:50,830
Ms. Li,

636
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,680
you gave a chance

637
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,920
to this kind of guy?

638
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,070
I'll report it to headquarters

639
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,270
and fire him!

640
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:57,830
Mr. Li.

641
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,310
- Right.
- Take the evidence.

642
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,070
I gotta take this.

643
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,070
Now that you had the evidence,

644
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,000
why didn't you show it earlier?

645
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,960
To play the long game.

646
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,840
I don't need to teach you this, do I?

647
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,880
I'm looking forward to it.

648
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,360
(Did you promote Zhang Jun)

649
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,650
(Xu Yanshi)
(so that he could be my bodyguard?)

650
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:36,540
(Xiang Yuan)

651
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,590
(Xiang Yuan)
(Today, you also)

652
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,070
(did a great job.)

653
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:45,940
(Xu Yanshi)

654
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:48,150
(Xiang Yuan: What?)

655
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,320
(Wondering how I knew that?)

656
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,590
(You know how gossipy)

657
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,630
(Gao Leng and Shi Tianyou can be.)

658
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:58,000
(Xiang Yuan)
(I'll shut their mouths.)

659
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,360
(Miss Xiang,)

660
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,590
(I intercede for them.)

661
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,400
(Besides,)

662
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,880
(I also want to see that.)

663
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,980
(Xiang Yuan)
(It's OK.)

664
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,670
(Next time I'll show it to you.)

665
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,820
(Xu Yanshi: Fine.)

666
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:18,960
Yanshi,

667
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,230
didn't I tell you I would send a car?

668
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,320
Why did you come personally?

669
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:22,590
Don't bother.

670
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,480
No way.

671
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,670
You're very important.

672
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,800
Get your bag and come up with me.

673
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,230
How important?

674
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,070
Well,

675
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,320
you'll be of great importance

676
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,280
to our company.

677
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,110
Come on. Let me open the door for you.

678
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:32,960
Who's this man?

679
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,280
Mr. Lin welcomed him personally.

680
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,880
The technical department

681
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,230
will have a new deputy general manager.

682
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,070
Mr. Lin poached him with high pay.

683
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,280
Quite a high profile.

684
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,110
And I heard

685
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,710
Ms. Ye would also hurry back today.

686
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,110
The new deputy general manager?

687
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,840
Then Ms. Ye wouldn't be...

688
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,070
Come on.

689
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:49,960
Order some coffee.

690
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,630
We have

691
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,320
another deputy general manager,

692
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,000
Chen Feng.

693
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,800
Hello, Mr. Lin.

694
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,070
He's in charge of sales.

695
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,320
Now, he's on a business trip.

696
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,360
When you work here,

697
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,110
you will play

698
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,030
the third fiddle.

699
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:06,880
I've rented a flat

700
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,590
near our company.

701
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,880
Check if you like it.

702
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,590
In business,

703
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,360
the car and the driver

704
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,630
have been arranged for you.

705
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,070
You can

706
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,710
use them

707
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,880
for commuting,

708
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,800
visiting clients,

709
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,480
and even dating girls.

710
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,510
If you think

711
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,760
this car isn't expensive enough,

712
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,440
there are more in the garage.

713
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,190
Pick the one you want.

714
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,760
Come on in.

715
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,440
When did you come?

716
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,760
What?

717
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,800
You don't want me?

718
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,400
I do, of course.

719
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,920
I've been expecting you

720
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,920
and finally...

721
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,150
You know him?

722
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,030
Last time, we...

723
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,480
Well,

724
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,840
let me introduce him to you.

725
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,230
This is Xu Yanshi

726
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,440
I told you before.

727
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,760
From this day on,

728
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,840
he'll be the deputy general manager

729
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,840
of our company,

730
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,880
in charge of the technical department!

731
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,030
- Let's applaud him.
- Deputy general manager already?

732
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:47,840
Come on. Clap hands.

733
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,400
Umm, Yuntao.

734
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,150
Look.

735
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,280
Yanshi has come.

736
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,440
Hurry to hand over

737
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:00,960
Soaring's project

738
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,920
to him.

739
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,670
From now on,

740
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,280
this project

741
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,510
will be his full responsibility.

742
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,400
No problem.

743
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:05,880
Mr. Lin...

744
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,510
Mr. Lin,

745
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,280
Mr. Xu is new here, after all.

746
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,920
I know you highly recommend him.

747
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,230
But for this project,

748
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,150
it's better for him

749
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:13,760
to look on.

750
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,110
But Siqin, you...

751
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,510
Have a meeting in 20 minutes

752
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,590
and we'll finalize the proposal

753
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:18,480
of the positioning system.

754
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,920
Siqin...

755
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,840
She's a veteran. I'll handle that.

756
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,590
Siqin,

757
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,760
I can kowtow and apologize,

758
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,320
OK?

759
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,190
I know

760
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,400
you've been taking care of this project.

761
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:31,920
But could you

762
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,920
let Xu Yanshi join you

763
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,800
in this project?

764
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,480
Don't take it personally.

765
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,280
Ye Siqin

766
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,670
always behaves like that.

767
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,840
She looks cold but is actually friendly.

768
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,760
She's capable

769
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,550
and proud.

770
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,760
After she knows how capable you are,

771
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,510
she'll be nice to you.

772
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,590
It doesn't matter.

773
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:48,710
I don't mind.

774
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,510
OK.

775
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,000
Zhang Jun,

776
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,190
you really kept a low profile.

777
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,480
You have a criminal record

778
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,710
and you can do Kungfu.

779
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,280
What crime did you commit?

780
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,840
Oh, I know.

781
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,590
You must have been framed

782
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,400
and ended up in jail.

783
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,030
Years later, you were released.

784
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,630
After the promotion,
you'd start your revenge.

785
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,440
Am I right?

786
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,440
You must have read too many novels.

787
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,030
But at today's meeting,

788
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,070
what you did was

789
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,590
really impressive.

790
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,320
Did I beat him too hard?

791
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,280
No, no.

792
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,320
We feel so good about it.

793
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,030
Yeah.

794
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,000
I should have

795
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
asked you to punch him.

796
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,230
Then Chen Shu

797
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,800
wouldn't say I was childish

798
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,000
and impulsive.

799
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Idiot.

800
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,030
It isn't the only thing

801
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,510
that makes you look impulsive.

802
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,590
You Zhi,

803
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,190
you sound more like Boss now.

804
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,480
Who gave you
the right to call me idiot?

805
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,230
I forgot to deliver the breakfast!

806
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,480
Tonight, we'll have dinner

807
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,280
to celebrate

808
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,280
Zhang Jun's promotion.

809
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,230
Come?

810
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,550
You technical guys enjoy it.

811
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,590
I won't go.

812
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,230
But when we had dinner together,

813
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,760
you always joined us.

814
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,280
Any business tonight?

815
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:16,480
No.

816
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:19,800
So, it's because of Gao Leng, huh?

817
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,670
Not at all.

818
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,000
Actually, Gao Leng

819
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,480
isn't as childish as you think he is.

820
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,510
I used to think he was a nice guy.

821
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,070
When we were together,

822
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,280
he always managed

823
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,840
to make me very happy.

824
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,670
Honestly, he took good care of me.

825
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,550
Every day, he made meals for me.

826
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,630
If I drank some wine,

827
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,070
he made me the hangover-cure soup.

828
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:44,880
Then,

829
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,880
why did you break up?

830
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,150
Get back to him.

831
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,230
Seriously, if you want it,

832
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,480
he will accept you

833
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,400
and even wail.

834
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,710
Hear me out.

835
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,800
These advantages,

836
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,960
when people are in love,

837
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,480
can be indeed wonderful.

838
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,230
But when people

839
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,590
are no longer in love,

840
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,590
such advantages

841
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:03,800
will be negative.

842
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,320
Anyway,

843
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,550
now I think

844
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,550
he's too childish

845
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,550
and clingy.

846
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,960
No longer love him?

847
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,030
He's rather young.

848
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,510
It's OK

849
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,590
to be in a relationship with him.

850
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,190
But if I consider things

851
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,280
for a long-term future,

852
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,880
he isn't my perfect match.

853
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,630
Actually, your saying

854
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,190
can be reversed.

855
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,360
When someone

856
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,110
falls in love,

857
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,590
all his disadvantages

858
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:44,000
will be positive.

859
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,510
And...

860
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:48,000
They'll even glitter.

861
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,630
Your glitter is calling.

862
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,230
What about dinner?

863
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,840
Fine, I'll go.

864
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,590
Go answer the phone.

865
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:01,440
Deal, then.

866
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,180
(Fancy Nutritional Breakfast)

867
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,420
(Recycle Bin)

868
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,500
(Move to Recycle Bin)

869
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:20,340
(Confirm to delete 22 items forever?)

870
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:28,660
(Yes)

871
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,760
OK, you're dumped.

872
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,070
But no background music, please.

873
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,280
Quite disturbing, you know?

874
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,550
I invited Chen Shu

875
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,800
to have dinner with us tonight

876
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,110
to celebrate Zhang Jun's promotion.

877
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,510
- OK.
- Sure.

878
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:12,150
Why did you invite an outsider?

879
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:12,960
I won't go.

880
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:14,110
Since when was she

881
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:15,280
an outsider?

882
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,480
We used to invite her

883
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,670
to our gatherings

884
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:20,030
because she was my girlfriend.

885
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,480
Now, why would we?

886
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,960
She's my friend, OK?

887
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:24,590
I didn't know

888
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:26,440
you could be this narrow-minded.

889
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,550
I'm magnanimous, actually.

890
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:30,550
We keep a distance after the breakup.

891
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,030
Then what about your work?

892
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,670
What about the handover thing?

893
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,400
Shall I

894
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,590
get you a secretary

895
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:37,400
who can help you communicate?

896
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:38,510
Qingqing,

897
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:39,840
will you help him?

898
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,110
I...

899
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:43,710
I...

900
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:45,360
I think you're as merciless

901
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,150
as Boss.

902
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:47,550
You're destined to be alone forever.

903
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:48,550
Childish.

904
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,480
Come on, You Zhi.

905
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:53,190
Don't think

906
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:54,360
you can talk like that

907
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,230
just because you've been imitating Boss!

908
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:56,320
In this office,

909
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,320
only your name
indicates how childish you are.

910
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,760
[*In Chinese, the pronunciation of
"You Zhi" is similar to "Childishness".]

911
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,070
I'll announce the time and place

912
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:02,230
in the group chat.

913
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,670
Finish this sheet

914
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:04,550
and give it back to me.

915
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,440
All you've learned from Boss

916
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,400
is to give sarcastic remarks

917
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,670
and hit my head, huh?

918
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:12,230
I'm warning you.

919
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,440
Whoever dares to go,

920
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,440
I'll break with him!

921
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:21,710
Hi, Shu.

922
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:22,960
- Hi, Yuan.
- There you are.

923
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:26,960
New bag?

924
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:28,360
Pretty.

925
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:30,480
A knockoff, actually.

926
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:33,030
Even a knockoff looks very good now.

927
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:35,840
Hello.

928
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:39,510
What about the others?

929
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,920
Gao Leng said

930
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,230
he wouldn't come because Shu was here.

931
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,630
You Zhi said

932
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:50,630
he wasn't in a very good mood.

933
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:52,760
Shi Tianyou was about to come,

934
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,920
but they stopped him.
