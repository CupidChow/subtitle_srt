=Episode 1=

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,690
Phase one is shut down.

30
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,440
(In autumn 2018,
satellite launch exercise.)

31
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,230
(3rd monitoring room,
on-orbit satellite monitoring center)

32
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,020
(Satellite high-precision positioning
load system test)

33
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,130
(Beijing time. Launch time. Flight time. Weather: temperature 20 degrees. Wind: less than 4m/s)

34
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,870
Abnormal satellite telemetry signals.

35
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,150
We can't tell

36
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,120
if the remote control is normal.

37
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,280
If it's normal

38
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,510
and the uplink instructions can be sent,

39
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,510
there is still hope.

40
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,950
Phase two is shut down.

41
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,400
Troubleshoot now

42
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,710
before the separation
of the satellite and rocket.

43
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,230
Get the drawings

44
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,200
of TT&C transponder

45
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,310
and the test data.

46
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,280
Here. This is the datasheet.

47
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,480
Check the telemetry data

48
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,120
before signals disappeared.

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,960
The problem is found.

50
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,960
The problem is found here.

51
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,870
What's the problem?

52
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,840
Yeah. Take a look.

53
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,080
The parameters aren't properly designed.

54
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,750
The threshold value is
at the critical state,

55
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,520
resulting in weak
anti-interference ability.

56
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,280
Under certain conditions,

57
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,120
this situation

58
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,960
is incurred.

59
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,400
How long does the troubleshooting take?

60
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,960
If we work together,

61
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,360
it'll be solved before the satellite
enters the orbit.

62
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,190
Go all out. Every second counts.

63
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,590
Yes, sir.

64
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,430
Get ready to send

65
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,240
parameter modification instructions.

66
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,240
Phase three, second ignition.

67
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,470
Pass.

68
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,560
Nope.

69
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,560
You don't even take three.

70
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,120
Are you serious?

71
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,190
Is that

72
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,030
the third son of Uncle Zhang?

73
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,310
His conditions are good.

74
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,870
Good look. Good education.

75
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,960
Good personality.

76
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,400
But

77
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,520
his girlfriend is studying in France.

78
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,150
Wouldn't she come back next year

79
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,710
and stew me into turkey soup

80
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,120
as a gift for his family?

81
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,870
What nonsense? Zhang Junyi.

82
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,190
Does he have a girlfriend?

83
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:36,870
Mr. Zhang

84
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,120
didn't tell me about that.

85
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,750
You know his intention,

86
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,030
don't you?

87
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,680
Well, look at this card.

88
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,750
Spade A.

89
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,520
He just finished his MBA

90
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,000
from abroad,

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,750
and will

92
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,150
take over Mr. Lin's company.

93
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,960
Lin Zijian. Look.

94
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,120
He looks like a flat peach.

95
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,190
Isn't he

96
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,910
as tall as you?

97
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,360
Why are you doing this?

98
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,800
Look at you.

99
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,750
What's...

100
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,400
What's that attitude?

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,800
What a look he has got.

102
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,400
Why?

103
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:08,750
I just

104
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,430
want to be merry.

105
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,400
Look at this.

106
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,590
Alright. I've said that

107
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,870
I won't get married.

108
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,000
I won't. I won't.

109
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,190
How many times

110
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:18,920
do I have to tell you?

111
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,310
OK. I know. I know.

112
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,390
You told me. OK?

113
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,310
But

114
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,680
what if

115
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,270
you run into a boy

116
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,310
you like?

117
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,720
Dating not for marriage

118
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,800
is the act

119
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,830
of a rogue.

120
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,070
Now

121
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,310
many people date for marriage.

122
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,270
Aren't they acting like rogues?

123
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,040
Right?

124
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,600
Grandpa.

125
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,600
We're all grownups

126
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,680
living for decades.

127
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,310
Don't pretend to be innocent.

128
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,270
What love matters

129
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,630
is to participate.

130
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,630
To participate is not
to purchase shares.

131
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,800
The result doesn't matter.

132
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,040
What's the point?

133
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,360
Moreover,

134
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,600
that happened before.

135
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,310
Girl.

136
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,950
In case

137
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,600
that you meet a boy

138
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,120
who you like very much,

139
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,680
won't you get married?

140
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,240
No!

141
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,390
No or...

142
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,390
No! No! No!

143
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,190
I heard you! I heard you!

144
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,390
I heard you! Clearly!

145
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,360
Xiang Yuan,

146
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,430
are you going to Xi'an?

147
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,160
It's not going to hell.

148
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,040
What are you yelling about?

149
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,680
Did I hear it right?

150
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,480
My sister,

151
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,480
a spoiled girl

152
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,950
since very little,

153
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,510
a game blogger

154
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,070
with five million fans,

155
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,950
will go to work

156
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,630
in Velin,

157
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,360
that little broken company?

158
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,870
Hey.

159
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,870
By comparison,

160
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,360
I seem to loaf around.

161
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,480
You don't understand.

162
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,120
I'm planning

163
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,040
for my future.

164
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,680
I promised grandpa

165
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,360
to raise

166
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,870
the sales of Velin

167
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,680
by ten percent.

168
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,720
Then

169
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,310
he won't urge me to get married.

170
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,920
What if you fail?

171
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,800
I will succeed.

172
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,480
What's wrong?

173
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,750
I forgot my charging cable.

174
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,270
Which one?

175
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,190
For the tablet?

176
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,000
It's fine. I have one.

177
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,070
Use mine

178
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,000
when we are in the lounge.

179
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,120
He means yours.

180
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,480
Mine is in the suitcase.

181
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,560
Xu Chengli!

182
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,750
That's what Shu gave me

183
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,830
as a gift

184
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,800
in the first countryside survey!

185
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:04,270
It...

186
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,750
It's not an ordinary charging cable.

187
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,870
It's the Red Line between us.

188
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,510
Brother.

189
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,040
What is the Red Line?

190
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,720
A line

191
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,480
that you are too young to touch.

192
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,310
No...

193
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,750
I have to call the hotel

194
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,560
and get it back.

195
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,190
I'm going to buy a cup of coffee.

196
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,240
Watch over him for me.

197
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,270
OK.

198
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:21,680
OK.

199
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,560
Hello.

200
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,950
Is that the hotel?

201
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,870
I am your customer.

202
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,070
My charging cable was left

203
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,040
there.

204
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,720
Room 305.

205
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,270
Have you found it?

206
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,310
Well,

207
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,120
(Connecting Flight)
can you mail it to me?

208
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,800
Isn't this the one in our class?

209
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,920
No wonder the classmates were talking.

210
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,190
Xiang Yuan. Wait for me.

211
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,270
I'll be at the airport soon.

212
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,000
What?

213
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,270
Are you coming to the airport?

214
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,360
Did your grandfather

215
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,830
introduce a boyfriend to you again?

216
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,270
Absolutely.

217
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,390
He wishes to be the God of Marriage

218
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,950
and ties the knot for me.

219
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,750
Have you seen
the classmates chat group?

220
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,160
The discussion is hot.

221
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,120
They say there are videos in the hotel.

222
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,560
Really?

223
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,360
Send me the videos

224
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,680
in a while.

225
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,800
OK. OK. OK.

226
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,040
I'm going to you later.

227
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,020
I'm waiting for you

228
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,500
at the entrance

229
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,290
of the small garden.

230
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,210
OK.

231
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,860
(Anipop)

232
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,450
It's new.

233
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,170
I don't have junk food.

234
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,340
Take it.

235
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,020
Thank you, Boss.

236
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,180
Look.

237
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,740
Xu Chengli, a little boy

238
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,580
already hits on girls.

239
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,700
He won't be lost.

240
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,500
Have you arrived?

241
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,820
I'm going for you.

242
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,260
OK.

243
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,500
OK.

244
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,700
Take it. It's yours.

245
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,420
Xu Chengli.

246
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,580
Brother.

247
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,580
Let's go.

248
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,820
I don't eat it. Take it.

249
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,580
Who gave you that?

250
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,420
The woman

251
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,380
who you hate the most.

252
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,060
Xu Chengli.

253
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,740
Don't learn the way your brother talks.

254
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,380
And

255
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,340
how do you know

256
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,620
which kind of women your brother hates?

257
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,220
Those who often cross the line,

258
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,820
play games

259
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,260
while having snacks,

260
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,860
and gossip a lot,

261
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,700
the kind of unlucky women.

262
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:08,700
Brother.

263
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,580
If you have a girlfriend

264
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,780
of that kind,

265
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,500
I'll leave home.

266
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,020
Rest assured.

267
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:17,980
Your brother

268
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,460
will never love someone.

269
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,380
If even he loves,

270
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,420
I can get married

271
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,620
with Ashers.

272
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,340
He has a bad month.

273
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,580
Whoever is with him will have bad luck.

274
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,340
Leave home?

275
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,460
OK.

276
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,100
When?

277
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,380
You bad guy.

278
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,420
Alright. Let's go.

279
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,020
Take the bag yourself.

280
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,060
I will. I will.

281
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,260
Xiang Yuan.

282
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,860
Look!

283
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,180
(What's this? The photo is confirmed!
Any videos? Thrilling!)

284
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,660
That's it?

285
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,740
What do you think it is?

286
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,820
They went to the hotel hand in hand!

287
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,580
Are you really going to Velin?

288
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,100
Or what? I'm going to work.

289
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,300
Of course I'll go.

290
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,020
Are you crazy?

291
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:17,860
You quit being a live streamer?

292
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,340
Why are you going there?

293
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,700
What are you doing here?

294
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,060
I'm going with you.

295
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,300
Really?

296
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,660
I'm kidding.

297
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,140
You're so scared.

298
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,300
I'm on a business trip.

299
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:30,940
I thought

300
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,220
I'd meet you here

301
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,300
and persuade you.

302
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,940
Why are you going to work there?

303
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,020
Do you quit being a live streamer?

304
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:36,940
You majored in broadcast

305
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,540
in college!

306
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,500
Do you know

307
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,180
what business that company runs?

308
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,420
Vehicle navigation.

309
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,660
Vehicle navigation?

310
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,260
The market of vehicle navigation

311
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,380
is so poor.

312
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,100
People all use mobile navigation now,

313
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,220
fast and convenient.

314
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,620
Many of these companies bankrupted

315
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,060
last year.

316
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,180
What can you do there?

317
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,060
Anyway,

318
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,260
I've bet with my grandpa.

319
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,420
It's fine.

320
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,300
The old man spoils you.

321
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,660
He's also afraid of you.

322
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,060
Just apologize to him.

323
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,220
Isn't it OK?

324
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,300
No.

325
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,780
I must win the bet this time.

326
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,260
If I win,

327
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,060
I can do whatever I want.

328
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,700
If I lose,

329
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,540
I'll go back to live streaming.

330
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:41,900
Hello.

331
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,180
Sir.

332
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,020
Hey. Wake up.

333
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,380
Wait for us at that location.

334
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,300
We'll be there.

335
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:47,900
Get up.

336
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,420
OK.

337
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:49,740
What?

338
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,260
Carpool with others?

339
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,980
How... How much cheaper?

340
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:56,820
Alright,

341
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,140
carpool then.

342
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,740
Wait for a moment.

343
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,380
We'll go after going to the toilet.

344
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,020
OK. OK.

345
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,100
Goodbye.

346
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,460
Can you take them all?

347
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,220
Yes.

348
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,340
We'll carpool.

349
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,300
OK.

350
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,500
80 yuan cheaper.

351
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,500
Hello, Miss.

352
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,380
Miss.

353
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,100
The plane has landed.

354
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,500
Time to get off.

355
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,580
Thank you.

356
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,020
(Sorry, no taxi for you around)

357
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,220
Miss.

358
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,420
Where are you going?

359
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,900
Yanta District.

360
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,100
Would you carpool?

361
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,340
You're the last one.

362
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,740
I wouldn't.

363
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,340
You can ask other drivers.

364
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,260
They double the money

365
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,420
with an empty car.

366
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,860
Double?

367
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,620
But we have rules.

368
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,740
First.

369
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,380
No financial support to you.

370
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,420
Second,

371
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,820
no powerful position

372
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,340
that can call the shots for you.

373
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,140
Third,

374
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,540
don't expose that

375
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,300
you are my granddaughter.

376
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,180
That means,

377
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,580
you're on your own.

378
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,700
If you successfully

379
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,300
save Velin,

380
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,220
I will listen to you

381
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,460
for everything in the future.

382
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,260
Sir. Sir.

383
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,180
I'll carpool. Carpool.

384
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,220
Let's go.

385
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:24,980
Go. Go.

386
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,140
OK. Go.

387
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:34,620
(Occupied. Xi'an Taxi)

388
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,820
Aren't you watching the road?

389
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,180
It's dangerous!

390
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,700
Finally, someone can manage you.

391
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,420
So hot.

392
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,100
(Xu Yanshi!)

393
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,980
(Bad karma! Bad karma!)

394
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,900
Xu Yanshi!

395
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,740
Won't you go to my birthday?

396
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,020
Xu Yanshi.

397
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,820
I won't.

398
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,300
(Occupied. Xi'an Taxi)

399
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,820
(There are all kinds of)

400
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,940
(reunions.)

401
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,700
(Unforgettable ones.)

402
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,700
(Reunions after breakups.)

403
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,900
(However,)

404
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,660
(I'm experiencing)

405
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,020
(the most awkward kind,)

406
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,180
(which is so awkward)

407
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,620
(that I don't want the other side)

408
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:46,220
(to know it's a reunion.)

409
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,420
Girl. Wear more if you feel cold.

410
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,060
Why wrapping up your head?

411
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,460
It's scary at night.

412
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,380
What are you talking about?

413
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,020
I don't know.

414
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,700
(Xu Yuan)

415
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,020
(Have you landed?)

416
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,900
(Do you remember Xu Yanshi?)

417
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,020
(Xiang Yuan)

418
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,860
(Xu Yuan)
(Yes.)

419
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,860
(Didn't he transfer to another school?)

420
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,580
(Because of you, right?)

421
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,780
I just worked overtime for a week,

422
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,020
too busy for it.

423
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,260
My goddess Ashers

424
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,540
has retired!

425
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,620
The blog is closed, too!

426
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:57,980
I...

427
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:58,540
I can't

428
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,420
watch her live streaming anymore!

429
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,540
I'm so sad!

430
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,740
(My fans are too many.)

431
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,380
(I should reflect.)

432
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,260
I don't care.

433
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,420
Boss, treat me to night snacks.

434
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,220
No.

435
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,780
What's so fun
about her live streaming?

436
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,380
Xu Chengli always thought

437
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:19,980
you were watching

438
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,340
a talking hen

439
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,820
type as a show.

440
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,460
He didn't even do homework.

441
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,580
Boss.

442
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,380
She... She...

443
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,380
She just used the voice changer.

444
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,300
(Forgive him. Forgive him.)

445
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,140
(Anyway, we won't meet again)

446
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,420
(after getting off.)

447
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,580
(Forgive him.)

448
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,140
Why are you

449
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,100
badmouthing my goddess?

450
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:37,700
And

451
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,700
why do you push your glasses

452
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,620
with your middle finger?

453
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,900
Are you despising her?

454
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:42,540
You...

455
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,260
Wait and see!

456
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,820
Brother, can I watch

457
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,140
cartoons?

458
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,140
(Blog: CoolMan)
(Boss talked harshly again today.)

459
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:53,780
(He even said)

460
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,860
(my goddess Ashers)

461
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,980
(was like)

462
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,540
(a talking hen)

463
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,900
(performing typing)

464
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,220
(when she was live streaming.)

465
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,820
I've posted

466
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,100
that you said

467
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,020
Ashers was a hen.

468
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,940
Wait for

469
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,380
the anger from fans.

470
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,260
Listen.

471
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,140
The fans of Ashers

472
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,020
are very crazy.

473
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:10,700
I remember

474
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,100
a male fan gave her many gifts

475
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,980
in her channel.

476
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,740
But

477
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,100
Ashers donated them all

478
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,500
the next day,

479
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,020
and posted the chat record

480
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,900
that she didn't accept gifts.

481
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,260
She didn't lack money.

482
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,420
People were all shocked

483
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,980
by that blog.

484
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,460
An esports live streamer

485
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,860
who doesn't go for contests

486
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,900
and doesn't accept gifts.

487
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,580
(CoolMan)
She even said she didn't lack money.

488
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,380
Boss.

489
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,140
Hearing she's a rich woman,

490
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,540
aren't you interested?

491
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,060
You need money more than me.

492
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,700
Remember to pay me back

493
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,820
early next month.

494
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,620
Don't. I'm short of money recently.

495
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,500
I wonder

496
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,100
which man

497
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,180
would marry Ashers.

498
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:57,940
Then he must

499
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,820
have saved the galaxy in his last life.

500
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,220
Not like us.

501
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,220
No hope at all.

502
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,780
No one wants us.

503
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,540
Life is realistic.

504
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,740
The rich

505
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,380
(CoolMan)
will only go for the richer.

506
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,100
They won't be philanthropists.

507
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:10,700
Right?

508
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,780
The way that you get serious

509
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,700
is...

510
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,060
What? Very charming?

511
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,380
Like a beggar

512
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,740
under the bridge.

513
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,460
(CoolMan)
(What kind of creature is my Boss?)

514
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,380
(Why can he so quickly solve the problems?)

515
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,780
(I can't resist)

516
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,180
(my jealousy.)

517
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,140
(CoolMan)
(In meetings,)

518
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,420
(observe my Boss)

519
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,700
(if he pushes glasses
with the middle finger)

520
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,260
(or the index finger.)

521
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,220
(Then you know)

522
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,180
(if he agrees with you.)

523
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,780
(I'm such a smart kid.)

524
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,100
(MyGosh)
(You know everything.)

525
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,260
(But you still aren't recognized)

526
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,500
(by your Boss.)

527
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,540
(Occupied. Xi'an Taxi)

528
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,220
What's going on?

529
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,220
My goodness.

530
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,180
Boss.

531
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,980
Is this an illegal taxi?

532
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,140
Yang said they took

533
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,060
an illegal taxi before.

534
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,260
It stopped halfway

535
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,780
and wouldn't go without more money.

536
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:23,660
We...

537
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,900
Are we so unlucky?

538
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,740
We will walk then.

539
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,780
We'll arrive at dawn.

540
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,540
Don't.

541
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,500
You should consider for the kid

542
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,100
if not for me.

543
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,620
Oh, right.

544
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:40,940
That girl

545
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,860
wraps her head completely.

546
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,460
Is she with the driver?

547
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,820
Maybe.

548
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,420
You think too much.

549
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,660
Only robbery.

550
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:54,860
Rob...

551
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:55,980
Rob...

552
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,780
Robbery...

553
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,420
Get off, all of you.

554
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,340
The car breaks down. We can't go.

555
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,060
Robber.

556
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,140
Would you join us?

557
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,020
It's hard to call a taxi here.

558
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,940
We can split the taxi fare.

559
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,100
Add my WeChat number.

560
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,180
Transfer the money

561
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:47,980
to me later.

562
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:48,900
Don't think too much.

563
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,740
I didn't mean to hit on you.

564
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,540
Or you can pay in cash.

565
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,660
No cash. No overthinking.

566
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,620
(Xiang Yuan)

567
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,060
Is your name Xiang Yuan?

568
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,940
(Calm down, calm down, calm down.)

569
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,780
Hey... Are you alright?

570
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,820
The hat is too tight.

571
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,700
Yeah.

572
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,020
Why do you tie it so tightly?

573
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,060
Do you think we are bad guys?

574
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,420
Or

575
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,060
you look very pretty?

576
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,140
Prettier than you.

577
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,100
But definitely

578
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,900
no prettier than my goddess.

579
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,700
Who is your goddess?

580
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,460
Ashers,

581
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,220
the First Hidden Lady of the server.

582
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,260
That's a chic title.

583
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,020
It is.

584
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:01,900
But

585
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,820
it's said that

586
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,460
she's pretty

587
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,020
with the mask on.

588
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,380
When the mask is off,

589
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,660
I'm not sure about her look.

590
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,980
By the way, we are idle.

591
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,980
Do you play games?

592
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,140
No.

593
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,620
Why are you so fierce?

594
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,020
My Boss doesn't play games either.

595
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,460
I wonder

596
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,860
how you guys kill time

597
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,300
without games.

598
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,180
But to tell the truth,

599
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,020
with that look,

600
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,900
he can earn millions

601
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,660
as a game live streamer.

602
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,940
That won't be a problem.

603
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,940
But he is a bad player.

604
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,940
That's wonderful.

605
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,780
What... What did you say?

606
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,580
I said,

607
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,180
he has

608
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,140
such a handsome face.

609
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,380
If he is also a good gamer

610
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,180
like your goddess,

611
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,820
how can others live?

612
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,140
Right?

613
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,700
It seems true

614
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,260
on the Internet.

615
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,780
She wears a mask

616
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,220
and uses a voice changer when streaming.

617
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,060
Ashers must

618
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,940
be a shemale.

619
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,300
Hey, You Zhi.

620
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:21,940
OK.

621
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,060
Boss. It's You Zhi.

622
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,980
The order of Mingxiong Electronics

623
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,860
is returned again.

624
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,180
The signal receivers

625
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,100
of the last batch

626
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,300
had problems again.

627
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,060
But the budge

628
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,060
for the model's high-precision version

629
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,940
is not enough.

630
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:34,900
Can you ask Boss

631
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,980
for a solution?

632
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,780
Let him send the model.

633
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,300
He asked you to send the model.

634
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,100
Do you hear it?

635
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,460
Bye.

636
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,060
Stop playing.

637
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,860
Why did you take my seat?

638
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:03,740
Sir.

639
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,340
Is this her seat?

640
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,540
No.

641
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,360
Didn't you say

642
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,860
our Boss is handsome

643
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,940
and you like him?

644
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:13,580
Come.

645
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,340
A VIP seat for you.

646
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,300
No thanks.

647
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,820
Little girl.

648
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,340
Is your destination Yulan Garden

649
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,180
on Chunjiang Road?

650
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,220
On Xiying Road.

651
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,020
What? Xiying Road?

652
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,220
How to get to Xiying Road?

653
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:03,900
I...

654
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,500
I... I don't know.

655
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,740
Little girl.

656
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,100
Turn on the navigation

657
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,260
of your phone.

658
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,500
I'll follow your navigation.

659
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,340
This

660
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,340
navigation

661
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,300
(Remaining 21.7km, 42min)
was given by them.

662
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,180
The location can't be changed.

663
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,220
Bothersome.

664
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,260
Sir.

665
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,500
Don't you have onboard navigation?

666
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,740
My phone is out of power.

667
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,860
I don't have that.

668
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,100
It's expensive and hard to use.

669
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,860
Charge it first.

670
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,620
Tell me the route

671
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,220
and we can go.

672
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,140
I'll turn on

673
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,100
the onboard smart screen.

674
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,380
You can just look at the screen.

675
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,660
I'm new here, and
not familiar with the way.

676
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,100
I might guide you wrong.

677
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,140
Fine.

678
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,740
Actually sir, first,

679
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,420
no need to consider

680
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:51,980
the radiation to the body

681
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,260
from the hardware of onboard navigation.

682
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,380
So, its power is huge.

683
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,060
It receives

684
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,100
richer signals

685
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:57,900
than phones,

686
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,980
and is more accurate.

687
00:27:59,140 --> 00:27:59,740
Second,

688
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,500
the memory and computation

689
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,460
of onboard navigation

690
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,180
is better than phones.

691
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:04,660
You can

692
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,780
install one and try.

693
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:06,740
What?

694
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,220
I won't install it.

695
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,100
Are you a car seller?

696
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,620
You are a good talker.

697
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,740
So professional.

698
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,540
No then.

699
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,140
(Really?)

700
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,220
(Does Xu Yanshi sell cars now?

701
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:24,940
(No wonder)

702
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,380
(he never goes to classmates' parties,)

703
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,700
(even not in the chat group.)

704
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,700
(He is absolutely)

705
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,260
(out of the human world.)

706
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,940
(He used to enjoy honors,)

707
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,620
(with so many competition awards.)

708
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,860
(He was about to)

709
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,500
(get admission to the college,)

710
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,620
(yet I forced him to be transferred.)

711
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,660
(All his previous honors)

712
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,500
(were in vain.)

713
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:49,660
(Did he fail to go to college)

714
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,620
(because of the transfer?)

715
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,660
(Xiang Yuan.)

716
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,500
(You hurt him so much.)

717
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,660
(Xu Yuan)
(I hear that Xu Yanshi)

718
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,140
(doesn't live well now.)

719
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,860
(He seems to be a car seller.)

720
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,180
(Didn't your brother)

721
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,380
(want to buy a car days ago?)

722
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,620
(Let him help.)

723
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,740
(We're classmates.)

724
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,020
(We can help his business.)

725
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,140
(Don't say I told you.)

726
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,060
(Connecting now.)

727
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:24,830
Well.

728
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,900
Little girl.

729
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,660
Are you from Shanghai?

730
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,700
Traveling?

731
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,660
No.

732
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,940
Working.

733
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,780
The destination is near.

734
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,140
After tonight,

735
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,060
Xu Yanshi and I

736
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,700
won't meet again.

737
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,540
Really? Xiang Yuan.

738
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,980
That Straight-A student, Xu Yanshi,

739
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,300
is selling cars?

740
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,620
That's miserable.

741
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,020
I'll ask my brother

742
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,620
and see if he wants to change his car.

743
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,700
You help him so much.

744
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,420
Do you have any thought

745
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,180
on him?

746
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,700
(Is it late)

747
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,260
(to jump out now?)

748
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,020
Why don't you talk?

749
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,140
Xiang Yuan.

750
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,420
(Out of connection)

751
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,820
Long time no see, Xiang Yuan.

752
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,940
Did that girl leave?

753
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,500
What's going on, Boss?

754
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,780
That was strange.

755
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,540
So, you know each other.

756
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:16,540
Hello.

757
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,020
Hello.

758
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,660
Where is Building 7, please?

759
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,100
Building 7?

760
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,140
That's building 7.

761
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,180
Thanks.

762
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,060
It's fine.

763
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,900
Do you need help?

764
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,300
Thank you.

765
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,020
What just happened?

766
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,500
You just hung up on me.

767
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,220
When I get back to Shanghai,

768
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,420
I will kill you!

769
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,220
What... What's wrong?

770
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:17,820
Don't move!

771
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,900
Thanks...

772
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,620
Go back.

773
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,860
Are you so heartless?

774
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,380
After so many years,

775
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,340
can't you proudly

776
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,940
show up

777
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,500
and then leave coolly?

778
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,580
Alright,

779
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,580
it's of no use wondering about that.

780
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,580
Perhaps he was just

781
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:21,580
taking you

782
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,700
as an old-time friend.

783
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,620
He helped you untie the knot

784
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,900
in case you suffocate.

785
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,980
That's the best he could do.

786
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,340
Even if we're just friends,

787
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,460
I'm the one who was humiliated.

788
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,220
Anyway, how is he looking?

789
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,140
Is he ugly?

790
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,540
That's what I care about.

791
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,540
Yes, he's bald and fat.

792
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,980
Don't take this as retaliation.

793
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,420
I have his photo,

794
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,140
you know.

795
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,340
I downloaded the photo

796
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,380
in the WeChat group.

797
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,460
It's said they met him at an event.

798
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,660
He wasn't a car seller back then.

799
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,260
He wasn't ugly at all,

800
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,100
instead, he was more handsome.

801
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,620
The girls in the group all went crazy.

802
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,500
Why did you even ask me then?

803
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,380
So how do you feel

804
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,620
meeting him again?

805
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,660
Nothing special.

806
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,180
I just

807
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,060
feel bad knowing that

808
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,060
he isn't happy.

809
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,740
This is not like you.

810
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,420
You're always carefree.

811
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,700
Be honest with me.

812
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,020
Well, you know me back then.

813
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:19,740
I was

814
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,660
so stupid then.

815
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,660
I was 100% sure

816
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,020
he was into me.

817
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,740
And I confronted him.

818
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,100
I…

819
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,220
I was such a fool.

820
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,140
But soon after that,

821
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,620
someone spread it,

822
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,300
and everyone in our school

823
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,860
knew it.

824
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,140
No wonder Xu Yanshi transferred.

825
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,140
A decent man like him

826
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:39,740
would never swallow

827
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,700
the insult.

828
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:41,820
Seriously,

829
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,340
you weren't there today.

830
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,980
His face was…

831
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,420
Never mind.

832
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,180
I might not

833
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,500
see him again.

834
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,700
If I do see him again,

835
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,420
I wouldn't be able

836
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,780
to see his eyes.

837
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,140
Alright, I have to go.

838
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,220
My boss calls me.

839
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,740

840
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,820
Your boss is still by your side.

841
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:03,260

Yeah.

847
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,780
It seems hungry.

848
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,420
There are a lot of worms.

849
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,700

850
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,260
Those are also worms.

851

You're right about it again.

857
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:40,740
It can still drink it?

860
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,760

861

862
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,060

863
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,380

00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,420
Good night.

865
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:02,980
Boss,

866
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:05,980
you recognized

867
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,980
that girl from the very beginning, right?

868
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,220
It was

869
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,300
quite awkward just now.

She

871
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,060
was into you, wasn't she?

872
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:22,660
Did you

873
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,980
have a crush on her?

874

875
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,820
Is she pretty?

876
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,260

the incorrect code promptly.

This is what I should do, prof.

Have you solved the problem

888
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,020
I gave you last time?

889
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,860
I have a new idea.

00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,460
(Velin. Lin Qingqing. Technical Group)

965
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,020
Are you also going to Velin?

966
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:11,860
You Zhi. Shi Tianyou.

967
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,380
They go to the company so early.

968
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,140
Everyone goes so early.

969
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:15,820
Looks like no one wants to

970
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,260
vacant a place for that parachute.

971
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,500
Parachute?

972
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:21,380
Those who

973
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,860
join the company suddenly

974
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:23,780
by connections.

975
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,220
There are several

976
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,780
in our department

977
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:27,780
every year.

978
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,020
We are so annoyed.

979
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:30,820
Are there many?

980
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,540
Yes.

981
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:33,740
Too many.

982
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,620
How much?
I'll transfer the money to you.

983
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,180
It's fine. I paid half.

984
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:05,980
Scan the code

985
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,140
for another half.

986
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:09,300
We are carpooling anyway.

987
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,300
