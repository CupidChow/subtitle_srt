00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,840
joined us

73
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,710

00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,960
of Xu Yanshi.

Let's warmly welcome him.

76
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,120
Welcome!

00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,030
Wow!

87

(Navigation Research Institute: Congratulations,
you've passed the interview of the Institute.)

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,800

89
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,680
by the Institute!

90
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,280
Not this one.

91
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,070
That was disgusting.

92
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,270
Think about it.

93
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,630
If I mix Jagermeister

94
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,600

95
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,630
and coffee,

96
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,920
how will it taste?

97
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,310
How about

98
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,480
you add some ginseng chicken soup?

99
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,240
It's nutritious.

100
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,190
Wine with soup?

101
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,560
How did you come up with that?

102
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,040
Add some of this.

103
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,240
What else?

104
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,160
That's awful!

105
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,480
Did you add some chicken soup?

106
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,870
Well...

107
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,630
I...

108
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,430
I'm going to the toilet.

109
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,040
I can't hold it anymore.

110
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,750
Shu,

111
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,360
I have to tell you something.

112
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,000
What?

113
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,040
You have no idea

114
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,630
what Gao Leng did for you!

115
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,000
Once,

116
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,190
you were carrying several big boxes

117
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:00,830
upstairs.

118
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,870
Gao Leng saw that.

119
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,240
In case you got tired,

120
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,160
he asked You Zhi and me to help you.

121
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,160
He was afraid that if he went to help you,

122
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,510
our colleagues might gossip.

123
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,070
Shu,

124
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,310
when you wanted to do business

125
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,240
with Mr. Lu of Ruidong,

126
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,480
and invited him to the play

127
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,950
whose tickets were hard to get,

128
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,560
Gao Leng got you the tickets

129
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,360
with a model figure he bought
after queueing for the whole night.

130
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,680
In case you were too angry with him

131
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,680
to accept the tickets,

132
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,190
he asked me to give them to you.

133
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,000
And...

134
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Do you know why

135
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,870
Gao Leng fought Lu Dong?

136
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,240
Still for you.

137
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,240
Because Lu Dong

138
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,000
spoke ill of you

139
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
and humiliated you

140
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,070
at someone else's party.

141
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,070
Gao Leng was boiling with anger.

142
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,270
Even if he knew you would be angry,

143
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,870
he still wanted to give him a lesson.

144
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,950
Shu,

145
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,920
you often complain
that Gao Leng is too childish.

146
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,240
But you've never seen

147
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,920
how much he has changed

148
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,720
just to continue his relationship

149
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,190
with you!

150
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,360
What are you doing?

151
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,430
Why didn't you

152
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,600
beg me to forgive you?

153
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,160
Lu Dong and I

154
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,750
were never together.

155
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,000
Re... Really?

156
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,950
I waited for such a long time.

157
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,870
And for you,

158
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,000
I even came to Shanghai.

159
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,720
But you still don't trust me?

160
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,000
I had no idea.

161
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,240
I'm just in time
for your birthday, Professor.

162
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,920
A few days ago,

163
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,070
I saw a pen

164
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,000
perfect for you.

165
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,040
Hope you'll like it, Professor.

166
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,510
In time for my birthday?

167
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,630
You nearly missed the interview!

168
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,800
You're daring, you know?

169
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,190
Before the interview,

170
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,190
you went to the US for your mother!

171
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,480
Luckily, your return flight

172
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,310
wasn't delayed due to the hurricane.

173
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,070
Had it been,

174
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,680
even if you cried and begged me,

175
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,630
you couldn't join the Institute!

176
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,430
What? Are you coming

177
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,920
to explain something

178
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,680
for Xiang Yuan?

179
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,950
Professor,

180
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,790
I know you did everything for me.

181
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,600
But when you blamed her,

182
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,080
Xiang Yuan would really think

183
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,440
you hated her.

184
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,270
In the future,

185
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,670
if I'm not doing

186
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,120
as well as you think

187
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,960
I can do it,

188
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,670
blame me any way you want it.

189
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,270
But don't blame her.

190
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,080
I'm just not capable enough.

191
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,240
None of her business.

192
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,790
Enough!

193
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,320
Say no more!

194
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,480
All right, all right.

195
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,360
That's pretty enough.

196
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,720
What's gone is gone.

197
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,790
Don't bring it up again.

198
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,670
Yanshi, come and have lunch.

199
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,270
Come on.

200
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,200
Yanshi, come on.

201
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,240
Dude,

202
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,200
we didn't get along for a long time.

203
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,320
But our most important projects

204
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,360
counted on you.

205
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,750
The patents you applied for

206
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,790
have been approved.

207
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,790
My company

208
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,720
has a place in the industry now.

209
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,480
I'd like to thank you guys, too.

210
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,510
I've also learned a lot here

211
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,240
from you.

212
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,080
Mr. Xu,

213
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,320
we worked together for months

214
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,000
and I really don't want you to leave.

215
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,870
Come on.

216
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,840
He's going to make contributions

217
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,390
to our country.

218
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,720
Let's stop here.

219
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,390
Anyway,

220
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,750
you always have shares in my company.

221
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,630
And we are

222
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,200
always good friends.

223
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,030
Right.

224
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:50,870
By the way,

225
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,080
remember to come to the wedding

226
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,120
of Kairui and me.

227
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,270
Sir,

228
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,960
to No.77 Beidou Road.

229
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,320
Oh, that place.

230
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,030
I know it.

231
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,870
I feel they never get off work.

232
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:26,870
I've never seen the light

233
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,240
in their offices

234
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,960
go off.

235
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,700
(Navigation Research Institute)

236
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,270
Why are you back so early today?

237
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,150
What?

238
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,750
You don't want me back?

239
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,240
I was waiting for too long.

240
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,550
Recently,

241
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,840
I've been really busy.

242
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,000
After it's over,

243
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,240
I'll take you out for fun.

244
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,440
All right.

245
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,550
It has to be a lot of fun.

246
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,320
OK.

247
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,960
I'm going to take a bath.

248
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,200
I have

249
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,240
something important

250
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,030
to tell you.

251
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,360

I need a lipstick touch-up.

287
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,390
Going out?

288
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,080
I just tried

289
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,000
the new lipstick.

290
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,030
So late?

291
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,840
What a silly man!

292
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,080
Tell me. What is it?

293
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,600
Well...

294
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,510
I'm going on a business trip to Xichang.

295
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,320
In the following days,

296
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,270
I can't keep you company.

297
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,120
That's all?

298
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,000
That's all.

299
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,390
(At 3:22 PM this afternoon,)

300
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,080
(in Xichang Satellite)

301
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,790
(Launch Center,)

302
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,080
(China successfully launched)

303
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,720
(No.52 and No.53)

304
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,510
(Beidou navigation satellites)

305
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,120
(with one carrier rocket,)

306
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,360
(CZ-3B.)

307
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,270
(So far,)

308
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,240
(all MEO satellites)

309
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,360
(have been launched.)

310
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,270
(It also marks)

311
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,720
("Two Satellites in One Rocket")
(the completion of)

312
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,630
(the basic constellation deployment of BDS-3.)

313
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,440
(After a three-hour flight,)

314
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,390
(the satellites successfully
entered the orbits.)

315
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,840
(In Orbit Test will be done later.)

316
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,120
It's been a long time

317
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,000
since you last saw Xu Yanshi, right?

318
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,960
How do you know?

319
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,030
(As the main satellite)

320
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,110
(of BDS-3 constellation deployment...)

321
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,960
They're on TV every day.

322
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,590
I can imagine

323
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,920
what he's doing now.

324
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,480
Exactly what your mother was doing.

325
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,720
Grandpa,

326
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,440
you've said that

327
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,830
many times.

328
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:15,510
Anyway,

329
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,510
you picked him

330
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,240
as your boyfriend.

331
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,480
In this case,

332
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,680
you should be more considerate.

333
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,830
This is the crucial moment for them

334
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,270
when they can't be distracted.

335
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,030
If you have no one

336
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:30,920
to vent your anger on,

337
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,310
get mad at me.

338
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,790
I'm used to that, anyway.

339
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,830
(Now,)

340
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,720
(BDS-3 global system constellation...)

341
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,110
I don't know

342
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,440
how complicated

343
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,790
or how charming

344
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,790
BDS can be.

345
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,550
("Two Satellites in One Rocket")
So many excellent talents

346
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,000
work tirelessly for it.

347
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,240
He's working hard

348
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,110
with Mother's effort

349
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,030
and he'll realize their dream.

350
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:07,920
No.

351
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,880
You can't fix the bug like this.

352
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,510
This is right.

353
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,310
No, it's not.

354
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,400
No, no. It's here.

355
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:12,960
Add this.

356
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,440
Modify it.

357
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:14,590
But...

358
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,400
Yuan, why are you back?

359
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,920
Why are you still working?

360
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,640
Today, some bugs were detected

361
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,750
in the new system.

362
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,920
In order not to delay the launch
at the end of this month,

363
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,110
we want to solve the problem soon.

364
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,000
Right.

365
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,270
Only you three?

366
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,160
Any problem here?

367
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,110
No.

368
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,680
Then let's pass.

369
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,590
Come on, listen to me.

370
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,550
You can't patch it like this.

371
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,790
It can't be.

372
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,790
This is E.

373
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,750
I know this.

374
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,680
Right?

375
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,110
See?

376
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,160
Come in.

377
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,720
I have confirmed the relevant matters

378
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,640
with the media we cooperated

379
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,240
at Velin New Product Launch of 2019.

380
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,000
But...

381
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,240
But what?

382
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,070
Last time,

383
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,070
Down's ID was exposed

384
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,000
and it made them much more famous.

385
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,160
They want something more

386
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,750
to reveal this time.

387
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,680
But think about it.

388
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,350
How can we get so many shadow IDs?

389
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:28,750
I'll take care of it.

390
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,070
(2h and 35min)
Hello, everybody.

391
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,070
This is

392
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,590
Ashers.

393
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,720
Long time no see.

394
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,400
I miss you quite a lot.

395
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,440
At two this afternoon...

396
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,680
What's going on?

397
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,480
Why do I remember

398
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,440
Ashers was also dressed like this

399
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,960
in her livestreaming?

400
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:04,830
It...

401
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:20,750
It...

402
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,240
Isn't it too much?

403
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:24,920
Yuan,

404
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,750
are you learning from Boss

405
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,880
to pretend to be Ashers

406
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,240
for our propaganda?

407
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,960
This mask

408
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,160
sells at 3.5 yuan online

409
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,350
at most.

410
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,480
Come on.

411
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:39,590
Don't overdo it.

412
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,920
Co... Coffee for you.

413
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,160
Go get changed. Time for work.

414
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,920
It... It doesn't suit you.

415
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,720
How I miss Ashers!

416
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,200
Morning.

417
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,160
You're quite early, Leng.

418
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,960
Good.

419
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,030
You're early, too.

420
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,550
Get to work.

421
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,440
(A post from Ashers)
My idol Ashers

422
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,720
just posted something.

423
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,720
Hello.

424
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,110
Morning, guys.

425
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:38,830
Morning.

426
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,000
You're so early.

427
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,000
Come on.

428
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,310
Let me see.

429
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,440
Hello, everybody.

430
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,510
This is Ashers.

431
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:55,880
It's...

432
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,270
It's me!

433
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,400
What?

434
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,160
You?

435
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,550
Oh, it's you.

436
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,920
It's a trending topic now.

437
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,550
Is it really you?

438
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,270
You... You look bad.

439
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,550
It's really you!

440
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,000
(It sells at 3.5 yuan)

441
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,790
(online at most.)

442
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,110
It's...

443
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,310
Xiang Yuan is Ashers!

444
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,880
Who... Who's Ashers?

445
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,480
(Comments)
(Awesome, Ashers.)

446
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,350
(Who said Ashers was no longer popular?)

447
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:24,830
(I want to punch him.)

448
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,160
(Who's this man? Bad-looking.)

449
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,310
Shi Tianyou,

450
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,750
these two parts

451
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,960
still need to be improved.

452
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,200
Perfect them.

453
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,590
I didn't know

454
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,590
Down was around me

455
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,110
and now even Ashers.

456
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,640
What the heck!

457
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,550
And...

458
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,680
Why did you edit my part

459
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,720
in your video?

460
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,480
Netizens cursed me the whole afternoon.

461
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,510
You kept saying

462
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,550
you wanted to be
in the shot with Ashers.

463
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I just realized your dream.

464
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:52,680
You!

465
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,510
My dream for my idol

466
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,750
ended.

467
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,270
Why did it end?

468
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,270
Can I not be your idol?

469
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,110
No.

470
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:03,790
Boss?

471
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,000
Boss.

472
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,000
What are you doing here?

473
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,960
Why do you stare at me?

474
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,350
Can't I?

475
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,200
Xu Yanshi.

476
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,830
It's been a month

477
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,590
and now you look

478
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,440
more masculine.

479
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,000
And you also get

480
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,960
more handsome.

481
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,240
On the phone that day, I heard someone

482
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,440
call you Brain Box.

483
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,510
Everyone there is a brain box.

484
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,030
I heard

485
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,590
you recruited a male secretary.

486
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,160
Who told you that?

487
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,440
And he was born in 1998.

488
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,310
Majored in acting.

489
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,680
Is he handsome?

490
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,110
I...

491
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,790
I didn't recruit him.

492
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,550
He's just...

493
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,440
A distant cousin.

494
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,200
Grandpa said he majored in acting

495
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,750
and didn't get a job for the moment.

496
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,790
Then he came here

497
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,350
as an intern.

498
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,270
He's... He's indeed a young cousin.

499
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,350
Think about

500
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,790
your own cousins.

501
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,640
I don't have cousins.

502
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,680
Yuan!

503
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,030
Yuan,

504
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,480
where's my walking stick?

505
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:10,790
Yuan...

506
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,790
What?

507
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,590
Did he really say that?

508
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,680
And,

509
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,030
I found a diamond ring

510
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,510
in his pocket last month.

511
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,070
Do you think he will...

512
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,590
He will propose to you!

513
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,000
You... You have to

514
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,070
(Xu Yuan)
be beautifully dressed.

515
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,480
How about you wear

516
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,310
the purple dress you just bought?

517
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,240
I just sent it to the laundry.

518
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:42,720
What...

519
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,960
What about the golden suit?

520
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,030
It looks great, too.

521
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,310
Yeah. Wait, wait a minute.

522
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,960
Xiang Yuan, leave it to me.

523
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,110
Don't stain your dress.

524
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,590
It's OK. It's OK.

525
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,160
I'll ask Xu Yanshi to help me.

526
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:01,640
There he is.

527
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,310
Thank you.

528
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,030
Why didn't you tell me

529
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,750
we came for Mrs. Liang's birthday?

530
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,790
I saw you

531
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,680
get formally dressed

532
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,790
and I thought you knew it.

533
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,030
I...

534
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,440
Hurry.

535
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,790
Is everything ready?

536
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:24,830
Come and have dinner.

537
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:25,720
OK.

538
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,640
Xiang Yuan, come have dinner.

539
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,960
Where's Professor Liang?

540
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,480
Knowing you would come,

541
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,350
he hid in his study.

542
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,640
I called him several times

543
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,070
but he didn't come out.

544
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,790
Does Professor Liang not want to see me?

545
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,160
Not like that.

546
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,680
He blamed you wrong

547
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,510
and didn't know how to explain it.

548
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,550
Ignore him. He's just stubborn.

549
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,200
The pride thing.

550
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,440
Liang,

551
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,310
time for dinner.

552
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,110
Be right there.

553
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,400
- Professor Liang.
- Professor Liang.

554
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,070
Be seated, guys.

555
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,790
Where are Xiang Yuan's chopsticks?

556
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,400
How could you forget
to prepare the chopsticks for her?

557
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,830
Here, chopsticks.

558
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,030
Umm...

559
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,110
Mrs. Liang, a toast to you.

560
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,920
Happy birthday!

561
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,160
I'll drink it up.
You drink as much as you want.

562
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,630
OK.

563
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,270
Cheers.

564
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:33,830
But Professor...

565
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,480
I'll just use the big cup.

566
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,790
Why does it taste like chili water?

567
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,400
It is chili water.

568
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,590
Happy birthday!

569
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,880
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

570
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,920
Thanks, thanks.

571
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,070
Xiang Yuan, come on.

572
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,590
Let me show you something.

573
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,030
I'll wash the dishes first.

574
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,000
That's a job

575
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,750
for Professor Liang.

576
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,240
Come on.

577
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,310

Sorry.

Cheers.

Cheers.

865
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,360

866

Yuan.

869
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,510
Yuan,

870
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,000
do you remember this?

871
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,920
Isn't it my promise feather?

872
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,510
Yes.

873
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,280
You took three feathers

874
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,840
and used two of them.

875
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,150
It's the last one

876
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,320
and what would you wish for?

877
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,190
Be careful, walk slowly.

878
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,000
I wish my grandpa

879
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,710
would live a long life

880
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,840
and always be healthy!

881
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,880
I didn't expect you to say this.

882
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,920
I'm really glad. I am.

883
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,440
My good granddaughter.

884
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,630
In this case, Grandpa,

885
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,280
give this feather to me.

886
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:34,320
Last time, I told you

887
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,230
about the pet store.

888
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,550
Think about it.

889
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:39,436
Piss off.

890
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,110
- You sit here.
- Hi, Mr. Lin.

891
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,550
Come on. Take a seat.

892
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,590
You...

893
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,230
Really fast.

894
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,320
Indeed.

895
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,710
Hi, Mr. Situ.

896
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,150
Hi, Kairui.

897
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,000

899
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,070
- Come. Let's take the photo.
- Move ahead.

900
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:57,800

901
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,630
Here we go.

902
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:59,000
Start.

903
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,800
Cheese.

904
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,550
Three, two, one!

905
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:09,760
Come on.

906
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:12,400
Fill the glasses. Fill them.

907
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,030
Come on. Drink it up.

908
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,070
- Drink.
- Hurry.

909
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:15,920
Come on, fill the glasses.

910
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,400
- Cheers.
- Together.

911
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,550
Why isn't the moon

912
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,590
round at all?

913
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:19,550
I want to see the full moon.

914
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,630
Because it's not the 15th, honey.

915
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,960
It's only the 8th day.

916
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,510
But I want the full moon.

917
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,590
Didn't we agree

918
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,320
that we would live day by day?

919
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:30,840
Let me ask him for you.

920
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,360
Hello, 15th.

921
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,510
Could you come tomorrow

922
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:38,280
instead of the 9th day?

923
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,230
My wife said

924
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,320
she wanted to see the full moon tomorrow.

925
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,150
He said OK.

926
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,840
Look.

927
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,960
If...

928
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,480
If I were as childish as them,

929
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,800
launch me up there

930
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,150
the way you launched the satellite.

931
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:02,030
The last networking satellite of BDS-3

932
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:02,840
has been launched.

933
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,150
You may not get that chance.

934
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,960
You really want to send me up?

935
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,230
Should I feel lucky

936
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,550
that the project is over?

937
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,800
It's not completely over, actually.

938
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,480
By the end of 2023,

939
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,550
we'll have to achieve

940
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:18,630
global tracking and independent control

941
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:19,590
of flights.

942
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,590
So, from now on,

943
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,710
I'll be very busy.

944
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,510
Don't worry.

945
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,590
I'm always here for you.

946
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,150
When I'm saying this,

947
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:36,150
I even want to marry you.

948
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,070
Marry me any time you want.

949
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:56,760
(Recently,)

950
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,320
(Mr. Yang,)

951
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:58,920
(Chairman of Pingshan Technology)

952
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,630
(and his mistress Ms. Li)

953
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:02,070
- Have some coffee.
- (were suspected of embezzlement.)

954
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:03,150
- It's hot, be careful.
- (Today, the municipal procuratorate)

955
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:05,670
(decided to charge them.)

956
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,670
Xu Yanshi,

957
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,400
they were arrested.

958
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,540
They deserve this.

959
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,440
- Here.
- Congratulations.

960
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:24,000
Thanks.

961
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,030
Give me your ID cards

962
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:25,670
and household registers.

963
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:26,280
OK.

964
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,400
Boy,

965
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:33,070
what's your name?

966
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:33,960
Who are you looking for?

967
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,150
My name is Sweet Dumpling.

968
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:37,030
(PRC Property Ownership Certificate)
I came to sell my house.

969
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:38,230
Sell your house?

970
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,590
But this is the Bureau of Civil Affairs.

971
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:41,630
What is this place?

972
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,030
It's for adults

973
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:44,840
to get married or divorced.

974
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,510
Where are your parents?

975
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,840
Where can I sell my house, then?

976
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:52,480
Why do you want to sell it?

977
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,480
Because it's vacant.

978
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,280
No one lives in it.

979
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:02,630
Ma'am,

980
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:04,510
if I can't sell my house here,

981
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:06,440
can you help my parents

982
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,800
to get divorced?

983
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:09,880
Sorry, sorry.

984
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,840
I'm sorry.

985
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:13,800
If you do this again,

986
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,000
I'll ask your father to beat you!

987
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,400
Xu Yanshi,

988
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:19,360
your son is giving me emotional abuse!

989
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,630
Father keeps working at the Institute

990
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:25,630
and he can't reach me, anyway.

991
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:29,030
Xu Yancheng!

992
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,070
Mom,

993
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,400
