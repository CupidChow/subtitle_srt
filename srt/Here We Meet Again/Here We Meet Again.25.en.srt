00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,040
After domineering in Velin

196
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,720
for such a long time,

197
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,360
she's finally getting what she deserves.

198
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,510
Well done there.

199
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,560
We're so pleased.

200
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,950
Looks like I'm not on the wrong side.

201
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,270
I kept it from you

202
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,630
and please don't be angry.

203
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,070
How would I,

204
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:41,800
my lady?

205
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,950
I still count on you for my work.

206
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,000
But...

207
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,480
Other members of your department...

208
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,240
Will you tell them?

209
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,680
You're back.

210
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,680
Your smile tells me

211
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,830
everything went smoothly.

212
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,720
It couldn't be better.

213
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,870
Especially when I see

214
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,480
your floral apron,

215
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,720
it's putting a perfect ending

216
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,390
to my day.

217
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,800
So,

218
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,680
do you like it?

219
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,030
Can't you see I'm having lunch?

220
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,870
No time for it.

221
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,120
Li Chi.

222
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,480
I misunderstood you,

223
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,750
for locking me up in the dark room

224
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,320
and I got you fired.

225
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,600
My apologies.

226
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,150
Then how did you know

227
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,320
I was wronged?

228
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,910
What are you up to?

229
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,750
Later Lin Qingqing confessed

230
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,840
that they framed you.

231
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,750
(That's why I aggravated)

232
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,600
(your dispute on the meeting.)

233
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,030
(I knew Li Chi would lose his temper)

234
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,840
(Li Qin's recording)
(and start a fight wildly.)

235
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,630
(And Li Yongbiao)

236
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,910
(would have to fire him.)

237
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,480
(Do you know why)

238
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,390
(Ying Yinyin claimed that)

239
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,200
(Li Chi took secret snaps?)

240
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,030
(I told her that, too.)

241
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,360
(Why would I single Li Chi out?)

242
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,840
(Because he is just like)

243
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,030
(an ungrateful and vicious wolf cub)

244
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,960
(who dares to bite anyone.)

245
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,790
(Do you know what this strategy is?)

246
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,360
(To murder a person
with a borrowed knife)

247
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,670
(and kill two birds with one stone.)

248
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,630
I was so impulsive

249
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,030
that I believed her.

250
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,480
You go back home.

251
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,630
I'll talk to him.

252
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,000
Excuse me,

253
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,120
a six-pack of beer.

254
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,080
OK. Enjoy it.

255
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,550
Thanks.

256
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,840
We seldom eat together.

257
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,790
Let's drink.

258
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,840
When I was little,

259
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,750
my family was rich.

260
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,080
At that time,

261
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,000
everyone stuck

262
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,790
around me

263
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,270
and conceded to me.

264
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,720
When my father was suddenly bankrupt,

265
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,390
every one of them

266
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,240
left me.

267
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,670
Later,

268
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,270
only Li Qin

269
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,790
helped me a little

270
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,910
when I didn't know what to do.

271
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,440
So, when she was involved

272
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,600
in office politics,

273
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,270
I tried to help her win.

274
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,870
I have a friend.

275
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,510
- Don't make that up.
- He...

276
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,270
Your story

277
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,120
was exposed by Gao Leng and his guys.

278
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,120
When you were little,

279
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,720
your mother discarded you
and your father.

280
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,960
Your father was swindled
of money and love.

281
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,240
He was even in a ton of debt.

282
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,670
Later,

283
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,600
you and your father

284
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,320
kept moving to avoid the creditors.

285
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,390
You nearly lived

286
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,000
a pariah's life.

287
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,720
Right?

288
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,720
After that,

289
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,480
your college life

290
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,150
was ruined by your little brother

291
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:39,790
your father brought you.

292
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,670
Your ideal work

293
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,080
was ruined by a friend of yours.

294
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,000
That's why you came to Velin,

295
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,360
such a hopeless company.

296
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,320
Why are we so unlucky?

297
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,840
Is it because talents

298
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,870
are always envied?

299
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,910
I just know

300
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,960
everyone has regrets in life.

301
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,910
Sometimes, don't complain

302
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,030
or vent your anger.

303
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,030
At least,

304
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,390
I think life is worth it now.

305
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,080
Worth? Are you insane?

306
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,240
If you had worked

307
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,480
in Xingheng,

308
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,790
you wouldn't have suffered like this.

309
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,600
You would make a great difference, OK?

310
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,390
And maybe,

311
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,120
you might have got married with a child.

312
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,120
You needn't have been single.

313
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,630
Who told you I was single?

314
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,630
You...

315
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,910
You have a girlfriend?

316
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,660
Yes.

317
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:32,630
Oh.

318
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,040
Oh?

319
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:40,920
Mm?

320
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,770
Oh?

321
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,270
Then...

322
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,370
Ah?

323
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,270
I have a girlfriend.

324
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,840
Shouldn't you ask who she is?

325
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,480
Why would I ask?

326
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,750
I don't know her, anyway.

327
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,510
Try asking me.

328
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,000
I...

329
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,320
I know her?

330
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,530
She's...

331
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,000
In our company?

332
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,600
(Can it be Chen Shu?)

333
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,550
(Or why does he insist)

334
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,630
(on telling me that?)

335
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,000
Umm...

336
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,360
Is she...

337
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,910
Hello.

338
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,910
I'm downstairs in your flat.

339
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,440
OK.

340
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,510
Wait for me.

341
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,030
No need.

342
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,550
Tell me

343
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,600
which room you're in.

344
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,550
I can get up there.

345
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,480
No way.

346
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,910
I said I would go to you.

347
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,240
Just wait there.

348
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,390
Bye-bye.

349
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,790
Only a delivered package.

350
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,670
Seriously?

351
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,550
Girlfriend?

352
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,200
She asked me to go shopping with her.

353
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,910
Well, Mr. Xu,

354
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,030
how about we call it a day?

355
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,030
OK. I get it.

356
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,080
I'll pay.

357
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:18,360
Check your WeChat.

358
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,670
I sent you something.

359
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,220
(Receiving file)

360
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,580
(Downloaded)

361
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,820
(Private E-ledger)

362
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,620
(E-ledger)

363
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,510
Before,

364
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,600
when I got kickbacks for Li Qin,

365
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,000
in case I did wrong calculations,

366
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,840
I made a record.

367
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,390
With this,

368
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,240
she can't deny it.

369
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,240
Thanks.

370
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:55,910
Mr. Xu,

371
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,030
is that Chen Shu?

372
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,270
What?

373
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,600
Umm...

374
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,440
Is your girlfriend

375
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,790
Chen Shu?

376
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,480
No.

377
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,550
I was freaked out.

378
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,790
Oh, my package.

379
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,080
Luckily, you came back from Shanghai.

380
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,910
Here, eat it before it gets cold.

381
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,360
How could you even cook this?

382
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,240
And it looks exactly the same

383
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,150
as the dish in some restaurants.

384
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,720
Here, I found

385
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,510
enough ingredients

386
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,240
and I made some dishes casually.

387
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,360
Let me try some.

388
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,320
How does it taste?

389
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,030
Great.

390
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,790
Have some sparkling water.

391
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,270
Be careful not to choke.

392
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:57,440
Here.

393
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,030
You're so good at cooking.

394
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,080
What if I eat too much

395
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,720
and get fat?

396
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,150
That's good.

397
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,600
That makes you healthier.

398
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,160
It's easy for you to say.

399
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,720
If I really gain some weight,

400
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,720
you'll dislike me.

401
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,680
What should I say, then?

402
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,640
Should I say like this?

403
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,350
"It's OK. Eat as you wish.

404
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,920
If you eat too much,

405
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,550
I'll do exercise with you

406
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,160
and you won't gain even a pound."

407
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,640
Try the blueberry flavor.

408
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,070
It'll give me no sense of fulfillment.

409
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,640
Don't bother about that.

410
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,790
Just live the life.

411
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,070
Some fans care about
their idols' careers.

412
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,110
It's the first time

413
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,400
I've seen a fan care about health.

414
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,790
I bought you a little present.

415
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:02,960
How do you like it?

416
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,880
Suit?

417
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,270
I'm a fan caring about your career.

418
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,440
I want you

419
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,440
to wear it

420
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,310
when you go to work

421
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,510
or have social intercourse,

422
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,310
and always think of me.

423
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,590
Do you know my size?

424
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,030
Will it fit?

425
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,070
Try it on and will know.

426
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,550
Looks cool.

427
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,550
Try it on.

428
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:30,920
Now?

429
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,790
Yuan seems to have grown up a lot

430
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,030
in Velin.

431
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,440
If she hadn't arranged for you

432
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,440
to listen throughout the meeting

433
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,110
outside the meeting room,

434
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,790
we wouldn't know

435
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,920
Yang Pingshan could
defend Li Qin that much.

436
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,880
She was teaching fish to swim

437
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,510
and didn't know when to stop.

438
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,590
Since little,

439
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,920
she's been spoilt by us

440
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,270
and now she thinks
she can mess with anyone.

441
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,750
You fear that Yang Pingshan would
hold against her, huh?

442
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,440
Anyway, I wouldn't pin my hope

443
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,000
on Jiamian.

444
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,830
He's always followed Lu Huaizheng

445
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,880
like his tagalong.

446
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,750
Quite indecisive.

447
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,920
Lu Huaizheng refuses

448
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,960
to take over his family business.

449
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,920
So does Jiamian.

450
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,240
Isn't it funny?

451
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,550
But Yuan is different.

452
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,110
Whatever she does,

453
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,880
she's always decisive.

454
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,160
To run away from blind dates,

455
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,160
she preferred

456
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,790
to work in Velin.

457
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,070
And now, to take down Li Qin,

458
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,110
she even challenged Yang Pingshan.

459
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,110
She never cares about what would happen.

460
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,160
But one day, she will

461
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,830
take over the company.

462
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,270
Doesn't she fear

463
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,200
that Yang Pingshan and his man
would work against her?

464
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,480
But honestly,

465
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,000
Yuan did something

466
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,440
that you were expecting to do,

467
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,110
didn't she?

468
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,070
Over all these years,

469
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:54,000
you and Mr. Yang have to fight it out.

470
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,920
And to Yuan,

471
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,310
don't be too harsh.

472
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,000
She did a great job today.

473
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,790
I'm really too old.

474
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,550
I used to think

475
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,440
I was the strongest backing

476
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,590
for Yuan.

477
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,510
But today, she made me realize

478
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,240
that a man would back himself up.

479
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,200
Isn't that obvious?

480
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,680
How could I forget it?

481
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,750
What a poor grandpa!

482
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,750
You're not too old.

483
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,750
But I think Yuan has been

484
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,880
more careful

485
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,270
and more sensible.

486
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,270
She even booked

487
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,400
the hotel room for you.

488
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,960
That's a good hotel.

489
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,510
Wait.

490
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,310
She's actually getting stingier.

491
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,400
Then why did she get me

492
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,680
such an expensive hotel room?

493
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,440
She's just caring about you,

494
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,030
isn't she?

495
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,200
No.

496
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,270
There must be something fishy.

497
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,160
What's the latest time
you have to leave?

498
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,200
Nine.

499
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,030
How do I look?

500
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,790
Say something.

501
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,030
I'll go see who it is.

502
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,200
It's my grandpa.

503
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,750
- Yuan, open the door.
- Then...

504
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,790
Shall I button it up

505
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,350
or shall I...

506
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,070
- It's not...
- put on a shirt?

507
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,270
the perfect timing to meet.

508
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,550
You should hide.

509
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,920
Hide?

510
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,240
It's too complicated to explain.

511
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,070
Please, OK?

512
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:45,720
Here we go.

513
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,440
But...

514
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,240
Where can I hide?

515
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,310
Here, here.

516
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:48,960
Hurry.

517
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,790
- Hurry. Get in.
- But I...

518
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,590
Hurry!

519
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:00,790
Don't move.

520
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,480
I didn't expect you

521
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,440
to be so familiar

522
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,480
with hiding a man.

523
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,750
You flatter me.

524
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,640
Yuan, open the door!

525
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,510
How could you keep your grandpa

526
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,680
waiting for so long?

527
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,350
I was in the bathroom.

528
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,920
Yeah...

529
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,830
You made the muffins?

530
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,110
And you made two.

531
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,790
I...

532
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,960
I learned from the Internet.

533
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,160
And I tried

534
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,510
two different flavors.

535
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,790
You ate one over there

536
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,110
and came here for the second one?

537
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,550
Yes, so what?

538
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,200
OK. Good.

539
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,030
Two bottles of sparkling water,

540
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:03,790
too?

541
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,400
Delicate girls like us

542
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,830
need different flavors.

543
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,070
It won't make us fat, after all.

544
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,310
OK, OK.

545
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,000
Let me taste some.

546
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,750
Good.

547
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,680
As good as those your grandma made.

548
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,590
Then eat some more.

549
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,000
It's really delicious.

550
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,400
Mom.

551
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,110
Baby,

552
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,440
why are you still up so late?

553
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,720
He said

554
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,400
he wouldn't go to bed
until you came back.

555
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:46,720
Go to bed now.

556
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,030
Good night, Mom.

557
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,200
Good night.

558
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,270
You drank quite a lot, huh?

559
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,720
I don't mean to blame you,

560
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,160
but before figuring out

561
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,440
Xiang Yuan's relationship with Mr. Situ,

562
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,510
you made that trouble.

563
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,030
Don't blame me only.

564
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,750
You didn't figure that out, either.

565
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,750
Fine, fine.

566
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,790
Situ Mingtian didn't tell me anything

567
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,830
about his trip to Velin.

568
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,000
Basically,

569
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,750
he just slapped me in the face

570
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,790
at the meeting.

571
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,350
Don't worry.

572
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,480
Velin is

573
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,960
declining.

574
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,550
In the headquarters,

575
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,160
I've got everything arranged.

576
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,510
You don't need to worry.

577
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,680
How about

578
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,550
you and Xuan

579
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,750
go abroad now?

580
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,000
You know I don't want that.

581
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,400
But we have no other choice.

582
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,510
When things cool off,

583
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,720
you can return.

584
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:26,680
Yuan,

585
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,030
the muffin tastes so great.

586
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,680
It's been many years

587
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,640
since I first tasted some.

588
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,480
When your grandma noticed I loved that,

589
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,510
she learned to make some.

590
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,790
Why is there

591
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:37,270
a man's overcoat?

592
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,160
It's for women.

593
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,270
Oversize, very popular.

594
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,240
I know that.

595
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,750
It means you buy a bigger size.

596
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:47,720
Put it on.

597
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,790
Let me see if it's a real oversize.

598
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,510
The color works with my skin,
doesn't it?

599
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,350
I think it weighs two or three kilos.

600
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,590
Rather an oversize.

601
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,590
Put it away.

602
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,070
Yuan,

603
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,920
sending you here is the right decision.

604
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,920
Without you,

605
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,070
I wouldn't know

606
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,830
what happened in Velin.

607
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,790
(What do I do?)

608
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,510
(Xu Yanshi has to leave at nine.)

609
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,440
(When can Grandpa)

610
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,590
(finish his talk?)

611
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,310
All right.

612
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,640
So much for the business thing.

613
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,240
Let's talk about it later.

614
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,160
You're leaving?

615
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,680
Why are you so excited?

616
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,960
I don't want you to leave.

617
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:39,030
I knew you missed me.

618
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,030
Fine, fine.

619
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:40,680
Then tonight,

620
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,160
I will...

621
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,240
I will sleep here.

622
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,960
I'm not going back to the hotel.

623
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:46,550
But...

624
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,920
Only that guest room is vacant

625
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,790
where no one lives.

626
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,000
It's filled with a heap of junk,

627
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,400
dirty and messy.

628
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,310
I'll have Bai tidy it up.

629
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,830
But I paid for the hotel room.

630
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,750
Bai can live there.

631
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,590
You didn't bring your luggage.

632
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,680
I did.

633
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:00,960
Go see who it is.

634
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,960
Hi, Yuan.

635
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,510
Have you got slippers?

636
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,030
Just now, I knocked at the wrong door.

637
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,310
A lady opened the door.

638
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,680
I said, "Oh, no.

639
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,440
I got the wrong place."

640
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,350
Sir, I've brought your luggage

641
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,590
from the hotel.

642
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,640
Put it in that guest room.

643
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,030
I'll do it!

644
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,310
Let Bai do it.

645
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,350
Yuan, come talk with me.

646
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,160
Go. Go talk with him.

647
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,070
What a mess!

648
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,270
What are you smelling?

649
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,240
The tea smells great.

650
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,480
Yuan,

651
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,880
do you remember

652
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,750
why I sent you to Velin?

653
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,160
You asked me to get married

654
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,270
but I didn't want that.

655
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,200
Do you still think so?

656
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,790
Last time, you said you wanted

657
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,350
a positive, outgoing, humorous,

658
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,830
and honey-lipped boyfriend.

659
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,720
I found one for you.

660
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,350
I'm serious.

661
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,350
When you see him,

662
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,510
you'll find him a good match.

663
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,440
You have to see him.

664
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,510
Why are you bringing it up again?

665
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,200
What's the problem?

666
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,680
Sir.

667
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,200
Why did you take it out?

668
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,960
That guest room is too messy.

669
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,310
It's not cleaned.

670
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,110
You... You can't live in it.

671
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,270
How about

672
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,030
we go back to the hotel?

673
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,220
Oh.

674
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,350
Fine, then.

675
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:55,790
It's messy.

676
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:56,960
Let's go back to the hotel.

677
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,960
Grandpa, let me walk you out.

678
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,590
I really don't want you to leave.

679
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,920
Why are you so excited

680
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,640
when I'm leaving?

681
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,830
I'm really confused.

682
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,440
Tonight,

683
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,000
I'll tidy that room up

684
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,480
and get you back tomorrow.

685
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,350
OK, OK.

686
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,310
Have some good rest.

687
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,480
Don't laugh.

688
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,310
They left.

689
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,790
OK.

690
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,000
You should go to the airport.

691
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,200
It's late.

692
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,550
It's not late to start our happy life.

693
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,790
Have you lost your mind?

694
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,030
Isn't this the boyfriend

695
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,440
you asked for?

696
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,680
I fooled my grandpa.

697
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,880
Because they arranged a lot of dates.

698
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,110
Every time they picked a man,

699
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,110
I told them

700
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,200
I loved the opposite type.

701
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,400
So,

702
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,030
was I your last boyfriend?

703
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,000
What do you mean?

704
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,240
Cool, depressed, quiet, and steady.

705
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,030
I should go.

706
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,200
Cheesy pick-up lines

707
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,400
really don't suit you.

708
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,070
What suits me, then?

709
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,350
Get back.

710
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,110
Bye-bye.

711
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,160
Come on.

712
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,550
We'll drive you to the airport.

713
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,160
The muffin tastes great.

714
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,030
Where did you learn to make it?

715
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,640
Glad you like it.

716
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,830
Yuan was

717
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,720
brought up

718
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,790
by her grandma and me.

719
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,790
Every time

720
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:29,640
she was up to something,

721
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,240
we could tell it.

722
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,960
Are you

723
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,240
in a relationship?

724
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,960
Sorry.

725
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,480
We didn't tell you.

726
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:42,790
Don't apologize.

727
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,000
You don't need to tell me, either.

728
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,310
You won't end up well, anyway.

729
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,030
I know what kind of life

730
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:51,790
you were living.

731
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,790
You have a little brother.

732
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,920
Your condition

733
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,550
isn't too bad for now.

734
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,590
However...

735
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,480
Your backgrounds

736
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,720
and living environments

737
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,680
could be

738
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,400
way too different.

739
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,720
So, when you spend more time together,

740
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,920
you can hardly continue.

741
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:09,880
Mr. Situ...

742
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,110
Don't interrupt.

743
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,400
Listen.

744
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,590
Her mother was like you,

745
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,070
a researcher.

746
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,630
When she got busy,

747
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,110
she worked day and night

748
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,000
and couldn't take care of the family.

749
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,510
Day by day,

750
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,670
love died away.

751
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,070
I believe you can see

752
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,190
that Yuan is

753
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,360
very proud.

754
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,360
Even when she has a grievance,

755
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,880
she doesn't tell anyone.

756
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,230
Not even me.

757
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,480
So,

758
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,320
I know

759
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,280
you care a lot about her.

760
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:44,960
But,

761
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,960
you two don't make a perfect couple.

762
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,000
Mr. Situ,

763
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,400
I think

764
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,000
you may

765
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,230
have some misunderstanding

766
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,280
of this age and me.

767
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,360
I have...

768
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,280
Maybe I don't know much about you.

769
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,670
But I wouldn't misunderstand you.

770
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,280
A few days ago,

771
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,190
you resigned.

772
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:05,960
And then,

773
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,840
Soaring's order was gone.

774
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,760
But coincidentally,

775
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,190
when you worked

776
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,760
in another company,

777
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,590
Soaring gave the order to it.

778
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,280
If you tell me

779
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,400
you're innocent

780
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,550
and haven't done anything,

781
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,480
I wouldn't believe it.

782
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,760
And today, I would not

783
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,360
ask you to break up.

784
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,920
If I wanted this,

785
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,710
when you got in the car,

786
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,480
I would have asked my secretary

787
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,000
to give you a cheque

788
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,320
and then I wouldn't

789
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,550
say even a word to you.

790
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,480
What I really want

791
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,960
to tell you is...

792
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,480
If...

793
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,760
If one day,

794
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,760
Yuan asks to break up,

795
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,320
please don't pester her.

796
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,360
Last time when I was here,

797
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,150
I was so embarrassed.

798
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,190
This time,

799
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,710
I'll show you

800
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,630
who never gets drunk.

801
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,760
Mr. Xu?

802
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,590
Why are you back?

803
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,670
Where's Dog Ray?

804
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,710
He left with Ye Siqin.

805
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,320
Looks like

806
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,480
he may get what he wants tonight.

807
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:06,960
Go on with your beer.

808
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:09,800
Come on.

809
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,510
I told you I wouldn't get drunk.

810
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,190
Dog Ray,

811
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,070
about Soaring's order,

812
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,150
you have to go explain it.

813
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,480
Otherwise, you would be single forever

814
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,190
just like the future me.

815
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,000
What... What are you talking about?

816
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,190
Why didn't you

817
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,670
figure out who she was?

818
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,920
I just knew she was
from the headquarters.

819
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,550
Who knows

820
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,190
she can be Mr. Situ's granddaughter?

821
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,000
Cheers.

822
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,320
Mr. Situ.

823
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:47,840
OK.

824
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,440
Be seated.

825
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,320
Where's Xiang Yuan?

826
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,880
In the bathroom.

827
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,280
Great. Hurry.

828
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:54,960
Come on.

829
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,400
Hurry, get me a glass.

830
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,360
Give it to me. Hurry.

831
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,590
Good chance, come on.

832
00:37:59,230 --> 00:37:59,550
That...

833
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,760
Another glass.

834
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,030
Empty it.

835
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:03,360
And...

836
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,150
And put that back.

837
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,190
OK.

838
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:12,880
One liang.
[*50 grams]

839
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:14,190
Two.
[*100 grams]

840
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,800
Three. Three.
[*150 grams]

841
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,280
Done.

842
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:16,880
OK.

843
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,030
Hurry, put it back.

844
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,400
Is it OK?

845
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:19,920
It's OK.

846
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,670
There you are, Miss Xiang.

847
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:22,960
Take your seat.

848
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,190
Don't. Umm...

849
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,030
Please, give me...

850
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,150
Give me a little bit.

851
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,070
Good girl.

852
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:41,840
A little...

853
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,150
A little bit more.

854
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,110
Fine, fine.

855
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,190
It's OK.

856
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,400
Mr. Situ,

857
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,760
is another man coming?

858
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,110
Yes.

859
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,280
One of my good friends.

860
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,800
My guest, actually.

861
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,670
I invited him.

862
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,110
Professor Liang Qin.

863
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,280
You know him.

864
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,760
He's in Xi'an these days.

865
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,400
Liang,

866
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,280
long time no see.

867
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,400
Come on.

868
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:05,960
Hello, Professor Liang.

869
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,550
It's been a while.

870
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,590
Come on. Be seated.

871
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,840
How did you come?

872
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,630
By bus.

873
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,000
Or what? On foot?

874
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,440
It's good to take a bus.

875
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,320
Good.

876
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,920
Now, I can take the bus

877
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,150
for free.

878
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:27,230
It's only free for people above 65.

879
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,190
I'm far from

880
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,440
being 65.

881
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,320
Um...

882
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,280
It's our honor

883
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,190
to have Professor Liang with us today.

884
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,190
Yes, yes.

885
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,840
Now that we're here,

886
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,670
let's drink some wine.

887
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,440
Right, right.

888
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,710
I'm not allowed to drink.

889
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,280
Then enjoy some hot dishes.

890
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,070
Yes, yes.

891
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,000
Have some vegetables.

892
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,280
Good for your health.

893
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,550
You have some walnuts, too.

894
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,510
Good for your brain.

895
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,360
Professor Liang,

896
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:01,070
let's do this.

897
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,320
You drink the tea.

898
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,760
And I'll propose a toast to you.

899
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,400
Don't.

900
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,440
Later, later.

901
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,230
Umm...

902
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,400
Professor Liang.

903
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,840
Oh, I should introduce the senior first.

904
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,360
Xiang Yuan,

905
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,440
this is Professor Liang Qin,

906
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,000
your mother's good friend.

907
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,960
This is Xiang Yuan, my granddaughter.

908
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,550
Gu Li's daughter.

909
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,110
He was a very close friend

910
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,320
of your mother's.

911
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,550
Not that close.

912
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,320
Your daughter-in-law

913
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,280
often said

914
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,550
others' papers

915
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,510
were long and stinky,

916
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,670
while my papers

917
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,630
were like the wig of a bald man,

918
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,590
quite plastic.

919
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:37,510
No, no.

920
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,030
No way.

921
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:38,920
She must have been kidding.

922
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,070
Did you

923
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:41,800
invite me here

924
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,670
for the quota

925
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:43,760
of the Global Navigation Conference?

926
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,320
Let's not talk about work, OK?

927
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:46,960
Let's just

928
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,110
enjoy the meal.

929
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:48,440
Yeah.

930
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,320
I have someone in mind.

931
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,150
Who?

932
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,440
Xu Yanshi, the team leader

933
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,630
of your technical department.

934
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,190
My student.

935
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,300
Xu... Xu...

936
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,110
Xu Yanshi?

937
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,280
In the past few years,

938
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,510
he hasn't done very well in business.

939
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:18,320
Professor Liang,

940
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,550
would you

941
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,670
think about another man?

942
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,000
Go on.

943
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,710
I don't know

944
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:28,760
how he was doing

945
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,710
when he was

946
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,800
in college.

947
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,230
But in the past few years,

948
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,030
he really didn't stand out.

949
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:37,030
New products

950
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,000
he was responsible for

951
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,230
got ordinary feedback.

952
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,510
A lot of complaints, too.

953
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:45,030
And he was quick-tempered.

954
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,510
A few days ago,

955
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,400
he was fired.

956
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,150
Mr. Li!

957
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,070
Funny.

958
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,280
A confused man tried
to instruct an expert.

959
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:03,630
He's saying,

960
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,960
"Don't pretend to know

961
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,590
what you don't know."

962
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:09,230
When you were confused,

963
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,590
how could you instruct someone else?

964
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,880
Pretend?

965
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,710
So don't pretend like that

966
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:19,110
in front of a professor.

967
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,190
Well...

968
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,070
Professor Liang,

969
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,510
I don't know much

970
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,070
about the technical thing.

971
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,670
But Xu Yanshi

972
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:33,070
didn't do very well in recent years

973
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,550
and all superiors

974
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,030
witnessed that.

975
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:39,070
Velin's market share,

976
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:39,800
for example.

977
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,840
Due to the development

978
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,920
of his new products,

979
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,150
it kept declining year by year.

980
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:45,880
Mr. Situ,

981
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,360
we didn't have a choice.

982
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:50,710
When you die, your name is gone

983
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:53,360
and nothing in history will be disturbed.

984
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,070
He's saying,

985
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:58,630
when you have a problem defecating,

986
00:42:58,630 --> 00:42:59,920
don't blame the toilet.

987
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,030
Really knowledgeable!

988
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:05,230
Xu Yanshi was the student

989
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:06,670
I cultivated for many years.

990
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,710
Technically speaking,

991
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:10,280
you can't find

992
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,070
even one single fault with him.

993
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,510
(Looks like)

994
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,960
(he's avenging Xu Yanshi.)

995
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:21,320
The frog in the well
knows nothing of the great ocean.

996
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:23,110
A short-sighted person
cannot see the big picture.

997
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:24,590
Today,

998
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:26,190
if Mr. Situ hadn't invited me,

999
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,510
I wouldn't be

1000
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:29,070
talking to you like this.

1001
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:32,880
Xu Yanshi

1002
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,230
was unrewarded
in your company for years.

1003
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,670
It touched a very raw nerve of mine.

1004
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,550
You will understand

1005
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:40,840
what you have missed.

1006
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,280
I should go.

1007
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,630
Sir, enjoy the meal.

1008
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:52,800
Professor Liang.

1009
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,150
I think I just make myself

1010
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,280
very clear.

1011
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,070
If you still want to convince me...

1012
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,400
I want to thank you.

1013
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:03,920
Thank you for doing something

1014
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,030
I've been expecting to do

1015
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:06,510
but I couldn't do.

1016
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:09,440
Thank you for trusting him.

1017
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,110
Who... Who are you to him?

1018
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:16,880
Oh, I know.

1019
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,630
Wherever he goes,

1020
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,630
he attracts girls.

1021
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,590
Then please,

1022
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:23,630
help him as much as you can.

1023
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:26,150
I will.

1024
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:35,030
Grandpa,

1025
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,800
you can return to Shanghai before me.

1026
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,630
I'm going back in a day or two.

1027
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:41,920
Yuan,

1028
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,960
is Xu Yanshi

1029
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:45,710
really a student

1030
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:47,320
of Professor Liang?

1031
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:49,360
Yes.

1032
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,630
Now you know

1033
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:52,590
what a poor offer you gave him, huh?

1034
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:54,150
Umm...

1035
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,030
Well...

1036
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:57,760
Oh, yeah.

1037
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,510
I have something

1038
00:44:58,510 --> 00:44:59,710
to discuss with you.

1039
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:00,710
So far,

1040
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:02,070
you've completed your target

1041
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,110
in Velin.

1042
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,360
Next year,

1043
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,630
you don't need to come back.

1044
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:07,280
What do you mean?

1045
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,440
The company management has decided

1046
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,000
to close down Velin

1047
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:14,030
before the end of this year.

1048
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:16,070
Why?

1049
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:18,670
Velin had

1050
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:20,710
good achievements this year,

1051
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,920
but the development space

1052
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,800
for vehicle positioning is limited.

1053
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:26,400
Under terrible trends,

1054
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,880
further development is hard to get.

1055
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:30,280
No.

1056
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,510
You can't close down Velin.

1057
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:33,150
Why not?

1058
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,190
I admit

1059
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,670
Velin more or less had

1060
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:36,480
some problems.

1061
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,360
But recently,

1062
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,550
I find that it has

1063
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:40,880
bright prospects

1064
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,230
in truck navigation.

1065
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:44,800
I've got a new idea.

1066
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,800
When I'm back in Shanghai,

1067
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,550
I'll think hard about it.

1068
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:49,480
Then write

1069
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,000
a feasibility report.

1070
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:51,590
OK.

1071
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,630
I'll be on it.

1072
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:53,150
See?

1073
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,030
Like always.

1074
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:55,400
I can never outargue you.

1075
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:56,400
Be careful.

1076
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,800
