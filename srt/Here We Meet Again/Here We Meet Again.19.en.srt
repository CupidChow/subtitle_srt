00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,510
Ms. Li to report it to headquarters.

192
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,870
Yesterday, two people
were sent here from headquarters

193
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,670
to investigate it.

194
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,080
They want to find out

195
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,000
if your participation in the competition

196
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,550
involved

197
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,870
any of the company's core secrets.

198
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,670
If it did...

199
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,390
That's ridiculous.

200
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,360
It has nothing to do

201
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,630
with the company.

202
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,790
We know that

203
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,360
Boss would never do that.

204
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,080
But

205
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,870
if they do

206
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,270
find out something,

207
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,120
in the worst case,

208
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,870
Boss might face legal charges.

209
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,720
I didn't tell you earlier

210
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,000
because Boss asked us not to.

211
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,840
Where is he?

212
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,360
He's upstairs under investigation.

213
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,600
(From the accident
at the launch event that night)

214
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,750
(to today's report,)

215
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,630
(everything)

216
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,120
(is interconnected.)

217
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,080
(I thought)

218
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,630
(that person was just trying to
mess with me,)

219
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,440
(but I was wrong.)

220
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,790
(She obviously wanted to harm me.)

221
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:15,500
(Velin)

222
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,140
(Work ID)

223
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,720
Well,

224
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,510
if you two really want to stir up things,

225
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,360
you should be careful.

226
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,750
Remember to put it away

227
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,910
after you used it.

228
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,480
Now I found it.

229
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,870
What if someone else had found it

230
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,390
and accused you two of

231
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,510
intentionally sabotaging
our company's launch event?

232
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,600
Now that the investigation team is here,

233
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,120
I don't have to report it
to headquarters.

234
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,910
What do you mean by

235
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,910
"intentionally sabotaging
our company's launch event"?

236
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,910
Don't accuse us without evidence!

237
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:13,600
Li Chi.

238
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,480
Sit down.

239
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:18,670
I found it

240
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,000
on your desk.

241
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,870
What else can you say?

242
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,390
You weren't working there that day.

243
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,720
Where did you get it?

244
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,320
Xiang Yuan.

245
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,960
I remembered something

246
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,960
that I want to tell you.

247
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,150
It's about the launch event

248
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,000
that day.

249
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,030
Keep it short.

250
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,630
I just saw Li Chi,

251
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,030
and it occurred to me

252
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:42,840
that it seemed like he didn't

253
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,120
have any work that day,

254
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,240
but I still saw him there.

255
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,900
(Logistics Department)

256
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,480
Where is Li Chi?

257
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,480
In Ms. Li's office.

258
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,580
(Work ID)

259
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,910
Miss Xiang.

260
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,150
Anyone on-site

261
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,480
had one of these

262
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,910
work IDs.

263
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,550
You can easily get one

264
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,840
to frame him.

265
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,670
If you have a problem with him,

266
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,360
please present the real evidence.

267
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,910
I will.

268
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,840
We'll see.

269
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,550
I've told you

270
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,440
to choose the right side.

271
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,200
This time,

272
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,240
Xu Yanshi covered for you.

273
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,440
What about next time?

274
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,790
I've also advised you

275
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,600
not to be so sure about
being on the right side.

276
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,750
Should we do something about it?

277
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,160
What are you doing?

278
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,590
So the investigation team has arrived.

279
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,240
It has nothing to do with him.

280
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,790
Why do you aim at him?

281
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,590
Do you like Xu Yanshi?

282
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,830
Does it have

283
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,110
anything to do with this?

284
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,720
If it doesn't,

285
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,160
then get ready

286
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,640
to make a handover

287
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,720
of the technical department.

288
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,160
I'll have Bai apply to

289
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,830
transfer you back to Shanghai.

290
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,550
Situ Mingtian, what do you want?

291
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,640
I want him

292
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,440
to stay away from you.

293
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,590
The one-year deadline hasn't expired.

294
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,790
I'm not going back, Grandpa.

295
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,270
We made

296
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:16,750
an agreement

297
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,110
about me coming to Velin.

298
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,750
It has nothing to do with Xu Yanshi.

299
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,750
And nothing is gonna happen

300
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,920
between me and Xu Yanshi.

301
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,400
I forced him into this situation.

302
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,160
If you want to punish anyone,
just punish me.

303
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,030
Don't go after him.

304
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,640
For your sake

305
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,830
and for the development of

306
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,350
Donghe...

307
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,640
Stop talking.

308
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,750
Miss Xiang.

309
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,830
I want to talk to you alone.

310
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,970
(So she's the chairman's granddaughter.)

311
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,030

324
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,960
Do you have any more new information?

325
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:04,830
Yes.

326
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,270
Good.

327
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:05,960
Just a moment, please.

328
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,030
Mr. Lu.

329
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,070
Here is the new information you want.

330
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,160
Please take a look.

331
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,830
I'm interested in the project.

332
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,510
I'll take it back

333
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,510
to study it.

334
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,000
By the way,

335
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,310
do you know

336
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,070
where Xiang Yuan's office is?

337
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,590
I'll take you there.

338
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,480
Okay, thank you.

339
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,160
This way, please.

340
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,680
Okay.

341
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,000
Come in.

342
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,550
This way, Mr. Lu.

343
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,270
What brings you here?

344
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,640
I heard you caught a cold.

345
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,310
I'm here to talk to Miss Chen today,

346
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,110
and I brought you some medicine.

347
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,740
(Cold Remedy Granular)

348
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,510
Thank you.

349
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,510
I'll let you guys talk.

350
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,310
I still have a meeting.

351
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,310
Thank you, Miss Chen.

352
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,510
You're welcome.

353
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,240
Oh, right,

354
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,110
as for the project,

355
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,310
I'll let you know my thoughts
after reading it.

356
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,550
Okay, thank you.

357
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,680

This guy is

360
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,440
a wolf in sheep's clothing,

361
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,440
untrustworthy,

362
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,480
and shameless.

363
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,440
For me?

364
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:47,920
It's hot!

365
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,790
Tell everyone
that we're having a meeting.

366
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,830
Where's Xiang Yuan?

367
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,400
I just told her.

368
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,440
She said she had something to do

369
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,550
and won't join the meeting.

370
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,960
Well...

371
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:44,920
Let's adjourn.

372
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,240
Ah?

373
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:48,590
Adjourn...

374
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,750
Adjourn...

(Flower Tea, Ginger Tea,
Sweet Soup, Stew)

376
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,740
(You have booked a flight from Xi'an
to Shanghai at 8 AM tomorrow morning.)

377
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,790
Hello, Mr. Lu.

378
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,550
Okay, I'll be right down.

379
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:13,860
(Donghe Co., Ltd.)

380
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,400
After our investigation,

381
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,920
we found that Xu Yanshi, team leader
of the technical department,

382
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:18,830
did not use

383
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,790
any of our company's technology

384
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,070
for the competition.

385
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,880
However, because he did it

386
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,510
without the company's permission,

387
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,030
Mr. Yang thinks

388
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,270
we should dismiss this employee.

389
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,920
First of all, let me make it clear

390
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,680
that we did not use

391
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,680
any of the company's technology

392
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,830
for this competition.

393
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,750
Miss Xiang?

394
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,440
Yuan.

395
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,510
Why don't you leave us?

396
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,350
I was also a member of

397
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,550
this competition.

398
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,160
We entered

399
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,510
this competition

400
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,160
also in hopes of getting publicity
for our company.

401
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,790
I believe you all know it.

402
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,200
(Participation Instructions)
This competition is authoritative

403
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,550
in the industry.

404
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,590
If we win,

405
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,680
it would be a strong testament

406
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,920
to our company's capabilities.

407
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,160
If we lose,

408
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,680
it would merely be my personal action.

409
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,350
Now you are bursting into

410
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,240
my office with arrogance.

411
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,110
Was it your personal action

412
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,750
or did Xu Yanshi

413
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,880
instruct you to do it?

414
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,000
Of course it was

415
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,880
my personal action.

416
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,480
You...

417
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,240
What's more,

418
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,480
I encouraged him

419
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,720
to enter this competition.

420
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:13,790
If someone must be

421
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,790
held accountable,

422
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,030
that should be me.

423
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,720
You can take a look at

424
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,000
the profits Mr. Xu has brought
to the company

425
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,200
in the past few years.

426
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,030
Due to the extensive publicity

427
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,590
(Xi'an Velin 2018 Annual Sales Report)
of this competition,

428
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,070
many companies have

429
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,240
approached us

430
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,480
for cooperation.

431
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,240
It is all thanks to

432
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,030
Mr. Xu's technical support

433
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,790
that I was able to successfully hold

434
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,960
the launch event

435
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,480
for our supply chain application.

436
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,310
Furthermore,

437
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,640
his technical oversight

438
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,680
of the Cargo Link Navigation

439
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:41,000
contributed to the highest increase
in orders this year,

440
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,790
reaching a three-year record.

441
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,350
Miss Xiang.

442
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,200
It's not just about order volume.

443
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,240
Do you think a few small orders

444
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,880
can prove anything?

445
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,680
What if it's an order from Ruidong?

446
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,400
Lu Dong's Ruidong?

447
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,500
(Cooperation Agreement between
Xi'an Velin and Ruidong Trading)

448
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,400
Mr. Lu.

449
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,400
Xiang Yuan.

450
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,640
Several decision-makers

451
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,030
are quite interested

452
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,070
in your Cargo Link project.

453
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,790
We're having dinner together tonight.

454
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,750
Would you like to join?

455
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,830
I'll wait for you downstairs.

456
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,400
Okay, I'll be right down.

457
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,640
Well...

458
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,440
You can go back.

459
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,920
I'll contact Mr. Yang later.

460
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,510
Okay.

461
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,790
Dear.

462
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,030
Looks like

463
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,920
you're not going to go back to Shanghai.

464
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,480
What did Xu Yanshi do

465
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,920
that made you

466
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,480
so obsessed with him?

467
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,550
What did he do

468
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,960
that made you dislike him

469
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,110
so much?

470
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,310
Anyway,

471
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,790
he had nothing to do with it
in the first place.

472
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,350
Besides, the one-year deadline
isn't up yet.

473
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,350
Never mind.

474
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,160
I'll let it go this time.

475
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,070
However,

476
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,510
I have to remind you

477
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,270
that you two

478
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,510
are from different worlds.

479
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,880
(From different worlds?)

480
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,270
(Why does that...)

481
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,960
That sounds familiar.

482
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,110
I remember he said back then

483
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:23,160
that he liked a girl

484
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,350
from his school.

485
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:26,790
At that time,

486
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,750
we all thought

487
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,920
that girl was dead.

488
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,110
That's what you thought.

489
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,680
Turns out

490
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,240
Down is Xu Yanshi.

491
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,550
Xu Yanshi is Down.

492
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:36,920
Oh my God.

493
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,000
I still can't accept it now.

494
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,350
Down was such a jerk.

495
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,440
He toyed with your feelings.

496
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,750
How could he be Xu Yanshi?

497
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,750
It's harder for me to accept it,

498
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,440
okay?

499
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,510
Just think about it.

500
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,510
I went to Wuhan alone with hopes

501
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,640
to confess my love to him.

502
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,480
Then what happened?

503
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,270
I even told him

504
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,750
that I got together with Xu Yanshi,

505
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,200
and he wished me happiness.

506
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,720
But then again,

507
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,880
it was Xu Yanshi

508
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,510
who played games

509
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,680
with you for so long, right?

510
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,960
Do you think

511
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,200
the girl from a different world

512
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,750
that he mentioned

513
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,110
could be me?

514
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,070
Did you forget

515
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:15,830
that he never paid attention to you

516
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,830
in high school?

517
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,480
Down is a scumbag. You can't deny it.

518
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,310
I don't think you should
go back to Velin.

519
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,200
I mean it.

520
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,110
Where are you going?

521
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,920
To take a walk and clear my mind.

522
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:25,550
Well...

523
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,750
What's wrong, Boss?

524
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,680
Are you missing Miss Xiang?

525
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,440
Where did she go?

526
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,110
She went to Shanghai,

527
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,480
but I don't know why.

528
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,550
Shanghai?

529
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,510
How long?

530
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,000
She didn't say.

531
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,880
I have a feeling she'll be gone
for quite a while.

532
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,550
It's unrequited love.

533
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,400

You should try my game.

582
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,320
This one has more players

583
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,190
and is much more interesting.

584
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,550
Crossfire is a new game.

585
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,510

the number one ranked player?

606
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,280
Don't mind him.

607
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,440
He must want to challenge you.

608
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,960
