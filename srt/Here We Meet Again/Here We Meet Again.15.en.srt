00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,190
deliberately. I'm telling you.

195
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,070
OK. I see.

196
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,800
Gotta hang up.

197
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,480
I'm busy.

198
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,480
(There seem to be)

199
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,390
(many reporters.)

200
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,120
(I'd better be careful.)

201
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,600
Who is it?

202
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,800
Feng Jun.

203
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,360
You're back!

204
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,120
Are you surprised?

205
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,310
Have you missed me?

206
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,510
You're an adult.

207
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,120
Don't you know
how to say hello properly?

208
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,310
Aren't you the same?

209
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,360
You hit me as hard as before.

210
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,480
Why did you stop contacting me

211
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,510
after high school?

212
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,680
You stopped contacting me, OK?

213
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,720
Are you here to compete?

214
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,010
Uh-huh.

215
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,750
(Feng Jun)
Well Technology.

216
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,870
Are you doing so well?

217
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,870
A piece of cake.

218
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,560
I got the job with ease.

219
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,600
Don't show off.

220
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,560
How long will you stay in China?

221
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,680
I don't know yet.

222
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,310
But my company plans to
expand its business in China.

223
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,190
So I'll come back regularly.

224
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:59,510
What about you?

225
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,600
Why are you here?

226
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,680
Do you also work for an IT company?

227
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,070
Any problem?

228
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,600
You did poorly in math.

229
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,190
Are you sure?

230
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,950
When Albert Einstein

231
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,000
discovered the photoelectric effect,

232
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,870
he only scored one point in math.

233
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,510
He was in German.

234
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,630
They applied a six-mark system.

235
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,070
Don't read those impractical articles.

236
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,360
Hasn't your company closed down yet?

237
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,000
I want to introduce you

238
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,830
a brainbox.

239
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,680
Who?

240
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,680
Even better than me?

241
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,390
You'll know.

242
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:26,950
Where is he?

243
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,920
He was here just now.

244
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,030
Let me call him.

245
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,480
OK.

246
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,020
(Mr. Xu)

247
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,720
Xiang Yuan,

248
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,630
do I know the person

249
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,550
you mentioned?

250
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,600
Guess.

251
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,670
Feng Jun.

252
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,670
It's really you.

253
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,150
It's been a long time.

254
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,200
Long time no see.

255
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,360
How are you doing?

256
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,120
Good.

257
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,840
How long have you been back?

258
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,440
It's been a while.

259
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,910
On the one hand,

260
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,240
I'm back for the competition.

261
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,120
On the other hand,

262
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,960
my company plans to
expand its business in China.

263
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,550
I act solely in the early stage.

264
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,790
So I've been busy lately.

265
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
Good for you.

266
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,630
What about you?

267
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,480
Are you here to compete?

268
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,480
Not exactly.

269
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,960
I came with a friend.

270
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,000
Which company

271
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,670
do you work for?

272
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,200
Is it Xingheng?

273
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,240
Velin.

274
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,440
Velin?

275
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,120
I've never heard of it.

276
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,150
What do they do?

277
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,630
Do you know?

278
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,120
I'm in Velin, too.

279
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,550
Are you in the same company?

280
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,720
Good for you.

281
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,510
How's your brother doing recently?

282
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,790
I haven't seen him for a long time.

283
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,390
I'd like to have dinner with him.

284
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,480
I barely keep in touch with him.

285
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,870
Seriously?

286
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,790
Is Jiamian still

287
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,670
busy with his flight base?

288
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,960
Does he have a girlfriend?

289
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,390
Don't worry about him.

290
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,840
I have to go, if you may excuse me.

291
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,670
You haven't changed much.

292
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,150
I have to go, too.

293
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,360
Xiang Yuan,

294
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,720
give me your WeChat.

295
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,150
Let me scan you.

296
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,840
Gotta go.

297
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,670
Bye-bye.

298
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,120
Give me one.

299
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,360
I'm a

300
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,390
participant.

301
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:30,790
You want these all?

302
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,390
Participant.

303
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,270
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Do you want this?

304
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,000
No. Not that.

305
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,720
Give me this.

306
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,270
OK.

307
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,390
Thanks.

308
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,000
You're welcome.

309
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,270
Participant.

310
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,360
Wow.

311
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,550
I was wondering

312
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,720
how a computer repairer

313
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,120
could qualify for the final.

314
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,000
It turns out
you've called in reinforcements.

315
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,030
Why?

316
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,790
Have you come to Shanghai because

317
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,030
you couldn't survive out there?

318
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,120
Look at you guys.

319
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,030
Now,

320
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,320
Zhang Yi lives off a woman.

321
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,600
Gui is seriously ill.

322
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,870
I've become outstanding in Shanghai.

323
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,030
Are you and Xu Yanshi

324
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,390
still holed up in your shells

325
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,080
like two turtles?

326
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,150
Lu Junliang,

327
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,840
you've repeated

328
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,550
your cut-and-dried speech

329
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,510
again and again

330
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,320
over the years.

331
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,750
Aren't you bored?

332
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,360
Yeah, I'm only a computer repairer.

333
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,120
But after all these years,

334
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,150
I've never seen a display screen

335
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,600
with such a low resolution as you.

336
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,030
You wander around

337
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,320
all day long with a

338
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,240
QR code-like face.

339
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,440
If I were you,

340
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,910
I would sink through the floor

341
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,320
instead of appearing publicly.

342
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,080
You're shameless.

343
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:33,910
And also,

344
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,200
when we're here to compete,

345
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,720
you can only get this at most.

346
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,480
Bye-bye.

347
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,120
Guess who I met just now.

348
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,080
We also ran into

349
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,870
an old friend.

350
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,630
Let me say first.

351
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,910
I ran into

352
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:08,670
Lu Junliang.

353
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,670
Who is he?

354
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,120
One of our seniors at college.

355
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,120
He always got second place.

356
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,080
He used to cheat

357
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,440
and play tricks

358
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,360
in various competitions.

359
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,030
But as long as Xu was there,

360
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,910
he could never get first place.

361
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,480
He

362
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,720
is now

363
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,240
a notorious

364
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,120
hacker.

365
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,120
Why did he come?

366
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,200
I'm curious, too.

367
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,000
That's why I think the Xingheng Cup

368
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,200
will be screwed.

369
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,790
Anyone can come and compete.

370
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,960
It has almost become a
garbage collection station.

371
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,840
No wonder the big shots
in the circle

372
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,270
don't come anymore.

373
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,870
Do you know

374
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,080
what that guy called us?

375
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,510
He called us turtles.

376
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,600
How could I...

377
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,550
Well, who did you say

378
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,480
you had met?

379
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,150
Feng Jun.

380
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,550
Feng Jun?

381
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,910
Where is he?

382
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,440
What's wrong?

383
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,440
Why are you so surprised?

384
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,870
Weren't you alumni?

385
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,510
Don't you know him?

386
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,270
Yeah, I know him too well.

387
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,080
Back then, I...

388
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,720
Wait in line.

389
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,510
What happened back then?

390
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,480
Never mind.

391
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,790
We used to hang out together

392
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,030
and Xu had to save his ass often.

393
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,440
(Well,)

394
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,000
(another thing they wouldn't tell me.)

395
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,020
(Xiang Yuan)

396
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,120
(When have these two)

397
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,150
(hooked up?)

398
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,840
Hello.

399
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,550
The team tied for first place with us

400
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,480
in the preliminary is called

401
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,030
"This Is A Serious Technology Company."

402
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,120
The leader is Wang Qingyi.

403
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,320
Qing?

404
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,120
Go on.

405
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,510
It's weird.

406
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,440
This man isn't

407
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,630
working for any company.

408
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,120
He runs a computer repair shop.

409
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,320
OK. I get it.

410
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,000
(Xingheng Cup Beidou+Competition)
The final will begin.

411
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,030
Everyone,

412
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,840
please pick up your racing vehicle

413
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,120
and get ready.

414
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,390
The auto drive competition

415
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,600
has a distance of six kilometers.

416
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,390
It requires speed

417
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,550
as well as accuracy.

418
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,080
Players must avoid obstacles
in the race.

419
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,670
And the distribution order

420
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,960
of all venues is confidential.

421
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,270
It is like a close-book exam,

422
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,750
which will be a big test

423
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,720
of our algorithm.

424
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,790
We've simulated it many times.

425
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,150
We'll be fine.

426
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,080
We must drive accurately and steadily.

427
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,860
(Data Loading)

428
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,460
(Loaded)

429
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,000
Awesome, Xu!

430
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,480
I've never seen any other person

431
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,550
more impressive than you.

432
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:15,720
You...

433
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,120
You're the most impressive.

434
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,120
You know what?

435
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,630
It took me

436
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,120
all my luck

437
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,000
to meet such a big shot.

438
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Of course he's impressive.

439
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,240
Let me see

440
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,960
which page you are

441
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,080
on a fairy tale book?

442
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,750
You're good.

443
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,440
Speaking of that,

444
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,000
I think it's a shame that

445
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,840
there are only five awards
for Nobel Prize.

446
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,790
I told you if there was a Nobel Prize

447
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,150
for Computer Science,

448
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,440
he must be a candidate.

449
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,150
No.

450
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,480
There should be
a Nobel Prize for Flattering.

451
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,510
You're so good at it.

452
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,440
Nobel should award you a prize himself.

453
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,790
Ungrateful man.

454
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Take it yourself.

455
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,880
To further stimulate the passion

456
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,550
for innovation and entrepreneurship,

457
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,750
create a new force,

458
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,400
utilize the role of
Beidou Navigation Application

459
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,240
as an engine,

460
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,750
and build a new highland for

461
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,750
innovative application of Beidou,

462
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,550
the final of the third Beidou+

463
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,640
Innovation and Entrepreneurship
Competition

464
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,270
is kicking off today.

465
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,960
- Good.
- Good! Good!

466
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,060
(This Is A Serious Technology Company)

467
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,550
(The Third Beidou+Competition)
Eight teams representing well-known

468
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,790
domestic and foreign enterprises

469
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,640
will give us a show

470
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,960
of speed and passion.

471
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
Everyone, are you ready?

472
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,030
Yes.

473
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,270
(Current Vehicle No.1)
The No.1 vehicle from Maosheng Technology

474
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,960
is slowly moving to

475
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,270
the starting line.

476
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:04,920
Three,

477
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:05,720
two,

478
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,480
one.

479
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,240
(Unmanned Vehicle System)
They're off.

480
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:08,920
We've set up

481
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,510
eight levels for the track,

482
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,750
including a U-turn,

483
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,830
traffic light recognition,

484
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,270
a bicycle barricade,

485
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,440
a fork, return positioning, etc.,

486
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,160
to comprehensively examine

487
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,720
the autonomous vehicle
from multiple aspects,

488
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,000
including the obstacle recognition
sensitivity,

489
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,550
the accuracy of
the driving trajectory control,

490
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,480
and the comfort of

491
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,200
the driving experience.

492
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,880
The first level, the U-turn,

493
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,880
is approaching.

494
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:28,510
Can they smoothly

495
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,590
pass it

496
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,750
and take the top spot?

497
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,400
They pressed the line

498
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,960
and turned the corner too fast.

499
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,960
As we know,

500
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,070
the ride comfort

501
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,240
from smooth driving

502
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,880
is an important indicator

503
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,000
for the final score.

504
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,000
What a shame!

505
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,590
The No.2 vehicle is from
Baitai Technology,

506
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,310
which is one of

507
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,310
our old friends.

508
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,790
Last time they finished

509
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,240
(Current Vehicle No.2)
seventh in the final.

510
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,510
Can they wipe out
the disgrace this time?

511
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,750
They've come to

512
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,550
the U-turn quickly.

513
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,680
Smooth driving and turning.

514
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,750
Its tires have drifted.

515
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,400
Once it presses the line,

516
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,400
- it will probably
- I told you.

517
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,160
end up like the No.1 vehicle.

518
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:12,960
Good.

519
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,310
No.2 has passed the level.

520
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,160
The next is a red light

521
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,070
to test the accurate recognition

522
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:17,750
of the signal light

523
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,830
by the auto drive system.

524
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,400
Wait!

525
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,880
Why doesn't No.2

526
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,920
show any signs of stopping?

527
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,680
How come?

528
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,720
If it keeps moving,

529
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,030
it may knock down a pedestrian.

530
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:28,960
Once it hits a pedestrian,

531
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,110
regardless of its performance,

532
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,160
it will be out

533
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,590
from the competition.

534
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,920
The pedestrian is slowly

535
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,000
moving to the middle of the road.

536
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,070
What a pity!

537
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,310
No.2 is out.

538
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,240
Seriously?

539
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,240
Don't panic.

540
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,110
We've simulated

541
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,510
all the problems they have.

542
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,160
We are definitely better than them.

543
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,880
But this level is indeed difficult.

544
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,310
The position of the dummy was tricky.

545
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,310
I think most of the players

546
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,160
can't pass it.

547
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,480
I wonder

548
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,510
what difficulties lie ahead.

549
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,160
You're being melodramatic.

550
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:01,960
Yeah.

551
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,000
I have confidence

552
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,680
in Xu's program.

553
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,240
This is mine.

554
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,880
I'll get you another one.

555
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,510
Next is the No.3 vehicle

556
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,920
from Well Technology.

557
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,580
(UVS Positioning Deviation
Duration Map Speed)

558
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,240
This is an international team

559
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,200
with top talents from China and abroad.

560
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,480
They've caught everyone's attention

561
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,030
at the beginning of the competition.

562
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,590
Now they're off.

563
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,260
(UVS Positioning Deviation
Duration Map Speed)

564
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,480
They made it.

565
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,480
Well done.

566
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,030
They avoided

567
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,000
the simulated pedestrian

568
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,790
crossing the zebra crossing

569
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,030
without hesitation.

570
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,140
(Current Vehicle No.3)

571
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,400
While traveling smoothly,

572
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,310
the speed of No.3

573
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,030
is the fastest so far.

574
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,680
They turned the wheel

575
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,720
a little sharply.

576
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,750
But still, they passed it.

577
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,270
Well done!

578
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,200
They deserve their reputation.

579
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,510
You know, the barrier we've set

580
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,200
is a stationary bicycle,

581
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,110
which equates to a

582
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,270
non-motor vehicle barrier.

583
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,680
It's a great challenge

584
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,680
for sensor recognition.

585
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,400
The auto drive system...

586
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,240
Big deal.

587
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,030
Is prone to

588
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:41,960
misjudging a stationary

589
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,790
non-motor vehicle.

590
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,240
They are fast...

591
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,200
But they didn't make any misjudgment.

592
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,880
And accurate.

593
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,510
And they've passed most of the barriers.

594
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,440
Well, dude,

595
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,750
why do you

596
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,030
take their side?

597
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,550
But they are not sensitive enough

598
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,920
to detect a non-motor vehicle.

599
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,270
They nearly hit the bike

600
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,240
just now.

601
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,270
They'll probably go wrong

602
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,310
if there are more

603
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,160
similar road conditions.

604
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,750
I hope so.

605
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,510

first vehicle to enter

the difficult track today.

608
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,030
Could it avoid

609
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,590
the stationary tricycle

610
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,350
with goods on it

611
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,590
and turn right smoothly?

612
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,480
What a shame!

613
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,750
It scraped the goods.

614
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:23,880
But it doesn't matter.

615
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,450
- You predicted it precisely.
- This is the only mistake

616
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,830
they've made so far.

617
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200

618
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,310
unaffected and is heading firmly

619
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,240
towards the finish line.

620
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,440
So far, it has only taken them

seven minutes and 15 seconds.

622
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,000
There's only one level left,

623
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,310
the fork in the road.

624
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,790
After going through this fork,

625
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,310
they'll become the first team

626
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,260

and ranked first for now.

like it's soaring.

645
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,350
It seems that

646
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,640
none of them should be underestimated.

It slowed down at the fork.

If it makes a wrong judgment,

650
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,310
it won't be able to
return to the starting line.

There are only three teams left.

Not necessarily.

- It doesn't matter.
- but it turned a little fast.

If you're sitting in it,

678
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,790
you must grip the handle tightly.

00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,310
of the bicycle in advance.

767
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:21,550
What follows is the avoidance

768
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,790
of a stationary roadblock.

769
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,640
Perfect!

770
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,070
No.7 passed smoothly as expected.

771
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,310
It has easily avoided

772
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,640
the spot where No.3

773
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,550
had scraped.

774
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,550
(My requirement for you)

775
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,440
(isn't just to win first place.)

776
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,310
(I care more)

777
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,790
(about how much you distance yourself)

778
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,110
(from the runner-up.)

779
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,070
If the vehicle

780
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:43,830
dodges when approaching

781
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:44,960
the non-motor vehicle,

782
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,790
it can't keep steady.

783
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,070
It is prone to accidents

784
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,750
and comfort compromise.

785
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,240
In that case,
it'll have its points deducted.

786
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,750
But in terms of

787
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,880
its two dodges,

788
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,240
No.7 predicted in advance,

789
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,000
changed its driving trajectory,

790
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,750
and maintained its stability,

791
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,200
further improving its speed,

792
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,720
preciseness, and accuracy.

793
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,270
The company deserves the name of

794
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,640
"A Serious Technology Company."

795
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,750
Now is the most difficult track

796
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,110
with a fork in the road.

797
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,830
The team of Soaring

798
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,400
made a mistake here

799
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,240
and missed the championship.

800
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,240
(Current Vehicle No.7)

801
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,920
- Could No.7 pass
- After this level,

802
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,350
- this final test
- we can nail it.

803
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,350
and compete with

804
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,640
Well Technology and Soaring?

805
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,680
This is

806
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,790
a really exciting time.

807
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:36,820
(Current Vehicle No.7)

808
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,590
What happened?

809
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,350
Why did the well-performed No.7

810
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,680
(Speed: 33km/h)
suddenly slow down?

811
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,550
What's going on?

812
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,590
What's wrong?

813
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,110
There is a problem with the signal.

814
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,750
If so,

815
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,200
will the navigation system be affected?

816
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,750
How would it pass

817
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,070
the fork ahead?

818
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,000
This is the fork track

819
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,720
with rigorous requirements

820
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,070
for the system.

821
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,000
Without a high-precision map

822
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,640
downloaded in advance,

823
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,960
the vehicle relies solely on
the Beidou system

824
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,240
(Unmanned Vehicle Systems)
for positioning and planning.

825
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,960
Its judgment on the fork ahead

826
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,480
will directly affect the results.

827
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,270
If it goes the wrong way,

828
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,720
it will get a zero.

829
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,270
Could No.7 pass

830
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,000
in such a state?

831
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,030
No, no, no.

832
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,830
It only has to pass the final level.

833
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,270
How did this happen?

834
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,140
(Current Vehicle No.7)

835
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,940
(Unmanned Vehicle Systems)

836
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,780
(Inertial System)

837
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,480
No.7 seems to

838
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,440
have changed.

839
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,240
Is the signal recovered?

840
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,960
Because we have Plan B.

841
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,640
What is Plan B?

842
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,070
We recompose and relocate

843
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,310
(Inertial System)
based on synchronous

844
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,720
positioning and mapping techniques.

845
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,720
When the navigation signal weakens,

846
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,960
the car automatically switches to
inertial navigation

847
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,000
to keep moving.

848
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,000
But with its speed

849
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,750
and accuracy decreasing,

850
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,510
it can do no more than finish the race.

851
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,440
It's about to turn the corner.

852
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,960
After what has happened,

853
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,240
could No.7 still make it?

854
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,270
This is a real technology company,

855
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,350
and also the only

856
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,720
rookie team to

857
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,680
advance to the final.

in the previous tracks,

860
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,110
overtaking the large company, Soaring,

861
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,240
and rivaling the top foreign company,

862
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,240

871
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,510
it passed the fork

00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:18,720
But how could

930
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,720
anyone might have used

used a jammer...

In that case,

948
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,510
it must be him.

949

00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,270
They even call you

958
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,880
the most handsome programmer.

959
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:37,760
Oh.

960
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,240
Why are you so calm?

961
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,750
This is a big deal.

962
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,830
Durian Witch will definitely

963
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,000
make an issue of it.

964
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,240
She may make an issue of it,

965
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,750
but she won't be an issue.

966
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,920
Do you still

967
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,920
have the mood to joke?

968
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:50,790
Or what?

969
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,310
Boss, I'm telling you...

970
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,350
All right. I have to go.

971
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,880
Hello. Boss. Hello.

972
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,310
Did he hang up?

973
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,510
Yeah.

974
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,310
What did he say?

975
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,350
He said nothing.

976
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,230
Xu is too kindhearted,

977
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,630
otherwise, Feng Jun wouldn't be

978
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,710
where he is today.

979
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,670
So, what happened between them?

980
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,500
(Offer from Xingheng
Technology Co., Ltd.)

981
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,440
Good.

982
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,190
You are the only

983
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,190
undergraduate student

984
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,190
who has got an offer
from Xingheng in these years.

985
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,360
Xingheng is leading in

986
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:32,360
the national positioning system

987
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,280
industry.

988
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,880
You must cherish

989
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,670
this hard-earned opportunity.

990
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,000
I still remember

991
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,550
when I gave you the first lesson,

992
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,550
I asked about your ideals.

993
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,360
You were the first to stand up

994
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,550
and told me that
you would contribute to

995
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,550
China's navigation industry.

996
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,760
Now,

997
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,510
you can start

998
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,590
realizing your ideals.

999
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,880
Sir, if it weren't for you,

1000
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,550
I wouldn't have had

1001
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,840
such a starting point.

1002
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,630
But you must remember,

1003
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,960
from now on,

1004
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,880
you not only

1005
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,400
have an extra honor

1006
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,480
but also shoulder

1007
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,840
responsibility to China's

1008
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,670
navigation industry.

1009
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:18,850
Yeah.

1010
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,280
I get it.

1011
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,580
(Notice on Clearing Nepotism from the Group)

1012
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,880
Did you make it?

1013
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:44,800
Sure.

1014
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,880
Who do you think I am?

1015
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,710
Enough. Enough.

1016
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:48,920
I was

1017
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,590
only two seconds behind you.

1018
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,880
What about you, Qing?

1019
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,550
I'm far behind you.

1020
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,360
I just logged in.

1021
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,440
I'm telling you,

1022
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,800
you made it because

1023
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,550
you used Xu's computer

1024
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,440
and shared his strength.

1025
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,070
Why don't you use your own computer

1026
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,000
and compete with me again?

1027
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,070
My computer is running a program, OK?

1028
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,070
Anyway, the computer

1029
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:06,880
doesn't make any difference.

1030
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,840
Stop acting shamelessly.

1031
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,150
Drink. Drink.

1032
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:09,670
Drink.

1033
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,320
Fine!

1034
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,400
I'll admit defeat.

1035
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,320
Come on.

Xu Yanshi, Wang Qingyi and Gao Sibo.

1039
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,960
You illegally hacked into

1040
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,000
the system of our company,

1041
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,510
causing its breakdown.

1042
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:15,360
We've suffered a significant loss.

00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,880
This is our indictment,

1044
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,670

(In total: RMB 10 million)

1048
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:44,360
Feng Jun,

1049
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,960
say something.

1050
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,070
Say what?

1051
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,630
Why don't you say?

1052
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,480
Are you kidding me?

1053
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,480
Why didn't you

1054
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,150
say anything just now?

1055
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,190
Let me ask you. Get up.

1056
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,320
Does it have anything to do with Xu?

1057
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,920
You hacked into their system

1058
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,630
with Xu's computer.

1059
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,880
Did I do it alone?

1060
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,550
Didn't you hack into it?

1061
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,510
We were probably possessed that day.

1062
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,070
How can we pay

1063
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,360
such a huge sum of money?

1064
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,110
Yeah.

1065
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,030
We're about to graduate.

1066
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,440
My family wants me

1067
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,440
to hunt for a good job.

1068
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,440
Now it's terrible.

1069
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,030
I'm finished.

1070
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,880
Great!

1071
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,960
Calm down, all of you.

1072
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,400
It has already happened.

1073
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,440
We should think about

1074
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,400
how to solve it.

1075
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,320
These are cases of compensation
for cyber intrusion

1076
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,920
I collected online

1077
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,800
and the compensation amount

1078
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,110
I consulted with my lawyer.

1079
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,030
(Cases of Compensation for Cyber Intrusion)
Many of the claims

1080
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:39,590
in your indictment are beyond

1081
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,630
our compensation scope.

1082
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,670
The amount we have to pay

1083
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,070
is two million yuan.

1084
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,760
I'm sorry about this.

1085
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,360
But everyone should be responsible

1086
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,360
for the mistakes they've made.

1087
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,070
If we appeal,

1088
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:58,400
it would be difficult for you

1089
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,150
to establish yourselves in the industry
in the future.

1090
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,550
You should understand.

1091
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,110
I got it.

1092
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,710
To compensate for the loss

1093
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,000
we have caused,

1094
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,670
we can upgrade

1095
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,960
the security system

1096
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,000
of your company.

1097
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:13,800
OK.

1098
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,760
As long as the upgraded system

1099
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,840
can meet our

1100
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,880
latest requirements,

1101
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,110
we'll accept two million yuan.

1102
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,960
Actually,

1103
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,590
I can offer you

1104
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,670
a better choice.

1105
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,320
If you agree to

1106
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,800
work in Velin,

1107
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:33,070
we'll give up suing you.

1108
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,190
You don't have to

1109
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,440
compensate for us.

1110
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,070
I won't go.

1111
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,510
Professor Liang told me that

1112
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,760
you were the only
undergraduate this year

1113
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,320
who had received

1114
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,400
the offer from Xingheng.

1115
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,880
But you should know,

1116
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,800
Xingheng wouldn't accept you

1117
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,280
if you couldn't solve this.

1118
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,550
I'll definitely solve it.

1119
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,360
OK.

1120
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,670
Since you're so confident,

1121
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,630
I'll give you two weeks.

1122
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,230
How did it go?

1123
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,030
I made a deal with Chen Shan.

1124
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,670
Within two weeks,

1125
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,400
we have to upgrade

1126
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,550
the security system of
Velin Technology

1127
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,150
and raise

1128
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,280
two million yuan in compensation.

1129
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,710
I'll raise the money.

1130
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,760
Two million.

1131
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:29,880
No problem.

1132
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Well,

1133
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,880
we don't have

1134
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,320
so much money now.

1135
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,190
Could you please pay for us?

1136
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,880
We'll pay you back
when we get the money.

1137
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,320
Thanks, bro.

1138
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:42,400
No problem.

1139
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,480
We'll be responsible

1140
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,030
for the system upgrade.

1141
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:47,960
Let's begin.

1142
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,440
I've finished it.

1143
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:15,440
What about you?

1144
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:16,960
I've finished it, too.

1145
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,590
Done.

1146
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,000
Great.

1147
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,800
We have two days left.

1148
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,920
There's still time.

1149
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:29,630
I wonder if Feng Jun

1150
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,440
has raised the money.

1151
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,320
(Sorry, the subscriber you dialed)

1152
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,550
(is busy now.)

1153
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,440
(Please redial...)

1154
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,030
- Hello.
- Hello.

1155
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,760
May I speak to Feng Jun?

1156
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,630
Feng Jun has gone abroad.

1157
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,840
Abroad?

1158
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,190
Could you tell me...

1159
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:05,960
I'm telling you,

1160
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,400
this has nothing to do

1161
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,590
with Feng Jun.

1162
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,550
Don't harass my son again.

1163
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,110
Hello. Hello.

1164
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,070
What should we do?

1165
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,510
Let's raise the money separately.

1166
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,710
How much do you need?

1167
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,400
Tell me. Don't waste time.

1168
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,840
I need

1169
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:50,920
1.5 million.

1170
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:58,230
I'll

1171
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,920
see what I can do.

1172
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,760
As for Xingheng,

1173
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,960
I'll communicate with them.

1174
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,880
Thank you, sir.

1175
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:18,760
Xu,

1176
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,800
don't worry.

1177
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,110
We'll give the money

1178
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:22,030
to Chen Shan

1179
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:23,280
and finish this thing.

1180
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,110
Gui and I will find a way

1181
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:26,670
to pay back the money
Professor Liang lent us.

1182
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,920
When I start to work in Xingheng,

1183
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,920
I'll help you to pay back the money.

1184
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:31,590
OK.

1185
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:33,150
We have to

1186
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,190
count on you.

1187
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:35,400
You guys,

1188
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,280
you look upset
even though you're smiling.

1189
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,440
Cheer up.

1190
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,550
We still have a bright future.

1191
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,880
We should celebrate.

1192
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:41,800
Let's drink.

1193
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:43,880
I'll get some beer.

1194
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,320
OK.

1195
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,660
(Dad Calling)

1196
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:52,440
Dad.

1197
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,440
Yanshi,

1198
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:54,800
I've got a very good

1199
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,150
opportunity recently.

1200
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,840
Lend Dad

1201
00:43:58,230 --> 00:43:59,030
your money

1202
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:00,110
for emergency use.

1203
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,110
When I make money,

1204
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:03,670
I'll make it up to you.

1205
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:16,880
Well, Xu,

1206
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,360
is your dad out of his mind?

1207
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,550
Does he know what impact

1208
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:22,440
this will have on you?

1209
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,840
It will affect your future.

1210
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,230
Enough.

1211
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:24,880
You're not

1212
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,760
helping.

1213
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,320
Listen to me.

1214
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,670
Let's reason with him.

1215
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:29,760
Or we can call the police.

1216
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,230
What do you say?

1217
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:31,670
We can't call the police.
That's his dad!

1218
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:32,510
I don't care.

1219
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:33,710
It's two million!

1220
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:35,920
Are you going to let the police

1221
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,880
catch his dad for the two million?

1222
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:37,710
What else can I do?

1223
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:38,710
You tell me!

1224
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,070
Do what?

1225
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:40,030
It only makes him more upset

1226
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:41,280
if you keep yelling.

1227
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,000
(Offer from Xingheng)
Why do you always argue with me?

1228
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Let's sit down and think it over, OK?

1229
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,000
(Several days later,)

1230
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,110
(when we received Chen Shan's notice)

1231
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:49,150
(to withdraw the lawsuit,)

1232
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:50,800
(Xu had already)

1233
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,480
(joined Velin.)

1234
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:55,510
Did Xu Yanshi give up

1235
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:57,110
his life and career just like that?

1236
00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:59,190
Feng Jun has returned from abroad

1237
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,480
and started over again.

1238
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:01,960
Gui has a successful career

1239
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,630
and love life in Shanghai.

1240
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,400
It seems that the incident

1241
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,510
hasn't changed

1242
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:07,510
anyone's life trajectory

1243
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,190
except Xu...

1244
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:27,670
You go first.

1245
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:32,920
Are you waiting for me?

1246
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:34,710
Let's have a word.
