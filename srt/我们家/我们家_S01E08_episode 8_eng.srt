1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,033
   

2
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:14,290



3
00:00:20,967 --> 00:00:25,567
 Unfortunately, you have lost your baby. 

4
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:28,633
 But Madam, the problem is that 

5
00:00:28,633 --> 00:00:31,200
 I think you'll have difficulty getting pregnant in the future. 

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,233
 Due to decreased ovarian function. 

7
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:38,133
 The normal AMH level is usually 2 to 5, 

8
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:40,933
 but your level is so low 

9
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:43,967
 that you are almost at menopause. 

10
00:00:43,967 --> 00:00:46,900
 If that happens, it'll be difficult to do in vitro fertilization. 

11
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,433
 Yes, all right. 

12
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:52,533
 Thank you. 

13
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,500
 I'll leave. 

14
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,100
 Get some rest. 

15
00:01:32,033 --> 00:01:34,233
 Sorry. 

16
00:02:05,967 --> 00:02:07,967
 Oh my. 

17
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,800
 Hey. 

18
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:22,133
 Who are you? 

19
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:43,767
 He is Prosecutor Choi's child, please take care of him. 

20
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:46,600
 Young Ja, a student. 

21
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:25,333
Jae Jin,

22
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:28,567
I'm okay as long as you don't know.

23
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:36,200
   

24
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,010
   

25
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,070
   

26
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:00,367
Did you really kill her?

27
00:04:00,367 --> 00:04:03,333
What are you talking about?

28
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,333
Are you saying I killed my sister?

29
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:12,200
How do you feel if someone knew your secret?

30
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,910
No.

31
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:17,500
You're doing this without knowing anything.

32
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,767
Yeah?

33
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:22,720
Then why are you so eager to call me?

34
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:28,100
You particularly liked your sister.

35
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:34,533
 I think that's what caused your abnormal obsession with love. 

36
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:36,800
Abnormal?

37
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:39,367
What do you think you know?

38
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:43,667
Your parents, your sister, three husbands,

39
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:47,200
could it really have been a coincidence?

40
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,200
Why do all your family members die like that?

41
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,833
That's not it.

42
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:03,567
Well, take a look at what your family is like.

43
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:07,767
You told me that family doesn't need to know each other's secrets. Right?

44
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:10,467
Is that really so?

45
00:05:10,467 --> 00:05:14,100
You are disappointed and unable to forgive each other,

46
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,667
but you live your lives hiding it all.

47
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:17,667
Oh.

48
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:19,933
Your goal was to destroy me

49
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:23,933
by revealing my family's secrets. Right?

50
00:05:25,233 --> 00:05:26,967
 But what should I do? 

51
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:30,433
 I have no intention of doing that. 

52
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:36,100
I guess that's because you don't know everything yet.

53
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,900
The game becomes more fun from now on.

54
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,533
Your way is wrong.

55
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:47,200
Yeah? Well then, keep an eye out for what happens next.

56
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,667
Dr. Noh? What's going on?

57
00:06:32,967 --> 00:06:35,433
I'm sure you were very surprised by what happened yesterday.

58
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:38,140
I admit it completely.

59
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,500
I knew it, too.

60
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,367
The evidence is solid, so what need is there to admit it?

61
00:06:43,367 --> 00:06:45,267
But...

62
00:06:45,267 --> 00:06:50,267
it wouldn't have changed anything even if I knew.

63
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:53,167
You wanted to be part of our family, too.

64
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:54,567
Of course,

65
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:58,367
I also wanted to have you as part of my family.

66
00:06:58,367 --> 00:07:03,033
So, we chose each other.

67
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:06,700
What makes me mad is your plan...

68
00:07:07,367 --> 00:07:09,300
to have me live in the same house

69
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,200
with the people who killed my father.

70
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,220
How could you have done that?

71
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,920
I could have done that.

72
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:22,533
I did it for my family.

73
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:27,000
I can do anything, even more, for my family.

74
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,900
You too are a mother raising a child, so you will understand my feelings.

75
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:41,167
This is all because of that Lee Se Na's cheeky thing.

76
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,367
Do you know what this is?

77
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:55,667
A camera?

78
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:59,467
With this camera, Lee Se Na was watching the whole house.

79
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,667
If this is installed, does that mean

80
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:08,133
there is an assistant to Lee Se Na in this house?

81
00:08:08,133 --> 00:08:10,433
Lord.

82
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:14,667
We have to solve this together first.

83
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,600
You figure it out.

84
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,500
Because you made the entire family like this.

85
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:32,567
Is she ordering me?

86
00:08:32,567 --> 00:08:36,833
I guess she thinks I can do whatever she asks.

87
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:40,300
I'm doing this of my own will.

88
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,133
Sit down for a moment.

89
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,867
A hidden camera was found in the house.

90
00:09:03,867 --> 00:09:06,133
Where?

91
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:09,533
Who would have done this?

92
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:14,033
You're not doubting us. Right?

93
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:16,133
Madam, I feel bad if you doubt us.

94
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:19,933
No, I'm saying this because I don't doubt you.

95
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:24,467
Since the security device didn't go off, it seemed like there was no intruder,

96
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:30,000
so I asked if there was anything suspicious.

97
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:33,767
Not many guests came to this house.

98
00:09:33,767 --> 00:09:36,767
The only person...

99
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,067
who visited recently was Dr. Oh…

100
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:40,567
Oh Ji Eun…

101
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:43,400
Dr. Oh is like family to you, no way.

102
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,333
Among outsiders, the one who has free entry and exit

103
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,833
is actually Mr. Moon.

104
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,900
Actually, I didn't want to say this.

105
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,200
He acts like a house owner when you're not home.

106
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,100
- Tae Oh? 
 - Yes.

107
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,967
Oh, and again… Oh, right.

108
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:05,200
Mr. Ahn, you said someone put something strange in that mailbox?

109
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,800
What is something strange?

110
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,900
Yes, a book was delivered to Dr. Noh.

111
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,533
Oh, that book? "The Mousetrap Has Disappeared."

112
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:16,100
I already know about that.

113
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,600
I'll pay more attention to security from now on.

114
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,133
Madam, have you reported it to the police?

115
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:25,100
But exactly where was the hidden camera found?

116
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,367
Oh, it's not a place like the bathroom. Right?

117
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:31,200
I worked really hard to clean every nook and cranny of the bathroom.

118
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
I have never seen a hidden camera.

119
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,033
I'm sorry, I should have tried harder. I should have looked more closely.

120
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:38,367
Please be quiet.

121
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,033
 Snow has begun to accumulate starting from the metropolitan area. 

122
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:55,433
 If you are out late at night, you need to be careful when moving. 

123
00:10:55,433 --> 00:10:59,167
 This snow is expected to expand to more areas west overnight. 

124
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:03,433
 Up to 10 cm of snow is expected to fall on Ulleungdo and Dokdo until tomorrow. 

125
00:11:03,433 --> 00:11:07,533
 Snow cover of 1 to as much as 5 cm is expected in the metropolitan area 

126
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:11,467
 and other central and western regions, and around 1 cm in parts of the Honam region. 

127
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:13,000
 The temperature also plummeted, so… 

128
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,900
Oh? Ji Eun.

129
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,710
Jae Jin.

130
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,933
What are you doing here?

131
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:30,800
Did you run away from home?

132
00:11:31,467 --> 00:11:34,367
Then you should have contacted me right away.

133
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:39,160
Ji Eun, Se Na is gone.

134
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:42,733
Haven't you two broken up?

135
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,067
We decided to meet again.

136
00:11:46,067 --> 00:11:47,400
But I can't get in touch with her.

137
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,967
Jae Jin, come to your senses.

138
00:11:49,967 --> 00:11:51,400
I think that woman is strange.

139
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,933
She hit me with a shovel right after she saw me.

140
00:11:53,933 --> 00:11:57,033
That's because you tried to hurt Se Na first.

141
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:59,133
You don't trust me now?

142
00:11:59,133 --> 00:12:01,033
Why would I lie?

143
00:12:01,033 --> 00:12:02,533
Se Na isn't that kind of person.

144
00:12:02,533 --> 00:12:05,500
What do you mean she's not that kind of person?

145
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:09,500
Ji Eun, why are you doing this?

146
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,600
I'm really having a hard time.

147
00:12:23,267 --> 00:12:28,533
You got scolded a lot by Mrs. Hong and Dr. Noh. Right?

148
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,267
By the way, you're saying that you can't get in touch with Lee Se Na. Right?

149
00:12:38,867 --> 00:12:41,467
I'll find out.

150
00:12:41,467 --> 00:12:44,500
Jae Jin, look at me.

151
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,767
It's okay.

152
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,900
Oh my.

153
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,850
Take care of your health first.

154
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:58,033
Did you eat something?

155
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,933
I can't stay still.

156
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:05,167
I'll get you something to eat. Okay?

157
00:13:11,067 --> 00:13:13,500
 When your father passed away, 

158
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,867
 he was falsely accused. Right? 

159
00:13:15,867 --> 00:13:19,233
 My father was involved in that. 

160
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:38,590
   

161
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:43,033
Mom, where? Where?

162
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:45,033
- Just go one more space. 
 - Here?

163
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,800
- Here? 
 - No, just one space.

164
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,800
- Here, here? 
 - That's right.

165
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,267
Oh, here!

166
00:13:49,267 --> 00:13:51,167
Take out the needle.

167
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:53,533
Oh, okay.

168
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,533
Doctor.

169
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,067
If you were coming, you should have called me.

170
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:04,000
It was when I had already left.

171
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,067
I also missed my mom.

172
00:14:06,067 --> 00:14:08,833
Doctor.

173
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:14,200
He looks very sick. Right?

174
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,933
So, I was teaching him cross-stitch.

175
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:20,667
Yes, you did well.

176
00:14:20,667 --> 00:14:22,733
What? It's the same thing that Mom doesn't recognize us,

177
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:25,967
but why are you a doctor and I'm a patient?

178
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:29,033
Mom,

179
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:30,900
I'm not feeling well.

180
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,500
What should I do?

181
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,833
Why does she think I'm sick?

182
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:01,167
You don't understand how it is possible for me

183
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:05,800
to continue living with people like that. Right?

184
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:12,333
I have hated that family for a long time.

185
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,033
Do you know why?

186
00:15:14,033 --> 00:15:15,933
When I had my high school graduation ceremony, college entrance ceremony,

187
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:17,833
and even enlisted in the military,

188
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,100
my mom was in the hospital and you couldn't come because you got married.

189
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,000
But in this situation, you're going to protect that family?

190
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,700
Don't you feel sorry for Dad?

191
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,367
Do you know why your sister did that?

192
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:38,400
Do you know why your sister got married and went into that house

193
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,900
when she was so young?

194
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,800
It's because of the money.

195
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,067
Don't you know that your sister did that to protect us,

196
00:15:47,067 --> 00:15:50,733
both for Mom's hospital bills and for your tuition?

197
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:56,133
Do you know what your sister said back then?

198
00:15:56,833 --> 00:16:02,300
She said that was the best choice she could make.

199
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:07,433
Whenever I think about your sister,

200
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:11,233
my heart hurts like it is being cut with a knife.

201
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:17,033
When I think about how that little kid tried to

202
00:16:17,033 --> 00:16:20,233
get into that family's good graces, I…

203
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:26,733
How could you yell at such a sister?

204
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:30,567
Quickly say sorry to your sister, quickly.

205
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:35,933
Sorry, Young Won.

206
00:16:36,967 --> 00:16:39,033
But, Mom,

207
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:41,433
are you coming to your senses for a moment?

208
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:46,900
Mom.

209
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:57,167
Why are you hugging me?

210
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:04,100
Doctor, he's crying.

211
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,600
See?

212
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,067
I told you he's very sick.

213
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:22,800
Let me be honest.

214
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,367
I was confident that if there was a problem in the marriage,

215
00:17:26,367 --> 00:17:29,000
I could get divorced

216
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,780
and move out of that house at any time.

217
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:37,100
Because I didn't understand why people endured life

218
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,533
without being able to divorce because of their children.

219
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:45,067
But when it actually became my problem,

220
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:47,400
it wasn't easy.

221
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,433
Is it because of Do Hyun?

222
00:17:50,433 --> 00:17:52,500
Don't you know me?

223
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,450
Nevertheless, if I want to do it, I'll do it.

224
00:17:56,233 --> 00:17:59,333
But not right now.

225
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,100
Another problem arose.

226
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,490
Is there something wrong with that family again?

227
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,950
Actually,

228
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:12,267
Lee Se Na is threatening our family.

229
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:13,733
Lee Se Na?

230
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:17,400
If it's Lee Se Na, is that the woman that Jae Jin had an affair with?

231
00:18:18,267 --> 00:18:20,567
But wasn't it over when Brother came back?

232
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,567
It's not over.

233
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:25,567
It was all planned by Lee Se Na.

234
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:28,733
Destroying my family one by one.

235
00:18:29,267 --> 00:18:34,300
Well… Then Lee Se Na also killed Prosecutor Choi?

236
00:18:34,967 --> 00:18:36,767
I don't know about that.

237
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:39,867
Oh boy, it's really…

238
00:18:39,867 --> 00:18:43,933
But why is Lee Se Na trying to hurt you?

239
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:48,630
So I need to find that out.

240
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,567
And then

241
00:18:51,567 --> 00:18:55,367
Lee Se Na will have to pay for her mistake.

242
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:59,533
Why is my sister's life so hard?

243
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,933
Is there anything I can help you with?

244
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:07,200
You think there's an insider

245
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,000
helping Lee Se Na. Right?

246
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,567
Yes.

247
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:13,600
The culprit is definitely nearby.

248
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:19,733
Someone put something in my mailbox about 5 days ago.

249
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:22,267
Please look for it around that time.

250
00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:27,430
If it's in front of your house, the local police station will be in charge.

251
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:32,333
Koo Kyung Tae, who became a police officer after 15 years.

252
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:36,633
Does he still know you as Oh Ji Eun's uncle?

253
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:40,367
Yes, I'll look into that, too.

254
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:44,100
Lee Se Na set fire to the house?

255
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,233
I guess I'll have to go and find out more.

256
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:50,233
 Gas filling is complete. 

257
00:19:50,867 --> 00:19:53,533
Now, it's done.

258
00:20:14,433 --> 00:20:15,733
Is it still far?

259
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:17,900
Yes.

260
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:38,000
Sis,

261
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,700
don't worry. I'll take care of it.

262
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,300
You asked about the Gangneung family fire incident. Right?

263
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,400
Yes.

264
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,433
But why are you asking about this case?

265
00:20:48,433 --> 00:20:52,433
Oh, Dr. Noh is writing a book this time.

266
00:20:52,433 --> 00:20:54,500
About children who have lost their families…

267
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,633
You are doing a lot of good work.

268
00:20:56,633 --> 00:21:00,400
But what are you curious about specifically?

269
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,100
At the time, it was said to be a family disaster,

270
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,400
but I heard there was a survivor.

271
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,200
Oh, that's right.

272
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,967
Lee Se Na, the second daughter.

273
00:21:13,967 --> 00:21:17,200
Is there anyone who can tell me

274
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,033
what she was like after the accident?

275
00:21:21,033 --> 00:21:24,900
The detective in charge was Detective Cha Min Gu.

276
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,100
I guess he investigated this as an arson case.

277
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,900
Arson case?

278
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,967
Are you saying someone set the fire on purpose?

279
00:21:32,967 --> 00:21:34,900
Why did he think it was arson?

280
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,700
Oh, this happened 14 years ago,

281
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,700
and he's not in our office anymore.

282
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:44,400
Is there anyone who might know that detective?

283
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,467
Yes, that's right.

284
00:21:46,467 --> 00:21:48,800
He was obsessed with that case.

285
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,233
He kept saying it was arson…

286
00:21:50,233 --> 00:21:52,300
Why did he think it was arson?

287
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,767
It could be the detective's intuition,

288
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:57,333
but I don't know why he was so obsessed with that case.

289
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:00,900
In the end, he closed the case and went somewhere else.

290
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,033
Where is he now?

291
00:22:03,033 --> 00:22:07,867
I heard he went to police station in Yongin before retirement.

292
00:22:07,867 --> 00:22:10,067
Thank you.

293
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,600
I'll go to Yongin first and then call you.

294
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,033
Yeah, Young Min. Call me later.

295
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:21,500
Yes.

296
00:22:28,233 --> 00:22:32,000
Doctor, someone came to visit you.

297
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,333
Hello.

298
00:22:40,933 --> 00:22:43,867
I heard a lot about you from Do Hyun.

299
00:22:43,867 --> 00:22:46,433
What did Do Hyun say?

300
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:52,433
He said there is someone he likes and that person is pretty and good at studying.

301
00:22:52,433 --> 00:22:54,367
I see.

302
00:22:54,367 --> 00:22:56,467
What brings you here?

303
00:22:56,467 --> 00:22:59,020
I have something to tell you.

304
00:23:00,233 --> 00:23:04,667
It's about Do Hyun that you don't know.

305
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:07,400
About Do Hyun?

306
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:12,567
Do you know everything about Do Hyun?

307
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,633
 Do you know everything about your family? 

308
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,233
What do you mean by that?

309
00:23:25,233 --> 00:23:27,700
Who told you to do this?

310
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,400
Why are you doing this?

311
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,667
I'm pregnant.

312
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:34,867
What?

313
00:23:34,867 --> 00:23:36,700
I'm pregnant.

314
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,200
Do Hyun's baby.

315
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,500
I thought people like you wouldn't be that surprised.

316
00:23:56,533 --> 00:23:58,967
Have you been to the hospital?

317
00:23:58,967 --> 00:24:01,267
You don't believe me. Right?

318
00:24:01,267 --> 00:24:03,100
No, it's not like that.

319
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,867
I understand.

320
00:24:04,867 --> 00:24:07,700
I knew it, so…

321
00:24:13,633 --> 00:24:16,167
It's been 11 weeks.

322
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Does Do Hyun know this too?

323
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,367
He's the baby's father, so of course he knows.

324
00:24:25,233 --> 00:24:27,233
Then you two…

325
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:30,467
Yes, I'll keep this baby.

326
00:24:36,133 --> 00:24:40,000
Of course I respect your decisions,

327
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,500
but it's not something that can be decided that easily.

328
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:49,000
- You have to go to school too… 
 - It wasn't an easy decision.

329
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,133
Please send us to study abroad.

330
00:24:51,133 --> 00:24:53,000
I'll go study abroad and give birth to the baby.

331
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,167
Studying abroad?

332
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:59,267
I guess here, we have to worry about what other people think.

333
00:25:02,733 --> 00:25:04,767
Why?

334
00:25:05,733 --> 00:25:07,967
Surely someone like you

335
00:25:07,967 --> 00:25:12,933
wouldn't tell me to get an abortion. Right?

336
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:17,800
Soyee,

337
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:22,133
I say this because having a child

338
00:25:22,133 --> 00:25:26,400
and becoming a parent is not as easy as it sounds.

339
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:31,500
The life you thought might take a completely different direction.

340
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,400
I'm not too young to know that.

341
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,833
Well, do you think it was easy for me

342
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:40,700
to decide to become a mother at 19?

343
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,810
Do your parents know?

344
00:25:48,533 --> 00:25:51,400
I'm telling you first.

345
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,767
If my mom calls you, please tell her.

346
00:25:58,567 --> 00:26:00,600
I guess this kind of thing is

347
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,167
a bit more shocking to mothers with daughters.

348
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:12,067
Well, I have to go to the academy now…

349
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,700
 I'm on my way home after meeting your mom. 

350
00:26:52,467 --> 00:26:55,467
Soyee told my mom about it.

351
00:26:56,233 --> 00:26:58,700
That's great.

352
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,800
It went just as you planned.

353
00:27:03,767 --> 00:27:06,833
What did your mother say?

354
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:09,333
She must have been surprised.

355
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:13,967
But do you think your mother will do as you wish?

356
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:18,667
Because my mom always said she wanted me to be honest.

357
00:27:18,667 --> 00:27:21,133
That's what mothers are like.

358
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:23,367
"Just don't lie."

359
00:27:23,367 --> 00:27:26,100
"Just tell me honestly so I won't get angry."

360
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,167
So, if you are honest with her,

361
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:31,333
she'll inevitably get angry and scold you.

362
00:27:33,233 --> 00:27:36,533
Then you will feel betrayed.

363
00:27:37,867 --> 00:27:43,067
Then this time, you can see your mother's true self.

364
00:27:49,533 --> 00:27:52,100
You're back.

365
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,567
Oh, Do Hyun is taking tutoring.

366
00:27:54,567 --> 00:27:56,800
I see.

367
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,600
Dr. Noh?

368
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,733
Mother.

369
00:28:41,933 --> 00:28:46,000
Dr. Noh, are you pregnant?

370
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,133
No.

371
00:28:48,133 --> 00:28:51,033
Then what? Lee Se Na?

372
00:28:51,033 --> 00:28:52,567
No.

373
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:54,967
Then what?

374
00:29:00,933 --> 00:29:03,000
It's Do Hyun.

375
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,967
Do Hyun's girlfriend is pregnant.

376
00:29:05,967 --> 00:29:07,860
Lord.

377
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,600
How long has it been?

378
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,867
- It's been 11 weeks. 
 - 11 weeks…

379
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:23,500
Since you are a doctor, you would know

380
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,067
that surgery is possible before 24 weeks.

381
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:28,200
Mother.

382
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,733
Why? Are you going to tell her to keep the baby?

383
00:29:30,733 --> 00:29:32,667
It's not something you can talk about so easily.

384
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:35,433
So, if I talk about it in a difficult way, will this be resolved?

385
00:29:35,433 --> 00:29:37,767
No parents are rational when it comes to their children.

386
00:29:37,767 --> 00:29:39,300
You should think about Do Hyun's life.

387
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,500
You should listen to Do Hyun first.

388
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,167
See?

389
00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:47,967
Things don't always go as planned with sons.

390
00:29:47,967 --> 00:29:51,833
Dr. Noh is a very capable doctor outside,

391
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:55,767
but things like this happened at home.

392
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:20,800
Soyee came to my hospital today.

393
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:24,633
Is it true what Soyee said?

394
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:32,767
Yeah, it's exactly what you heard from her.

395
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,133
A rational person like you…

396
00:30:37,133 --> 00:30:40,133
Well, if I'm rational, does that mean I don't have sexual desires?

397
00:30:42,733 --> 00:30:47,233
What I mean is, I'm curious about whether the pregnancy

398
00:30:47,233 --> 00:30:51,067
was agreed upon or discussed sufficiently

399
00:30:51,067 --> 00:30:52,400
and whether the decision was made carefully.

400
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,600
Are you telling me I didn't make a careful decision?

401
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,733
It's my choice. You said you would respect my choice.

402
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:05,033
Forget it.

403
00:31:05,033 --> 00:31:08,300
I'll talk to my dad separately.

404
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,733
Between man to man.

405
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,867
Could you please leave for a moment?

406
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,800
Why are you doing this?

407
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,733
I understand your painful feelings.

408
00:32:26,633 --> 00:32:28,033
Let's just go home.

409
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:30,567
How long will you be like this?

410
00:32:31,267 --> 00:32:34,233
Please go back.

411
00:32:34,233 --> 00:32:35,800
Please give up on me.

412
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,967
What parents give up on their sons?

413
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,800
Is Young Won pregnant?

414
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,033
It's Do Hyun.

415
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,400
When did he…

416
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,667
Don't you think he needs his dad in this situation?

417
00:33:07,667 --> 00:33:13,233
Put aside your resentment toward me and your desire to be free for a moment.

418
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:19,333
That's what Dr. Choi, as a parent, has to do now.

419
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,033
After you finish shaving, come out.

420
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,733
Oh, it's…

421
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,367
Madam, I…

422
00:33:36,367 --> 00:33:40,700
What are you thinking?

423
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,667
Even after seeing that situation,

424
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:45,300
you just kept Jae Jin here?

425
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,567
You should have sent him back home.

426
00:33:49,933 --> 00:33:55,700
This is why I can't really trust you.

427
00:34:07,467 --> 00:34:09,633
Jae Jin.

428
00:34:59,633 --> 00:35:02,367
Why did you bring him here?

429
00:35:03,233 --> 00:35:05,467
Didn't Do Hyun look for his dad?

430
00:35:05,467 --> 00:35:08,500
Do Hyun said he wanted to talk between men.

431
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,867
You heard that again.

432
00:35:09,867 --> 00:35:11,467
The important thing is that

433
00:35:11,467 --> 00:35:15,380
families need to work together in times like these.

434
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,300
Have you met that girl's mom?

435
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,133
I'm planning to meet her tomorrow.

436
00:35:21,133 --> 00:35:25,333
People will recognize you wherever you go, so I think it would be better

437
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:30,300
to have a private place so that no one will know.

438
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,700
I'll decide the place.

439
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,100
You had me when you were 24.

440
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,633
What's so different between 24 and 18?

441
00:35:45,633 --> 00:35:47,733
I was a medical student at the time, though.

442
00:35:47,733 --> 00:35:49,067
So was your mom.

443
00:35:49,067 --> 00:35:51,850
Neither of us were high school students.

444
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,833
When did you already…

445
00:35:56,767 --> 00:36:00,333
But weren't you happy because you had me?

446
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:01,733
If you say that, I have nothing to say.

447
00:36:01,733 --> 00:36:03,800
I'm trying to do that too to be happy.

448
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:08,200
You said that I should live the life I want.

449
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,533
So,

450
00:36:21,533 --> 00:36:25,600
you're saying that's the life you want?

451
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,633
Yes.

452
00:36:26,633 --> 00:36:30,100
Is it really necessary to live abroad?

453
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,533
Dad, you know Jun Ho. Right?

454
00:36:32,533 --> 00:36:34,030
Yes.

455
00:36:34,933 --> 00:36:38,000
The three of us will be together again.

456
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,167
So are you going to the US where Jun Ho is?

457
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:43,233
Yes.

458
00:36:44,667 --> 00:36:47,633
Dad, you'll take my side. Right?

459
00:37:53,667 --> 00:37:56,567
 Hello, I'm Moon Tae Oh. 

460
00:37:56,567 --> 00:38:00,367
 How did you get my number? 

461
00:38:06,067 --> 00:38:08,733
 Jae Jin asked me to tell you that he was sorry. 

462
00:38:08,733 --> 00:38:11,067
 I met him at his house today. 

463
00:38:11,067 --> 00:38:13,167
 Is he okay? 

464
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:14,767
 He's not okay. 

465
00:38:14,767 --> 00:38:16,533
 Dr. Oh, are you upset? 

466
00:38:16,533 --> 00:38:18,367
 Because he's acting like that now… 

467
00:38:18,367 --> 00:38:20,833
 You can talk to me. 

468
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:23,033
 He told me everything. 

469
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:25,400
 He is in pain. 

470
00:38:29,167 --> 00:38:32,133
 What happened with Lee Se Na? 

471
00:38:32,133 --> 00:38:34,467
 I guess he can't get in touch with her. 

472
00:38:34,467 --> 00:38:36,667
 I think he has been abandoned by her. 

473
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:40,167
 Why did Jae Jin fall in love with such a strange woman… 

474
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:43,767
 He said that someone saved him. 

475
00:38:43,767 --> 00:38:46,267
 When I see him struggling at home now, 

476
00:38:46,267 --> 00:38:49,800
 I wonder if it'd be better for him to leave. 

477
00:38:50,467 --> 00:38:54,500
 Who can save him now? 

478
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:24,800
   

479
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,133
 I just heard that Detective Cha retired 

480
00:39:27,133 --> 00:39:30,267
 and started a deer farm nearby. 

481
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:33,000
A deer farm…

482
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,467
What is this?

483
00:39:34,467 --> 00:39:36,567
There are so many deer farms.

484
00:39:36,567 --> 00:39:39,433
Why do you have so little confidence?

485
00:39:39,433 --> 00:39:41,167
Where has our passion gone?

486
00:39:41,167 --> 00:39:44,767
Let's call all the deer farms here. Let's go.

487
00:39:44,767 --> 00:39:47,300
Let's go, yes.

488
00:39:53,033 --> 00:39:56,300
- Have a cool drink. 
 - Oh, thank you.

489
00:40:04,267 --> 00:40:06,200
But, Uncle,

490
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,267
why are you looking for CCTVs that show the house?

491
00:40:09,267 --> 00:40:12,033
Oh, I heard someone left

492
00:40:12,033 --> 00:40:16,767
some weird mail for them recently.

493
00:40:16,767 --> 00:40:18,067
Whose house is this?

494
00:40:18,067 --> 00:40:20,733
Someone who is like family.

495
00:40:20,733 --> 00:40:23,300
Please do me a favor, nephew-in-law.

496
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,200
What? Nephew-in-law?

497
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,000
Of course.

498
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,967
Family members should help each other with everything.

499
00:40:30,967 --> 00:40:33,367
Thank you.

500
00:40:33,367 --> 00:40:35,467
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

501
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:46,100
 So I think it would be better to have a private place so that no one will know. 

502
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,833
 I'll decide the place. 

503
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,500
Hello.

504
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,900
You're here, too.

505
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,500
I thought his grandmother came because you couldn't make it here.

506
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,400
It seems like you two get along really well.

507
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,167
Even in this situation, you came together.

508
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:31,667
Because we're family.

509
00:41:37,867 --> 00:41:42,333
But how did you end up like this…

510
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:46,233
Does raising children ever go according to plan?

511
00:41:46,233 --> 00:41:50,367
You didn't educate your daughter to get pregnant, either.

512
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,333
By the way, what are you going to do about this?

513
00:41:58,333 --> 00:42:01,333
Soyee is a senior in high school, so preparing for the college entrance exam is tight.

514
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:04,300
By the way, are you sure it's Do Hyun's baby?

515
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,900
Are you telling me that my daughter is lying?

516
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,300
Should I get her to do some genetic testing?

517
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:13,400
Prenatal genetic testing is illegal.

518
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:22,700
Have you ever heard what they say?

519
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,167
She said she wanted to go abroad to study and keep the baby.

520
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,900
Oh, well…

521
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,267
It would be good to send them to study abroad.

522
00:42:30,267 --> 00:42:33,967
Soyee really wanted to go study abroad.

523
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:38,200
Well, if they're going to get married anyway, it's not a bad thing. Right?

524
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,167
A marriage?

525
00:42:40,167 --> 00:42:43,767
Are you trying to stand in my grandchild's way?

526
00:42:43,767 --> 00:42:47,433
The same goes for Soyee.

527
00:42:47,433 --> 00:42:49,467
Honestly, in a family with a son,

528
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:52,100
if she just aborts the baby, there is no risk.

529
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,233
But it's different for my daughter.

530
00:42:54,233 --> 00:42:57,767
There are risks whether she gives birth or has an abortion.

531
00:42:58,567 --> 00:43:00,500
Do you know that story?

532
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:04,000
These days in Gangnam, when a late baby is born in a family,

533
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,933
it is said that the baby is their sons' baby.

534
00:43:06,933 --> 00:43:08,800
They register their grandson as their son

535
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,867
in place of their son, who is in high school.

536
00:43:11,867 --> 00:43:13,933
This baby is also part of that family.

537
00:43:13,933 --> 00:43:18,000
So would you do that?

538
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,033
Soyee's mother, please calm down first.

539
00:43:20,033 --> 00:43:23,767
So, if I give you about 500 million won, will it be okay?

540
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,933
Mother.

541
00:43:31,933 --> 00:43:33,867
Is this something

542
00:43:33,867 --> 00:43:37,900
that can be solved with money now?

543
00:43:39,967 --> 00:43:43,600
Shouldn't someone like you not be doing something like this?

544
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,900
Oh, well…

545
00:43:46,467 --> 00:43:49,567
Mother, please don't get involved in this.

546
00:43:49,567 --> 00:43:52,067
This has to do with my son.

547
00:43:57,667 --> 00:44:00,867
Soyee's mother, sorry.

548
00:44:01,733 --> 00:44:05,033
I don't want to talk to you anymore today.

549
00:44:18,333 --> 00:44:20,167
   

550
00:44:20,167 --> 00:44:22,267
Manager Park.

551
00:44:23,233 --> 00:44:24,400
Yes, Madam.

552
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,400
That girl named Soyee, please find out about her family.

553
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,467
Yes.

554
00:44:46,667 --> 00:44:48,567
Hello.

555
00:44:48,567 --> 00:44:49,800
We are the ones who called to visit you today.

556
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,867
Oh, yes.

557
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,233
Hello.

558
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:56,400
Aren't you the person who appears on TV?

559
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,800
Why did you come here?

560
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,267
Because of the family disaster fire incident

561
00:45:02,267 --> 00:45:04,733
that occurred 14 years ago.

562
00:45:04,733 --> 00:45:07,500
It's a closed case, but why?

563
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:11,467
I heard that at the time, you thought the fire was an arson incident.

564
00:45:11,467 --> 00:45:15,067
Can I ask why?

565
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,300
Why are you curious about that?

566
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:28,700
The second daughter, who was the only survivor at that time, is my patient.

567
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:31,033
I don't want to know about that person.

568
00:45:31,033 --> 00:45:32,967
Please go back now!

569
00:45:32,967 --> 00:45:34,967
- Sir, that's not it… 
 - Go back.

570
00:45:34,967 --> 00:45:37,700
- Sir, that's not it… 
 - Go back now!

571
00:45:38,533 --> 00:45:40,733
Actually,

572
00:45:40,733 --> 00:45:42,733
I lied.

573
00:45:42,733 --> 00:45:45,067
I'm sorry.

574
00:45:46,633 --> 00:45:52,467
Lee Se Na is threatening my son.

575
00:45:54,467 --> 00:45:57,100
Please help me.

576
00:46:08,533 --> 00:46:10,167
It's that house.

577
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:14,000
It looks like they're having a hard time financially due to a failed business.

578
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,667
Her husband filed for bankruptcy and ran away,

579
00:46:17,667 --> 00:46:23,267
and she couldn't leave Gangnam because of her daughter…

580
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,833
Did you turn the heater off when you came out?

581
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:29,390
I turned it off.

582
00:46:30,333 --> 00:46:32,867
She wasn't the only one.

583
00:46:32,867 --> 00:46:34,300
What?

584
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:38,133
Lee Se Na wasn't the only survivor.

585
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,850
Her elder sister is alive.

586
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,967
Her sister was in a coma at first.

587
00:46:44,967 --> 00:46:50,467
That's why the reporters wrote that it was a family disaster.

588
00:46:50,467 --> 00:46:54,333
Did Lee Se Na know that her sister was alive?

589
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:57,833
Her sister's condition was so bad at the time

590
00:46:57,833 --> 00:47:02,200
that she must have been very shocked as well.

591
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:07,533
Then, belatedly, her sister woke up dramatically.

592
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,733
However,

593
00:47:09,733 --> 00:47:14,433
she asked me not to let Lee Se Na know that she was alive.

594
00:47:15,467 --> 00:47:19,433
At first, I thought it was just the shock from the fire,

595
00:47:19,433 --> 00:47:22,133
but then she said this.

596
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,210
Her little sister set the fire...

597
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,867
and tried to kill their parents.

598
00:47:31,867 --> 00:47:35,967
But she said it was because of her that her sister did that.

599
00:47:35,967 --> 00:47:37,100
So…

600
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:43,667
So I tried to hide it and reinvestigate the case,

601
00:47:44,867 --> 00:47:48,333
but Lee Se Na got adopted.

602
00:47:49,467 --> 00:47:52,667
That's how the case ended.

603
00:47:52,667 --> 00:47:56,267
Did Lee Se Na find her sister after that?

604
00:47:56,267 --> 00:47:58,633
She may have tried to look for her,

605
00:47:58,633 --> 00:48:01,100
but she would never have found her.

606
00:48:11,633 --> 00:48:14,100
Try going to this address.

607
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:19,690
   

608
00:48:28,567 --> 00:48:31,080
   

609
00:48:32,133 --> 00:48:35,500
- Do Hyun. 
 - How could you do that?

610
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,633
Did you pay Soyee's family to get rid of the baby?

611
00:48:37,633 --> 00:48:38,667
What are you talking about?

612
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:41,800
I heard you wrote a memorandum to get rid of the baby in exchange for money.

613
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,133
I've never done that.

614
00:48:43,133 --> 00:48:46,600
If it's a lie, I really won't forgive you.

615
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,500
Do Hyun. Do Hyun.

616
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:55,867
Mother, why are you doing this?

617
00:48:55,867 --> 00:48:57,367
I solved it.

618
00:48:57,367 --> 00:49:00,167
This way, there won't be any problems later.

619
00:49:00,167 --> 00:49:02,500
She'll blame her parents for taking the money.

620
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,333
I told you not to get involved this time.

621
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:07,667
Her parents also wanted it.

622
00:49:07,667 --> 00:49:10,333
What parent would approve

623
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:12,633
of a high school student having a child?

624
00:49:12,633 --> 00:49:15,733
And it seemed like that family needed money.

625
00:49:15,733 --> 00:49:18,067
And you also need to be honest.

626
00:49:18,067 --> 00:49:20,333
You don't want Do Hyun to be the baby's father. Right?

627
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:22,733
I don't want that.

628
00:49:22,733 --> 00:49:26,133
I'm scared because I know what Do Hyun will have to deal with.

629
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:27,800
But what I'm more afraid of

630
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,700
is that Do Hyun will hate me

631
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:31,833
because of the decision I made.

632
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:35,767
Nevertheless, it is a mother's job to make decisions on behalf of her son.

633
00:49:35,767 --> 00:49:37,367
You think you can decide your son's life

634
00:49:37,367 --> 00:49:40,533
based on your own judgment. Right?

635
00:49:40,533 --> 00:49:42,067
I'm different from you.

636
00:49:42,067 --> 00:49:45,467
I'll respect Do Hyun's thoughts and decisions.

637
00:49:45,467 --> 00:49:47,500
I'll raise and protect my son

638
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,167
differently from you, so please don't get involved in

639
00:49:50,167 --> 00:49:53,333
Do Hyun's business again.

640
00:49:53,333 --> 00:49:56,567
How can I not get involved? It's my grandchild's business.

641
00:49:56,567 --> 00:49:59,167
This is a family matter!

642
00:49:59,167 --> 00:50:01,133
What is this family?

643
00:50:01,133 --> 00:50:05,167
What is so great about this family that has been deceiving each other?

644
00:50:07,033 --> 00:50:08,233
Dr. Noh!

645
00:50:08,233 --> 00:50:11,000
I'm not done talking yet!

646
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:18,550
   

647
00:51:30,467 --> 00:51:32,850
   

648
00:51:46,067 --> 00:51:52,033
 Motherhood is so beautiful yet sad. Right? 

649
00:52:18,833 --> 00:52:21,033
Do Hyun,

650
00:52:21,767 --> 00:52:26,667
I'll support your decision.

651
00:52:29,667 --> 00:52:31,200
Really?

652
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,800
Yes.

653
00:52:33,867 --> 00:52:37,567
You'll have a lot to overcome in the future,

654
00:52:37,567 --> 00:52:41,067
but no matter what other people think of you,

655
00:52:41,733 --> 00:52:44,667
I'll protect you.

656
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,233
Thank you, Mom.

657
00:53:44,033 --> 00:53:46,960
   

658
00:53:58,533 --> 00:54:00,833
 But then she said this. 

659
00:54:00,833 --> 00:54:02,933
 Her little sister set the fire 

660
00:54:02,933 --> 00:54:04,733
 and tried to kill her parents. 

661
00:54:04,733 --> 00:54:06,600
 But she said it was because of her that her sister did that. 

662
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:10,400
 You're doing this without knowing anything. 

663
00:54:34,767 --> 00:54:36,867
Excuse me.

664
00:54:37,467 --> 00:54:40,133
What can I do for you?

665
00:54:40,133 --> 00:54:43,667
I came to see Lee Se Eun.

666
00:54:43,667 --> 00:54:47,100
Why are you looking for Se Eun?

667
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:50,467
I have something to tell her about her family.

668
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,933
Follow me.

669
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:12,300
Sister Maria, someone came to see you.

670
00:55:21,033 --> 00:55:22,867
   

671
00:55:22,867 --> 00:55:24,900
Se Eun.

672
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:28,800
You can just speak comfortably. Okay?

673
00:55:33,533 --> 00:55:37,000
It started with a pigeon.

674
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:43,933
When she brought a decapitated pigeon into the yard.

675
00:55:43,933 --> 00:55:46,900
 There was only one reason my sister gave. 

676
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:52,633
 "Because I don't like pigeons." 

677
00:55:52,633 --> 00:55:54,867
 Her obsession with me grew stronger day by day, 

678
00:55:54,867 --> 00:55:59,000
 and her revenge became bolder. 

679
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,033
Next was the cat,

680
00:56:02,933 --> 00:56:05,300
and next was...

681
00:56:06,067 --> 00:56:08,800
the boy next door.

682
00:56:11,467 --> 00:56:14,767
In the end, my parents didn't let my sister go out.

683
00:56:14,767 --> 00:56:18,233
They said she shouldn't commit another sin.

684
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,933
But there was...

685
00:56:24,333 --> 00:56:26,800
a fire that day.

686
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:38,933
What are you doing?

687
00:56:40,267 --> 00:56:42,800
She's the sister you like so much.

688
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:47,733
You'll hear the whole truth about that day on the live broadcast today.

689
00:56:47,733 --> 00:56:49,640
That's a lie.

690
00:56:50,267 --> 00:56:52,733
Don't lie.

691
00:56:52,733 --> 00:56:56,100
Why? Are you afraid?

692
00:56:56,633 --> 00:56:59,767
If you are afraid, come and try to stop it yourself.

693
00:56:59,767 --> 00:57:02,833
But you'll need to hurry.

694
00:58:08,867 --> 00:58:11,270
   

695
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,133
Where is my sister?

696
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,100
Did you come here because you missed your sister?

697
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:30,200
Or...

698
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:33,290
are you here because you're afraid she's alive?

699
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,800
I guess it's because you're afraid.

700
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:39,667
Because your sister is the only witness

701
00:58:39,667 --> 00:58:41,750
to what you did that day.

702
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,133
Don't talk nonsense when you don't even know.

703
00:58:45,133 --> 00:58:47,500
Don't you think it's all because of you

704
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,633
that your family was so ruined?

705
00:58:49,633 --> 00:58:52,933
Are you saying that I did something wrong, too?

706
00:58:52,933 --> 00:58:54,433
No.

707
00:58:54,433 --> 00:58:56,267
It's not my fault.

708
00:58:56,267 --> 00:58:59,667
Even though we were family, they didn't accept my love.

709
00:59:03,067 --> 00:59:06,790
But no one else burns their family to death like you did.

710
00:59:07,433 --> 00:59:10,567
So where is my sister?

711
00:59:15,267 --> 00:59:17,700
It's all a lie.

712
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,790
Your sister is dead.

713
00:59:49,067 --> 00:59:53,100
   

714
00:59:56,580 --> 01:00:04,620



715
01:00:20,133 --> 01:00:21,700
 I'll get you quarantined and treated 

716
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:24,033
 before everyone finds out what you've done. 

717
01:00:24,033 --> 01:00:25,833
 I was just curious. 

718
01:00:25,833 --> 01:00:30,400
 Would it be so easy to talk about someone else's family 

719
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,633
 even after knowing the ugly truth about your own family? 

720
01:00:33,633 --> 01:00:36,300
 You should have lived your own life! 

721
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:39,767
 The son you were expecting wouldn't have been like this. 

722
01:00:39,767 --> 01:00:42,067
 Doctor, you also have a son like that. 

723
01:00:42,067 --> 01:00:44,400
 What are you planning to do? 

724
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,667
 Why are you doing this? 

725
01:00:45,667 --> 01:00:48,367
 The human imagination... 

726
01:00:50,567 --> 01:00:53,600
 is the scariest thing.
