1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,033
   

2
00:00:06,967 --> 00:00:10,500
 Madam, this is the Margaux 2005 you mentioned. 

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,300
 Oh, you got that wine. 

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,033
 This wine is such a rare wine that it is recognized 

5
00:00:17,033 --> 00:00:18,900
 as the best vintage wine in Bordeaux. 

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,967
 This is a wine you can't help but love. 

7
00:00:21,967 --> 00:00:25,100
 It is said that Hemingway loved this wine so much 

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,800
 that he named his granddaughter Margaux Hemingway. 

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,033
 Please prepare this well. 

10
00:00:31,033 --> 00:00:32,267
 Yes. 

11
00:00:32,267 --> 00:00:36,800
 Why are you paying so much attention today? 

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,933
 It's my son and his wife's 10th wedding anniversary. 

13
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:43,133
 Because they got married in 2005. 

14
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:45,633
 You are so attentive. 

15
00:00:45,633 --> 00:00:48,333
 I should celebrate their anniversaries since they are my family. 

16
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:51,600
 Yes, then I'll prepare it well. 

17
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:02,500
 This wine was prepared by Mrs. Hong. 

18
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,800
 Oh, Mother? 

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,800
 Yes. 

20
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,067
 Toast! 

21
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:44,750
   

22
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:58,867
 Who are you? 

23
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:03,500
 You can't sleep well if you watch TV too late at night. 

24
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:09,867
 When you can't sleep, it's good to do this. 

25
00:02:21,367 --> 00:02:26,133
 Is it time for me to sleep? 

26
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,700
 I'm sleepy. 

27
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,700
 I'm going to sleep. 

28
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,867
 Try lying down. 

29
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:53,100
 Have you read Hemingway's "The Old Man and the Sea"? 

30
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,067
 A story about an old fisherman 

31
00:02:58,067 --> 00:03:00,867
 who fights alone in his sailboat 

32
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:05,733
 for four days and nights to catch a marlin. 

33
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:09,233
 Of course, he succeeds in catching it, 

34
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:13,567
 but on the way back home, he encounters a school of sharks 

35
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:16,700
 and loses everything. 

36
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:22,567
 He carries only the skeleton of a marlin and says, 

37
00:03:25,033 --> 00:03:28,533
 "Now, home is not far away." 

38
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:31,867
 The old fisherman does not get discouraged 

39
00:03:31,867 --> 00:03:36,067
 but returns home safely, 

40
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:38,900
 thinking of the people who care about him. 

41
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:49,467
 I think Young Won created that kind of home for me. 

42
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,800
 In-law, 

43
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,367
 today is their 10th wedding anniversary. 

44
00:04:00,967 --> 00:04:06,333
 If only they are happy, then that's okay. Right? 

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,433
 I'm sure Director Noh will understand. Right? 

46
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:50,067
   

47
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:51,867
 That's why I'm telling you, 

48
00:04:51,867 --> 00:04:53,767
 I think it would be better for me 

49
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:57,000
 to deal with crazy people like you from now on. 

50
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,300
Lee Se Na, I told you I was going to deal with you. Right?

51
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,033
Dr. Noh?

52
00:07:32,033 --> 00:07:34,100
Mother.

53
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:47,933
Are you okay?

54
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:51,467
I don't know. I don't know, either.

55
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:54,633
I think I blacked out for a while…

56
00:07:54,633 --> 00:07:56,733
Why did you come here?

57
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:59,133
I got a text saying...

58
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,033
someone was going to reveal a secret.

59
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,967
I thought it was Lee Se Na.

60
00:08:05,967 --> 00:08:08,233
So, I tried to solve it…

61
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:10,800
I… I was going to meet that person

62
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,167
and end things.

63
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:16,600
Did you meet Lee Se Na?

64
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:22,533
Someone attacked me.

65
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,767
I think there was a physical fight.

66
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:47,633
I didn't kill him, I didn't.

67
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:50,333
I didn't kill him.

68
00:08:51,067 --> 00:08:55,333
Mother, you need to come to your senses.

69
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,500
Stay still.

70
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:05,900
We are the police.

71
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,700
I sent you the address.

72
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,833
Call for backup. It's a murder case.

73
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:30,133
There is one victim, two suspects.

74
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:38,200
Due to the circumstances of the scene, both of you will be taken to the police station.

75
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:38,567
   

76
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:41,100
She's Dr. Noh Young Won. Right?

77
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:45,600
Why did someone who had everything do something like that?

78
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,567
You're worrying about useless things again.

79
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:49,867
It's nothing for you to worry about.

80
00:10:49,867 --> 00:10:54,233
Still, what are they going to do when they are caught at the scene of a murder?

81
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:55,967
The other one is her mother-in-law. Right?

82
00:10:55,967 --> 00:10:58,133
Don't jump to conclusions.

83
00:10:58,133 --> 00:11:01,933
We still don't know which of the two is the culprit.

84
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:06,367
But given the circumstances, isn't the mother-in-law more likely?

85
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,167
We'll find out if we investigate.

86
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,967
First, go and collect all the evidence from the scene.

87
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:12,333
Yes, sir.

88
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,767
You said you went to the villa after receiving a text message. Right?

89
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:29,100
Yes.

90
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,067
Oh my! You must be upset about your son.

91
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:36,500
I don't think that's something to be upset about.

92
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,967
Yes, well…

93
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:41,433
Oh, here it is.

94
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:45,500
You said that this text was sent by a woman named Lee Se Na,

95
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,900
but this number is a fake phone number so it cannot be traced.

96
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,467
I'm sure it's Lee Se Na.

97
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:51,467
I got a text and then a phone call right away.

98
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:53,767
There is no recording of the call,

99
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:58,633
and there is no evidence that the person who called was Lee Se Na.

100
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:02,000
Anyway, when I got to the villa, Lee Se Na wasn't there

101
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,700
and Ahn Yo Seop was dead?

102
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:09,533
And then there was your mother-in-law, Hong Sa Gang… Right?

103
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:11,733
Yes.

104
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:16,400
You said someone attacked you when you arrived at the villa. Right?

105
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,600
Based on the current situation, it seems most likely that it was Ahn Yo Seop.

106
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,967
But it was so dark there that I couldn't see who it was.

107
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:30,033
And then someone knocked me out,

108
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:34,333
and it was clearly gauze soaked in chloroform.

109
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,700
The dead can't talk,

110
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,350
and the person who killed him has no memories.

111
00:12:42,967 --> 00:12:45,767
I didn't kill him.

112
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:50,333
It's just that something happened when I was blacked out.

113
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:54,633
There is no evidence that you had fainted.

114
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:57,133
But how can you be sure you didn't kill him?

115
00:12:57,133 --> 00:13:00,300
I'm not that kind of person.

116
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:04,433
I wondered who Lee Se Na was,

117
00:13:04,433 --> 00:13:08,533
and she was your husband's mistress.

118
00:13:08,533 --> 00:13:11,500
You recently handed Lee Se Na over to the police.

119
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,600
She's been threatening me all this time.

120
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,467
But since Ahn Yo Seop said it had nothing to do with Lee Se Na,

121
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:22,133
she was released due to insufficient evidence.

122
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:24,433
From your point of view,

123
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:27,633
you must have been very angry with Ahn Yo Seop, right?

124
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:29,733
That doesn't mean I killed that person.

125
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:31,400
Yeah?

126
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,467
Murder may not have been the goal.

127
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:40,067
In any case, the exact estimated time of death and autopsy results will have to be released,

128
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:41,933
but both you and Hong Sa Gang

129
00:13:41,933 --> 00:13:46,400
have sufficient motive to murder Ahn Yo Seop.

130
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,867
There is also the possibility that you two are accomplices.

131
00:13:50,867 --> 00:13:53,100
Accomplice?

132
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,433
Officer, let me make this one thing clear.

133
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:04,800
Dr. Noh arrived after I woke up.

134
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,433
I clearly remember this.

135
00:14:07,433 --> 00:14:11,833
And Dr. Noh is not that kind of person.

136
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:17,567
Are you admitting that you were the only one at the murder scene?

137
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:18,700
No.

138
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,800
She would never have done that.

139
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,333
This is a trap.

140
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:25,400
Lee Se Na is trying to frame us for murder.

141
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,967
I was wondering why your mom and wife were so angry.

142
00:14:30,967 --> 00:14:33,867
Well, I understand that.

143
00:14:33,867 --> 00:14:37,633
So, can you reach Lee Se Na?

144
00:14:37,633 --> 00:14:40,067
Since both of them said it was because of Lee Se Na.

145
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:42,767
No.

146
00:14:42,767 --> 00:14:46,800
If Lee Se Na is caught, will they be able to escape being framed for murder?

147
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,067
No.

148
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:53,033
That is also something that is difficult to prove unless the person admits it.

149
00:14:53,933 --> 00:14:56,933
So, for now, it seems more certain that your mother or wife

150
00:14:56,933 --> 00:14:59,700
had a motive for killing Mr. Ahn.

151
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,767
No, officer.

152
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:05,660
My mother and wife are not the type of people who would commit murder.

153
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:11,200
Mr. Choi Jae Jin, the crime scene doesn't lie.

154
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:15,367
If it's not true, it will be revealed in the investigation.

155
00:16:46,144 --> 00:16:49,400
   

156
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,800
Mrs. Noh Young Won, you can go home now.

157
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,133
Oh, and the vehicle is still under investigation.

158
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:40,033
As soon as the investigation is over, please come and pick up the car.

159
00:17:41,467 --> 00:17:43,167
Thank you for your hard work in investigating.

160
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:46,667
You were cleared of "no charges".

161
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:50,067
I guess Mrs. Hong strongly stated

162
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:52,833
that she was the only one at the scene.

163
00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:58,700
   

164
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,900
Then, what about Mother?

165
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:04,167
They say the fingerprints from the knife that appears to be the murder weapon

166
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,500
and the DNA found at the scene all match those of Mrs. Hong.

167
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,267
So, what happens then?

168
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:12,867
The police will likely identify Mrs. Hong as the prime suspect.

169
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:14,767
We'll have to wait until the autopsy results come out,

170
00:18:14,767 --> 00:18:16,367
but it won't be easy to avoid charges

171
00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:19,900
if the cause of death was a stab wound.

172
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,900
If things are going as per Lee Se Na's plan,

173
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,867
I'm sure she was aiming for me,

174
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:58,967
but it seems like there's a variable.

175
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:02,000
Because of me, you…

176
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,500
No, no, no. Dr. Noh.

177
00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:10,733
If Lee Se Na's plan went awry, then this is just for the better.

178
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:15,800
If you had been framed as she planned, it would have been all over.

179
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,967
Also, I think it would be

180
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:24,233
better for me to be here than you.

181
00:19:24,933 --> 00:19:25,933
Mother.

182
00:19:25,933 --> 00:19:28,100
Don't look at me that way.

183
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,400
I'm just a bit stronger than you

184
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,967
to handle something like this.

185
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:43,700
The evidence from the scene can be easily manipulated.

186
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,633
Don't worry.

187
00:19:45,633 --> 00:19:48,933
I'll find evidence to prove this is what Lee Se Na did.

188
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:52,900
At first, I also thought it would be Lee Se Na, just like you thought.

189
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,590
However,

190
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:59,367
it was definitely a man who attacked me.

191
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:03,700
Are you saying it wasn't Lee Se Na but a man?

192
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,433
Dr. Noh, don't you know how to do things like hypnosis?

193
00:20:07,433 --> 00:20:09,533
Pardon?

194
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:19,333
As soon as I entered the living room,

195
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:25,167
someone behind me covered my mouth and nose.

196
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:27,100
That person was quite tall.

197
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,633
My head was touching that person's chin.

198
00:20:30,633 --> 00:20:33,600
The rustling noise was so annoying.

199
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,233
I hit that person with my elbow as hard as I could.

200
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,733
That person let out a small voice.

201
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:46,367
It was definitely a man. I'm sure it was a man.

202
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:48,333
The living room was too dark.

203
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:51,767
And then he knocked me down.

204
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:53,733
I got something in my hand.

205
00:20:53,733 --> 00:20:56,533
I hit him on the head with it.

206
00:20:57,267 --> 00:21:01,767
But he covered my mouth again with gauze.

207
00:21:01,767 --> 00:21:03,900
I felt so bad.

208
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,467
And then?

209
00:21:06,467 --> 00:21:08,800
I don't remember.

210
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:15,167
Was that really Manager Ahn?

211
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:19,900
Even so, there was someone who killed Manager Ahn.

212
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,333
Of course, that person erased all traces and disappeared.

213
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,300
Do you know what the trick is with these locked-room cases in mystery novels?

214
00:21:33,633 --> 00:21:38,900
A murderer is a person who never comes under suspicion.

215
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,867
Then, who is it?

216
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:48,167
There is another assistant of Lee Se Na that we don't expect…

217
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,367
Mother,

218
00:21:52,367 --> 00:21:55,067
you have to recall as much as you can.

219
00:21:55,067 --> 00:21:58,100
Yeah, I'll try that.

220
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,367
Dr. Choi was very surprised, right?

221
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:16,200
I guess he feels like he can't face you.

222
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,900
Well, I also don't want to see him right now.

223
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,267
You can just go now.

224
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:31,667
I'll talk to Attorney Koh.

225
00:22:34,067 --> 00:22:36,167
Yes, Mother.

226
00:22:56,967 --> 00:22:59,000
Honey.

227
00:23:00,267 --> 00:23:02,400
Now…

228
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:09,100
She came out!

229
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,433
Hello! Hello!

230
00:23:10,433 --> 00:23:12,833
Dr. Noh, I'm from Military Monster.

231
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:13,933
You feel unfair, right?

232
00:23:13,933 --> 00:23:15,967
Then, please contact us at any time.

233
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:18,533
- Here, here. 
 - The victim is…

234
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,567
Please do it later, later…

235
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:24,800
I'm from Minjuda, it would be creepy if your mother-in-law was a murderer. Right?

236
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,733
- I got goosebumps. 
 - It's totally creepy.

237
00:23:29,167 --> 00:23:34,367
My mother-in-law is not a murderer.

238
00:23:34,367 --> 00:23:37,467
The truth will come out soon.

239
00:23:37,467 --> 00:23:39,533
Please get out of the way.

240
00:23:40,567 --> 00:23:42,933
Excuse me, I'll pass by.

241
00:23:42,933 --> 00:23:45,367
Could you please answer me?

242
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,400
Please answer me.

243
00:23:49,133 --> 00:23:51,500
Are you heading home now?

244
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,400
Please say a word to his bereaved family.

245
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,333
You can't just leave like this.

246
00:24:04,933 --> 00:24:08,500
 Even though it's Dr. Noh Young Won, it really gives me goosebumps. 

247
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,233
 I wonder how she called him when she brought him to the villa. 

248
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:16,400
 Since he was her secretary, he had to go when she called. 

249
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:25,100
   

250
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,000
How could…

251
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,367
Did you watch the news?

252
00:24:30,367 --> 00:24:32,767
Yes, I did.

253
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:38,200
I knew she was a scary person, but I never thought she would commit murder.

254
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,400
Jae Jin must have been very shocked.

255
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:50,400
But maybe you can think of it as an opportunity.

256
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,400
An opportunity?

257
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,933
Jae Jin is the one who wants to leave home,

258
00:24:53,933 --> 00:24:59,333
and Mrs. Hong doesn't want that.

259
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:00,933
Right.

260
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:03,333
If it weren't for her,

261
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:07,220
Jae Jin wouldn't have lived like that.

262
00:25:07,933 --> 00:25:12,433
If it weren't for her…

263
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:26,567
If you can get rid of the person, you want to do it without any effort,

264
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,867
so I think that's an opportunity.

265
00:25:29,933 --> 00:25:31,800
Isn't that right?

266
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,300
Her fingerprints were found, so of course she would go to jail.

267
00:25:38,733 --> 00:25:44,033
But did she really kill him?

268
00:25:44,867 --> 00:25:47,967
Are you having a weak mind again?

269
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,733
Ji Eun, do you know that saying?

270
00:25:53,733 --> 00:25:56,967
If the favor continues, they think it is their right.

271
00:25:56,967 --> 00:25:59,867
If you show kindness like this, people will treat you…

272
00:25:59,867 --> 00:26:03,400
they'll look down on you. Are you a pushover?

273
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,733
I'm not that kind of person.

274
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:11,133
Why does everyone just say that and not take any action?

275
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:18,000
Sorry.

276
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,767
I really don't want you to miss another opportunity and regret it.

277
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,567
Uncle! Uncle!

278
00:26:44,567 --> 00:26:46,433
Why are you making such a fuss this morning?

279
00:26:46,433 --> 00:26:51,667
A person who cooks food must have a heavy mouth and body.

280
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:55,533
Look at this. It's that madam.

281
00:26:55,533 --> 00:26:58,067
   

282
00:27:04,233 --> 00:27:06,067
Uncle, that's hot.

283
00:27:06,067 --> 00:27:08,233
Hand, hand! Uncle, your hand!

284
00:27:08,233 --> 00:27:09,733
Your hand!

285
00:27:09,733 --> 00:27:11,900
It's hot.

286
00:27:13,267 --> 00:27:15,700
Let's meet and talk for more details.

287
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,333
Ra Kyung, don't respond to anything.

288
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:20,367
 All right. 

289
00:27:20,367 --> 00:27:21,967
- Yes. 
  - Call me later. 

290
00:27:21,967 --> 00:27:23,967
Yeah.

291
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:44,033
I'm sorry.

292
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,933
It's me who did wrong.

293
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:50,367
It's all my fault.

294
00:27:50,367 --> 00:27:53,767
No matter what decision you make,

295
00:27:54,733 --> 00:27:57,633
I have nothing to say.

296
00:28:01,567 --> 00:28:06,890
If it's too hard for you, you can leave.

297
00:28:07,733 --> 00:28:09,580
All right.

298
00:28:10,267 --> 00:28:12,140
I'll leave.

299
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:25,067
Honestly, I haven't thought deeply

300
00:28:25,067 --> 00:28:28,100
about my relationship with you.

301
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,433
I don't even know what to do from now on.

302
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:36,633
For now, we need to catch Lee Se Na first.

303
00:28:37,733 --> 00:28:41,167
Mother has become like that

304
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:44,100
and I have no time to think about it.

305
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,033
I guess so.

306
00:28:48,067 --> 00:28:50,233
I'm sorry.

307
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,733
If you're sorry, come to your senses.

308
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,633
You have to protect your family first.

309
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:20,000
Yes.

310
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,600
I'll try anything.

311
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:27,067
 Sis, are you back? 

312
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:28,433
What's going on?

313
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,867
Why did you come together so suddenly?

314
00:29:30,867 --> 00:29:33,633
I heard my sister was released. Has she come home yet?

315
00:29:33,633 --> 00:29:35,400
She's on the second floor.

316
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,533
- On the second floor? 
 - Yes.

317
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,133
What is going on?

318
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:47,200
I know.

319
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,100
Well, it's more bearable than you think.

320
00:29:51,367 --> 00:29:54,067
I will find out who did this,

321
00:29:54,067 --> 00:29:57,633
and I will find them…

322
00:29:57,633 --> 00:30:00,100
And clear your false accusation…

323
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,633
Do you believe me?

324
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,200
Yes, of course.

325
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,367
Why do you believe me?

326
00:30:06,367 --> 00:30:08,600
Why?

327
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,767
There must be many people

328
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:15,833
who think that I am a human being who would have done that.

329
00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:22,100
You said...

330
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,800
all grass is poisonous. Right?

331
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,867
You said that they become so poisonous...

332
00:30:30,467 --> 00:30:33,433
just to protect themselves...

333
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:37,100
because they can't run away like animals.

334
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,000
I still remember the sad look...

335
00:30:42,467 --> 00:30:45,200
on your face as you said that.

336
00:30:45,733 --> 00:30:50,267
You are just the same.

337
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:53,333
You are just being poisonous...

338
00:30:55,467 --> 00:30:58,367
to protect yourself…

339
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,867
Talk to me now.

340
00:31:11,867 --> 00:31:13,133
Yes.

341
00:31:13,133 --> 00:31:16,200
I also came here right away after seeing the news.

342
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,100
As reported on the news,

343
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,633
she is at the police station now.

344
00:31:20,633 --> 00:31:22,867
Is it also true that she is a murder suspect?

345
00:31:22,867 --> 00:31:27,233
Murder? What do you mean?

346
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:31,800
Well, it wouldn't be too surprising

347
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,800
if she killed someone with her temper.

348
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,967
Aunt.

349
00:31:34,967 --> 00:31:37,267
No, I mean…

350
00:31:37,267 --> 00:31:38,433
That…

351
00:31:38,433 --> 00:31:41,433
It means she is that strong.

352
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:44,167
She didn't kill anyone.

353
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:46,900
I think someone deliberately framed her.

354
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,733
Who framed her?

355
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,033
There was someone who threatened our family recently.

356
00:31:54,033 --> 00:31:57,767
I think that person did that.

357
00:31:58,867 --> 00:32:02,167
Then, Lee Se Na did that?

358
00:32:02,167 --> 00:32:03,933
Lee… Lee Se Na?

359
00:32:03,933 --> 00:32:06,000
Oh my! Is that the Lee Se Na that Jae Jin had an affair with?

360
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,033
Aunt.

361
00:32:08,933 --> 00:32:10,433
Sorry.

362
00:32:10,433 --> 00:32:12,967
Anyway, even if it was that woman,

363
00:32:12,967 --> 00:32:14,967
Young Won should have killed her.

364
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:16,267
Why would she kill her?

365
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:20,667
Aunt, Mother didn't kill her.

366
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:26,767
It's not Lee Se Na who died.

367
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:28,467
It's Manager Ahn.

368
00:32:28,467 --> 00:32:30,133
Oh, Manager Ahn.

369
00:32:30,133 --> 00:32:31,500
His hair is always greasy,

370
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,933
and there was something fishy about him.

371
00:32:33,933 --> 00:32:35,267
Did you notice that?

372
00:32:35,267 --> 00:32:36,267
Yes.

373
00:32:36,267 --> 00:32:41,000
Anyway, she'll soon be cleared of this false accusation.

374
00:32:41,867 --> 00:32:44,767
Didn't Manager Ahn displease her?

375
00:32:44,767 --> 00:32:47,433
Are you sure it's a false accusation?

376
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:51,400
I trust my grandmother.

377
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,800
Grandaunt,

378
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,033
my grandmother is a very cool person.

379
00:32:55,033 --> 00:32:58,367
She's not the kind of person who kills someone just because she's annoyed.

380
00:32:58,367 --> 00:33:00,367
Do Hyun,

381
00:33:00,367 --> 00:33:03,533
that's not what I'm saying.

382
00:33:03,533 --> 00:33:06,833
Everyone, especially in times like these,

383
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:09,600
please trust each other more as a family.

384
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:21,300
Dr. Noh, the police are here…

385
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,333
The police?

386
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:33,767
Sister-in-law?

387
00:33:33,767 --> 00:33:36,833
She is a typical rich girl.

388
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:40,833
My elder brother, who pretends to be elegant all by himself,

389
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:43,333
is a really affectionate person.

390
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:46,767
Just seeing that he didn't only have affection for her…

391
00:33:46,767 --> 00:33:48,933
Did you know that my brother

392
00:33:48,933 --> 00:33:52,933
died exactly the same way as in her novel?

393
00:33:52,933 --> 00:33:56,533
Well, even if she killed him, there's nothing to say.

394
00:33:56,533 --> 00:33:58,367
Because he had a lot of affairs.

395
00:33:58,367 --> 00:34:00,400
To be honest, I felt relieved

396
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,933
To be honest, I felt relieved

397
00:34:02,933 --> 00:34:06,300
when she ignored my brother.

398
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:10,667
I actually admired her.

399
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,233
Sister-in-law…

400
00:34:14,233 --> 00:34:17,900
Is she doing well?

401
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,867
We weren't that close.

402
00:34:19,867 --> 00:34:21,800
Since she's my sister's mother-in-law…

403
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,433
Ah, most importantly, she introduced me to a small company

404
00:34:25,433 --> 00:34:28,533
that wasn't very good,

405
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,267
so my feelings were really hurt.

406
00:34:30,267 --> 00:34:31,933
Well,

407
00:34:31,933 --> 00:34:35,500
I have such an amazing business idea.

408
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,433
If you're interested, I'll explain it to you.

409
00:34:38,433 --> 00:34:41,200
Even though she has so much money, she didn't even invest in my business…

410
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,700
However, this doesn't mean I have a grudge against Mrs. Hong.

411
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,900
Even if she killed someone,

412
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,900
she's the type of person who would say, "Oh, I killed him."

413
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,600
Someone who might hold a grudge against her?

414
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,700
Oh, I guess there are some people like that.

415
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,000
Because Mrs. Hong is so cold.

416
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,533
That cold person really likes cold vegetables so much.

417
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:03,133
I'm sorry.

418
00:35:03,133 --> 00:35:04,700
By the way, do you know the word "tsundere"?

419
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,467
I guess I can say that Mrs. Hong is somewhat of that type of person.

420
00:35:07,467 --> 00:35:09,167
Even when my child was sick,

421
00:35:09,167 --> 00:35:13,500
she pretended not to know but paid all the hospital bills.

422
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:18,600
How could such a warm person…

423
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,667
Think of it as paid vacation and take a break for a while.

424
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:27,100
Yes, please contact me any time.

425
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,128
And this.

426
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,333
Thank you.

427
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:37,533
Oh, hello. Hello.

428
00:35:37,533 --> 00:35:40,700
I'll just go now.

429
00:35:45,133 --> 00:35:46,767
I didn't contact you in advance.

430
00:35:46,767 --> 00:35:48,800
No, it's okay, but…

431
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,667
I guess they're investigating.

432
00:35:50,667 --> 00:35:54,300
Wow, this is my first time seeing this.

433
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,967
By the way, are you all right?

434
00:35:56,967 --> 00:35:59,267
Do Hyun and even Mrs. Hong…

435
00:35:59,267 --> 00:36:03,667
I heard you already knew about Do Hyun's secret.

436
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:05,800
You should have told me in advance.

437
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,667
Oh, I'm sorry I offended you.

438
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:11,767
As you know, this is a bit difficult to talk about.

439
00:36:11,767 --> 00:36:14,533
So I don't think Do Hyun will be able to receive tutoring for a while.

440
00:36:14,533 --> 00:36:18,267
As you can see, there are family circumstances as well.

441
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,900
It must have been difficult for you to get here, but I'm sorry.

442
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,933
What? Just a moment.

443
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:25,700
I understand what you feel,

444
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,233
but wouldn't it be better for Do Hyun to stick to his routine at times like this?

445
00:36:29,233 --> 00:36:30,600
No.

446
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,267
In times like these, I think we need more family time.

447
00:36:35,267 --> 00:36:37,300
Senior.

448
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,700
Jae Jin. Jae Jin.

449
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,000
Dr. Noh said it would be better for me not to come to tutoring for a while.

450
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,533
I have nothing to say to you.

451
00:36:50,533 --> 00:36:51,533
Will you please go?

452
00:36:51,533 --> 00:36:53,600
What?

453
00:37:27,567 --> 00:37:29,700
Oh, thank you for your hard work.

454
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,967
I guess the investigation is over. Right?

455
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:35,667
Oh, I'm the tutor for this family's son.

456
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,567
Then, do you know about this family well?

457
00:37:39,567 --> 00:37:42,400
Have you noticed anything strange lately?

458
00:37:43,367 --> 00:37:45,833
Yes, actually…

459
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:49,867
I noticed something strange recently.

460
00:37:50,767 --> 00:37:53,767
Dr. Oh Ji Eun came out of

461
00:37:53,767 --> 00:37:57,833
Mrs. Hong's room crying a while ago.

462
00:37:57,833 --> 00:38:00,533
But honestly, what did a grown woman hear

463
00:38:00,533 --> 00:38:03,733
that made her cry like that…

464
00:38:03,733 --> 00:38:05,867
Ms. Oh Ji Eun?

465
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:06,867
Thank you.

466
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:09,167
- Yes. 
 - Thank you.

467
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:11,167
Have a good day.

468
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:24,633
 Yeah, I think she's capable of murder. 

469
00:38:25,767 --> 00:38:27,167
 She's a scary person. 

470
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:31,833
A person who can do whatever she wants.

471
00:38:33,933 --> 00:38:37,200
Mrs. Hong Sa Gang sponsored you, though.

472
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,767
Well, it was a sponsorship in name only,

473
00:38:40,767 --> 00:38:44,167
but she wanted me to do what the family needed.

474
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:46,800
What exactly does that mean?

475
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,967
She sent me to medical school to make her son a doctor.

476
00:38:51,967 --> 00:38:54,433
To get me to perform surgery on her son's behalf.

477
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:56,700
Are you saying you did whatever she asked?

478
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:02,067
I felt like she would kill me if I didn't do what she said.

479
00:39:02,067 --> 00:39:04,067
Ms. Oh Ji Eun,

480
00:39:04,067 --> 00:39:07,100
surrogate surgery is clearly illegal.

481
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,033
I didn't say I did it.

482
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,500
Anyway,

483
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:20,500
she would kill a person if it was for his son.

484
00:39:49,833 --> 00:39:52,733
What do you want to talk about?

485
00:39:52,733 --> 00:39:57,000
I think there's a bit of a problem with Tae Oh.

486
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,100
What?

487
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,000
He said something strange to Do Hyun.

488
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,700
 Tae Oh said that someone like Mom would never understand it. 

489
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,900
 He said that if my mother found out about this, she would turn away from me. 

490
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,567
So, I said something about it,

491
00:40:12,567 --> 00:40:14,700
and he got angry.

492
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,900
 Moon Tae Oh. 

493
00:40:19,133 --> 00:40:23,500
If I had known he would be like this, I wouldn't have brought him home.

494
00:40:24,667 --> 00:40:26,867
It's my fault.

495
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:31,767
Since he's your senior's son, you probably had no choice.

496
00:40:32,767 --> 00:40:35,600
Sorry, Young Won.

497
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,400
Tae Oh is not my senior's son.

498
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,100
Then?

499
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:44,933
I lied to reassure you because you don't like

500
00:40:44,933 --> 00:40:47,433
letting strangers into our house.

501
00:40:47,433 --> 00:40:49,933
Then, who is he?

502
00:40:50,567 --> 00:40:53,767
I've had psychiatric counseling.

503
00:40:55,267 --> 00:40:57,095
We first met at the hospital there.

504
00:40:57,095 --> 00:40:59,910
   

505
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:09,967
 Save me. Please help me. 

506
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,767
 It's not me. 

507
00:41:11,767 --> 00:41:13,767
 It's not me. 

508
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,133
 - Help me. 
 - It's not me. 

509
00:41:17,133 --> 00:41:19,300
 It's not me. 

510
00:41:20,867 --> 00:41:23,900
 No, it's not me. 

511
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,733
 Are you okay? 

512
00:41:29,733 --> 00:41:32,167
 You were startled. Right? 

513
00:41:36,467 --> 00:41:39,267
 You are Dr. Choi Jae Jin. Right? 

514
00:41:39,267 --> 00:41:41,200
 Yes. 

515
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,000
 I recognized you at once. 

516
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,860
 I've always admired you so much. 

517
00:41:46,633 --> 00:41:49,833
 Oh, I'm a medical student. 

518
00:41:49,833 --> 00:41:51,967
 Yes. 

519
00:41:52,967 --> 00:41:55,067
 Actually, 

520
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,233
 I was scared of seeing blood, too. 

521
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:07,333
At first, I was glad and surprised that

522
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:10,533
we had the same concerns.

523
00:42:11,133 --> 00:42:13,433
But now that I think about it,

524
00:42:13,433 --> 00:42:16,633
I think he knew all about my secret.

525
00:42:16,633 --> 00:42:21,267
Are you saying that he approached you intentionally?

526
00:42:25,233 --> 00:42:27,033
 That person was quite tall. 

527
00:42:27,033 --> 00:42:30,533
 My head was touching that person's chin. 

528
00:42:30,533 --> 00:42:35,433
 Do you know what the trick is with these locked-room cases in mystery novels? 

529
00:42:35,433 --> 00:42:40,533
 A murderer is a person who never comes under suspicion. 

530
00:42:47,767 --> 00:42:49,600
Yes, Officer Koo.

531
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,800
I came to Yangpyeong and am looking into it.

532
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,200
I guess they'll apply for a warrant tomorrow.

533
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,600
A warrant? That quickly?

534
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,167
The evidence at the scene is so clear that

535
00:43:03,167 --> 00:43:07,067
they're probably trying to send her to the prosecution quickly.

536
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,133
Please find out more about Moon Tae Oh.

537
00:43:18,133 --> 00:43:20,267
Yes, okay.

538
00:44:08,867 --> 00:44:10,967
Mother.

539
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:19,900
How do you like my personal color today?

540
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:24,600
I bought it because ocher color is not my style.

541
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,867
You did well.

542
00:44:28,867 --> 00:44:31,067
Please hold on a little longer.

543
00:44:31,067 --> 00:44:34,233
I'll definitely get you out of here.

544
00:44:35,267 --> 00:44:40,567
Your true personal color is in our house.

545
00:44:40,567 --> 00:44:44,267
I'm fine, so catch Lee Se Na first.

546
00:44:45,633 --> 00:44:51,100
It really hurts my pride that this happened to me.

547
00:44:55,933 --> 00:44:59,467
This isn't the end, Dr. Noh.

548
00:45:01,233 --> 00:45:04,567
What did you just say?

549
00:45:04,567 --> 00:45:05,700
What?

550
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,400
Did I get promoted?

551
00:45:10,633 --> 00:45:15,567
I'm asking you to take care of my family, Dr. Noh.

552
00:45:15,567 --> 00:45:20,567
I know you went there to protect our family on my behalf.

553
00:45:20,567 --> 00:45:25,767
I know that's your way of saying sorry.

554
00:45:29,633 --> 00:45:33,033
I think I understand your feelings a little bit now.

555
00:45:38,367 --> 00:45:41,400
Let's not get too emotional.

556
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,100
Yeah.

557
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:47,733
You and me, aren't we both cool-toned?

558
00:45:54,467 --> 00:45:56,667
 Mother, 

559
00:45:56,667 --> 00:45:59,467
 I'll definitely get you out of there. 

560
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,867
Excuse me, sir.

561
00:46:22,867 --> 00:46:25,633
Have you ever seen anyone coming in and out from the villa up there?

562
00:46:25,633 --> 00:46:27,433
No, I haven't.

563
00:46:27,433 --> 00:46:29,367
Sir.

564
00:46:29,367 --> 00:46:30,767
Hello.

565
00:46:30,767 --> 00:46:35,000
Have you ever seen anyone coming in and out from the villa up there?

566
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,500
Someone said he thought he saw a young man.

567
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,733
A young man?

568
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:47,233
Moon Tae Oh said he was doing volunteer work here.

569
00:46:47,233 --> 00:46:49,500
Young Min, please take care of it.

570
00:46:51,033 --> 00:46:52,800
But, Brother,

571
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,167
why would you ask a mentally healthy person like me to do this?

572
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:02,533
What I remember when I was little is that...

573
00:47:04,433 --> 00:47:08,233
my mom and dad only talked about my sister.

574
00:47:08,233 --> 00:47:12,367
No matter who came to my house, or who they met outside,

575
00:47:12,367 --> 00:47:15,167
they only talked about my sister.

576
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:17,200
I was so angry at that time,

577
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,767
but I couldn't say anything.

578
00:47:19,767 --> 00:47:22,967
So, as a kind of revenge,

579
00:47:22,967 --> 00:47:28,200
I turned over all the family photos in the house.

580
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,300
But do you know what's even sadder?

581
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,400
The thing is, no one noticed that.

582
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,867
That's fine.

583
00:47:40,867 --> 00:47:43,867
Say everything you want to say.

584
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,733
It's important for all of you to reveal

585
00:47:48,733 --> 00:47:51,833
what's deep inside your mind.

586
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:56,633
This time, the one who came with that person…

587
00:48:01,267 --> 00:48:03,300
Hello.

588
00:48:04,367 --> 00:48:08,500
I've been eating this since a while ago,

589
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:12,133
but I'm not just eating because I'm hungry.

590
00:48:12,133 --> 00:48:16,067
I always feel so empty.

591
00:48:16,067 --> 00:48:21,600
Is it because I didn't take anthelmintic?

592
00:48:24,667 --> 00:48:29,533
Oh, just in time, Mr. Moon came with some refreshments.

593
00:48:29,533 --> 00:48:31,833
Please come here and say hello.

594
00:48:31,833 --> 00:48:34,700
Mr. Moon Tae Oh.

595
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:37,300
Oh, yes.

596
00:48:44,767 --> 00:48:47,433
Moon Tae Oh, who attends Hankuk University, is a different person.

597
00:48:47,433 --> 00:48:50,200
He's not the Moon Tae Oh we know.

598
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,633
Could that person be the one who was in the villa that day?

599
00:48:52,633 --> 00:48:56,267
It's strange that Moon Tae Oh appeared in front of you at that moment,

600
00:48:56,267 --> 00:49:00,067
and the pattern and method of Lee Se Na

601
00:49:00,067 --> 00:49:02,600
approaching you intentionally is very similar.

602
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:07,000
Lee Se Na had a distorted mind about my family counseling.

603
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,900
I'll check if there were similar patients in the patient record.

604
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:13,233
So, Lee Se Na and Moon Tae Oh are on the same side?

605
00:49:14,167 --> 00:49:17,400
I'm sure those two are related.

606
00:49:19,233 --> 00:49:21,633
I'll find out about that.

607
00:49:21,633 --> 00:49:23,133
Wait, then…

608
00:49:23,133 --> 00:49:25,467
Could Do Hyun's tutoring have been part of Lee Se Na's plan?

609
00:49:25,467 --> 00:49:28,200
It's still not clear whether the two knew each other.

610
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,733
Let's go now.

611
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:31,267
Lee Se Na wasn't here, right?

612
00:49:31,267 --> 00:49:35,500
No, there's a boy I have to find.

613
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:38,200
If he approached me with the same purpose,

614
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,200
there would be a patient in a similar environment.

615
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:44,867
Maybe he was rejected by his parents or maybe it's a sibling issue.

616
00:49:44,867 --> 00:49:48,900
   

617
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:52,520
   

618
00:49:56,067 --> 00:49:58,233
 My son doesn't listen to me. 

619
00:49:58,233 --> 00:50:02,000
 He has bandages all over his body every day. 

620
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,467
 It seems like he's asking for attention. 

621
00:50:08,467 --> 00:50:11,667
 Didn't your husband come with you? 

622
00:50:12,333 --> 00:50:16,833
 He must have been told a pre-interview is important. 

623
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:19,133
 Because he is busy. 

624
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,167
 When a child behaves like this, 

625
00:50:28,167 --> 00:50:31,333
 there must be a problem in the family. 

626
00:50:31,333 --> 00:50:36,200
 Is there any violence in your home? 

627
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:38,400
 No, there isn't. 

628
00:50:40,067 --> 00:50:42,300
 Ji Hwan's mother. 

629
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:47,100
 Tolerating and enduring is not necessarily the solution. 

630
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,433
 I'll stop it. 

631
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,300
 Doctor, 

632
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,167
 this isn't going to be aired. Right? 

633
00:50:55,167 --> 00:50:56,867
 This should never be aired. 

634
00:50:56,867 --> 00:51:01,933
 You probably know what the biggest problem in your home is right now. 

635
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:04,560
 You need to get rid of that. 

636
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:09,900
 If the parents don't change, the child won't change. 

637
00:51:13,167 --> 00:51:17,067
Ra Kyung, do you remember this kid?

638
00:51:17,067 --> 00:51:19,267
Oh Ji Hwan?

639
00:51:19,267 --> 00:51:21,367
A child whose father had problems?

640
00:51:21,367 --> 00:51:24,633
Can you find out how Oh Ji Hwan is doing now?

641
00:51:24,633 --> 00:51:28,433
I think his eyes are bigger.

642
00:51:28,433 --> 00:51:31,433
He has a sharp nose.

643
00:51:31,433 --> 00:51:32,733
He wears glasses. Right?

644
00:51:32,733 --> 00:51:34,767
Yes.

645
00:51:34,767 --> 00:51:36,800
Because I haven't eaten anything…

646
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,467
You ate before you came, but why are you saying that?

647
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:43,367
Forget it.

648
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:52,633
That witch came here to do volunteer work?

649
00:51:52,633 --> 00:51:54,533
 Oh, it's Francesca. 

650
00:51:54,533 --> 00:51:57,733
 - Hello. 
 - Hello. 

651
00:51:57,733 --> 00:52:00,433
 I missed you. 

652
00:52:00,433 --> 00:52:03,333
 Thank you. 

653
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,433
It's so ironic.

654
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,667
Hello.

655
00:52:11,667 --> 00:52:12,767
Hello, sister.

656
00:52:12,767 --> 00:52:13,900
Hello.

657
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:17,100
I came here with Se Na…

658
00:52:18,033 --> 00:52:20,100
I came here with Francesca before.

659
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,600
Yes.

660
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,433
Have you seen Francesca lately?

661
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:28,233
She stayed for a few days and left yesterday.

662
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,667
Can I talk to you for a moment?

663
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,967
Do you know who this woman is?

664
00:52:34,967 --> 00:52:37,567
Oh? It's Francesca.

665
00:52:37,567 --> 00:52:38,967
Francesca?

666
00:52:38,967 --> 00:52:41,267
Is… Is this woman nice to you?

667
00:52:41,267 --> 00:52:44,967
Yes, I like her the best.

668
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,967
Oh, I see.

669
00:52:47,967 --> 00:52:50,533
I like Uncle Thomas better.

670
00:52:50,533 --> 00:52:52,000
Uncle Thomas?

671
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,200
Who is that?

672
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:02,900
This is Uncle Thomas.

673
00:53:04,133 --> 00:53:05,200
I'm sorry.

674
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,233
Look at this.

675
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,067
Sister,

676
00:53:11,067 --> 00:53:13,567
do you know who this person is?

677
00:53:13,567 --> 00:53:17,067
This is Thomas. What's wrong with him?

678
00:53:17,067 --> 00:53:21,000
Oh, Thomas grew up here, too?

679
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,933
Yes.

680
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:27,100
Sister, no matter how much you love everyone,

681
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:30,067
- you must be very careful. 
 - Young Min.

682
00:53:34,333 --> 00:53:38,467
What is Thomas' real name?

683
00:53:38,467 --> 00:53:39,500
Yes.

684
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,000
 They knew each other. 

685
00:53:43,167 --> 00:53:46,100
And I also found out Moon Tae Oh's real name.

686
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,267
It's Oh Tae Hwan.

687
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,267
Isn't it Oh Ji Hwan?

688
00:53:51,267 --> 00:53:53,333
I'll be there quickly.

689
00:53:54,633 --> 00:53:56,467
 Oh, sorry. 

690
00:53:56,467 --> 00:53:58,567
 Why… 

691
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,333
 He was his twin brother. 

692
00:54:03,333 --> 00:54:05,867
 It's not Oh Ji Hwan, 

693
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,667
 but it's Oh Tae Hwan. 

694
00:54:16,467 --> 00:54:19,690
   

695
00:54:31,667 --> 00:54:32,800
Who?

696
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,500
 He was the guy who came with you once before, 

697
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,700
 and he was looking for you. 

698
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:41,600
 Francesca, what's going on? 

699
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:45,733
 Those guys seem to know Thomas, too. 

700
00:54:45,733 --> 00:54:49,667
Sister, I'll call you again.

701
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:03,467
Wow, her expression is so funny.

702
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:06,233
This needs to be captured.

703
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:14,200
How does it feel to have things go your way?

704
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,733
Isn't this more fun?

705
00:55:20,733 --> 00:55:22,267
Is that fun?

706
00:55:22,267 --> 00:55:25,367
Yeah, look at Noh Young Won's face.

707
00:55:25,367 --> 00:55:27,067
This is better.

708
00:55:27,067 --> 00:55:31,200
Noh Young Won also has to feel the pain of her family being destroyed.

709
00:55:34,267 --> 00:55:36,400
I think you should go away for a while.

710
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,500
Wouldn't it be dangerous since Hong Sa Gang was framed

711
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,000
for murder as you wanted?

712
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,933
Why?

713
00:55:42,933 --> 00:55:44,600
Noh Young Won wouldn't even think that I was the culprit?

714
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,133
Of course, she'll think you did it.

715
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,900
So what?

716
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,533
You recently act flippantly.

717
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,500
You know that if it weren't for me,

718
00:55:56,500 --> 00:56:01,300
you wouldn't have even dreamed of revenge. Right?

719
00:56:02,667 --> 00:56:07,633
I'm the one who brought you and helped you.

720
00:56:13,933 --> 00:56:16,800
We have to go until the end.

721
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,033
Don't you think so?

722
00:56:20,367 --> 00:56:23,567
 A mother who wants to feed her child at least one meal, 

723
00:56:23,567 --> 00:56:26,000
 - her intentions are definitely good. 
 - Yes. 

724
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,700
 But at that time, your son said he wouldn't eat it. 

725
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:30,867
 Yes. 

726
00:56:30,867 --> 00:56:33,400
 In the relationship between couples, parents, and children, 

727
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,700
 is there any love… 

728
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:44,433
 Will it be revenge if you do that? 

729
00:56:50,333 --> 00:56:53,633
 If you want revenge, 

730
00:56:53,633 --> 00:56:56,967
 you need a new life. 

731
00:57:07,733 --> 00:57:09,333
 This is your new life. 

732
00:57:09,333 --> 00:57:11,367
 Really? 

733
00:57:15,633 --> 00:57:17,933
 Is this all mine? 

734
00:57:33,767 --> 00:57:38,633
 Now you are born again. 

735
00:57:46,133 --> 00:57:50,467
 But will it happen as you say? 

736
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:54,267
 The woman and her family don't seem to be easy to deal with. 

737
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:20,433
All right.

738
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,400
One ticket to Hoengseong.

739
00:59:12,567 --> 00:59:14,100
 You were right. 

740
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:16,533
 My mom doesn't acknowledge me. 

741
00:59:16,533 --> 00:59:19,400
 Come here and save me. 

742
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:29,000
   

743
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,200
It's Tae Oh.

744
00:59:32,967 --> 00:59:36,667
Mom, should I pick up the phone and completely fool him?

745
00:59:36,667 --> 00:59:38,900
He might get suspicious and not come.

746
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:42,333
You can't do that. You must not be directly involved.

747
00:59:42,333 --> 00:59:44,900
Yeah, he's right.

748
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,067
Am I right?

749
00:59:46,067 --> 00:59:49,300
It's been a while since you said I was right.

750
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:52,500
He'll come just out of curiosity

751
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:55,067
because he believes he's gaslighting you.

752
00:59:55,067 --> 00:59:57,633
Yeah, let's wait a little bit.

753
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:01,467
Yes, this is Gangnam police station.

754
01:00:01,467 --> 01:00:03,500
Yes.

755
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,633
The real culprit?

756
01:00:06,633 --> 01:00:08,833
- Yes, please give me the address. 
 - What is it?

757
01:00:08,833 --> 01:00:10,833
Yes.

758
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:12,800
What is it?

759
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:16,367
He is saying that he is the real culprit of the Yangpyeong villa murder case.

760
01:00:16,367 --> 01:00:17,967
Hello.

761
01:00:17,967 --> 01:00:20,133
Hello.

762
01:00:22,933 --> 01:00:24,720
   

763
01:00:26,733 --> 01:00:28,033
Follow me closely.

764
01:00:28,033 --> 01:00:30,233
You go first.

765
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:55,900
   

766
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,200
Hello.

767
01:01:38,167 --> 01:01:40,567
- You're here. 
 - Yes.

768
01:01:40,567 --> 01:01:42,733
Where's Do Hyun?

769
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:49,567
The one who is from Yangju cathedral orphanage.

770
01:01:49,567 --> 01:01:52,967
The one who impersonated Moon Tae Oh from Hankuk University.

771
01:01:52,967 --> 01:01:56,000
The one who is Oh Ji Hwan's twin brother.

772
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,200
Oh Tae Hwan.

773
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:05,300
Since when have you known Lee Se Na?

774
01:02:14,033 --> 01:02:18,133
   

775
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:28,060

776
01:02:45,133 --> 01:02:47,367
 It's a mistake to think it was because of me. 

777
01:02:47,367 --> 01:02:51,567
 That's why we want you to break down. 

778
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:53,133
 A family? 

779
01:02:53,133 --> 01:02:56,100
 Please stop saying family. 

780
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:59,267
 It's enough for me to have endured for those people so far. 

781
01:02:59,267 --> 01:03:01,767
 You have that weapon. 

782
01:03:01,767 --> 01:03:04,067
 There is no sender. 

783
01:03:04,067 --> 01:03:07,867
 We have to catch them before they run away. 

784
01:03:09,133 --> 01:03:12,333
 You should have listened to me. 

785
01:03:12,333 --> 01:03:15,067
 Now you have to be freed.
