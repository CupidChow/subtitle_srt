1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,133
   

2
00:00:03,133 --> 00:00:05,933
 Lee Se Na, she's Choi Jae Jin's mistress. 

3
00:00:05,933 --> 00:00:10,333
 To be honest, my cheating husband may have died with that woman. 

4
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:13,867
 Should I just feel sad and sorry for him? 

5
00:00:13,867 --> 00:00:18,133
 Se Na, I think I can be truly happy now. 

6
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:19,733
 Was it all a play? 

7
00:00:19,733 --> 00:00:21,167
 We got caught. 

8
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:22,467
 So, go back home now. 

9
00:00:22,467 --> 00:00:25,633
 We can't just run away forever. 

10
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:27,833
 You, my life, 

11
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:31,500
 and even our marriage were all planned by my mother. 

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,900
 We are not the family you think. 

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,633
 That's amazing. 

14
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:38,133
 I thought he couldn't do it. 

15
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:40,767
 With this camera, Lee Se Na was watching the whole house. 

16
00:00:40,767 --> 00:00:43,367
 There is an assistant to Lee Se Na in this house? 

17
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:47,633
 Jae Jin said that nothing would be possible without you. 

18
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:50,733
 Do you know everything about Do Hyun? 

19
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:52,367
 I'm pregnant. 

20
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:55,200
 Do Hyun's baby. 

21
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,333
 When did he… 

22
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:00,233
 Don't you think he needs his dad in this situation? 

23
00:01:00,233 --> 00:01:02,133
 Dad, will you take my side? 

24
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:05,733
 I'll support your decision. 

25
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:06,933
 Thank you, Mom. 

26
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:10,767
 There was a fire incident in Gangneung 14 years ago that killed a family. 

27
00:01:10,767 --> 00:01:12,733
 The one who died in the fire was the eldest daughter. 

28
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:14,900
 But I heard there was survivor. 

29
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,567
 Oh, that's right. 

30
00:01:16,567 --> 00:01:18,167
 Her name is Lee Se Na… 

31
00:01:18,167 --> 00:01:22,900
 Why do all your family members die like that? 

32
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,133
 The game becomes more fun from now on. 

33
00:01:25,133 --> 00:01:28,933
 Lee Se Na wasn't the only survivor. 

34
00:01:28,933 --> 00:01:31,400
 Her elder sister was alive. 

35
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:42,700
 Sister Maria, someone came to see you. 

36
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:55,200
 Are you Lee Se Eun? 

37
00:01:56,467 --> 00:01:59,933
 Se Eun is dead. 

38
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,900
 It started with a pigeon. 

39
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,633
 Se Na. 

40
00:02:24,267 --> 00:02:27,133
 Se Eun, isn't the pigeon cute? 

41
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:31,833
 Yes, I'll go in first. 

42
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,900
 Yes. 

43
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:50,167
 Se Na. 

44
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:05,100
She said there was only one reason.

45
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,033
Se Eun said her sister killed the pigeons because she hated them.

46
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:10,000
As her obsession with Se Eun grew,

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,800
her actions became increasingly more frightening.

48
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,933
And then the fire broke out that day.

49
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,067
 Se Eun, wake up. 

50
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:24,600
 Why? 

51
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,367
 Mom. 

52
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,233
 It's all over, Se Eun. 

53
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:32,433
 You… 

54
00:03:32,433 --> 00:03:36,833
 If it weren't for Dad and Mom, you would've liked me too. 

55
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,233
 Let me go. 

56
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:41,533
 Let me go! 

57
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:47,200
 Mom. 

58
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,733
 Mom! 

59
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:06,333
That was all Se Eun remembered.

60
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:10,267
And then Se Eun, who was thought to be dead, miraculously woke up.

61
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:14,300
Then, she never told her younger sister about it.

62
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,200
Yes.

63
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,200
She lived here hiding like a dead person.

64
00:04:24,967 --> 00:04:29,033
Then when Se Eun…

65
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:32,600
She had severe post-traumatic stress.

66
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,367
She couldn't last a few more years due to complications.

67
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:46,280
   

68
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:15,567
Doesn't she really look like her?

69
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:24,200
 But there was... 

70
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,633
 a fire that day. 

71
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:31,667
 You've worked hard. 

72
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:34,300
Thank you.

73
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:38,667
Lee Se Na will be really surprised.

74
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:40,633
But will she really come here?

75
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:44,767
Because her elder sister is Lee Se Na's only weakness.

76
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:47,300
I'm sure she will show up.

77
00:05:56,633 --> 00:05:58,900
She came. It's her. Right?

78
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,000
That's right.

79
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:21,700
   

80
00:06:22,867 --> 00:06:25,200
It's all a lie.

81
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,767
Your sister is dead.

82
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,033
Oh? Wait…

83
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,933
Sis!

84
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,900
Are you all right?

85
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:45,733
Did you catch it all on camera?

86
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:47,800
Yes, it was captured well on camera.

87
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,133
Yes, it was filmed very realistically, even the way she strangled you.

88
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,567
Are you all right?

89
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:00,067
- Look for Lee Se Na first. 
 - Yes.

90
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:03,100
Are you okay? Someone, help!

91
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:09,767
- Are you okay? 
 - Are you okay?

92
00:07:41,967 --> 00:07:44,600
Excuse me, I'll pass by.

93
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:55,600
Oh? She…

94
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:26,833
What are you doing? Let me go!

95
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,833
Let me go!

96
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:32,100
Let me go!

97
00:08:59,933 --> 00:09:05,700
You were the one who sent the threatening package to Dr. Noh Young Won. Right?

98
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,100
Do you have any evidence?

99
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:20,600
It was all caught on camera.

100
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,300
The scene where you threatened Dr. Noh Young Won.

101
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,733
Just by looking at this, it becomes clear what you think of Dr. Noh Young Won.

102
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,200
Officer,

103
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,367
do you know the relationship between me and her husband?

104
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:40,567
Oh, you already know about it.

105
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,000
So, you're saying that's why you did that?

106
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,100
Just think about it.

107
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,633
How much would she hate me from her perspective?

108
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:52,967
 That's why she said my sister was alive just to tease me. 

109
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:56,233
 That's why she said my sister was alive just to tease me. 

110
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:58,700
 Because she knows... 

111
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:03,533
how much I miss my sister.

112
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:07,767
But she said my sister died.

113
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:10,967
 She said it was a lie that my sister was alive. 

114
00:10:11,967 --> 00:10:14,833
So, I got angry

115
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,667
without realizing it earlier…

116
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,070
Then why did you install a hidden camera in Noh Young Won's house?

117
00:10:29,033 --> 00:10:31,600
That's a clear stalking crime.

118
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,100
Do you have any evidence?

119
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,133
Why does everyone only believe what she says?

120
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:41,600
Isn't it wrong for police officers to only believe what powerful people say?

121
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,500
I'm not that kind of police officer.

122
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,733
Then, what about the fire that happened in your house before?

123
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:58,800
You know that being so agitated...

124
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:05,367
by those words is quite suspicious. Right?

125
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:14,033
I lost my whole family...

126
00:11:15,067 --> 00:11:17,967
in that fire.

127
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:24,067
 Do you know the pain and suffering of being the only survivor? 

128
00:11:24,067 --> 00:11:26,200
 Am I suspicious? 

129
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,867
 Why? Because I'm the only one who survived? 

130
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,633
If you suspect that I killed them,

131
00:11:37,633 --> 00:11:40,033
please investigate.

132
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,067
Because I also really want to resolve this injustice.

133
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:00,967
It's not easy.

134
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:03,467
I knew she wouldn't admit it easily.

135
00:12:03,467 --> 00:12:07,600
You can apply for a warrant based on the recorded video.

136
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,733
But I'm worried the intimidation charge may be dismissed

137
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:13,400
due to insufficient evidence.

138
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,433
But I'll try to secure as much evidence as possible within 48 hours.

139
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:24,033
Can I see her now?

140
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:34,633
Did you use my sister to catch me?

141
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:38,767
Because I thought you would show up because you were scared.

142
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:42,700
What am I afraid of?

143
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,733
You might have thought she died in the accident,

144
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:50,267
but she was alive.

145
00:12:51,367 --> 00:12:54,200
You did this because you loved your sister,

146
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,867
but your family despised you.

147
00:12:56,867 --> 00:13:00,433
So you must have been very hurt and had a hard time.

148
00:13:00,433 --> 00:13:02,033
Yeah.

149
00:13:02,033 --> 00:13:05,200
I'll try to understand the resentment and anger

150
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,233
you may have felt towards your family.

151
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:11,500
But why do you want my family to be ruined?

152
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,833
I don't want your family to be ruined.

153
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:18,433
I was just letting you know that your family was already ruined.

154
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:21,167
I was just curious.

155
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,867
Would you be able to talk about someone else's family so easily

156
00:13:24,867 --> 00:13:30,967
even after knowing the ugly truth about your own?

157
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:34,200
Usually, normal people raise issues

158
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,733
and discuss them in such cases.

159
00:13:38,633 --> 00:13:41,500
They don't do things like this.

160
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,233
Are you a normal person?

161
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:49,933
You told people not to hide their family problems,

162
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:54,700
but you yourself tried to cover them up.

163
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:00,600
You said that in such cases, even if they are family, you have to cut them off.

164
00:14:05,767 --> 00:14:08,333
If you're so confident,

165
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:11,567
does that mean it's okay for people to know the truth?

166
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:18,200
I'll get you quarantined and treated

167
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,367
before everyone finds out what you've done.

168
00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:27,333
Because you have antisocial personality disorder.

169
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:44,900
Have you met Koo Kyung Tae, who became a police official after 15 years?

170
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:49,600
Yes, thanks to him, I was able to see the CCTV in front of your house.

171
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,533
You said that was seven days ago. Right?

172
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:57,833
Dr. Noh said she received the book seven days ago in the afternoon.

173
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:02,533
That means it was already in the mailbox.

174
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:07,567
There was no footage of anyone putting anything in the mailbox that day.

175
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:12,767
Just in case, I looked through the previous day and the day before that,

176
00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:14,300
but it wasn't there, either.

177
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,700
That's weird.

178
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,700
She clearly said it was in the mailbox…

179
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:23,667
So what about the footage where something is taken out?

180
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:25,400
That was weird.

181
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,433
There was no footage of anyone putting something in,

182
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:31,800
but there was also no footage of anyone taking something out.

183
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,300
No one took it out…

184
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,633
But why did Manager Ahn lie and say it was in the mailbox?

185
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,270
   

186
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,700
    
 We must secure as much evidence as possible within 48 hours and apply.

187
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,267
I brought everything that came by courier,

188
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:10,267
including pigeon models, miniature villas, and car models.

189
00:16:10,267 --> 00:16:14,300
Seriously, why on earth is Lee Se Na doing this?

190
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:19,200
I guess she felt like I was blaming her family.

191
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,400
Her family was ruined by herself, and now she's blaming you?

192
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:27,933
When someone who she wanted to be loved by tried to leave her,

193
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:31,300
she tried to get rid of them first.

194
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,500
She's really scary.

195
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,333
Is there any more evidence that can be provided?

196
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,467
It would be nice to have someone to testify,

197
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:43,400
but since everyone around Lee Se Na is dead,

198
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,467
there is no one who can tell.

199
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:51,600
Lee Se Na is in the police station.

200
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,367
I need your help to punish her.

201
00:16:56,033 --> 00:16:58,767
What can I do?

202
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:02,267
Please testify that it was Lee Se Na

203
00:17:02,267 --> 00:17:04,333
who hit you at the villa that day.

204
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,567
If my family is to get away from Lee Se Na, we need a lot of evidence…

205
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:09,700
Hold on!

206
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:14,700
Dr. Noh,

207
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,200
why should I do that?

208
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,233
What do you mean?

209
00:17:20,233 --> 00:17:23,467
You also suffered from Lee Se Na, and you are a victim.

210
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:26,067
That's not it!

211
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,867
You're trying to use me to save your family.

212
00:17:29,867 --> 00:17:32,267
Am I the one who has to do anything for your family?

213
00:17:32,267 --> 00:17:35,233
I've lost everything I have to that family.

214
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:48,033
I understand how you feel...

215
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:51,533
about my family.

216
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:54,067
But...

217
00:17:54,067 --> 00:17:57,470
we really need your testimony now.

218
00:17:58,633 --> 00:18:00,767
Leave your family.

219
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,433
Then I'll testify.

220
00:18:04,433 --> 00:18:07,133
You can't do that. Right?

221
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,033
He is most likely the culprit…

222
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:29,400
As expected…

223
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,500
Madam, I brought you the items you mentioned.

224
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,633
Oh, thank you.

225
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:39,433
Put it over there.

226
00:18:39,433 --> 00:18:42,267
Manager Ahn, say hello to him.

227
00:18:42,267 --> 00:18:46,333
Manager Park, who assisted my father.

228
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,100
Hello, nice to meet you. I'm Park Kang Seong.

229
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,500
Yes, I'm Ahn Yo Seop.

230
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,300
When did you first come to my house?

231
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,533
It was 15 years ago.

232
00:18:57,533 --> 00:19:00,100
Wow, if he worked for 15 years,

233
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,667
he must be like family to you.

234
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:07,133
You've been working for my family for 30 years. Right?

235
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:09,133
To be exact, it's been 29 years and 5 months.

236
00:19:09,133 --> 00:19:10,433
It hasn't been 30 years.

237
00:19:10,433 --> 00:19:12,600
I heard he's retired,

238
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,367
but I ran into him recently.

239
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:20,033
Thank you so much for inviting me.

240
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,700
Yes, then I'll go.

241
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,080
Manager Ahn, sit here for a moment.

242
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,540
Have a seat.

243
00:19:31,267 --> 00:19:33,367
Sit comfortably.

244
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:35,767
Now, let's have a drink.

245
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:40,433
Looking at you reminds me of my younger days.

246
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,900
You'll find out about various circumstances and secrets in this family.

247
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,567
So people like us need to be quiet,

248
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:59,033
and we need to be loyal as well.

249
00:19:59,033 --> 00:20:01,233
- Don't you think so? 
 - Yes.

250
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,167
Oh, Manager Ahn.

251
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:06,333
I'm trying to get something out of the car,

252
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:10,000
so give me your keys. I don't have my keys.

253
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,600
- I'll just go. 
 - No, no.

254
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,833
Just give me the remote control key. I'll go and get it.

255
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,233
Just continue the conversation.

256
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:23,633
What are you doing? Give it to her quickly.

257
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,900
Here.

258
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,433
Let's have a drink.

259
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:37,367
 It's a day that will never come again. 

260
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,433
I really wanted to show this to you.

261
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,000
And Dr. Noh, I checked all the CCTV cameras in front of the house,

262
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,733
and Manager Ahn never took

263
00:21:53,733 --> 00:21:58,433
anything out of the mailbox on the day Dr. Noh received the book.

264
00:21:58,433 --> 00:22:02,600
Nothing was ever delivered in the mailbox.

265
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,800
So, this hidden camera was clearly done by Manager Ahn.

266
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,100
How could he do that to us?

267
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:13,533
How can he repay the favor we did for him in this way?

268
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:18,833
I was about to send him to jail right away, but I held back.

269
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:23,200
The important thing is whether Manager Ahn will testify for us.

270
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,867
He was gaslighted, so he won't testify for us easily.

271
00:22:27,867 --> 00:22:29,767
We should make him testify.

272
00:22:29,767 --> 00:22:33,500
You said you need clear evidence by tomorrow.

273
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:39,300
Now that you saw it, you know the truth. Right?

274
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:43,200
Go to the police station tomorrow and testify.

275
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:51,033
Dr. Choi,

276
00:22:51,033 --> 00:22:54,067
now we have to get back to our place.

277
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,067
Madam, I didn't get my car keys yesterday.

278
00:23:29,267 --> 00:23:31,967
- This? 
 - Yes.

279
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,300
Have a seat.

280
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:48,500
You've been working for us for 15 years.

281
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:54,033
15 years is enough to say we know everything there is to know. Right?

282
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:54,967
Yes.

283
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:57,833
Well then, can you do me a favor?

284
00:23:57,833 --> 00:24:01,433
Yes, but what kind of favor would it be?

285
00:24:05,167 --> 00:24:07,867
You can't reach Lee Se Na. Right?

286
00:24:10,467 --> 00:24:13,367
She's in the police station.

287
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:18,600
And we know what kind of relationship you two have.

288
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,900
We thought of you as family and trusted you.

289
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,733
Why did you do that to us?

290
00:24:35,633 --> 00:24:38,067
You don't know

291
00:24:38,067 --> 00:24:43,267
how much our Se Na has been hurt by this family.

292
00:24:43,267 --> 00:24:45,067
That's all a lie.

293
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:49,667
You've been gaslighted by her.

294
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:51,967
No way.

295
00:24:56,467 --> 00:24:59,500
Take a look and judge for yourself.

296
00:25:04,867 --> 00:25:07,200
   

297
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,233
   

298
00:25:08,233 --> 00:25:10,600
   

299
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,333
   

300
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:18,000
   

301
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,333
Manager Ahn,

302
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,567
please help Lee Se Na live a normal life.

303
00:25:30,567 --> 00:25:32,533
If you really care for her,

304
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:35,933
just state the truth.

305
00:25:44,067 --> 00:25:47,650
   

306
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,033
This is really for Se Na. Right?

307
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,633
 Your role is important in obtaining statements. 

308
00:26:10,633 --> 00:26:11,667
 - You got it? 
 - Yes. 

309
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:14,067
 You got it. Right? 

310
00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:16,100
How have you been?

311
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,400
Please take Mr. Ahn Yo Seop inside first.

312
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,500
Let's go.

313
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:26,867
Well… Don't worry.

314
00:26:26,867 --> 00:26:31,667
As long as Ahn Yo Seop testifies, a warrant will be issued quickly.

315
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:33,967
Police officer, Koo Kyung Tae.

316
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,400
Yes.

317
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,567
There's someone I need to meet before then.

318
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,167
You are so cheeky.

319
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:53,433
How could you betray me like this, who trusted you back then?

320
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,133
Did you trust me?

321
00:26:56,133 --> 00:27:00,400
Why did you take my money if you didn't want to break up with Jae Jin?

322
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,367
Don't you even know what a deal is?

323
00:27:12,267 --> 00:27:14,100
I told you then.

324
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:19,567
Motherhood is so beautiful and yet sad.

325
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:23,767
So, I wanted to let you know that

326
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,820
motherhood is of no use.

327
00:27:27,567 --> 00:27:30,470
You're completely out of your mind.

328
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,833
What about your family?

329
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:36,833
Is there anyone in your family who isn't crazy?

330
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:39,767
Since you've been targeting my family for so long,

331
00:27:39,767 --> 00:27:43,970
you probably know me well.

332
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,500
Do you think I'm mentally sane?

333
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,433
That's why I'm telling you,

334
00:27:49,433 --> 00:27:51,467
I think it would be better for me

335
00:27:51,467 --> 00:27:54,610
to deal with crazy people like you from now on.

336
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,200
Did you know Ahn Yo Seop was caught?

337
00:28:04,467 --> 00:28:06,567
Now everything will be revealed,

338
00:28:06,567 --> 00:28:11,000
so let's see how long you can be this shameless.

339
00:28:25,367 --> 00:28:29,200
Jae Jin will come to testify soon, too.

340
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,833
Oh Ji Eun is the victim. Right?

341
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:34,867
Wouldn't Dr. Oh be of some help to us?

342
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:38,280
Dr. Oh refused to testify.

343
00:28:38,933 --> 00:28:42,400
Why is she so…

344
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,233
They drive me crazy.

345
00:28:45,233 --> 00:28:46,933
It doesn't matter.

346
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:50,900
Manager Ahn just has to testify truthfully.

347
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,000
But...

348
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:58,133
there's not much left until the 48 hours are up…

349
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,900
Yes.

350
00:29:10,967 --> 00:29:14,700
What is your relationship with Lee Se Na?

351
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,733
We were lovers.

352
00:29:16,733 --> 00:29:19,233
Have you ever installed

353
00:29:19,233 --> 00:29:23,500
a hidden camera in Dr. Noh Young Won's house?

354
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,500
Yes.

355
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,000
Is it true that Lee Se Na

356
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,267
was the one who asked you to do that?

357
00:29:50,967 --> 00:29:53,500
Mr. Ahn,

358
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,867
if you make a false statement here, you'll be in big trouble.

359
00:29:57,867 --> 00:30:00,167
Did someone tell you to install

360
00:30:00,167 --> 00:30:04,767
a hidden camera in Noh Young Won's house?

361
00:30:04,767 --> 00:30:06,967
Who did that?

362
00:30:29,633 --> 00:30:31,933
I did it.

363
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:37,300
I did it all by myself.

364
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,467
Se Na doesn't know anything about this.

365
00:31:01,967 --> 00:31:04,067
Mrs. Hong.

366
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:12,967
Please take her out.

367
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:42,167
Here it is.

368
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:48,100
I was trying to get at least a bodily harm charge…

369
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,700
So what happens now?

370
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,400
I'm sorry.

371
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:57,100
We can't keep Lee Se Na in detention any longer.

372
00:32:07,933 --> 00:32:10,367
 I'm at your hospital right now. Could you come right away? 

373
00:32:10,367 --> 00:32:12,600
 It's urgent. 

374
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,367
Are you here to set me free? Or are you here to put me in jail?

375
00:32:41,433 --> 00:32:44,267
You are here to put me in jail. Right?

376
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,200
Then, what should you do? You're a little late.

377
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,833
Lee Se Na,

378
00:32:51,833 --> 00:32:56,300
did you really take advantage of me?

379
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,400
Was everything up until now a lie?

380
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,300
Does that matter now?

381
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:05,200
Isn't the important thing that I helped you realize

382
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,833
what you want in life?

383
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,200
That's ridiculous.

384
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,933
You came here to throw me in jail, but now

385
00:33:14,933 --> 00:33:18,567
you want to know what my true feelings were?

386
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,967
No matter how you've been with me,

387
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,600
it doesn't matter anymore.

388
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,400
However,

389
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,833
I can't tolerate you threatening my family.

390
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:33,833
It's also a lie that Ji Eun attacked you first at the villa that day. Right?

391
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:37,270
I'll tell the police that you assaulted Ji Eun.

392
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,200
Oh Ji Eun?

393
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,467
No, that's what you did.

394
00:33:43,467 --> 00:33:45,933
Don't you remember?

395
00:33:48,033 --> 00:33:52,933
I guess your memory is wrong because you were so panicked to see blood that day.

396
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:56,500
Lee Se Na.

397
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,067
However, do you know?

398
00:34:02,067 --> 00:34:05,133
Even if they investigate me, I never did anything against the law.

399
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:08,167
Your family will be in trouble with the law more than me.

400
00:34:23,033 --> 00:34:24,567
Hello.

401
00:34:24,567 --> 00:34:26,900
Yeah.

402
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,233
Why did you guys suddenly come here?

403
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,633
Mom, you clearly gave permission back then. Right?

404
00:34:32,633 --> 00:34:34,133
Because Soyee still doesn't believe me.

405
00:34:34,133 --> 00:34:37,767
Yeah, I decided to support both of you.

406
00:34:37,767 --> 00:34:39,700
But, why are you asking?

407
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,833
See?

408
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:44,767
Then, when will you send us to study abroad?

409
00:34:44,767 --> 00:34:49,133
Instead, I hope you give birth to your baby in Korea.

410
00:34:49,133 --> 00:34:51,200
It's definitely not easy for you, who are minors,

411
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,533
to go study abroad, have children and raise them.

412
00:34:54,533 --> 00:34:56,000
You said you'd support us.

413
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,233
Why do you suddenly change your words?

414
00:34:57,233 --> 00:34:58,400
He's right.

415
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,300
We decided to go study abroad and have a baby.

416
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:04,667
Isn't the important thing to have a healthy baby first?

417
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:08,100
You can think about studying abroad later.

418
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:12,633
Is studying abroad more important than having a baby?

419
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,233
Sis!

420
00:35:19,233 --> 00:35:22,567
Has it been resolved?

421
00:35:22,567 --> 00:35:25,900
Oh, Do Hyun is here too.

422
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,900
Oh, it's been a while.

423
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:33,433
Your girlfriend?

424
00:35:33,433 --> 00:35:35,933
I don't even have a girlfriend…

425
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:38,833
Uncle, could you please leave for a moment?

426
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:42,367
What? Yes.

427
00:35:42,367 --> 00:35:47,000
Hey, but I just got here…

428
00:35:50,633 --> 00:35:52,867
What? What's going on?

429
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:54,933
Are you in some kind of trouble?

430
00:35:54,933 --> 00:35:56,033
 (Go out, quickly.) 

431
00:35:56,033 --> 00:35:58,700
Our thoughts remain unchanged.

432
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,367
Please think again.

433
00:36:03,467 --> 00:36:05,500
Let's go, Do Hyun.

434
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,633
Yes.

435
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:09,700
What?

436
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,767
What was that?

437
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:21,300
Oh my.

438
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,333
That girl has charisma though.

439
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:27,133
Do Hyun followed her right away.

440
00:36:27,133 --> 00:36:29,867
However, are all young students like that these days?

441
00:36:31,367 --> 00:36:34,200
What? What else is going on?

442
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,100
That girl is pregnant with Do Hyun's baby.

443
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,133
What?

444
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,000
Wow, he…

445
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,467
Since when did he keep such a secret…

446
00:36:49,467 --> 00:36:51,300
Hold on.

447
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,967
So, is it Lee Se Na who made her pregnant?

448
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:57,733
No, that's a bit weird.

449
00:36:57,733 --> 00:37:01,400
She can't plan her pregnancy in advance.

450
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,967
Oh, it's really…

451
00:37:09,433 --> 00:37:11,400
 You were imprudent with me. 

452
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,467
 Do you really think pregnancy is your son's secret? 

453
00:37:47,233 --> 00:37:49,933
Don't blame yourself.

454
00:37:49,933 --> 00:37:55,133
If she had planned to scam you, you could not have avoided being scammed.

455
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,867
This is all Lee Se Na's plan.

456
00:38:00,867 --> 00:38:05,767
Lee Se Na's plan to seduce the naive Dr. Choi.

457
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:08,240
It's all my fault, whatever.

458
00:38:09,133 --> 00:38:11,833
It was something I chose to do.

459
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:15,740
I'll go in.

460
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,867
Dr. Choi.

461
00:38:19,567 --> 00:38:22,467
I understand you're mad at me,

462
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:26,100
but you have to understand this one thing.

463
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:29,800
Every moment, every choice

464
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,900
I made was for you.

465
00:38:33,633 --> 00:38:36,060
It was for me…

466
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,340
Every moment was for me…

467
00:38:43,767 --> 00:38:46,600
I'm sorry, Mother.

468
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,200
Those words were

469
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,533
shackles for me my whole life.

470
00:38:53,533 --> 00:38:57,733
So, I made a wrong choice to get out of here.

471
00:38:57,733 --> 00:39:01,010
Of course, it was a foolish choice.

472
00:39:01,767 --> 00:39:05,433
So, please stop saying things like that.

473
00:39:07,667 --> 00:39:11,300
Yeah, let's stop it.

474
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,767
That's how my life has been. I don't know why.

475
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:24,133
For my family, more than my life,

476
00:39:24,133 --> 00:39:27,533
only to protect you…

477
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:32,133
Please.

478
00:39:32,133 --> 00:39:35,533
Please don't say that, Mother.

479
00:39:35,533 --> 00:39:36,533
Why did you do that?

480
00:39:36,533 --> 00:39:39,100
Mother, why did you plan my life the way you wanted!

481
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:42,567
You should have lived your own life!

482
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,800
I'm not even your biological son.

483
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,560
Why did you do that to me?

484
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,967
Do Hyun,

485
00:40:25,967 --> 00:40:28,900
you have nothing to say to me?

486
00:40:29,667 --> 00:40:32,200
What's going on?

487
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:38,000
I wish you would be honest with me.

488
00:40:39,433 --> 00:40:42,000
Actually, at your age,

489
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,833
there are some things you don't want to tell me.

490
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:48,733
No, there is no such thing.

491
00:40:52,467 --> 00:40:55,300
I'll be honest with you, too.

492
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,900
I received a strange text today.

493
00:41:03,433 --> 00:41:07,000
Someone said she knew your secret.

494
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,200
I'm afraid.

495
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,400
I don't even know what the secret is,

496
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,533
but I'm afraid that

497
00:41:19,533 --> 00:41:23,533
someone who knows it might do something to you.

498
00:41:23,533 --> 00:41:27,833
So, I want to know that.

499
00:41:28,867 --> 00:41:30,767
Do Hyun,

500
00:41:30,767 --> 00:41:35,867
even if you commit a crime,

501
00:41:35,867 --> 00:41:39,660
we'll solve it together and I'll be always by your side.

502
00:41:40,533 --> 00:41:45,233
So, please tell me, Do Hyun.

503
00:41:46,433 --> 00:41:52,100
Can you please trust me?

504
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,467
Actually…

505
00:42:07,933 --> 00:42:13,600
It was a lie that Soyee was pregnant.

506
00:42:17,933 --> 00:42:21,567
Why did you tell such a lie?

507
00:42:24,867 --> 00:42:26,933
It's okay.

508
00:42:26,933 --> 00:42:30,867
I will understand whatever you say.

509
00:42:32,033 --> 00:42:33,933
Mom, you know Jun Ho. Right?

510
00:42:33,933 --> 00:42:36,233
Jun Ho?

511
00:42:37,467 --> 00:42:40,433
The one who went to study abroad in the US?

512
00:42:41,567 --> 00:42:43,600
Yes.

513
00:42:44,833 --> 00:42:48,033
We were going to go see Jun Ho.

514
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:52,400
Then, why did you lie that she's pregnant?

515
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,267
You can just travel to the US.

516
00:42:56,733 --> 00:43:00,200
I want to stay with Jun Ho.

517
00:43:04,267 --> 00:43:06,867
I like Jun Ho.

518
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:15,000
- That means… 
 - Right.

519
00:43:16,933 --> 00:43:19,767
We love each other.

520
00:43:33,233 --> 00:43:35,867
Do Hyun,

521
00:43:35,867 --> 00:43:38,300
I will accept

522
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:43,433
all of your honest feelings.

523
00:43:43,433 --> 00:43:45,700
However,

524
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:51,200
at your age, you may be confused about your identity.

525
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,867
So, don't be so quick to judge…

526
00:43:54,867 --> 00:43:56,933
Mom,

527
00:43:57,967 --> 00:44:02,000
I don't know how many times I denied it to myself.

528
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,033
But it didn't work.

529
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:16,533
The more I became convinced,

530
00:44:18,167 --> 00:44:21,867
the more I thought, "What if this truth gets out?"

531
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:24,267
I was scared.

532
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:30,133
Even I wanted to deny it myself,

533
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:38,400
but I wondered what it would be like if other people found out about this fact.

534
00:44:42,533 --> 00:44:45,633
If you had such a hard time,

535
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,500
why didn't you tell me?

536
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:55,467
Because I wanted to remain a good son to you.

537
00:44:59,567 --> 00:45:02,667
That's probably not the son...

538
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,567
you expected.

539
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:17,333
I couldn't tell you because I was afraid everything you had achieved up until now

540
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:20,300
would fall apart.

541
00:45:32,933 --> 00:45:35,867
No, Do Hyun.

542
00:45:35,867 --> 00:45:41,133
You are more precious to me than anything else in the world.

543
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,033
Don't worry.

544
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:52,100
I'll be by your side until the end.

545
00:45:53,267 --> 00:45:58,833
I'll protect you.

546
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:22,533
 95, 96, 97, 98, 

547
00:46:22,533 --> 00:46:23,967
 99, 99, 99… 

548
00:46:23,967 --> 00:46:25,767
 100! 

549
00:46:25,767 --> 00:46:28,033
 I'll find you. 

550
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,967
 Hide well. 

551
00:46:33,667 --> 00:46:35,833
 Mom! 

552
00:46:39,267 --> 00:46:41,800
 My baby… 

553
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:11,700
 To my beloved Jae Jin. 

554
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,233
 There is a saying that success is not temporary, 

555
00:47:14,233 --> 00:47:18,433
 but the result of repeated actions every day. 

556
00:47:18,433 --> 00:47:22,933
 I'm so proud of my son who follows my plan. 

557
00:47:22,933 --> 00:47:24,300
 Jae Jin, 

558
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:27,467
 don't hesitate or falter. Just look ahead 

559
00:47:27,467 --> 00:47:29,367
 and move forward. 

560
00:47:29,367 --> 00:47:32,100
 I'll walk with you from behind you. 

561
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:37,167
 You are the sparkle of my life, and my eternal pride. 

562
00:47:37,167 --> 00:47:40,067
 From a mother who only loves you. 

563
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,133
It's cold, Mother.

564
00:48:34,867 --> 00:48:37,333
Lord.

565
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:40,667
How could this happen to our Do Hyun…

566
00:48:42,233 --> 00:48:44,700
I guess this is just a temporary thing.

567
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,033
Right?

568
00:48:47,033 --> 00:48:51,733
At this age, you can easily be mistaken. Right?

569
00:48:53,533 --> 00:48:58,167
So, what did you say? Did you say you understood and supported him?

570
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,367
Yes.

571
00:49:02,633 --> 00:49:06,933
Absolutely not, I can't accept it.

572
00:49:06,933 --> 00:49:09,633
What if we can't accept it?

573
00:49:09,633 --> 00:49:12,033
To be honest, I was embarrassed,

574
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:14,967
but I have to respect Do Hyun because it is his life.

575
00:49:14,967 --> 00:49:17,733
If others say that, I respect it.

576
00:49:17,733 --> 00:49:20,000
However, I can't accept it if it's my family.

577
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,133
You can clearly see how difficult a life your son will have,

578
00:49:25,133 --> 00:49:27,967
but as a mother, do you just stand by and watch?

579
00:49:27,967 --> 00:49:32,867
You need to think carefully about what life is like for Do Hyun.

580
00:49:32,867 --> 00:49:40,500
How afraid must Do Hyun have been before revealing this secret?

581
00:49:41,533 --> 00:49:46,367
Maybe Do Hyun could have continued to live by hiding and lying.

582
00:49:46,367 --> 00:49:48,867
But he didn't do that.

583
00:49:48,867 --> 00:49:51,467
I'm so proud of Do Hyun.

584
00:49:51,467 --> 00:49:55,900
The most confused one among us right now is probably Do Hyun.

585
00:49:56,967 --> 00:49:59,867
What we can do is…

586
00:49:59,867 --> 00:50:05,467
Can't we just support Do Hyun's choice?

587
00:50:05,467 --> 00:50:08,467
The life that Do Hyun chose.

588
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:19,667
The problem is that Lee Se Na knows this.

589
00:50:21,133 --> 00:50:22,867
So what?

590
00:50:22,867 --> 00:50:25,467
She'll threaten us by saying she'll tell other people.

591
00:50:25,467 --> 00:50:28,533
Or she could just let people know about it.

592
00:50:33,367 --> 00:50:35,820
Dr. Noh, will you be all right?

593
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:39,300
Can you let go of everything you've achieved so far?

594
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,367
Yes.

595
00:50:41,367 --> 00:50:44,933
Yes, I can do that for my son.

596
00:50:44,933 --> 00:50:48,200
Just like you did for Jae Jin.

597
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:53,233
I'll do everything to make sure Do Hyun doesn't get hurt.

598
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:06,200
Son, you've had a hard time. ight?

599
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,333
You should have confided in me at least.

600
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:13,567
If I had told you, you would have told my mom.

601
00:51:15,067 --> 00:51:19,300
And when I wanted to tell you everything, you left the house.

602
00:51:22,933 --> 00:51:29,400
You can choose whatever you want,

603
00:51:30,667 --> 00:51:33,400
but I'm on Mom's side.

604
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,567
It's true that you did something wrong.

605
00:51:46,867 --> 00:51:49,000
Yeah.

606
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,700
I'm sorry for what I did wrong.

607
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,833
But, Do Hyun,

608
00:51:55,833 --> 00:51:58,833
just because Mom and Dad aren't on good terms

609
00:51:58,833 --> 00:52:02,180
doesn't mean my feelings for you will change.

610
00:52:02,867 --> 00:52:04,733
You know that, right?

611
00:52:04,733 --> 00:52:10,400
Mom and Dad will love you just the way you are,

612
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,333
no matter what.

613
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,620
Yes.

614
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:19,033
I think I know now that...

615
00:52:19,833 --> 00:52:23,300
what Tae Oh said was wrong.

616
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,633
Tae Oh?

617
00:52:24,633 --> 00:52:29,233
Tae Oh said that someone like Mom would never understand it.

618
00:52:30,167 --> 00:52:32,600
He said that if my mother found out about this,

619
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,233
she would turn away from me.

620
00:52:49,133 --> 00:52:51,367
 Where are you? 

621
00:53:18,233 --> 00:53:20,500
You really came.

622
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,133
I told you I had something to say.

623
00:53:22,133 --> 00:53:24,567
Have a seat.

624
00:53:26,467 --> 00:53:28,633
You should have a drink.

625
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,933
Why did you say that to Do Hyun?

626
00:53:31,933 --> 00:53:35,500
Why did you tell him that we wouldn't understand?

627
00:53:36,667 --> 00:53:38,600
- Suddenly… 
 - Are you drunk?

628
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,033
Tell me straight.

629
00:53:40,033 --> 00:53:41,600
If something like that happened to Do Hyun,

630
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,667
you should have told him to tell us honestly.

631
00:53:43,667 --> 00:53:46,067
Calm down, calm down.

632
00:53:46,067 --> 00:53:49,967
I did that for Do Hyun.

633
00:53:49,967 --> 00:53:52,433
And I don't think Dr. Noh would understand, either.

634
00:53:52,433 --> 00:53:55,800
I think you're mistaken about that.

635
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,520
Jae Jin.

636
00:54:01,533 --> 00:54:03,767
Why?

637
00:54:03,767 --> 00:54:08,267
Why are you suddenly sympathizing with Dr. Noh?

638
00:54:13,733 --> 00:54:15,867
Jae Jin.

639
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:25,267
That's why you couldn't be honest, either.

640
00:54:27,233 --> 00:54:29,700
You lied to her that I was your senior's son.

641
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,733
That's not it.

642
00:54:30,733 --> 00:54:34,933
No? That's not it?

643
00:54:34,933 --> 00:54:37,033
Then,

644
00:54:37,667 --> 00:54:42,300
can you tell her how we met?

645
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:44,533
Moon Tae Oh!

646
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,767
Jae Jin,

647
00:54:48,767 --> 00:54:51,267
you know how to get angry now.

648
00:54:51,267 --> 00:54:53,300
Yeah.

649
00:54:59,033 --> 00:55:00,333
You progressed a lot.

650
00:55:00,333 --> 00:55:02,633
But, Jae Jin,

651
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:05,933
is there something you can do?

652
00:55:31,667 --> 00:55:36,800
♫  By the time summer approaches  ♫

653
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:41,000
♫  I was in love  ♫

654
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,467
♫  Even the passionate kiss  ♫

655
00:55:46,467 --> 00:55:51,567
♫  Melts under the sun  ♫

656
00:55:51,567 --> 00:55:57,200
♫  Countless days and nights  ♫

657
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:01,500
♫  Pass by without any regrets  ♫

658
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:09,400
♫  I won't go back to  ♫

659
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:13,867
♫  Any secret's moment  ♫

660
00:56:27,033 --> 00:56:30,600
   
 Okay, let's listen to the next story. Hello? 

661
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:34,133
 Hello, I'm a mother with a son who is a first year high school student. 

662
00:56:34,133 --> 00:56:36,033
 I have a problem that I can't talk about, 

663
00:56:36,033 --> 00:56:38,467
 but I thought today was my chance, so I called. 

664
00:56:38,467 --> 00:56:40,033
 You did well. 

665
00:56:40,033 --> 00:56:44,400
 Please tell Dr. Noh what your concerns are. 

666
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,033
 My son says he likes boys. 

667
00:56:48,033 --> 00:56:51,033
 I was so surprised and embarrassed… 

668
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,100
 I heard you have a son like that, too. 

669
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:57,633
 What are you planning to do? 

670
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:07,967
 Now, hang up. 

671
00:57:07,967 --> 00:57:09,300
 Cut. 

672
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,967
 Let's take a short break. 

673
00:57:10,967 --> 00:57:12,500
 Sis! 

674
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,020
   

675
00:57:44,167 --> 00:57:48,567
 You'll be connected to the voice mail and charged after the beep sound… 

676
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:24,200
   

677
00:59:08,333 --> 00:59:10,633
Thank you.

678
00:59:15,067 --> 00:59:18,900
They say kids these days are crazy about mala flavor.

679
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:21,367
It's not bad.

680
00:59:21,367 --> 00:59:25,450
There are times when you have to endure the spiciness.

681
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:29,033
Do Hyun, I think

682
00:59:29,033 --> 00:59:32,833
that's better than pregnancy.

683
00:59:32,833 --> 00:59:35,433
In some ways…

684
00:59:36,333 --> 00:59:39,167
But people may not view it favorably.

685
00:59:39,167 --> 00:59:43,533
You may be criticized or ignored.

686
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:47,067
People often think that

687
00:59:47,067 --> 00:59:51,567
being different from themselves is wrong.

688
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:55,667
So, I insisted on my way to make your father

689
00:59:55,667 --> 01:00:00,033
I mean... live no differently from others,

690
01:00:00,033 --> 01:00:03,233
or at least as much as others.

691
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:06,000
Are you going to do that to me, too?

692
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,750
No.

693
01:00:10,167 --> 01:00:13,167
Even if the path you have to take will be long and with great pain,

694
01:00:13,167 --> 01:00:18,400
choose that path if you want.

695
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:22,567
I get it now.

696
01:00:22,567 --> 01:00:27,500
I should have given your father that freedom and choice.

697
01:00:34,633 --> 01:00:37,367
Because in life,

698
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:41,333
you have to endure the spiciness, too.

699
01:01:08,433 --> 01:01:10,833
Why is it so spicy?

700
01:01:17,333 --> 01:01:19,700
Soyee.

701
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:21,967
Even though it was for Do Hyun,

702
01:01:21,967 --> 01:01:26,100
it was a bit bold to lie about being pregnant.

703
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:27,570
Yes.

704
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:32,910
I think I know now why you did that.

705
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:37,700
Do Hyun likes Jun Ho,

706
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:41,690
and you like Do Hyun. Right?

707
01:01:46,033 --> 01:01:47,267
 Hello. 

708
01:01:47,267 --> 01:01:48,433
 - Hello. 
 - Hello. 

709
01:01:48,433 --> 01:01:49,933
 Get ready, everyone. 

710
01:01:49,933 --> 01:01:52,000
 Thank you. 

711
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,067
 Please set it. 

712
01:01:54,067 --> 01:01:55,833
- Doctor. 
 - Thank you.

713
01:01:55,833 --> 01:01:57,867
There are three stories today.

714
01:01:57,867 --> 01:02:00,067
Just a moment.

715
01:02:05,167 --> 01:02:08,067
   

716
01:02:16,433 --> 01:02:20,420
   

717
01:02:24,367 --> 01:02:26,180
   

718
01:02:31,967 --> 01:02:34,133
Why are you doing this?

719
01:02:34,133 --> 01:02:38,367
I'll reveal the truth about your family. On live broadcast.

720
01:02:38,367 --> 01:02:41,000
No, leave Do Hyun alone.

721
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:43,833
Please.

722
01:02:43,833 --> 01:02:46,200
Just tell me what you want from me.

723
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,100
Are you afraid?

724
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:51,600
Then, come and stop it yourself.

725
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,967
   

726
01:02:53,967 --> 01:02:57,800
However, I think you'll have to hurry.

727
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:05,310
   

728
01:03:09,133 --> 01:03:12,400
Sis, where are you going?

729
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:07,533
Mother.

730
01:04:07,533 --> 01:04:09,350
Dr. Noh?

731
01:04:28,933 --> 01:04:31,233
Are you okay?

732
01:04:48,033 --> 01:04:51,220
   

733
01:04:54,040 --> 01:05:03,410

734
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:20,500
 Dr. Noh? 

735
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,367
 I'm not that kind of person. 

736
01:05:22,367 --> 01:05:24,300
 She would never have done that. 

737
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:25,500
 This is a trap. 

738
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,567
 What if you could get rid of the person you want to get rid of 

739
01:05:27,567 --> 01:05:29,700
 without having to do it yourself? 

740
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:31,900
 If it weren't for Mrs. Hong… 

741
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:33,467
 I said I would deal with you. Right? 

742
01:05:33,467 --> 01:05:36,900
 She would kill a person if it is about her son. 

743
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,833
 If things are going as per Lee Se Na's plan, 

744
01:05:38,833 --> 01:05:40,600
 it seems like there's a variable. 

745
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:42,433
 Moon Tae Oh, who attends Hankuk University, is a different person. 

746
01:05:42,433 --> 01:05:44,300
 He's not the Moon Tae Oh we knew. 

747
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,967
 How could… 

748
01:05:46,967 --> 01:05:48,667
 We have to go until the end. 

749
01:05:48,667 --> 01:05:50,320
 Don't you think so?
