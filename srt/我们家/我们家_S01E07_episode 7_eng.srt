1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
   

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,167
 I think family is the lifeline to me. 

3
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:11,133
 This is where the real Noh Young Won exists 

4
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:13,233
 and the power to get me back up. 

5
00:00:13,233 --> 00:00:18,100
 If it weren't for my family, I wouldn't be here. 

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,300
 So, my family is the only thing 

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,033
 I have to protect until the end. 

8
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,733
 Protecting my family from being cut off 

9
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:32,433
 is probably the reason for my life and existence. 

10
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:35,567
 Even if it is a family member, if they try to destroy you, 

11
00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:37,733
 you must cut them off. 

12
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:41,167
 So, what kind of family do you live with? 

13
00:00:45,067 --> 00:00:48,533
 The cases my father was involved in 

14
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:50,367
 were all framed, I think. 

15
00:00:50,367 --> 00:00:54,533
 You said that people become stronger as they slip. 

16
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:58,833
 You've slipped this far, so now you need to get stronger. 

17
00:01:00,967 --> 00:01:04,033
 And he was involved in that. 

18
00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:08,733
 I understand. But isn't the important thing here not revealing the truth, 

19
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:10,833
 but the well-being of our families? 

20
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:13,367
 Think about what you need to keep. 

21
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:16,533
 The choice is yours. 

22
00:01:16,533 --> 00:01:19,133
 Are you going to hide the secret of your father's death? 

23
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:21,633
 That's funny. 

24
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:23,367
 What about you? 

25
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:26,600
 Do you know everything... about your family? 

26
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,433
 Are you saying that Jae Jin is cheating on you? 

27
00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:32,100
 Lee Se Na. She's Choi Jae Jin's mistress. 

28
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,467
 That's why he went to the villa… 

29
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:37,800
 From what I researched, Lee Se Na, she is a witch. 

30
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,900
 So, you're saying that all those husbands are dead? 

31
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,233
 This might not be just an affair. 

32
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:45,500
 Dr. Choi could also be in danger. 

33
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,067
 He said that our Jae Jin is with a witch right now. 

34
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,333
 Aren't you worried? 

35
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,100
 Mother, I… 

36
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,600
 I'm angrier at Jae Jin for falling for that kind of woman. 

37
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,033
 So, what are you going to do? 

38
00:01:58,033 --> 00:02:00,667
 I'll find him. 

39
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:07,000
 Wouldn't it be better to die by me than by a witch? 

40
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:11,300
 Where are we going now? 

41
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,033
 Did you find him? 

42
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:16,133
 A car was found in the sea. 

43
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:22,033
 Oh, I was surprised. 

44
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:23,400
 There is no one inside. 

45
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,033
 They said they found the inn where they stayed. 

46
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:31,400
 To my beloved family, 

47
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:35,500
 I'm sorry and I love you. 

48
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,267
 To be honest, my cheating husband may have died with that woman. 

49
00:02:40,267 --> 00:02:43,367
 Should I just feel sad and sorry for him? 

50
00:02:43,367 --> 00:02:45,067
 Jae Jin didn't die. 

51
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:48,767
 He must be alive here somewhere. 

52
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:53,067
 Se Na, I think I can be truly happy now. 

53
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:54,433
 Was it all a play? 

54
00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:57,700
 I told you that our Jae Jin is not dead. 

55
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,867
 To Lee Se Na, I don't think it's just an affair. 

56
00:03:01,867 --> 00:03:04,667
 The important thing is why Lee Se Na is doing this. 

57
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:06,933
 And the fourth is Do Hyun. 

58
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:09,300
 If Lee Se Na is planning to harm Do Hyun… 

59
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,300
 I'll find Lee Se Na. 

60
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,333
 What are you doing? 

61
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:16,300
 You just died 

62
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,900
 and you're born again. 

63
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,110
 So now... 

64
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,800
 you have to live a new life. 

65
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,000
 Dr. Noh, I don't want you to understand our Jae Jin. 

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 But you have to think about family. 

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,067
 I guess it was all just for you. 

68
00:03:34,067 --> 00:03:36,533
 Was I really part of the family? 

69
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:39,560
   

70
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:50,900



71
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,267
 What did you think after reading this book, my son? 

72
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:05,867
 Pip loved Estella unconditionally 

73
00:04:05,867 --> 00:04:10,700
 all his life and it was amazing. 

74
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,933
 No, 

75
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:14,533
 he didn't love her unconditionally. 

76
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:19,400
 Pip could only truly love her if Estella accepted it. 

77
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,533
 It's a conditional desire. 

78
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:26,100
 "Love has no conditions, 

79
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,100
 but desire has conditions." Is that what you think? 

80
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,600
 The relationship between the two will be decided at the moment of sacrifice. 

81
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,633
 But I just think that 

82
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:40,667
 desire leads people down unimaginable paths. 

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,567
 As expected, Young Won is smart, huh? 

84
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:46,633
 I also agree with your opinion. 

85
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:50,367
 - Daddy!  
  - Yes, now. 

86
00:04:50,367 --> 00:04:55,133
 - Shall we stop reading the book and order pizza? 
 - Yes. 

87
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:57,967
 No instant food. 

88
00:04:57,967 --> 00:05:02,333
 Mrs. Hong, it's okay to eat it for a day or so. 

89
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,067
 A day or so? 

90
00:05:04,067 --> 00:05:06,800
 Why are you like this? 

91
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:13,533
 Ma'am was making crab soup earlier because it's in season. 

92
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:16,367
 It looked so delicious. 

93
00:05:16,367 --> 00:05:18,467
 Do you like crabs? 

94
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:20,800
 Yeah, okay. Then shall we have crab soup? 

95
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,767
 Then, yes. Let's do that. 

96
00:05:22,767 --> 00:05:26,800
 Jae Jin, shall we go pick out a different book together? 

97
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,967
 Yes. 

98
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:29,367
 - Oh. 
 - Oh my. 

99
00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:31,267
 Jae Jin, are you okay? 

100
00:05:31,267 --> 00:05:33,467
 You should have been more careful. 

101
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:35,100
 Young Won, I'm sorry. 

102
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,500
 No, I'm fine. 

103
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,900
 Young Won, go to Jae Jin's room 

104
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,900
 and change into clothes that fit you. 

105
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,400
 Yes. 

106
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,500
 Let's go. 

107
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:50,100
 I wish I had a daughter like that. 

108
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,767
 A day or so? 

109
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:56,767
 Do you think parenting can be done in a day or so? 

110
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:05,233
 Young Won, these are the exact same clothes that Seo Tai Ji wore. 

111
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:07,800
 Would you like to wear this? 

112
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,967
 - No, I'm fine. 
 - All right. 

113
00:06:17,367 --> 00:06:18,500
 You wear this. 

114
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,633
 This denim shirt looks better with the beige pants you are wearing. 

115
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:24,633
 Really? 

116
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:28,667
 Mom. 

117
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:30,700
 You also changed your clothes? 

118
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,467
 Young Won said this suits me better. 

119
00:06:33,467 --> 00:06:34,970
 Yeah? 

120
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:43,033
 It suits you very well, just like your clothes. 

121
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:47,000
 But to become a suitable person for someone, 

122
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,567
 I have to develop my inner self. 

123
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:54,000
 "That's why you made me read Great Expectations." 

124
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:58,460
 Young Won, 

125
00:06:59,233 --> 00:07:02,067
 I really wonder 

126
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:05,667
 if you have any desire 

127
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:08,633
 or noble character in you. 

128
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,367
 Let's have dinner together. 

129
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,867
   

130
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:50,233
 The police, who were searching the bodies of Mr. Choi and Ms. Lee, 

131
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:53,600
 who went missing in Namhae as a joint suicide, decided to suspend the search today 

132
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,267
 after receiving a tip from their family that 

133
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,267
 they had been in contact with Mr. Choi. 

134
00:07:58,267 --> 00:08:01,767
 With this, everything that has happened so far has been revealed as a simple incident, 

135
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:06,567
 and all the rumors related to this that have been around for a while are false… 

136
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:11,433
We got caught.

137
00:08:11,433 --> 00:08:13,733
So go back home now.

138
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:15,533
What do you mean?

139
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:18,500
Our plan failed.

140
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,467
You said that

141
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:24,533
if we are alive, they would find us wherever we are.

142
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:28,000
That's true, but I…

143
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,800
We can't just run away forever.

144
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,900
Wouldn't it be better to finish things off?

145
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,933
Maybe this is

146
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:43,667
the last chance for liberation.

147
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,367
No, it was hard to get here.

148
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:50,333
I won't go back, never again.

149
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:12,233
Oh my.

150
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,667
What are you doing?

151
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:47,000
You are out of your mind.

152
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:53,467
Jae Jin! Jae Jin!

153
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:56,067
Jae Jin, my son.

154
00:09:56,067 --> 00:09:57,860
Are you okay?

155
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,750
You have no shame.

156
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:09,400
Don't even think about coming into my house.

157
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:15,300
Dr. Noh, your house?

158
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,767
What?

159
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:19,620
How come this is your house?

160
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,633
Jae Jin, it's fine.

161
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:24,650
I'm here with you.

162
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:37,600
Mom.

163
00:10:40,633 --> 00:10:42,350
Dad.

164
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,367
Do Hyun.

165
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:53,900
You are back.

166
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,667
Yes, how have you been?

167
00:10:58,567 --> 00:11:01,800
What have you been doing, and why are you back now?

168
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:19,500
Isn't this what family is all about?

169
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:25,333
Tae Oh, you understand. Right?

170
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:30,167
Yes, I'm glad he's back.

171
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,767
Sorry.

172
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:43,633
Thank you for your hard work today, goodbye.

173
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:46,100
Actually yesterday,

174
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,633
Do Hyun didn't go to the academy and stayed with me.

175
00:11:49,633 --> 00:11:52,533
You know Soyee, right? Do Hyun's girlfriend.

176
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:53,833
Yes.

177
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:57,367
Do Hyun wanted to introduce her

178
00:11:57,367 --> 00:12:00,133
to you and Jae Jin.

179
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:04,400
But I think he was upset because he didn't think it was the right time.

180
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,633
That's why I said I'd buy him something delicious instead.

181
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:11,000
Oh, was that so?

182
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,867
Of course, it was Do Hyun's fault for not going to the academy,

183
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,767
but it was because he thought about you,

184
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:18,400
so you…

185
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,967
Thanks for telling me that.

186
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:22,167
No.

187
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:29,400
I don't want to keep secrets from you.

188
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,667
Yes, if something like this happens again next time,

189
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:35,600
please let me know, then.

190
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,033
Sure, I'll go, then.

191
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,300
Sorry, Son.

192
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:06,140
Did you have an affair?

193
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:10,190
I guess it's true.

194
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,500
I thought Mom knew everything about you and me,

195
00:13:18,267 --> 00:13:20,200
but I guess she didn't know about you.

196
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:25,933
I have nothing to say to you right now.

197
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,790
Maybe later, when you grow up,

198
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:35,333
you'll be able to understand me.

199
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:38,733
Are you getting a divorce?

200
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:40,570
Do Hyun,

201
00:13:41,467 --> 00:13:44,300
no matter what happens,

202
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:50,300
the fact that I am your dad will never change.

203
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:54,110
I will always be by your side,

204
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,950
so I hope...

205
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:02,667
you can live the life you want.

206
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:05,700
So this isn't the life you wanted?

207
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:11,900
Honestly, I don't even know what I wanted in life.

208
00:14:13,433 --> 00:14:16,370
So I want to find out what I want.

209
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,650
Have you been doing well?

210
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,370
Actually, I…

211
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:31,233
No.

212
00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:34,067
Solve your problem first.

213
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:35,400
I'll tell you later.

214
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,333
 Why? Tell me what happened. 

215
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:41,833
 What's going on? Did you break up with Soyee? Is it like that? 

216
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,633
 I didn't break up with her. 

217
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,033
 We are still getting along well. 

218
00:14:46,033 --> 00:14:49,567
 - That's great. 
 - Please leave now. 

219
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,400
Shall we talk?

220
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,400
Toast.

221
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:24,067
I'm so glad that Dr. Choi came back safely.

222
00:15:26,067 --> 00:15:28,633
Isn't that right, Dr. Noh?

223
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,467
You've suffered so much that your face has become haggard.

224
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:38,100
Have you been eating well?

225
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,100
Tell me where and how you've been.

226
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,033
Mother, he didn't return after his trip.

227
00:15:45,033 --> 00:15:48,167
Why should I listen to this?

228
00:15:50,267 --> 00:15:54,367
I feel truly sorry to both of you.

229
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:57,333
Of course, you feel sorry to us.

230
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,400
Dr. Noh, he said he is sorry.

231
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,667
I didn't mean to do this at first.

232
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:06,300
Then you shouldn't have done that.

233
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,467
Dr. Noh, he said he didn't mean to do this.

234
00:16:09,467 --> 00:16:11,567
I'm listening to it all, too.

235
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:12,833
Right?

236
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:16,233
Well, anyway, this time it was Dr. Choi's fault.

237
00:16:16,233 --> 00:16:20,700
It's wrong if you were so naive that you were deceived.

238
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:26,110
Even if Lee Se Na approached you with a plan,

239
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,067
it still doesn't change that you have been deceiving me all this time.

240
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:33,733
More than that, I'm more disappointed

241
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:38,300
in how you've been respected by the world for so long,

242
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,033
even doing ghost surgeries.

243
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:46,500
You don't even wonder why I did that. Right?

244
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,000
Whatever the reason,

245
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,180
what you did can't be justified.

246
00:16:52,967 --> 00:16:56,120
Don't even think about making cowardly excuses.

247
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:03,233
Yeah, I don't have any excuses anymore.

248
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,740
Dr. Choi, you still don't get it?

249
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:14,167
Lee Se Na is trying to deceive you

250
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:16,100
and harm my family.

251
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,233
No, Mother.

252
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:20,633
What are you saying Se Na will do to my family?

253
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:26,200
Lord, please save this lamb from Satan.

254
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,490
   

255
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,100
Here it is.

256
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,167
These are charts from a previous counseling program.

257
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:16,000
- This is what you asked me to find. Right? 
 - Yeah.

258
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,433
Oh, when was this aired?

259
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:22,533
They must all be adults now.

260
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:27,167
Are all these doing well?

261
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:35,033
I know you're not the type of person who speaks hastily,

262
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:37,867
so I pretended not to notice.

263
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:40,180
What's going on?

264
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,900
Lee Se Na?

265
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,100
Yes.

266
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:55,740
Lee Se Na...

267
00:18:57,233 --> 00:19:00,200
is threatening me.

268
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,133
   

269
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:03,367
Is there really any information about Lee Se Na here?

270
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:08,100
I don't think there was a match based on basic information alone.

271
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:13,067
But what will you do if you find out

272
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:15,500
why Lee Se Na is doing this?

273
00:19:17,267 --> 00:19:22,000
I think I can stop Lee Se Na

274
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,980
if I know the reason.

275
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:41,700
Francesca, why has it taken you so long to come?

276
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,567
The overseas business trip was too long.

277
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:47,920
I think this is the longest you've been gone

278
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,730
out of the 8 years you've been volunteering.

279
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:52,620
Has it already been 8 years?

280
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,730
Yes.

281
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,700
Can I stay here for a few days?

282
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,833
- Of course. 
  - Se Na! Se Na! 

283
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:07,133
- Se Na. 
  - I missed you. 

284
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:10,800
- I brought you a gift. 
 - Oh, it's here too.

285
00:20:14,233 --> 00:20:18,167
Min Hee is not feeling well today.

286
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:24,067
Ta-da! A gift!

287
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,600
You said you wanted this for your birthday.

288
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:38,467
My mom said she'd come pick me up when I turned seven.

289
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:44,167
Do you still believe that?

290
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:46,733
We made a promise.

291
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:49,467
You promised me that

292
00:20:49,467 --> 00:20:53,700
you would hate those who abandoned you.

293
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,700
Does that mean she abandoned me?

294
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:08,533
Don't worry.

295
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:12,467
I won't let her make promises

296
00:21:12,467 --> 00:21:15,333
she can't keep.

297
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:20,500
Soyee.

298
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,700
My dad came back.

299
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,933
Well then, I guess you should prepare your mind.

300
00:21:25,933 --> 00:21:29,200
You just waited for your dad to come back.

301
00:21:29,867 --> 00:21:30,967
Are you okay?

302
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:33,767
There's no reason to not be okay.

303
00:21:33,767 --> 00:21:35,833
I talked to Jun Ho yesterday.

304
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,233
He said he missed us both.

305
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:40,700
Jun Ho?

306
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,100
Why does he only contact you?

307
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,967
Are you jealous?

308
00:21:46,967 --> 00:21:48,700
No.

309
00:21:53,533 --> 00:21:56,033
Don't be jealous.

310
00:21:56,033 --> 00:22:00,733
And Do Hyun, you have to trust me now.

311
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:04,120
Yes.

312
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,633
   

313
00:22:17,633 --> 00:22:19,900
Remodeling work?

314
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,100
Ji Eun.

315
00:22:50,433 --> 00:22:52,167
   

316
00:22:55,967 --> 00:22:57,740
   

317
00:22:58,867 --> 00:23:01,190
- Find out about this person. 
 - What?

318
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:05,233
Lee Se Na?

319
00:23:05,233 --> 00:23:08,600
This woman, she's the one who ran away with the director. Right?

320
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,600
That's why I need to find Jae Jin.

321
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,233
Ji Eun, why do you care about that?

322
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,933
Oh? Dr. Oh, you are here.

323
00:23:23,633 --> 00:23:25,733
- Who are you? 
 - I have something to tell you.

324
00:23:25,733 --> 00:23:28,100
You shouldn't come in here without permission.

325
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,933
It's okay.

326
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:32,367
Do you know him?

327
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:33,767
What are you doing here?

328
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:36,200
Oh, I was passing by and the hospital door was open.

329
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,567
What are you doing here?

330
00:23:38,567 --> 00:23:42,033
I wanted to do some organizing before the hospital opens.

331
00:23:45,933 --> 00:23:48,467
Lee Se Na, Lee Se Na.

332
00:23:48,467 --> 00:23:51,367
Lee Se Na is that woman. Right?

333
00:23:51,367 --> 00:23:53,333
- Wait a minute. 
 - No, this…

334
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:55,400
Kyung Tae.

335
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:58,140
Would you please go?

336
00:23:59,033 --> 00:24:01,300
All right.

337
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,533
Thank you.

338
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:29,167
I was grateful for that day.

339
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:31,030
No.

340
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:38,067
But it seemed like something happened to you and Mrs. Hong Sa Gang that day.

341
00:24:38,067 --> 00:24:43,267
Yeah, she's in a bad mood sometimes.

342
00:24:43,267 --> 00:24:46,333
We've been like family for so long

343
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:48,400
that it's not a big deal.

344
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,800
Yeah, I guess everyone is in a bad mood right now.

345
00:24:53,933 --> 00:24:57,533
It's all because of that woman, Lee Se Na.

346
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,840
Why did he get deceived by such a woman?

347
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,267
Oh, right.

348
00:25:05,267 --> 00:25:09,840
He said he liked you when he was young.

349
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,767
Did he really say that?

350
00:25:13,767 --> 00:25:15,800
Yes.

351
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:20,233
Well, maybe if it weren't for Mrs. Hong Sa Gang,

352
00:25:20,233 --> 00:25:23,200
you might be next to him right now.

353
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:26,500
Mr. Moon Tae Oh.

354
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,233
What are you trying to say?

355
00:25:32,967 --> 00:25:35,200
Dr. Oh,

356
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:40,400
he knows how you really feel.

357
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,233
So don't be too upset.

358
00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:49,070
I wanted to tell you this.

359
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:55,810
   

360
00:26:02,133 --> 00:26:04,700
Please go now.

361
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:09,767
I can think about that after he comes back.

362
00:26:09,767 --> 00:26:12,633
He's already back.

363
00:26:23,067 --> 00:26:25,933
Why did you buy so much? What special day is it today?

364
00:26:25,933 --> 00:26:28,233
It's nothing.

365
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:30,900
Dr. Choi?

366
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,067
What is all this?

367
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:36,200
Oh, I'm going to make dinner.

368
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,867
Are you going to cook?

369
00:26:38,867 --> 00:26:42,533
- Yes, please bring this in. 
 - Oh, yes.

370
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:48,233
You couldn't even eat properly because of me.

371
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:51,800
Today, I'll cook.

372
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:57,133
As expected, our Dr. Choi is so affectionate and warm.

373
00:27:04,433 --> 00:27:07,733
 Young Min, I'm home. 

374
00:27:07,733 --> 00:27:10,367
 Would you please come to my house? 

375
00:27:17,567 --> 00:27:20,700
Young Won, you're home early.

376
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,133
Did you come running like this

377
00:27:23,133 --> 00:27:26,867
because you were afraid that I would beat up Jae Jin again?

378
00:27:26,867 --> 00:27:29,067
I guess that's what being a married couple is like.

379
00:27:29,067 --> 00:27:30,433
I told you not to come.

380
00:27:30,433 --> 00:27:33,667
Oh, I mean, he invited me

381
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:36,500
as an apology like this,

382
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,610
so I should come.

383
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,533
Oh? I think someone came.

384
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:55,533
Mr. Oh, did you also receive a call from Jae Jin?

385
00:27:55,533 --> 00:27:57,140
Yes.

386
00:27:59,767 --> 00:28:01,910
What does he want?

387
00:28:10,733 --> 00:28:12,570
Dr. Noh?

388
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,133
Oh, Mrs. Hong. Hello.

389
00:28:15,133 --> 00:28:18,067
- You are here. 
 - Brother.

390
00:28:20,267 --> 00:28:23,370
I really want to hit you, but…

391
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,800
Welcome back.

392
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,833
You also invited him.

393
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:31,300
Yeah, you did well.

394
00:28:33,933 --> 00:28:35,533
Ji Eun, you…

395
00:28:35,533 --> 00:28:37,710
I called her.

396
00:28:39,433 --> 00:28:41,400
Are you all right?

397
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,133
What happened?

398
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:45,500
I'm okay.

399
00:28:46,233 --> 00:28:48,000
Sorry, Ji Eun.

400
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,333
No, I just wanted you to come back safely.

401
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:56,767
Dr. Noh, you are back?

402
00:28:56,767 --> 00:29:00,967
Dr. Choi worked hard to prepare a meal for you.

403
00:29:00,967 --> 00:29:02,867
Shall we eat first?

404
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:05,100
Oh, well…

405
00:29:07,133 --> 00:29:08,800
It's not someone's birthday today. Right?

406
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,133
I couldn't even prepare a birthday cake because I was in a hurry.

407
00:29:12,133 --> 00:29:13,733
No. It's okay, Aunt.

408
00:29:13,733 --> 00:29:15,667
Welcome.

409
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:18,910
Sis, how have you been?

410
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,767
Well…

411
00:29:21,767 --> 00:29:24,267
I guess you must have had a hard time.

412
00:29:24,267 --> 00:29:27,560
Our Dr. Choi threw a family party.

413
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:32,300
Yeah, this is what a family is like.

414
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,500
Oh, Dr. Noh, I enjoyed the broadcast.

415
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:40,333
- When can you give me that money? 
  - If everyone knew that this famous 

416
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:43,067
- I'll send you the money by today. 
  - counselor's family is like this, 

417
00:29:43,067 --> 00:29:44,700
 it wouldn't be good. 

418
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,067
Miss.

419
00:29:46,067 --> 00:29:48,767
Oh, she has good hearing.

420
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:53,900
Now that we're all here, let's eat.

421
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,533
Mrs. Hong.

422
00:30:07,867 --> 00:30:11,200
What is all this?

423
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,567
Wow, you prepared a lot.

424
00:30:14,567 --> 00:30:18,333
Well, why…

425
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:21,700
Why is there no seasonal food at all?

426
00:30:42,033 --> 00:30:45,067
You guys are very confused, right?

427
00:30:45,767 --> 00:30:49,200
But, these are the foods

428
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,200
I really like.

429
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:57,300
These are things I could never eat in this house.

430
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,500
Why do you suddenly talk about your favorite food?

431
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,700
The Choi Jae Jin you know...

432
00:31:05,733 --> 00:31:07,750
is a fake.

433
00:31:10,467 --> 00:31:13,600
I've been living a life of lies.

434
00:31:15,133 --> 00:31:17,590
I lived as a good son,

435
00:31:19,033 --> 00:31:21,240
a good husband,

436
00:31:22,733 --> 00:31:24,633
and outside,

437
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:27,800
I lived as a fake doctor who ordered Dr. Oh

438
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,640
to perform surgery on my behalf.

439
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:37,033
Why are you doing this?

440
00:31:37,033 --> 00:31:38,633
What?

441
00:31:38,633 --> 00:31:41,467
Then does that mean

442
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:44,667
Dr. Choi is a fake doctor?

443
00:31:45,567 --> 00:31:47,033
See?

444
00:31:47,033 --> 00:31:50,500
I told you then that I was curious how he became a doctor.

445
00:31:51,933 --> 00:31:54,833
I couldn't become a doctor.

446
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:59,300
Nevertheless, my mother made me a doctor.

447
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,400
She made me live as a fake doctor...

448
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,233
and kept me living a lie.

449
00:32:08,133 --> 00:32:11,333
I knew you were a scary person,

450
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:14,400
but how could you fool us like that?

451
00:32:20,033 --> 00:32:21,600
Dr. Choi.

452
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,933
I understand that Dr. Choi wants

453
00:32:25,933 --> 00:32:28,533
to be honest with our family.

454
00:32:28,533 --> 00:32:30,633
Well, now that everyone knows the truth,

455
00:32:30,633 --> 00:32:33,567
I guess you can understand because we're family.

456
00:32:33,567 --> 00:32:35,260
Mother,

457
00:32:36,233 --> 00:32:40,167
there was something else you were hiding.

458
00:32:42,367 --> 00:32:44,600
Listen to me carefully.

459
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,200
When your father passed away,

460
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,720
he was falsely accused. Right?

461
00:32:52,767 --> 00:32:56,200
My father was involved in that.

462
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,970
My father is the accomplice...

463
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:07,667
who drove him into sexual harassment even though he knew it was a lie.

464
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:12,167
Brother, what are you talking about?

465
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,667
Are you saying my dad was framed?

466
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:18,680
Sorry, Young Min. Sorry.

467
00:33:20,533 --> 00:33:24,667
I wondered how my brother got stoned to death.

468
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:26,433
If this had been found out,

469
00:33:26,433 --> 00:33:30,167
would my brother have been stoned to death?

470
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:32,367
Dr. Choi, stop it now.

471
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:36,567
No, I don't want to stop it.

472
00:33:36,567 --> 00:33:39,620
Now the highlights remain.

473
00:33:41,733 --> 00:33:45,867
You knew all this but wanted to hide it.

474
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:53,633
So that's why my mother brought you into our house.

475
00:33:53,633 --> 00:33:56,033
You, my life,

476
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:58,870
and even our marriage

477
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,730
were all planned by my mother.

478
00:34:05,033 --> 00:34:08,500
No, that's not it.

479
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:13,267
That's really something that Prosecutor Choi did alone.

480
00:34:13,267 --> 00:34:14,267
As a mother, I…

481
00:34:14,267 --> 00:34:16,300
 Do you know how ugly and dirty 

482
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,300
 your hypocrisy is in taking care of Dr. Noh? 

483
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,567
 It's disgusting how you're pretending 

484
00:34:21,567 --> 00:34:25,500
 to be a good father-in-law after driving him to suicide. 

485
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,533
 Disgusting? 

486
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:30,133
 Have you forgotten that you are also an accomplice? 

487
00:34:30,133 --> 00:34:32,433
 Well, who was it that told me to bring her here 

488
00:34:32,433 --> 00:34:34,900
 when you feel something uneasy about her? 

489
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,600
 It was you who made her marry Jae Jin. 

490
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,000
 What would I have done that for? 

491
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,800
 Why? Why! 

492
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,367
It's all over now, Young Won.

493
00:35:04,367 --> 00:35:07,933
We are not the family you think.

494
00:35:15,933 --> 00:35:18,000
Jae Jin.

495
00:35:28,933 --> 00:35:33,000
 Is everyone leaving? 

496
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:36,033
That's amazing.

497
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:38,967
I thought he couldn't do it.

498
00:35:41,367 --> 00:35:42,667
Jae Jin.

499
00:35:42,667 --> 00:35:44,933
Mother.

500
00:35:47,533 --> 00:35:50,850
Even in this situation, you only worry about your son. Right?

501
00:35:51,533 --> 00:35:55,333
You lied to me all the way through.

502
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:58,030
But at least Jae Jin was...

503
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:02,650
honest today.

504
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,533
Sis, are you all right?

505
00:36:11,533 --> 00:36:15,667
Even though you guys weren't on good terms,my brother and you were still a married couple.

506
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:19,533
Because there was a secret that only the two of you knew.

507
00:36:19,533 --> 00:36:23,500
I'll go. Goodbye.

508
00:36:38,133 --> 00:36:41,100
Is this what you came back for?

509
00:36:42,933 --> 00:36:45,367
Yeah, that's why I came back.

510
00:36:45,367 --> 00:36:48,600
I was going to tell you the dirty truth about our family.

511
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,233
I wanted to free you from your life without knowing anything.

512
00:36:52,233 --> 00:36:55,600
And I also want to be free from here.

513
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,933
I won't live as the fake Choi Jae Jin anymore.

514
00:36:58,933 --> 00:37:02,333
If you're tired of being fake, you could have said it before.

515
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:04,033
Are you asking why I didn't tell you?

516
00:37:04,033 --> 00:37:06,900
Are you asking why I've been living like this until now?

517
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,400
Because I had to live as the ideal son my mother wanted

518
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,933
and the ideal husband you wanted.

519
00:37:12,933 --> 00:37:16,400
That's how I could protect this family.

520
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,167
The real Choi Jae Jin...

521
00:37:20,233 --> 00:37:22,933
wants to be free.

522
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,133
Did you cheat because you wanted to be free?

523
00:37:26,133 --> 00:37:28,000
Even disguising it as suicide?

524
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,510
Yeah,

525
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:32,700
I'm wrong.

526
00:37:33,367 --> 00:37:36,400
But I can't stand it anymore.

527
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:40,267
That's why I'm trying to end it like this.

528
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,867
Come to your senses.

529
00:37:54,867 --> 00:37:58,067
You are being gaslighted by Lee Se Na.

530
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,767
She sent you here on purpose to destroy our family.

531
00:38:00,767 --> 00:38:04,600
No, it's my choice!

532
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:07,767
My choice.

533
00:38:34,267 --> 00:38:36,667
Yeah, I'm heading there now.

534
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:38,900
I'll be there quickly.

535
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,467
 Again, I didn't die. 

536
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:07,900
 You can't die, not yet. 

537
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,300
 Your family is the one causing you pain, 

538
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,233
 but why are you trying to kill yourself? 

539
00:40:22,233 --> 00:40:25,033
 You can just cut off that family and get away. 

540
00:40:25,033 --> 00:40:27,567
 Se Na, 

541
00:40:27,567 --> 00:40:30,300
 you don't know our family well. 

542
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:34,900
 How long are you going to live in the play that your mother made? 

543
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:40,000
 You know that that's not your real self. 

544
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:49,733
 There's a story that only I know that you don't know. 

545
00:40:56,767 --> 00:41:00,267
 Why are you telling me this now? 

546
00:41:00,267 --> 00:41:03,633
 My parents were also monsters. 

547
00:41:03,633 --> 00:41:07,200
 But I became free from my parents. 

548
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:12,567
 So you too can be free from them. 

549
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,733
 If Young Won finds out about this… 

550
00:41:16,733 --> 00:41:20,800
 Noh Young Won is also a pitiful person like you. 

551
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,700
 You need to liberate her. 

552
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:32,633
 That's how you save everyone. 

553
00:41:32,633 --> 00:41:35,500
 Just like you saved me. 

554
00:41:36,733 --> 00:41:39,600
 And... 

555
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,880
 we can meet again. 

556
00:41:49,433 --> 00:41:51,900
 Yeah, I'm heading there now. 

557
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,760
 I'll be there quickly. 

558
00:42:44,133 --> 00:42:46,350
   

559
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:53,767
 Please leave a message after the beep… 

560
00:44:08,367 --> 00:44:11,000
Yes, I'm almost there.

561
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,367
I'm here.

562
00:44:40,067 --> 00:44:43,767
I thought we were leaving right away when you asked to meet me at the airport.

563
00:44:43,767 --> 00:44:47,233
There's still work to be done.

564
00:44:47,233 --> 00:44:49,600
So when will we leave?

565
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,867
Don't rush.

566
00:44:51,867 --> 00:44:53,833
We'll be together forever,

567
00:44:53,833 --> 00:44:57,000
so now you have to wait.

568
00:44:58,267 --> 00:45:00,333
Sorry.

569
00:45:00,333 --> 00:45:02,967
I'm just worried that Se Na will get hurt

570
00:45:02,967 --> 00:45:06,733
for no reason because of revenge.

571
00:45:14,033 --> 00:45:15,880
You know...

572
00:45:16,567 --> 00:45:20,870
how greatly I was hurt...

573
00:45:21,567 --> 00:45:23,970
by Noh Young Won.

574
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:30,167
There is no other way to heal my wounds.

575
00:45:30,167 --> 00:45:32,300
Or I would die.

576
00:45:33,533 --> 00:45:35,267
No, no, Se Na.

577
00:45:35,267 --> 00:45:38,633
I will do well. I will do my best.

578
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,167
Could you install a hidden camera in the living room?

579
00:45:44,167 --> 00:45:45,800
Living room?

580
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,160
Okay, I'll do that.

581
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,033
 The last flight to Hawaii is closing for check-in. 

582
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:47,767
 Passengers, please complete boarding procedures as soon as possible. 

583
00:46:47,767 --> 00:46:50,633
 I inform you once again. 

584
00:46:50,633 --> 00:46:55,033
 The last flight to Hawaii is closing for check-in. 

585
00:46:55,033 --> 00:47:00,600
 Passengers, please complete boarding procedures as soon as possible. 

586
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,700
 I'd like to buy you dinner as a thank-you gift. 

587
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:11,367
 Because you saved me. 

588
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:44,233
This is what Lee Se Na sent to me.

589
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,800
Number 1 is your father, number 2 is you,

590
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,100
and number 3 is your mother.

591
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:55,100
I think it's the order that I come to know the lies I didn't know about before.

592
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:59,533
No, that can't be true.

593
00:49:00,067 --> 00:49:01,667
Come to your senses.

594
00:49:01,667 --> 00:49:03,967
The fourth is Do Hyun.

595
00:49:03,967 --> 00:49:08,000
Something might happen to Do Hyun, but are you still going to do this?

596
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:19,810
   

597
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:27,630
   

598
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:32,433
   

599
00:49:32,433 --> 00:49:34,433
   

600
00:49:34,433 --> 00:49:39,167
The time Lee Se Na sent the text was 5:09.

601
00:49:40,733 --> 00:49:44,333
 It was definitely just after 5:00. 

602
00:49:45,633 --> 00:49:50,700
 And it was 5:30 when Jae Jin left while making a phone call. 

603
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,560
 Then, 

604
00:49:55,167 --> 00:49:58,233
was Lee Se Na watching

605
00:49:58,233 --> 00:50:00,200
what you were talking about today

606
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:03,000
or did you just plan to meet there?

607
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,533
Answer me quickly.

608
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:12,880
We decided to meet at that place...

609
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:17,000
after everything was over.

610
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,800
 She was watching all of us. 

611
00:50:43,733 --> 00:50:48,290
 The kids really take after their father. 

612
00:50:49,067 --> 00:50:55,000
 The village couldn't overcome the obstacles, and everything fell into disrepair. 

613
00:50:55,967 --> 00:50:59,100
 We lived in poverty in the countryside 

614
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:02,200
 and were not able to teach them much, 

615
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,267
 so they cannot work in the shade, 

616
00:51:04,267 --> 00:51:07,267
 but live by working in the scorching sun. 

617
00:51:07,267 --> 00:51:11,600
 When the sun is hot, my insides feel full. 

618
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,100
 I feel so ashamed 

619
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:19,400
 and guilty for calling myself a mother. 

620
00:51:20,633 --> 00:51:23,200
I remember...

621
00:51:24,667 --> 00:51:30,067
the day my father first brought you.

622
00:51:30,067 --> 00:51:31,500
I...

623
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:36,000
think it was when you were just starting college.

624
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,950
You were reading a book in the garden,

625
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,733
and to my eyes, who had not been to school for a long time,

626
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:45,660
that sight...

627
00:51:46,633 --> 00:51:49,767
seemed noble.

628
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,267
All those illusions must have been shattered

629
00:51:54,267 --> 00:51:57,340
when you stayed with my family.

630
00:51:57,967 --> 00:52:01,067
My father wasn't such an upright prosecutor.

631
00:52:01,067 --> 00:52:04,633
He is a kind person who took me in.

632
00:52:04,633 --> 00:52:06,867
If it weren't for him,

633
00:52:06,867 --> 00:52:11,600
my life would have been uglier.

634
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:18,400
Instead, you covered up all the ugly secrets in our family.

635
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,733
But somehow, at a time like this,

636
00:52:24,733 --> 00:52:27,920
you appeared in front of me again.

637
00:52:28,633 --> 00:52:31,967
That's exactly what I wanted,

638
00:52:32,667 --> 00:52:35,633
so there's no need to feel pressured.

639
00:52:36,733 --> 00:52:38,760
Manager Park,

640
00:52:40,533 --> 00:52:44,667
I really hated my father.

641
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:49,100
I found out that it was

642
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:54,133
the saddest thing in the world for a child to hate his or her parents.

643
00:53:00,267 --> 00:53:03,267
Would Jae Jin do the same to me?

644
00:53:03,267 --> 00:53:05,120
Someday,

645
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,267
Dr. Choi will understand...

646
00:53:12,133 --> 00:53:14,600
his mother's heart.

647
00:53:21,567 --> 00:53:24,200
You must be feeling empty,

648
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,667
so have some warm soup before you go.

649
00:55:47,533 --> 00:55:49,767
Doctor, are you in there?

650
00:55:49,767 --> 00:55:52,300
Yes.

651
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:54,200
Oh, how have you been?

652
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:58,567
I was already looking into that woman.

653
00:55:58,567 --> 00:56:01,433
She was a really scary woman.

654
00:56:01,433 --> 00:56:05,067
Her husbands are all dead.

655
00:56:05,067 --> 00:56:06,400
I know that.

656
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,800
You know that?

657
00:56:11,333 --> 00:56:14,100
But that's not all.

658
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,333
There is a record of her being investigated

659
00:56:16,333 --> 00:56:20,900
when her third husband died in a fire, and she is not normal.

660
00:56:23,933 --> 00:56:26,467
 I guess you liked your sister a lot. 

661
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:31,367
 My sister was pretty. 

662
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,300
 Everyone said she's pretty. 

663
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:37,050
 I also... 

664
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,650
 really liked... 

665
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,967
 my sister. 

666
00:56:44,967 --> 00:56:47,833
 So I tried to protect her. 

667
00:56:47,833 --> 00:56:51,267
 What happened to your sister? 

668
00:56:51,267 --> 00:56:54,600
 They're dead, all three. 

669
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,967
 In a plane crash. 

670
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:01,733
 My father, 

671
00:57:01,733 --> 00:57:04,200
 my mother, 

672
00:57:06,833 --> 00:57:09,133
 and my sister. 

673
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:14,267
 Did you kill the cat? 

674
00:57:15,467 --> 00:57:17,567
 Because it hurt my sister. 

675
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:20,100
She admitted it.

676
00:57:20,633 --> 00:57:23,867
 She said she killed the cat. 

677
00:57:23,867 --> 00:57:26,167
 But everyone said it was my fault. 

678
00:57:26,167 --> 00:57:29,800
 I was just trying to protect my family. 

679
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:35,967
 So I got rid of everything my husband didn't like. 

680
00:57:36,867 --> 00:57:41,933
 I think you should get professional help. 

681
00:57:41,933 --> 00:57:45,267
 Being overly obsessed with love means… 

682
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,767
See?

683
00:57:51,767 --> 00:57:54,567
She's a total psychopath.

684
00:57:54,567 --> 00:57:56,700
If we just leave this woman alone,

685
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:00,167
she might do something to our Ji Eun.

686
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,933
You didn't know that this woman

687
00:58:03,933 --> 00:58:06,067
hit our Ji Eun with a shovel. Right?

688
00:58:06,067 --> 00:58:07,067
I knew that.

689
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:09,033
You also knew that?

690
00:58:09,033 --> 00:58:10,800
Oh, I heard it from Dr. Oh.

691
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,800
Anyway, as a police officer,

692
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:18,200
I cannot just sit by and watch this dangerous person.

693
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:22,100
So I found out more about Lee Se Na.

694
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:24,833
There's something else you need to see.

695
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,667
There was a fire incident in Gangneung

696
00:58:27,667 --> 00:58:33,040
14 years ago that killed a family.

697
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:39,467
All three, parents and daughter, died in the same room,

698
00:58:39,467 --> 00:58:41,867
and the exact cause of the fire was not revealed,

699
00:58:41,867 --> 00:58:46,433
so it was an unfortunate case of family history.

700
00:58:46,433 --> 00:58:48,767
Why did that incident…

701
00:58:49,833 --> 00:58:54,267
The article said that it was a family disaster.

702
00:58:54,267 --> 00:58:58,067
But there wasn't

703
00:58:58,067 --> 00:59:00,620
just one daughter.

704
00:59:01,167 --> 00:59:02,833
There were two daughters.

705
00:59:02,833 --> 00:59:06,267
The one who died in the fire was the eldest daughter.

706
00:59:06,267 --> 00:59:07,933
Then the second daughter is…

707
00:59:07,933 --> 00:59:11,333
Yes, that's Lee Se Na.

708
00:59:11,333 --> 00:59:13,833
Only Lee Se Na wasn't home that day.

709
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:17,133
The investigation noted that she was sleeping in the yard

710
00:59:17,133 --> 00:59:19,900
because she was sleepwalking.

711
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,233
You said the cause of the fire hasn't been determined. Right?

712
00:59:22,233 --> 00:59:23,533
Yes.

713
00:59:23,533 --> 00:59:26,933
No specific cause of the fire was found at the scene,

714
00:59:26,933 --> 00:59:29,167
and Lee Se Na, who was the only survivor,

715
00:59:29,167 --> 00:59:31,767
appears to have had mental problems to the extent that

716
00:59:31,767 --> 00:59:35,267
she could not respond to the investigation at the time.

717
00:59:35,267 --> 00:59:37,667
What happened to Lee Se Na after that?

718
00:59:37,667 --> 00:59:41,000
She was adopted to Norway.

719
00:59:41,467 --> 00:59:46,233
I think that's probably why that case was closed.

720
00:59:46,233 --> 00:59:50,000
But when she was questioned,

721
00:59:54,767 --> 00:59:59,467
why did she say her family died in a plane crash?

722
00:59:59,467 --> 01:00:01,700
 They're dead, all three. 

723
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,570
 In a plane crash. 

724
01:00:04,433 --> 01:00:09,267
I'm not sure if her memories were re-edited due to mental trauma at the time,

725
01:00:09,267 --> 01:00:13,333
or if she intentionally lied, but seeing as her obsession

726
01:00:13,333 --> 01:00:18,067
with love manifests itself in such a violent way,

727
01:00:19,133 --> 01:00:22,500
it's clear that she's a dangerous person.

728
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:43,233
 My sister was pretty. 

729
01:00:43,233 --> 01:00:46,500
 So I tried to protect her. 

730
01:00:48,433 --> 01:00:52,033
 There was a fire incident in Gangneung that killed a family. 

731
01:00:52,033 --> 01:00:53,833
 They're dead, all three. 

732
01:00:53,833 --> 01:00:56,633
 Parents and daughter, three. 

733
01:00:56,633 --> 01:00:59,567
 My father, 

734
01:00:59,567 --> 01:01:01,400
 my mother, 

735
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,867
 and my sister. 

736
01:01:29,367 --> 01:01:33,900
 Why did you kill the sister you liked so much? 

737
01:01:41,633 --> 01:01:43,240
   

738
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:27,800
   

739
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:38,270



740
01:02:54,733 --> 01:02:57,200
 Lee Se Na was watching the whole house through a camera. 

741
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:58,367
 You find it. 

742
01:02:58,367 --> 01:03:00,267
 Is she ordering me? 

743
01:03:00,267 --> 01:03:03,833
 You think there's an insider helping Lee Se Na. Right? 

744
01:03:03,833 --> 01:03:05,767
 The culprit is definitely nearby. 

745
01:03:05,767 --> 01:03:07,200
 Do you know everything about Do Hyun? 

746
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,200
 It's been 11 weeks. 

747
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,200
 Lee Se Na? 

748
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,567
 You paid her to have an abortion? 

749
01:03:10,567 --> 01:03:11,833
 It's my choice. 

750
01:03:11,833 --> 01:03:15,500
 Motherhood is so beautiful and yet sad. 

751
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,400
 The game becomes more fun from now on. 

752
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,300
 Lee Se Na is threatening my son. 

753
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:21,767
 Her elder sister was alive. 

754
01:03:21,767 --> 01:03:25,600
 She said her sister set the fire and tried to kill their parents. 

755
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:29,667
 How would you feel if someone knew your secret?
