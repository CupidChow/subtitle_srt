1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,860
   

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,500
 Isn't that really creepy? 

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,560
 Did you know that 

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,200
 Prosecutor Choi's death is exactly like Hong Sa Gang's novel? 

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,460
 You know that? Your mother-in-law is not an ordinary person. Right? 

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,530
 Are you doubting me now? 

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,670
 It's true that you hated him. 

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,840
 What about you? 

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,800
 Do you know everything about your family? 

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,000
 A miniature villa was delivered 

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,800
 along with a strange text message. 

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,810
 But Dr. Oh was lying down in that villa and you were there, 

13
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,590
 I can't help but be suspicious of you. 

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,750
 I didn't kill her. 

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,600
 Are you saying that our Jae Jin is cheating on you? 

16
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,920
 Ms. Lee Se Na, 

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,620
 she is Choi Jae Jin's mistress. 

18
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,260
 That's why they went to the villa. 

19
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,730
 From what I researched, Lee Se Na, she is a witch. 

20
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,900
 So, you're saying that all those husbands are dead? 

21
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,000
 This might not be just an affair. 

22
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,380
 Dr. Choi could also be in danger. 

23
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,900
 He said that our Jae Jin is with the witch right now. 

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,300
 Aren't you worried? 

25
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,020
 Mother, I… 

26
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,800
 I'm angrier at Jae Jin for falling for that kind of woman. 

27
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,890
 So, what are you going to do? 

28
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,240
 I'll find him. 

29
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:24,290
 Wouldn't it be better to die by me than by a witch? 

30
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:29,600
 Let's not give up and look for him together until the end. 

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,670
 Start by looking for his car. 

32
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,340
 They are heading south. 

33
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:38,260
 The last toll gate he stopped at was Tongyeong. 

34
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,540
 Are you surprised? 

35
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,000
 How did you know I was here? 

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Anyway, Dr. Noh, we're a team now . 

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,100
 Shouldn't we find Jae Jin together? 

38
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,800
 I'm looking for the car owner now. 

39
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,600
 Didn't he say he was going to Yokji Island? 

40
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,830
 Where is Yokji Island? 

41
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,830
 Where are we going now? 

42
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,130
 Did you find him? 

43
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,930
 A car was found in the sea. 

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Please help. 

45
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,200
 Jae Jin. 

46
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,720
 What's going on? 

47
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,460
 What's happening? 

48
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,160
 Wake up. 

49
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,160
 - Hold him. 
 - Quickly. 

50
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,530
 Lay him down head first. 

51
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,300
 Are you all right? 

52
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,564
 One, two, three. 

53
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,424
 Honey. 

54
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,350
 Honey, Young Won… 

55
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,450
 - Honey. 
 - Honey. 

56
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,710
 I'm going to die because of you. 

57
00:03:32,928 --> 00:03:34,430
   

58
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,410
 Since I was born again, I'll love again like the first time. 

59
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,010
 Let's see a kiss! 
 - Congratulations! 

60
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,860
 Were you surprised? 

61
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,600
 I don't even want to talk when I think about how surprised I was. 

62
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,230
 Then what are you going to do if you really blacked out? 
 - You're not angry, right? 

63
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:23,900
 Anyway, if your goal was to surprise me, you succeeded. 

64
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,890
 Yes, it was successful. 

65
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,380
 If your mother had known what happened today, she would have gone crazy. 

66
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,350
 She doesn't even know that I sometimes freedive. 

67
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,290
 I know, your mother 

68
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:38,510
 will never guess that you are lying. 

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,890
 But what should I do if my son lies to me later? 

70
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,460
 No way. 

71
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,660
 - Really? 
 - That won't happen. 

72
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,072
 It looks delicious. 

73
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,500
 Here. 

74
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,220
 What is this? Is this for me? 

75
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,716
 It's for you. 

76
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,704
 Open it. 

77
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,700
 Wow, Honey, are you surprising me too? 

78
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,040
 This is one of a kind in the world. 
 - Really 

79
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,740
 Yes. If you look here, our wedding anniversary is engraved. 

80
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,540
 It's so pretty. 

81
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,050
 I always wanted to change this to leather. 

82
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,800
 Metallic colors look cold in winter. 

83
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,290
 I'll only wear this watch from now on. 

84
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,490
 Congratulations on your 10th wedding anniversary. 

85
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,900
 Thank you. 

86
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,720
 This wine is prepared by Mrs. Hong. 

87
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,300
 - Did she? 
 - Yes. 

88
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,350
 Well then, have a great time. 

89
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,450
 I guess you told your mother we were coming here. 

90
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,290
 No, I didn't. 

91
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,060
 Well, I guess she checked it out 

92
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,500
 because it's a place we visit often. 

93
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,740
 She also knows that today is our wedding anniversary. 

94
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,800
 Yes. 

95
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,130
 Then I should at least thank her. I'll call her and come back. 

96
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,400
 I'll go to the bathroom. 

97
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,968
 Toast. 

98
00:06:57,704 --> 00:06:59,600
 Aren't you going? 

99
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:17,460
   

100
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,336
That's not the car. Right?

101
00:07:24,224 --> 00:07:27,590
Heo 2949.

102
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,390
That is the car number that Dr. Choi rented.

103
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,456
Oh my.

104
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,370
Oh my god!

105
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,380
Mother...

106
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,100
Oh my, I was startled.

107
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,950
I thought it was a person.

108
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,400
There is no one inside.

109
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,900
- Is this a rental car? Check the vehicle number quickly. 
 - Okay.

110
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,900
Did only the car fall into the water,

111
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,784
or was the dead body lost?

112
00:08:18,784 --> 00:08:20,928
A dead body?

113
00:08:20,928 --> 00:08:23,748
A dead body?

114
00:08:23,748 --> 00:08:25,470
Oh my.

115
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,592
You are… Dr. Noh Young Won, right?

116
00:08:34,592 --> 00:08:37,220
You're right.

117
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,370
Do you know that car?

118
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,510
Then, since when have you been unable to contact Choi Jae Jin?

119
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,220
From Wednesday night.

120
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,350
Then that's right. He rented a car in Tongyeong on Thursday.

121
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,790
And when I checked the CCTV at the dock here…

122
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,568
Turn it on.

123
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,760
Friday 11:09 a.m.

124
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,860
The license plate number is correct. Right?

125
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,670
And this is CCTV in front of the port where the car was found.

126
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,470
Right? It's the same car.

127
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,370
The car went into the port on Saturday night

128
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,670
and has not come out since.

129
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:27,710
Then, that means the car fell into the water on Saturday night…

130
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,210
You are saying that our Jae Jin is…

131
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:34,308
Are you sure there was someone in the car?

132
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:36,964
It's hard to identify because it's night, but given the circumstances…

133
00:09:36,964 --> 00:09:40,890
No, maybe it was just the car that fell into the water.

134
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:44,560
If only the car had fallen into the water, he would have reported the accident.

135
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,460
Then, what about the CCTV inside that port?

136
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,760
There are no CCTVs inside the port.

137
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,370
Why isn't there CCTV there?

138
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,450
What happened next?

139
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:05,700
I'm trying to figure it out, but it might take a while.

140
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,520
How long does it take? How long?

141
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,820
Until when?

142
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,520
Wait a minute. We're looking for him, too.

143
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:17,360
We also have to figure out what happened. To retrieve a body from the open sea…

144
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,960
A body? You mean a corpse?

145
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,100
A corpse…

146
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,770
Senior!

147
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,670
Choi Jae Jin, Gaesaeki…

148
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,070
Why do you call him a bastard like that in front of his family?

149
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:35,110
Oh, that's not it.

150
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,880
I mean the Gaesaeki jjamppong restaurant.

151
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,688
The Gaesaeki jjamppong restaurant.

152
00:10:42,688 --> 00:10:44,192
Isn't that a famous restaurant?

153
00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:47,780
But there was a woman who came with Choi Jae Jin.

154
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,800
A woman?

155
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,100
Yes, and I heard that his family came to look for the woman this morning.

156
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,500
A woman who looks like Jae Jin's mother...

157
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,740
and a man who makes noodles.

158
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,920
Weren't you saying that Choi Jae Jin came alone?

159
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,520
So, let's recap.

160
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:22,490
You mean Choi Jae Jin and a woman named Lee Se Na disappeared together?

161
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:29,030
What is the relationship between Ms. Lee Se Na and Mr. Choi Jae Jin?

162
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,240
Lee Se Na is a witch…

163
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,240
I heard that Lee Se Na is a witch.

164
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,980
Those two were having an affair.

165
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,060
Yes.

166
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,460
Really?

167
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,170
All right.

168
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,624
They said they found the inn where they stayed.

169
00:11:58,624 --> 00:12:00,680
Lord.

170
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:27,220
- Where is it? 
 - You can go down this way.

171
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,020
Please come this way.

172
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,500
What happened?

173
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,080
It's been a while since they left.

174
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,790
They paid one month's rent

175
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,090
in cash.

176
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:59,290
But aren't those two having an affair?

177
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,290
I thought it was a little weird.

178
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,540
They didn't look like a married couple.

179
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,730
- Senior. 
 - Yes.

180
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:08,470
- You should come here. 
 - Why?

181
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,910
What is it?

182
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,270
Isn't this a will?

183
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,250
 To my beloved family, 

184
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:34,460
 the happy times passed by like a flash, 

185
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:38,230
 but it was a life where the pain 

186
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:41,530
 was greater than the happy memories, 

187
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,440
 so I, Choi Jae Jin, 

188
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,940
 am about to end my life here. 

189
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,910
 Mother. 

190
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,000
 I'm sorry to disappoint you. 

191
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,960
 Please forgive this bad son. 

192
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,710
 - Come with me. 
 - Be careful. 

193
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,840
Please step aside.

194
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,888
Take your time.

195
00:14:30,888 --> 00:14:32,950
 Young Won, 

196
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:36,110
 thank you, and I loved you. 

197
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,020
 I'm sorry for making this choice. 

198
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,556
 And, my son. 

199
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:51,170
 Dear Do Hyun, 

200
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,600
 I hope... 

201
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,310
 you understand me someday. 

202
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,620
 Once again, 

203
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,920
 I'm sorry to all my family, 

204
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,980
 and I love you all. 

205
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,900
Jae Jin.

206
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,330
Jae Jin…

207
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,140
 Look at how I can jump! 

208
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:36,700
We'll take that will.

209
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,090
It looks like he committed suicide. Right?

210
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,310
I guess so.

211
00:18:29,896 --> 00:18:31,890
Mother.

212
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,990
Mother, let's go.

213
00:18:46,948 --> 00:18:48,970
Mother.

214
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,800
Don't do this.

215
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,560
Are you feeling comfortable now?

216
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,660
You are feeling comfortable that our Jae Jin is gone like this. Am I right?

217
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:18,800
I told you it was so dangerous.

218
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,900
I told you I had to report it.

219
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,000
If something really happens

220
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,820
to our Jae Jin,

221
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,490
I won't be able to forgive you, Dr. Noh.

222
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,820
The investigation and search are still ongoing,

223
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,020
but given the circumstances…

224
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,400
No, that can't be true.

225
00:20:21,696 --> 00:20:23,700
Why did he…

226
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,300
Young Won.

227
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,100
What happened?

228
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,210
Why did he commit suicide?

229
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:33,480
What about the will? Are you sure that he wrote the will?

230
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,580
We are currently checking the handwriting,

231
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,880
but neither cell phone nor card were found.

232
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,720
nor card were found.

233
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,720
Judging from the fact that a will was discovered,

234
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,710
- it seems like they committed suicide together… 
 - No.

235
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,900
No, that can't be true.

236
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,660
Right, that can't be true.

237
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:55,260
And how can the police make a conclusion so easily

238
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,260
when there is no body found?

239
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,060
From our point of view, a will was found, so…

240
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:04,800
He may have changed his mind even after writing the will.

241
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,150
It can never be like that. He is definitely alive.

242
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:12,200
See, she said he's alive.

243
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,720
What about CCTV?

244
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,890
There must have been something filmed.

245
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:22,500
This is his movements that have been identified since he arrived on the island on Friday.

246
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,100
This was caught on CCTV near the jjamppong restaurant on Friday.

247
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,200
If it's near the jjamppong restaurant,

248
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,800
does that mean he came all the way here to eat jjamppong?

249
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,470
That's already been confirmed.

250
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,008
Oh, yeah?

251
00:21:37,008 --> 00:21:39,080
Let's keep watching.

252
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:44,200
A market? What did he buy there?

253
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,320
It turned out that he bought two bags.

254
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,120
The large bag was found in the car,

255
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,490
and the small bag appears to have been lost.

256
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:59,290
And an appearance in front of the port on Saturday night was his last.

257
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,130
What about the CCTV inside the port?

258
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,900
There's no CCTV there.

259
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,270
Does it make sense that

260
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,370
there are no CCTVs inside the port?

261
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,970
That's what I'm trying to say.

262
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,280
Are you trying to make some kind of suicide spot?

263
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,180
There's a problem with this.

264
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,800
Young Min, you keep quiet.

265
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,300
How can I stay quiet in this situation?

266
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,590
It's strange that you're rational even in this situation.

267
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:30,260
Anyway, after that, the two never came out of the port

268
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,700
and were not captured on any other CCTV.

269
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,370
There's no way that could ever happen.

270
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,240
She's right.

271
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,040
There's no reason for him to commit suicide.

272
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,210
Of course, it's absurd that Jae Jin cheated on my sister.

273
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:48,340
Plus, he got caught cheating on her, so it makes sense for him to be scared.

274
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,880
Still, it's strange that he would commit suicide.

275
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,220
Oh, it's really frustrating.

276
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:58,190
That woman… What about Lee Se Na?

277
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,710
That detective guy said that woman is a witch. Right?

278
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,520
She said she'd kill everyone.

279
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,664
Then that woman killed him…

280
00:23:05,664 --> 00:23:09,530
No, that can't be true. Son.

281
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,400
He didn't commit suicide. This could be a murder case.

282
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,100
This could be a murder case.

283
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,970
You shouldn't do this here.

284
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,210
Get out.

285
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,010
Why are you letting me out?

286
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,450
I understand you.

287
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,080
I feel so sorry for Jae Jin.

288
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,490
What should I do?

289
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:34,350
He had everything like money, family, and fame.

290
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:38,630
Where did he meet such a crazy and strange person?

291
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:42,500
- Jae Jin. 
 - Stop it! Please stop it!

292
00:23:52,996 --> 00:23:55,720
   

293
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,600
Then, what should we do now?

294
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,800
They told us to wait a bit, so I'll go home for now.

295
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,440
Do Hyun is also waiting.

296
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:26,140
Ships are currently not operating.

297
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,680
Shall I look for another way?

298
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,000
Yes, please.

299
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,220
Going home?

300
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,850
Leaving our Jae Jin here?

301
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:43,604
Then, do we have to stay here?

302
00:24:43,604 --> 00:24:45,290
It's cold.

303
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,260
It's too cold.

304
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:54,500
There might be our Jae Jin in this sea right now.

305
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,310
They say there's nothing we can do but wait.

306
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,290
And the body...

307
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,280
wasn't found in the end, either.

308
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:08,490
Then are you waiting for the body to come out?

309
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:13,020
Does that mean there's nothing we can do but wait?

310
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,568
You are so heartless.

311
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:21,700
So, how lonely our Dr. Choi must have been…

312
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,670
Mother.

313
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,140
To be honest, my cheating husband

314
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:29,190
may have died with that woman.

315
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:33,140
Should I just feel sad and sorry for him?

316
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,480
Does it matter that he cheated

317
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,480
when he might be dead now?

318
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,480
So, in this situation,

319
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,730
I have to stay calm.

320
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,680
Even if Jae Jin is dead,

321
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:52,190
I will take care of my son.

322
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,030
Dr. Noh,

323
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:57,270
you shouldn't even speak so carelessly.

324
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,300
Jae Jin didn't die.

325
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:07,210
He must be alive here somewhere.

326
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,100
Are you feeling something?

327
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,420
Are you a fortune teller or something?

328
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,336
Why are you looking at me like that?

329
00:26:23,336 --> 00:26:27,390
So are you going to stay here?

330
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,170
I'll find my son.

331
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,900
 Hello. 

332
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,484
Where's Do Hyun?

333
00:27:02,484 --> 00:27:04,992
Hello, Dr. Noh. I'm Tae Ho.

334
00:27:04,992 --> 00:27:09,640
Do Hyun chats a lot during tutoring.

335
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,000
I told him to solve the problem and I came down with Do Hyun's cell phone.

336
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,180
Please put him on the phone.

337
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,680
- Young Won. 
 - Yes.

338
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,510
No.

339
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:22,350
I'm going to be a little late today.

340
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,390
So please tell him I'll call him back later.

341
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:28,220
Yes, okay.

342
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,404
Ma'am.

343
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,072
Could you just bring me a cup of tea?

344
00:27:44,072 --> 00:27:45,790
Yes.

345
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:14,500
Thinking back now, it was really hard at that time.

346
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,670
Mom went into the hospital, and you got married,

347
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:21,100
so I felt like I was all alone.

348
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,300
Still, I endured each day holding on day by day.

349
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,020
You didn't know that, right?

350
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:29,850
I was sad when you said you were getting married.

351
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,990
You lived so hard to look good in that family.

352
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,800
Why has this happened?

353
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:44,230
But, what did you do to him that he…

354
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,140
What did I do? Was it my fault that he committed suicide?

355
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:52,040
He is a coward who made that choice and made others feel guilty.

356
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,910
Why are you so cold-hearted?

357
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,410
Sis, you don't know. Right?

358
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:59,620
Sis, you're always right, you have to do everything you say,

359
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,250
and you should do whatever you want.

360
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:04,650
So you never thought he might have been frustrated. Right?

361
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:07,260
Even if what you say is right,

362
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:12,690
sometimes people just want you to listen to them.

363
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,470
Did he say he felt frustrated?

364
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:18,400
So he has been seeing another woman for a year without me knowing?

365
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,400
So you want me to understand that?

366
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,110
I really don't know what this is anymore.

367
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:32,180
I don't even know what's real and what's fake.

368
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,520
Is this the family I used to know?

369
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,000
I don't know that, either.

370
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,360
I worked really hard for this family...

371
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,970
I feel so miserable...

372
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,530
that I feel it's so unfair, it is driving me crazy.

373
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:53,340
They said he might be dead.

374
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:56,670
But why on earth did he die?

375
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,300
Even though I'm too harsh,

376
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,910
I wonder if it's true that he's dead...

377
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,250
I'm scared, too.

378
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,820
But what should I do?

379
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:17,330
I'm Do Hyun's mother.

380
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:21,050
I can't break down like this.

381
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,856
Do Hyun.

382
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:43,720
- Mom. 
 - Yes. Wake up.

383
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,350
Let's eat.

384
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:47,308
Take a shower and come down.

385
00:31:47,308 --> 00:31:48,920
Yes.

386
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:59,190
Are you back from far away?

387
00:32:00,048 --> 00:32:01,830
Yes.

388
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,600
But why can't I reach Dad?

389
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,370
I think he's really busy.

390
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:15,100
Who are you chatting with so early in the morning?

391
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,950
It's my friend.

392
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,350
Who is it?

393
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:21,050
You don't need to know everything.

394
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,700
Soyee.

395
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,400
You arrived early.

396
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,100
What are you doing? Let's go now.

397
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,120
 She said we were all going to die. 

398
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,420
 Choi's vehicle that entered the island was found in the sea, 

399
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,490
 but their whereabouts remain unknown. 

400
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:40,260
 However, as Mr. Choi's suicide note was discovered in the inn they stayed at, 

401
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:44,170
 the Coast Guard began searching for the body, weighing the possibility of a double suicide. 

402
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:47,700
 However, as no bodies are found near the vehicle, 

403
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:52,340
 the Coast Guard is expanding the underwater search using divers 

404
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,840
 from 20 km east to west to 30 km north to south. 

405
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,180
Where's Jae Jin?

406
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,000
Where is he?

407
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,110
He disappeared.

408
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:08,000
With that… woman?

409
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,900
They said they might have died together.

410
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,000
A will was found, so…

411
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,930
No way.

412
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:17,600
Right.

413
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,740
That doesn't make sense.

414
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,370
So I need to know exactly.

415
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:28,768
What happened the day you came to the villa?

416
00:34:28,768 --> 00:34:30,800
Well…

417
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:37,536
That day, the director left work early,

418
00:34:37,536 --> 00:34:41,448
unlike usual.

419
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,500
 I'll go, and you've worked hard. 

420
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:03,850
 Something was strange. 

421
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,120
 So I chased him. 

422
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:08,710
 Everyone is going to die. 

423
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:14,520
She said everyone was going to die.

424
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,300
We're all going to die.

425
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,060
If that woman really…

426
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:22,650
Jae Jin... Jae Jin...

427
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,560
This doesn't make sense!

428
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,000
If Jae Jin really committed suicide,

429
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,040
why did he make that choice?

430
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,200
Didn't you notice anything strange?

431
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,900
Was there some problem at the hospital?

432
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:39,610
I...

433
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:43,950
saw the pictures in your cell phone.

434
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,680
It seems like you two have known each other

435
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,700
since you were young,

436
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:53,220
but did you intentionally hide it from me?

437
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:04,310
Do you know how I feel right now?

438
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:10,130
From cheating to suicide…

439
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:16,180
I don't know if Jae Jin is the person I've always known.

440
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,460
So...

441
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,150
I really want to know

442
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:26,000
why Jae Jin made that choice.

443
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,436
That's because...

444
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,600
you don't really know him.

445
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:39,030
What don't I know?

446
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:45,700
There are things you don't know about.

447
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,450
Please just go now.

448
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:02,984
How did it go?

449
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,420
- You couldn't find it, right? 
 - I couldn't find it.

450
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,890
Has it already been swept away?

451
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:11,130
No, no.

452
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,000
That means he's alive.

453
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,900
Is there any reason why you are so sure?

454
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,410
I feel that way.

455
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,600
I can feel...

456
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:23,010
a strong signal.

457
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:27,250
Well, if he fell into the water, the body would surface in 10 days anyway.

458
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,920
But this place has a net under the water,

459
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,160
so the body is bound to get caught.

460
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,116
I don't know how it will be.

461
00:38:34,116 --> 00:38:35,984
Let's go over there.

462
00:38:35,984 --> 00:38:39,350
Then, let's expand the support request.

463
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:52,540
 He rented a car in Tongyeong on Thursday. 

464
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:57,710
 The car went into the port on Saturday night and has not been out since. 

465
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:01,420
 Are you sure there was someone in the car? 

466
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:05,020
 It's hard to identify because it's night, but given the circumstances… 

467
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:08,990
- This is it. 
 - What?

468
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:13,830
Agatha Christie's novel "Ten Little Indians."

469
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:17,470
The culprit was Judge Wargrave.

470
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:21,370
Right. But he also dies in the middle,

471
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:26,100
but in fact, the author never explicitly stated that he died anywhere.

472
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,800
Died but not dead?

473
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,490
I'm pretty sure he came into this port.

474
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:35,520
Of course, I can't guarantee that he left this port.

475
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,660
But what if he really didn't go out?

476
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:42,160
What if he just disappeared from here?

477
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:57,710
Who discovered the rental car in the first place?

478
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:00,410
A fishing boat coming into the port.

479
00:40:24,076 --> 00:40:27,880
   

480
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:43,650
   

481
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,520
   

482
00:41:29,792 --> 00:41:33,640
 14th October! But why are you asking about Lee Se Na's birthday? 

483
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,080
   

484
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:14,688
Please do it as quickly as possible.

485
00:42:14,688 --> 00:42:16,850
All right.

486
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,420
Have you ever seen someone like this?

487
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,190
No, I haven't.

488
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:39,270
Have you ever seen these people?

489
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:42,720
I think I saw them from over there then.

490
00:42:43,748 --> 00:42:45,550
Thank you.

491
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,350
Ji Eun.

492
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:00,420
Are you all right?

493
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,060
Are you injured somewhere?

494
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:05,390
I was so worried about you.

495
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,560
What is going on?

496
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,440
Where's my phone?

497
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,030
Here it is.

498
00:43:16,108 --> 00:43:20,746
 Leave a message after the tone… 

499
00:43:22,244 --> 00:43:25,010
Is it because of Choi Jae Jin?

500
00:43:25,568 --> 00:43:29,050
- Where's the car? 
 - It's outside.

501
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:37,760
What's your relationship with Choi Jae Jin?

502
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:44,050
   

503
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:38,250
Have you ever seen these people?

504
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,860
I think I've seen this woman.

505
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:43,652
What about that guy?

506
00:44:43,652 --> 00:44:46,190
- He wasn't there. 
 - Wasn't he there?

507
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:48,130
She was definitely alone.

508
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:51,000
I remember it because it was strange.

509
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,680
It's strange for a young woman to go night fishing alone.

510
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,580
Then did she come back here again?

511
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:03,524
It seems like it's not.

512
00:45:03,524 --> 00:45:09,480
- If it's not… 
 - We dropped off in Tongyeong once.

513
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,990
I think she got off there.

514
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:20,300
Please drop me off at the place where she got off.

515
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,900
Could you give me just a little more?

516
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,900
Please count it first and then tell me.

517
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,850
   

518
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:52,690
Yes, Sergeant.

519
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:57,530
We haven't found the body yet, but we found a watch.

520
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:01,840
I'll send you a photo, so please check it.

521
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:18,100
 Metal colors look cold in winter. 

522
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,890
 I'll only wear this watch from now on. 

523
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:21,560
 Can I wear this now? 

524
00:47:23,104 --> 00:47:25,220
 What? 

525
00:48:39,459 --> 00:48:41,360
   

526
00:48:43,756 --> 00:48:45,500
Mother.

527
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:48,720
Did you get some sleep?

528
00:48:49,388 --> 00:48:51,140
Mother.

529
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:54,980
- Jae Jin's watch is... 
 - I heard that.

530
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:57,250
That's why I called you.

531
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:59,350
Dr. Noh,

532
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:02,280
the fact that his body hasn't been found yet

533
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,590
means he's alive.

534
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:06,920
So, brace yourself.

535
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,360
Let's talk about it later.

536
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,640
   

537
00:49:23,976 --> 00:49:26,632
- Hello. 
  - Hello, Madam. 

538
00:49:26,632 --> 00:49:28,640
 We have a new product coming out this time. 

539
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,540
Sorry, I'll call you back later.

540
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:35,280
 Madam, I was wondering if you were dissatisfied with our asset management. 

541
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,920
No, that's not it.

542
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,620
 I heard you suddenly canceled all your funds. 

543
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:42,460
What?

544
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:44,260
 Didn't you know that? 

545
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:48,710
 The entire amount was withdrawn last Thursday. 

546
00:49:50,216 --> 00:49:52,470
Was it my husband?

547
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:56,000
I don't know because it wasn't canceled at our branch.

548
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,870
So where was the money withdrawn from?

549
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:00,470
It was the Tongyeong branch.

550
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:10,383
   

551
00:50:10,383 --> 00:50:11,990
   

552
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,428
 The shocking truth about Dr. Noh Young Won. 

553
00:50:17,428 --> 00:50:21,536
 Dr. Noh Young Won's husband commits suicide after having an affair. 

554
00:50:21,536 --> 00:50:25,946
 That means they loved each other very much. 

555
00:50:25,946 --> 00:50:28,736
 Dr. Noh's husband committed suicide after having an affair. 

556
00:50:28,736 --> 00:50:30,304
 What was her husband's job? 

557
00:50:30,304 --> 00:50:32,168
 I heard he's a doctor, and she must be pissed off. 

558
00:50:32,168 --> 00:50:33,544
 People who have a lot are more greedy. 

559
00:50:33,544 --> 00:50:35,400
 I think that hospital close. 

560
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,650
Why only my son?

561
00:51:07,168 --> 00:51:10,700
 The one who was going to die canceled the fund.  

562
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,880
 Why did he need the cash… 

563
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:18,220
 Stopped the car as if he knew where the camera was. 

564
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:22,860
 As if he was intentionally trying to give away his location. 

565
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:28,160
 He seems strangely cheerful for someone 

566
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,310
 who was depressed to the point of contemplating suicide. 

567
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:47,150
 So has the small bag really disappeared? 

568
00:51:48,496 --> 00:51:52,084
 Then, in a small bag… 

569
00:52:00,292 --> 00:52:02,670
   

570
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,176
 Se Na, 

571
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,860
 I think I can be truly happy now. 

572
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:45,000
What?

573
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,730
Was it all a play?

574
00:53:27,852 --> 00:53:29,704
Young Won.

575
00:53:29,704 --> 00:53:32,030
What's wrong? What's going on?

576
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:33,860
Are you okay?

577
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:36,712
Yes, I'm okay.

578
00:53:36,712 --> 00:53:39,390
Young Won, you're in big trouble.

579
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:42,260
Did you go to Tongyeong the day before yesterday?

580
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:45,430
Someone took a picture of you in Tongyeong and posted it.

581
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:48,740
The news about the Tongyeong disappearance case

582
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:52,210
spread on the Internet saying it was about you.

583
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,679
   

584
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:01,640
It's nothing. Don't react to it.

585
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:05,280
What? Is that true?

586
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:13,680
Are you going out now?

587
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:18,370
No, there are reporters out there right now.

588
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:20,260
Look at this.

589
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,310
What are you going to do?

590
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:30,080
I won't respond in any way.

591
00:54:31,604 --> 00:54:33,580
Do Hyun.

592
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:36,600
Mom, who are they?

593
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:42,272
What do they mean my dad committed suicide?

594
00:54:42,272 --> 00:54:44,190
That's not it.

595
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:46,020
I'll pick you up.

596
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:48,800
No, just come home right away.

597
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,600
I'll explain it to you.

598
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:51,900
There's chaos in front of the house right now.

599
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,140
People are taking pictures with cameras in front of the house.

600
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:57,270
- Even in front of the house? 
 - Doctor.

601
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:00,710
Now, in the live video…

602
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:07,220
 I think you all came because of the rumors going around, 

603
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:10,920
 but that incident has nothing to do with our family. 

604
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:15,560
Are you saying that Mr. Choi in the disappearance case is not your son?

605
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,024
He is Mr. Choi, right?

606
00:55:18,024 --> 00:55:20,160
No, no, no.

607
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:25,390
It's ridiculous to make such a guess just because the last name is the same…

608
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:28,300
Five percent of the population is surnamed Choi.

609
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,970
Five percent isn't that much. Right?

610
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:34,480
Five percent of fifty million is 2.5 million!

611
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:37,680
Is that 2.5 million low?

612
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,352
If not, where is your son now?

613
00:55:40,352 --> 00:55:43,892
I heard that the hospital run by her son also closed down. What is the reason?

614
00:55:43,892 --> 00:55:49,020
 - Please answer. 
 - Please answer. 

615
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:52,730
Why? Should I tell you everything?

616
00:55:59,816 --> 00:56:02,728
Why is she suddenly like that?

617
00:56:02,728 --> 00:56:03,876
Let's just finish now.

618
00:56:03,876 --> 00:56:07,240
    
 What? An article came out saying that the missing person case was false.

619
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,210
 What? That wasn't true? 

620
00:56:19,076 --> 00:56:20,800
Manager Park,

621
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,790
still, we can't rest assured.

622
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:57,800
 Let me check it first.  Got it. 

623
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:09,870
We definitely need to find him quickly.

624
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:16,080
Looks like you read the article.

625
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:19,980
I told you that our Jae Jin is not dead.

626
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:27,990
Dr. Noh, you also had a lot of hardships.

627
00:57:36,356 --> 00:57:40,600
Of course, I'm still worried that he's with Lee Se Na,

628
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:44,410
but I decided to stop the investigation for now.

629
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:47,364
I can't keep watching my family

630
00:57:47,364 --> 00:57:51,876
become the talk of the world.

631
00:57:51,876 --> 00:57:57,220
So shouldn't we really

632
00:57:57,220 --> 00:58:02,376
find Jae Jin together this time?

633
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,700
Can we find him?

634
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:08,800
He's the guy who pretended to commit suicide and ran away, even writing a will.

635
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,400
This was all planned by Lee Se Na.

636
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,530
You also know that

637
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:17,240
Jae Jin made his own choice, not because of Lee Se Na.

638
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,970
No! It's not.

639
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:22,780
Jae Jin is definitely not that kind of person.

640
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:26,520
Jae Jin is being controlled by Lee Se Na right now.

641
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,710
So we have to save Jae Jin.

642
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:31,590
He's in danger now.

643
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:36,630
I'm not going to look for him anymore.

644
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:38,930
What are you talking about?

645
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:41,400
So are you saying it's okay for Jae Jin to die?

646
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:45,700
Yes, I don't care if he dies.

647
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:50,570
That person is now dead from my life.

648
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:26,200
 Now, no one can find us. 

649
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:46,490
Se Na… I think I can be really happy now.

650
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:13,860
 I think you all came because of the rumors going around, 

651
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:17,731
 but that incident has nothing to do with our family. 

652
01:00:17,731 --> 01:00:21,368
 Are you saying that Mr. Choi in the disappearance case is not your son? 

653
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:23,802
 He is Mr. Choi. Right? 

654
01:00:24,804 --> 01:00:26,339
 No, no, no. 

655
01:00:26,339 --> 01:00:29,730
 They have the same last name, but that doesn't mean it is our Jae Jin. 

656
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,000
Jae Jin.

657
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,000
Your hand.

658
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,170
   

659
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:28,380



660
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,870
 So, what kind of family do you live with? 

661
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:35,880
 Is there something you haven't told me yet? 

662
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:39,240
 Maybe she'll never understand me. 

663
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:42,080
 I'll save you this time. 

664
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:45,250
 According to Lee Se Na's pattern, the fourth is Do Hyun. 

665
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:48,650
 Let's each focus on our own son. 

666
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:51,850
 I'll give him back everything I've been through. 

667
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:54,660
 Do you know what Lee Se Na is really after? 

668
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:57,860
 Everyone will die.
