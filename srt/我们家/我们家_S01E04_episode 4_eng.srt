1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,867
   

2
00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:08,900
There are a lot of pictures of them.

3
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:15,567
Yes, Ms. Lee Se Na, she is Choi Jae Jin's mistress.

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,367
According to the investigation,

5
00:00:19,367 --> 00:00:21,667
Lee Se Na, she's a witch.

6
00:00:21,667 --> 00:00:23,700
Witch?

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,367
Yes.

8
00:00:25,367 --> 00:00:29,767
Her first husband's cause of death was addiction.

9
00:00:29,767 --> 00:00:33,000
But it was true that the fish was poisoned.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,333
The important thing is that she received a significant amount of insurance money

11
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:37,100
The important thing is that she received a significant amount of insurance money

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,567
due to her first husband's death.

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,500
Her second husband's cause of death was drowning.

14
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:46,633
As a result of this accident,

15
00:00:46,633 --> 00:00:49,700
she once again received a significant amount of insurance money.

16
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,633
After going through this, getting married would have been horrible.

17
00:00:52,633 --> 00:00:56,133
She didn't marry the third man.

18
00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:58,600
It was also treated as an accidental death.

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,133
The important thing is that the third man's insurance beneficiary was also Lee Se Na.

20
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:06,567
What a disgusting bitch!

21
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:10,433
I should have taken care of her sooner.

22
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:12,900
Before this happened!

23
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,033
What are you talking about?

24
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:20,400
Did you already know?

25
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:28,967
Since when have you known?

26
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,800
How dare she take my son?!

27
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,600
You knew about their relationship, so that's why you went to the villa that day.

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,033
Why did she take our innocent

29
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:39,767
Dr. Choi away…

30
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,967
Mother! Please answer me.

31
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:45,333
He hasn't done anything wrong…

32
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:48,333
- Lord! 
 - Mother.

33
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:50,967
I guess I was careless too much.

34
00:01:50,967 --> 00:01:54,900
No, I have to report it first.

35
00:01:56,367 --> 00:02:00,533
If you report it, how would you explain this situation?

36
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:03,200
Noh Young Won's husband had an affair and ran away?

37
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,000
Are you going to let everyone know like that?

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,433
He says our Jae Jin is with a witch!

39
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:10,300
Aren't you worried?

40
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,433
What would you do if Jae Jin really died?

41
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm angrier at Jae Jin for falling for that kind of woman.

42
00:02:17,033 --> 00:02:18,600
No.

43
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,933
Our Jae Jin is so naive.

44
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,833
He's so naive that he got fooled.

45
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:28,733
Yes, he was so naive that he fooled me so well for a year.

46
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:30,467
But, Mother,

47
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:35,733
I can't lose what I've built so far because of someone like that!

48
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,400
So, what do you want to do?

49
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:42,167
I'll find him.

50
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:49,067
Wouldn't it be better to die by me than by a witch?

51
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:56,120

52
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:02,067
 I can't accept that he deceived me for so long. 

53
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:05,033
 I was really depressed, so I took psychiatric medication 

54
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:08,767
 and stuff, Doctor. 

55
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:11,367
 I was going to get a divorce, 

56
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:13,800
 but I couldn't do it because of the kids. 

57
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,767
Doctor, today's story is also very frustrating.

58
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:20,700
Her husband had been running another family for a long time without his wife's knowledge,

59
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,933
and even her mother-in-law knew about it.

60
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:26,400
And it's been 15 years.

61
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,867
Isn't it the most difficult thing to know the husband's thoughts?

62
00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:32,800
It breaks my heart

63
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,200
to think of the betrayal and loss

64
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,633
she must be feeling right now.

65
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,900
This is what people call ridiculous.

66
00:03:45,467 --> 00:03:48,067
It's been 15 years, 
    

67
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:53,100
so you might be feeling a bit resigned 
    

68
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,200
and wondering what you can do now.

69
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:01,167
Don't give up.

70
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:04,800
It is clearly your husband's fault.

71
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,067
And the mother-in-law shouldn't do that to her, either.

72
00:04:09,067 --> 00:04:11,533
You are also someone's wife.

73
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:15,600
It makes no sense to only protect her own son.

74
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,600
Just because they are family, should she understand and overcome everything?

75
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:26,067
Is it okay to lie to her for 15 years as a family member?

76
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,833
So,

77
00:04:29,433 --> 00:04:32,067
never blame yourself...

78
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,300
and don't abuse yourself just because you have to endure it.

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,660
Divorce?

80
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,060
No.

81
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:46,433
You should be thoroughly compensated for the 15 years of injustice.

82
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:49,300
You should be thoroughly compensated for the 15 years of injustice.

83
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,260
 - Thank you. 
 - You worked hard. 

84
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,590
 Yes, you've worked hard. 

85
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,400
 Goodbye! 

86
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,633
Wow, your comments were unusually blunt today.

87
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:05,167
I think your husband can't even have an affair because he's scared of you.

88
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:08,067
Am I scary? Me?

89
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,100
See you next week.

90
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,900
A fortune teller I know said you would have bad energy this year.

91
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,567
Do you have any concerns these days? If you have any concerns, tell me.

92
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,967
What will you do if I tell you?

93
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:26,300
Then, we should go see a fortune teller who is close to me.

94
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,800
Go see a fortune teller?

95
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,500
Don't you know I go to church?

96
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,333
Young Won, just think of it as fortune-telling to put your mind at ease.

97
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,467
If you stay still like that, you will suffer from a lot of stress.

98
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:40,733
I think you really need to take care of your mental health.

99
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:43,133
Doctor!

100
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:45,167
- This! 
 - What is this?

101
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:46,267
I don't know, either…

102
00:05:46,267 --> 00:05:50,300
Someone said he's a fan of yours and asked me to forward this to you.

103
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,600
It's a car?

104
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,070
    
 9999?

105
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,333
Who gave this to you?

106
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,133
- What? 
 - Who gave this to you?

107
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:03,467
Young Won, what's wrong?

108
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:06,100
Well, he was at the entrance.

109
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,600
Young Won. Young Won

110
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,700
Wait! Wait!

111
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,967
Wait! Wait!

112
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,933
Who are you?

113
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,067
I'm just a delivery man.

114
00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:44,733
- A delivery man? 
 - Yes.

115
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:47,067
Then, who sent this?

116
00:06:47,067 --> 00:06:48,933
I don't know, either.

117
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:51,367
There must be a sender, right?

118
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:52,967
That person is probably a fan of yours.

119
00:06:52,967 --> 00:06:55,533
- A fan? 
 - Dr. Noh Young Won's fan.

120
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:58,400
Actually, I'm also your fan.

121
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,500
I'm sorry, but

122
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,433
do you have the contact information or name of the person who sent this?

123
00:07:04,433 --> 00:07:07,333
I received the package on the site after receiving the call.

124
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,033
Then, did you see that person's face?

125
00:07:09,033 --> 00:07:13,600
- I saw him, but he was just an ordinary, normal guy. 
 - A guy?

126
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,367
Yes. Just an ordinary, normal guy,

127
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:18,033
no… Was that person a woman?

128
00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:21,767
With a black hat, a black mask, and horn-rimmed glasses…

129
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:24,133
Was that person a woman?

130
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,133
   

131
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,567
 Still don't get it? 

132
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,100
 We fell into a trap. 

133
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:06,167
   

134
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,680
Why didn't Mr. Choi Jae Jin come?

135
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:34,700
- That's actually… 
 - He went to a conference.

136
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,933
Did you say the hidden camera culprit was caught?

137
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:48,900
Yes, it is completely punishable,

138
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:54,133
but it depends on whether the victim shows leniency or not.

139
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:57,900
What will you do? Do you want to see the culprit?

140
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,367
Yes.

141
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,167
You weren't going to talk about Jae Jin. Right?

142
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:11,967
I clearly told you that you can't report it.

143
00:10:11,967 --> 00:10:16,700
Hidden camera footage was discovered, but neither the director nor the vice director showed up.

144
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,733
Isn't it a little weird?

145
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:20,967
It's kind of weird, right?

146
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,133
This happened when there was neither a director

147
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:33,433
nor a vice director.

148
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:34,533
Right.

149
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:39,467
Well, things in this world don't always go as planned.

150
00:10:39,467 --> 00:10:41,400
I know.

151
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,667
But it feels like...

152
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,700
it happened exactly...

153
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:53,367
according to someone's plan.

154
00:11:14,267 --> 00:11:18,067
Park Seung Jae. 35 years old this year. Right?

155
00:11:18,067 --> 00:11:18,967
- Yes. 
 - What do you do for a living?

156
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:19,967
- Yes. 
 - What do you do for a living?

157
00:11:19,967 --> 00:11:23,100
I make corn noodles at a noodle restaurant.

158
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,600
You make noodles at…

159
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,200
No, I make corn noodles at the corn noodle restaurant.

160
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,630
Corn noodles?

161
00:11:33,633 --> 00:11:36,467
Is that… Is that different from banquet noodles?

162
00:11:36,467 --> 00:11:39,700
Yes, it's different from banquet noodles.

163
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,033
Yellow corn noodles!

164
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:44,667
 Yeah, my military colleague. 

165
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:47,700
 Seung Jae, who makes corn noodles at the noodle restaurant. 

166
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,100
All right, so why did you install the hidden cameras?

167
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,800
From the men's locker room, men's restroomto the director's office.

168
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,567
- Well… 
 - Didn't someone tell you to do that?

169
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:03,767
Why don't you speak clearly?

170
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:16,100
I loved the director.

171
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,733
What, suddenly?

172
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:21,960
Yes, suddenly.

173
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,430
No, this is the feeling I had for a long time.

174
00:12:25,433 --> 00:12:28,167
But the director didn't accept my feelings.

175
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:30,600
Do you think that makes sense?

176
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,667
Actually, it makes sense, but...

177
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,400
I think this guy is hiding something.

178
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:48,367
Well, I'll forgive you with a generous heart.

179
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,310
All of a sudden?

180
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,667
"To love another is to see

181
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:03,800
the face of God."

182
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,333
It's a famous quote from "Les Miserables".

183
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:13,767
It means "To love another is to see the face of God."

184
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:15,167
All of a sudden?

185
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:21,000
Park Seung Jae, who makes corn noodles at the corn noodle restaurant.

186
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,800
Yes.

187
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,700
I'll forgive you.

188
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,433
So, please forget about Dr. Choi.

189
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,400
Thank you.

190
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,900
Then, release him right away?

191
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,767
Yes, please.

192
00:13:43,433 --> 00:13:45,367
Let's go, Mother.

193
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,233
By the way, what conference...

194
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:52,467
did the director go to?

195
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:54,867
Is that relevant to this case?

196
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,667
Let's go.

197
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,000
How did you know about him and put him to work?

198
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,833
You are curious about everything. Does that matter now?

199
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,333
I know you're upset because I told you not to report him.

200
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:19,900
Since Jae Jin is not a child, they won't even accept a missing person report.

201
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:24,267
I envy you for being smart.

202
00:14:24,267 --> 00:14:27,000
Son, are you watching?

203
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,600
I'm the only one who cares about you.

204
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,333
- Mother, I also… 
 - You what?

205
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,600
I'll find my son.

206
00:14:54,867 --> 00:14:57,000
Mr. Koo Kyung Tae!

207
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,667
It seems like you are in a very weak psychological state.

208
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:06,233
Please come to the hospital.

209
00:15:06,233 --> 00:15:09,400
I'll give you special advice.

210
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,500
   

211
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,533
I'm fine.

212
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:33,033
I just made the noodles.

213
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:35,700
Did you have to do that?

214
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,200
Boiling the noodles before eating makes them chewier.

215
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,433
No, not that one.

216
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:46,000
I didn't know my nephew would say he loves Dr. Choi.

217
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,433
No! Not that one.

218
00:15:49,433 --> 00:15:52,633
Did it have to be a hidden camera?

219
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,367
It was the only way to close the hospital without anyone getting hurt.

220
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,867
Your nephew was good at keeping secrets, though.

221
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:16,100
Then, try this noodle.

222
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,033
No!

223
00:16:18,033 --> 00:16:20,867
I don't have time to eat noodles right now.

224
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:26,000
Since she won't even let me report it,

225
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,933
I have to find him faster.

226
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:31,033
I'm checking the CCTV in Yangpyeong,

227
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:33,833
but the amount is so huge.

228
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:40,900
Koo Kyung Tae.

229
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:44,633
Go to see Koo Kyung Tae.

230
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:47,633
Koo Kyung Tae,

231
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:50,433
Dr. Oh's boyfriend who became a police officer after 15 years?

232
00:16:50,433 --> 00:16:52,667
Dr. Oh's boyfriend who became a police officer after 15 years?

233
00:16:53,967 --> 00:16:55,933
Sometimes,

234
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,467
I hate myself.

235
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,733
Sometimes,

236
00:17:03,033 --> 00:17:05,633
I cry alone.

237
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:10,933
Why do you hate yourself?

238
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,900
Can you tell me when you feel that way?

239
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,300
When there's nothing I can do.

240
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,000
Like now.

241
00:17:24,967 --> 00:17:28,867
I can't find Ji Eun.

242
00:17:36,867 --> 00:17:43,100
Actually, I found Ji Eun's cell phone at her place.

243
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,900
But there was a picture of Dr. Choi on her cell phone.

244
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,167
Mr. Koo, I'll be honest with you.

245
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:05,900
My husband, Choi Jae Jin didn't go on a business trip.

246
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,467
- He disappeared. 
 - What?

247
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:10,233
Are you saying that...

248
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,700
you can't reach your husband, either?

249
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,433
Yes.

250
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:21,067
The director and vice director both disappeared.

251
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:22,533
Isn't that strange?

252
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:24,533
See!

253
00:18:24,533 --> 00:18:27,833
I told you it was strange.

254
00:18:32,367 --> 00:18:36,900
Maybe those two…

255
00:18:38,433 --> 00:18:40,633
No! No!

256
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,890
That can't happen.

257
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,200
I don't know,

258
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,167
but I'm pretty sure they're both gone.

259
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:52,500
I can't talk about this anywhere.

260
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,000
But, Mr. Koo,

261
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,100
you're a police officer. Right?

262
00:18:57,967 --> 00:19:02,733
A police officer who became a police officer after 15 years without giving up.

263
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:07,933
Let's not give up and find them together until the end.

264
00:19:08,467 --> 00:19:12,333
Let's start by looking for the director's car.

265
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:16,567
Then, I think we can find out where Ji Eun is.

266
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,900
All right.

267
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:25,467
But why did your uncle ask you to install hidden cameras in the hospital?

268
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:27,433
I don't know.

269
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,833
You should have asked that first.

270
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:33,167
Idiot, if you did something wrong, you could have a criminal record.

271
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:37,833
When my uncle asks me to dosomething like that, there's a reason.

272
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:41,867
I don't know if I can understand my uncle's intentions or not.

273
00:19:41,867 --> 00:19:44,400
How could I dare to ask my uncle?

274
00:19:46,033 --> 00:19:50,367
Anyway, did you meet Jae Jin at the police station? My brother-in-law?

275
00:19:50,367 --> 00:19:54,000
No, I heard he went on a business trip.

276
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:58,767
The police were also whispering that the director and vice director were not there.

277
00:19:58,767 --> 00:20:02,167
A business trip? Do doctors also go on business trips?

278
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,400
That's why he couldn't be reached.

279
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,133
Hey, you… Didn't you eat anything there?

280
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:09,800
You're eating so well.

281
00:20:10,633 --> 00:20:13,067
So messy around your mouth.

282
00:20:32,133 --> 00:20:33,933
9999.

283
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,780
   

284
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:53,033
Uncle! What are you doing here?

285
00:20:53,033 --> 00:20:56,933
I came to see how my future nephew-in-law is doing.

286
00:20:57,733 --> 00:21:00,367
Nephew-in-law.

287
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:02,500
Please have a seat.

288
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:10,267
I guess you're tracking something.

289
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,700
- Actually… 
 - Yeah.

290
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:18,233
It seems like Ji Eun is with the hospital director.

291
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:19,767
So,

292
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,433
of course, I still don't believe it!

293
00:21:22,433 --> 00:21:23,967
Is that the hospital director's car?

294
00:21:23,967 --> 00:21:28,833
Yes, the director's car continued to go south.

295
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,533
Here, try this one.

296
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:36,767
He stopped by here on his way south…

297
00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:38,867
- One more… 
 - Thank you.

298
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,300
You're back.

299
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:55,833
Do Hyun is taking private lessons with Mr. Moon.

300
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,867
All right.

301
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,700
Jae Jin?

302
00:22:33,867 --> 00:22:36,200
You are back?

303
00:22:38,067 --> 00:22:40,800
Because I spilled some juice!

304
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:45,367
Do Hyun told me to change into Jae Jin's clothes, so I came in here,

305
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:48,333
but why does he have so many pretty clothes?

306
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:51,800
Because I'm interested in fashion.

307
00:22:57,267 --> 00:22:58,600
 Then, see you tomorrow! 

308
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,633
 Yeah, you did a great job! I'll go. 

309
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:01,867
 Yes, goodbye. 

310
00:23:01,867 --> 00:23:04,033
 Yes. 

311
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,933
Son.

312
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:10,867
Want to have a beer with me?

313
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:12,267
Beer?

314
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:13,867
Yes.

315
00:23:14,967 --> 00:23:18,133
Are you going to pretend you don't know how?

316
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:21,067
Do you think I don't know that your dad gives you beer?

317
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:25,800
Last time, you were giggling with your dad because you thought I didn't know it.

318
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:29,133
Mom, you really knew everything.

319
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,233
You really know everything about us.

320
00:23:32,233 --> 00:23:34,233
Cheers.

321
00:23:42,033 --> 00:23:46,233
But, Mom, Dad has never been like this before. Right?

322
00:23:46,233 --> 00:23:49,000
He's been away on business for this long.

323
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,670
Right.

324
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,267
I guess your dad needs a break, too.

325
00:23:57,267 --> 00:23:59,967
Do Hyun, would you like to skip academy and tutoring for a week this vacation

326
00:23:59,967 --> 00:24:01,633
Do Hyun, would you like to skip academy and tutoring for a week this vacation

327
00:24:01,633 --> 00:24:05,600
and go on a trip with me?

328
00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:08,733
- Really? 
 - Yes.

329
00:24:09,367 --> 00:24:11,867
I want to see the sea.

330
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:16,200
Let's do that.

331
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:31,267
 Dr. Noh Young Won! I finally figured it out. 

332
00:24:31,267 --> 00:24:34,333
 See you tomorrow at the flood plain. 

333
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:52,100
Did you find it?

334
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:56,667
I stayed up all night...

335
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:02,133
and searched CCTV footage from Yangpyeong

336
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:04,467
to other highway toll gates.

337
00:25:07,467 --> 00:25:11,733
He left Yangpyeong and went down the highway.

338
00:25:11,733 --> 00:25:14,467
So I searched all along that road.

339
00:25:14,467 --> 00:25:17,633
He continued to pass through

340
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:22,400
South Icheon, Hamyang, and Goseong toll gates.

341
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,633
And headed south. And then?

342
00:25:25,633 --> 00:25:29,200
The last toll gate he stopped at

343
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,433
was Tongyeong.

344
00:25:32,267 --> 00:25:34,633
Of course, I have to look again to see

345
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:37,533
where he went from there.

346
00:25:37,533 --> 00:25:41,767
The important thing is whether or not

347
00:25:41,767 --> 00:25:44,600
Ji Eun was sitting next to your husband!

348
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,867
The only way to find out...

349
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,800
is a speeding ticket.

350
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,200
He got a speeding ticket.

351
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,400
Here, look.

352
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,900
There's someone sitting next to him here.

353
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:03,033
Now look. Can you see it?

354
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:06,833
I can't see it.

355
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:09,200
I can't see it clearly.

356
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,400
Then, we can't confirm itight?

357
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,767
No.

358
00:26:13,767 --> 00:26:15,733
I'm not the one giving up here!

359
00:26:15,733 --> 00:26:18,200
Judging by the circumstances,

360
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,433
If he had gone that far, he would have filled the car with gas.

361
00:26:21,433 --> 00:26:23,333
He also had to go to the bathroom!

362
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:25,200
- A rest area? 
 - Bingo.

363
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,467
I found the car right away on the CCTV at a rest area.

364
00:26:30,467 --> 00:26:35,033
If you look here, before leaving the rest area, they stopped at a gas station.

365
00:26:35,033 --> 00:26:38,767
And the two got out of the car while refueling.

366
00:26:42,967 --> 00:26:46,400
It must be frustrating for them too, I guess.

367
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,500
See, it was not Ji Eun!

368
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:54,633
I was so scared that the person next to him was our Ji Eun.

369
00:26:59,567 --> 00:27:01,500
But, Doctor,

370
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,900
I looked closely.

371
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,533
I think your husband...

372
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,967
is having an affair.

373
00:27:10,967 --> 00:27:14,967
Even if he has a popular and famous wife…

374
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,733
You've worked hard.

375
00:27:19,433 --> 00:27:22,833
But then, where did Ji Eun go?

376
00:27:23,533 --> 00:27:25,060
Doctor.

377
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,933
Are you just leaving?

378
00:27:27,933 --> 00:27:30,133
So when is my next consultation?

379
00:27:30,133 --> 00:27:31,800
Tomorrow?

380
00:27:32,533 --> 00:27:34,800
I'll contact you.

381
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:38,400
Yes.

382
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,633
Please contact me.

383
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,700
 Honey. 

384
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,000
   

385
00:29:12,867 --> 00:29:15,067
Excuse me.

386
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:45,180
♫  Well, I worked hard, yes, everything went as I wanted  ♫

387
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:51,560
♫  It seems like it's not working  ♫

388
00:29:51,567 --> 00:29:53,400
Fuck.

389
00:29:54,800 --> 00:30:00,550
♫  How pathetic (I am) Do you hate...? (This world)  ♫

390
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:06,290
♫  Are you lonely?  ♫

391
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,300
   

392
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,470
   

393
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:48,067
Rest area in Hamyang?

394
00:30:49,667 --> 00:30:52,567
Is she heading to Gyeongsangnam Province?

395
00:31:16,033 --> 00:31:18,767
 Go to see Koo Kyung Tae. 

396
00:31:18,767 --> 00:31:20,733
 Koo Kyung Tae, 

397
00:31:20,733 --> 00:31:25,767
 Dr. Oh's boyfriend who became a police officer after 15 years? 

398
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,500
 Why did Dr. Noh give him a business card? 

399
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,400
 Was it because she wanted him to visit her hospital? 

400
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:40,200
 What does it mean when the busy Dr. Noh calls him to the hospital? 

401
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:43,400
 Try to use him? 

402
00:31:45,033 --> 00:31:48,367
 Koo Kyung Tae must have seen our Jae Jin's photo on Dr. Oh's phone 

403
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:52,900
 and must have suspected something between the two of them. 

404
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:57,933
 Moreover, Dr. Oh's car was hidden by the manager, so it won't be traceable. 

405
00:31:57,933 --> 00:32:01,867
 Then, whose car would he be tracking? 

406
00:32:01,867 --> 00:32:06,500
 As expected, you are the Agatha Christie of Korea! 

407
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,700
See, Son.

408
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,833
I told you I would find you. Right?

409
00:32:45,133 --> 00:32:46,900
Are you surprised?

410
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,200
How did you know I was here?

411
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,467
I'm the Agatha Christie of Korea.

412
00:32:51,467 --> 00:32:53,867
This is what a detective's reasoning is like.

413
00:32:53,867 --> 00:32:57,033
This is different from someone who uses psychology

414
00:32:57,033 --> 00:32:59,667
to deceive others.

415
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:02,867
Anyway, finding Jae Jin is the priority.

416
00:33:02,867 --> 00:33:04,067
Right.

417
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:06,133
Wouldn't it be okay if Jae Jin returned safely?

418
00:33:06,133 --> 00:33:08,100
Wouldn't it be okay if Jae Jin returned safely?

419
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,233
If he comes back safely, that's it?

420
00:33:11,233 --> 00:33:12,333
No!

421
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:15,833
Even if he comes back, that's not all.

422
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,300
But why did you hide coming here from me?

423
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,100
You're really good at hiding things.

424
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,367
Not as much as you, though.

425
00:33:24,367 --> 00:33:26,033
Oh my.

426
00:33:26,033 --> 00:33:29,700
You get better at making fun of me every day.

427
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,467
Anyway, Dr. Noh?

428
00:33:33,467 --> 00:33:35,633
We're a team now.

429
00:33:35,633 --> 00:33:39,800
Shouldn't we find Jae Jin together?

430
00:33:56,133 --> 00:33:59,667
As expected from someone who ran away, he has come a long way.

431
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:02,400
Tongyeong is

432
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,200
a special place for me and Dr. Choi.

433
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,967
I first brought Jae Jin here when he was little.

434
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:14,200
As of now, it would be like a field trip.

435
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:20,100
I wanted to show Dr. Choi the poet's village.

436
00:34:21,467 --> 00:34:26,100
Maybe Dr. Choi also came here

437
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,233
because of memories from that time.

438
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:35,300
This is a silent cry,

439
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,933
an eternal handkerchief of nostalgia,

440
00:34:39,933 --> 00:34:43,733
waving toward that vast blue ocean.

441
00:34:44,267 --> 00:34:48,333
Pure love flutters in the wind like waves

442
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:52,767
hung on a post of only clear and straight ideology.

443
00:34:52,767 --> 00:34:56,670
Sorrow spreads its wings like a white heron.

444
00:34:57,367 --> 00:35:00,600
Ah! Who is the person?

445
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:04,500
Who was the first to know how to hang the mind of heartrending sorrow

446
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:09,100
in the air for the first time?

447
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:20,070
♫  Life is an endless adventure  ♫

448
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,430
♫  Happiness is special  ♫

449
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:31,090
♫  Hidden in all the small moments  ♫

450
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:36,500
♫  Life is a gift  ♫

451
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:47,190
♫  A treasure to be cherished  ♫

452
00:36:04,567 --> 00:36:07,733
It must be here somewhere.

453
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,333
You're right. It's here.

454
00:36:27,067 --> 00:36:29,110
   

455
00:36:33,267 --> 00:36:36,833
- I guess… 
 - I know. I was going to go.

456
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:39,167
Because it's related to my son.

457
00:36:40,233 --> 00:36:42,800
Why did you appear on TV?

458
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,090
   

459
00:37:36,033 --> 00:37:38,500
Hello?

460
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,633
Who are you?

461
00:37:51,633 --> 00:37:55,067
Hello, everyone.

462
00:37:55,067 --> 00:37:59,133
I came here to ask you something.

463
00:37:59,133 --> 00:38:01,067
What do you want to ask?

464
00:38:01,067 --> 00:38:03,400
9999.

465
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:08,667
I'm looking for the owner of that car right now.

466
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:10,233
Does anyone know anything about this?

467
00:38:10,233 --> 00:38:12,400
Do you know the owner of that car?

468
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,100
The car owner is my son.

469
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,833
Oh, that's great!

470
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:19,133
Even if I call him, he doesn't answer.

471
00:38:19,133 --> 00:38:20,633
Have you been unable to reach him?

472
00:38:20,633 --> 00:38:23,267
Didn't he come the day before yesterday?

473
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:24,833
Didn't he say he was going to Yokji Island?

474
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:27,700
He rented a car from our store.

475
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,933
He came with a woman.

476
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,767
Where's Yokji Island?

477
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:34,900
It takes about an hour by boat from here.

478
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,233
You can't take the boat now,

479
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:40,433
but you can take the first boat tomorrow.

480
00:38:40,433 --> 00:38:43,333
Oh, you said it's your son. Right?

481
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:44,770
Yes.

482
00:38:45,767 --> 00:38:49,367
Then, please pay for us.

483
00:38:50,667 --> 00:38:52,667
Shall I?

484
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,233
There won't be wine, right?

485
00:39:07,233 --> 00:39:08,960
Yes.

486
00:39:31,233 --> 00:39:33,400
I feel relieved.

487
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,800
Since it's an island, wouldn't it be a matter of time before we find him?

488
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,167
Since it's an island, wouldn't it be a matter of time before we find him?

489
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:41,000
Is this something we can be relieved about?

490
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,733
I'm here to catch my cheating husband.

491
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,333
Dr. Noh,

492
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:50,500
I know very well how Jae Jin,

493
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,167
with his delicate heart,

494
00:39:53,167 --> 00:39:57,033
was fooled by her scary words.

495
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,500
And there are times when men act like that.

496
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:05,367
Especially from Dr. Choi's perspective,

497
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:09,567
he might be curious about a woman who is completely

498
00:40:09,567 --> 00:40:14,433
different from his perfect wife, like you.

499
00:40:15,367 --> 00:40:20,367
It's not like cheating is passed down to the next generation…

500
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,967
How did you feel when your husband cheated on you?

501
00:40:31,933 --> 00:40:34,133
I didn't expect anything.

502
00:40:34,133 --> 00:40:37,633
Then, suddenly I realized

503
00:40:37,633 --> 00:40:40,367
I should have expected something from him.

504
00:40:40,967 --> 00:40:45,833
At least then, he would have been able to blame himself

505
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:48,300
for deceiving his family.

506
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:52,367
So are you saying that I should expect something from Jae Jin?

507
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:53,800
Until the end?

508
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,367
Still, Jae Jin listened to you well.

509
00:40:57,367 --> 00:40:59,400
What does that matter?

510
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,067
That was all just to deceive me.

511
00:41:02,067 --> 00:41:04,033
Dr. Noh,

512
00:41:04,033 --> 00:41:07,767
I don't want you to understand our Jae Jin.

513
00:41:07,767 --> 00:41:10,600
But you have to think about family.

514
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,567
You've lived up to our family's expectations.

515
00:41:14,567 --> 00:41:17,233
Are you confident of abandoning that?

516
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:22,900
Are you confident that you can throw away everything you have built up until now?

517
00:41:25,767 --> 00:41:28,833
I guess it was all just for you.

518
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:31,867
Was I really part of the family?

519
00:41:31,867 --> 00:41:35,800
If Do Hyun were in this situation, what would you do?

520
00:41:37,467 --> 00:41:39,533
As a poet said,

521
00:41:39,533 --> 00:41:41,900
isn't it the heart of a mother

522
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:46,167
who becomes desperate...

523
00:41:49,133 --> 00:41:52,000
just by calling her son?

524
00:41:52,633 --> 00:41:56,167
You and me, before we are women, we are mothers.

525
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,650
   

526
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,033
Welcome.

527
00:42:26,033 --> 00:42:28,100
I told him to come.

528
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,600
It's not easy to search the island.

529
00:42:33,033 --> 00:42:35,867
Hello. I am Park Kang Seong.

530
00:42:35,867 --> 00:42:39,233
Hello, we have met before. Right?

531
00:42:39,233 --> 00:42:43,767
The one who discovered the hidden camera in the hospital and Dr. Oh's uncle.

532
00:42:43,767 --> 00:42:47,267
It just so happened… I feel sorry for that.

533
00:42:47,267 --> 00:42:49,733
Did you find out about that rental car?

534
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:54,633
Yes. I tracked it down and there was a record of him boarding a ship heading to Yokji Island,

535
00:42:54,633 --> 00:42:56,733
but there was no record of him coming back.

536
00:42:56,733 --> 00:42:58,633
I think they're still on the island.

537
00:42:58,633 --> 00:43:01,267
Lord! That's a relief.

538
00:43:01,267 --> 00:43:04,333
By the way, what time is the first boat to the island?

539
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:07,633
Yeah, I'll look into that.

540
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,767
Why did you call me all the way to Tongyeong?

541
00:43:16,067 --> 00:43:18,467
Oh, my sister's mother-in-law is also here.

542
00:43:18,467 --> 00:43:20,033
Hello.

543
00:43:20,033 --> 00:43:22,267
I called him.

544
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:26,500
Why is Seung Jae's uncle here?

545
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,767
Seung Jae?

546
00:43:27,767 --> 00:43:32,067
Seung Jae, who makes corn noodles at the corn noodle restaurant?

547
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:39,033
Then, the friend of Dr. Noh's brother is Manager Park's nephew?

548
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:43,733
Then, you're the old lady that Seung Jae's uncle serves?

549
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,133
What?

550
00:43:52,133 --> 00:43:55,567
Jae Jin is on an island with some woman?

551
00:43:55,567 --> 00:43:57,700
He's crazy.

552
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,167
Calm down.

553
00:43:59,167 --> 00:44:03,900
I called you because I'm not in a situation where I can go around freely right now,

554
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,200
but I didn't know that Manager Park would come.

555
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:11,233
Sis, since Seung Jae's uncle serves your mother-in-law,

556
00:44:11,233 --> 00:44:13,367
I will serve you!

557
00:44:13,367 --> 00:44:15,200
Don't worry.

558
00:44:18,933 --> 00:44:22,033
Are you leaving? Go first.

559
00:44:25,767 --> 00:44:27,067
 Jae Jin! Where are you? 

560
00:44:27,067 --> 00:44:29,833
 My sister is going to Yokji Island to catch you! 

561
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,633
 If you see this, contact me first. 

562
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,000
   

563
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,633
Dr. Oh, are you okay?

564
00:44:51,633 --> 00:44:54,167
Are you all right?

565
00:44:54,167 --> 00:44:57,267
 Yes, Mrs. Hong. 

566
00:44:57,267 --> 00:44:59,300
What's wrong with her?

567
00:45:00,467 --> 00:45:01,933
Why is she talking like that?

568
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:06,233
 Oh, yes, she's a little slurred now, 

569
00:45:06,233 --> 00:45:08,967
but she'll be fine if you wait a little bit.

570
00:45:08,967 --> 00:45:10,667
Here.

571
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:15,633
Dr. Oh, do you remember that day? You went to the villa. Right?

572
00:45:16,267 --> 00:45:17,700
Yes.

573
00:45:20,067 --> 00:45:23,933
I went to the villa.

574
00:45:23,933 --> 00:45:27,333
Oh, it's frustrating. Can't we just talk through text?

575
00:45:27,333 --> 00:45:29,333
Mother, wait.

576
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:34,267
Dr. Oh, did you see Jae Jin at the villa?

577
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:40,033
What? Did she say no?

578
00:45:40,033 --> 00:45:42,067
I couldn't...

579
00:45:43,633 --> 00:45:46,333
even meet the director.

580
00:45:49,767 --> 00:45:51,800
She said we were going to die.

581
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,700
What?

582
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:58,000
She said we were all going to die.

583
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,467
 We are all going to die. 

584
00:46:03,667 --> 00:46:06,200
 We are all going to die! 

585
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,067
Doctor!

586
00:46:08,067 --> 00:46:10,200
Jae Jin is going to die!

587
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,667
It's a symptom of shock.

588
00:46:11,667 --> 00:46:14,967
 I'll calm her down and get back to you. 

589
00:46:14,967 --> 00:46:16,600
 Nurse… 

590
00:46:18,767 --> 00:46:21,067
What is she saying?

591
00:46:37,533 --> 00:46:41,733
   

592
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:09,633
When did those two start meeting?

593
00:47:11,467 --> 00:47:13,900
About a year and a half ago?

594
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,500
It must have been about that time.

595
00:47:17,933 --> 00:47:21,533
I was the only one who didn't know about it until now.

596
00:47:21,533 --> 00:47:25,767
I also recently found out that they were still seeing each other.

597
00:47:27,867 --> 00:47:32,233
I thought they broke up then.

598
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,000
I got the feeling that she wasn't an ordinary patient.

599
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,633
I felt something strong about her.

600
00:47:55,233 --> 00:47:59,633
It was around that time that Jae Jin started to change.

601
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,600
 Hello? 

602
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,200
 Would you like to have lunch? 

603
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,400
 Please give me dessert first. 

604
00:48:38,233 --> 00:48:42,133
You might not know it, but I know my son.

605
00:48:43,267 --> 00:48:46,933
That's why you kept quiet even after knowing about their relationship.

606
00:48:46,933 --> 00:48:50,733
No, I didn't stay quiet.

607
00:49:17,967 --> 00:49:20,733
 You are the author Hong Sa Gang. Right? 

608
00:49:20,733 --> 00:49:23,133
 I'm your biggest fan. 

609
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:42,350
 A mother's heart is... 

610
00:49:43,033 --> 00:49:45,633
 beautiful... 

611
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:48,367
 but sad. 

612
00:49:48,367 --> 00:49:50,067
She was so bold.

613
00:49:50,067 --> 00:49:54,200
Now that I think about it, she was something else.

614
00:49:55,467 --> 00:49:58,967
Surprisingly, she understood what I said right away.

615
00:49:58,967 --> 00:50:01,833
She accepted the check, so it was all over then.

616
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:04,667
I thought it was.

617
00:50:04,667 --> 00:50:07,420
Jae Jin also said that they broke up.

618
00:50:08,033 --> 00:50:11,033
Why didn't you tell me?

619
00:50:12,333 --> 00:50:14,500
Because we're family.

620
00:50:20,967 --> 00:50:24,400
How did we get this far?

621
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,633
But why is she doing this?

622
00:50:27,633 --> 00:50:29,333
You said she was so bold.

623
00:50:29,333 --> 00:50:33,267
Why did she take the money and then do it again?

624
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,733
Dr. Noh,

625
00:50:35,733 --> 00:50:38,810
what kind of psychology is this?

626
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:42,667
I think they just cheated.

627
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,900
As the detective said, they had been seeing each other for too long

628
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:50,300
to have been aiming for the insurance money.

629
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,333
Something is strange.

630
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:55,633
What kind of psychology is this?

631
00:50:55,633 --> 00:50:57,133
Mother,

632
00:50:57,133 --> 00:51:01,267
why do you ask questions and not listen to the answers?

633
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:04,230
Did I do that?

634
00:51:04,833 --> 00:51:06,800
Dr. Noh,

635
00:51:07,567 --> 00:51:11,833
don't be too sensitive. Your skin might age.

636
00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:32,367
 I think I saw her on TV. 

637
00:51:32,367 --> 00:51:34,433
 - Me too. 
 - Who is she? 

638
00:51:34,433 --> 00:51:35,967
 - Isn't she Dr. Noh Young Won?  
 - No, she's not.

639
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:38,167
 She's so pretty. 

640
00:52:03,167 --> 00:52:05,200
Young Min,

641
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,100
start by looking at the CCTV over there.

642
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:11,167
Now? Without even having lunch?

643
00:52:11,167 --> 00:52:16,533
Fine, why are you making me work without even feeding me?

644
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:17,933
Hurry.

645
00:52:17,933 --> 00:52:20,933
All right, I'll go.

646
00:52:24,667 --> 00:52:25,833
She's so pretty.

647
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:27,967
She's so cool.

648
00:52:37,967 --> 00:52:40,367
Get in the car now.

649
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,333
Why did you appear on TV?

650
00:52:49,767 --> 00:52:51,500
- Let's go now. 
 - Yes.

651
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,067
- Manager Park. 
 - Yes.

652
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,633
Where is the best restaurant around here?

653
00:52:57,633 --> 00:52:58,867
The best restaurant?

654
00:52:58,867 --> 00:53:01,600
Our Jae Jin is a gourmet. Right?

655
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:04,600
You don't know anything about your own husband.

656
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:08,700
Even though our Jae Jin eats little,

657
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,633
he really likes seasonal food.

658
00:53:12,267 --> 00:53:15,400
He is a passionate gourmet who seeks out delicious restaurants

659
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,833
wherever he goes.

660
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:23,367
He must have stopped by the best restaurant first.

661
00:53:33,267 --> 00:53:35,333
I found the best restaurant around here.

662
00:53:35,333 --> 00:53:37,367
Where is it?

663
00:53:37,933 --> 00:53:40,167
It's the gesaeki jjambbong restaurant.

664
00:53:40,167 --> 00:53:42,767
- What? 
 - Gaesaekki jjambbong.  (Gaesaekki is a curse word in Korean) 

665
00:53:43,667 --> 00:53:44,867
No.

666
00:53:44,867 --> 00:53:48,567
It's gesaeki jjambbong with crab, shrimp,

667
00:53:48,567 --> 00:53:50,500
and scallops.

668
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:53,633
It's known as a restaurant that people must visit when they come to the island.

669
00:53:53,633 --> 00:53:56,700
It sounds delicious. Gaesaekki jjambbong.

670
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,333
Mother.

671
00:53:58,333 --> 00:54:01,033
It's gesaeki jjambbong.

672
00:54:01,033 --> 00:54:03,633
Gaesaekki jjambbong.

673
00:54:03,633 --> 00:54:06,400
Then let's get going.

674
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,733
Did you bring a photo of Lee Se Na?

675
00:54:30,733 --> 00:54:34,467
Yes, but why the photo…

676
00:54:34,467 --> 00:54:38,733
I can't say I'm looking for a son who's over 40 years old. Right?

677
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,267
As expected…

678
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Will you stay in the car?

679
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,400
I know! There's no benefit to you from being known.

680
00:55:03,567 --> 00:55:05,933
Has this person been here before?

681
00:55:05,933 --> 00:55:09,000
How can I remember all the guests?

682
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,133
I'm busy, so go away.

683
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,900
I know you're busy.

684
00:55:18,833 --> 00:55:20,900
   

685
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:24,500
I am also a person who makes noodles.

686
00:55:25,367 --> 00:55:28,300
Just take a short break.

687
00:55:35,767 --> 00:55:37,933
She looks familiar.

688
00:55:37,933 --> 00:55:40,700
Have you seen her?

689
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,733
Isn't that her? Three days ago?

690
00:55:42,733 --> 00:55:45,100
- Don't you remember, boss? 
 - I don't remember.

691
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:48,600
Those two… The two of them came and ordered a lot

692
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:52,167
A very pretty woman and a man who ate a lot.

693
00:55:52,167 --> 00:55:55,867
Oh, I remember! Those amazing people.

694
00:55:55,867 --> 00:55:57,267
Didn't she sit over there and eat?

695
00:55:57,267 --> 00:55:59,100
Oh, right!

696
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:03,300
That man ate so much, so I remember him.

697
00:56:05,767 --> 00:56:08,100
 It's delicious, eat. 

698
00:56:18,967 --> 00:56:21,300
 - Why? 
 - It feels like I'm watching a mukbang. (An online eating show) 

699
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:24,067
 - You're so funny. 
 - Yeah? 

700
00:56:24,067 --> 00:56:28,033
 Then, should I change my career path at this point? 

701
00:56:28,033 --> 00:56:31,100
 Today, we are eating Chinese food. 

702
00:56:32,267 --> 00:56:34,333
 I should mix it with rice. 

703
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:42,800
Wait a minute!

704
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,200
Did you just say he ate a lot?

705
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:50,800
Aren't you mistaking him for someone else?

706
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,533
My child eats little.

707
00:56:54,533 --> 00:56:57,067
He eats mostly salad and protein.

708
00:56:57,067 --> 00:57:00,267
Yes, that pretty woman didn't eat much.

709
00:57:00,267 --> 00:57:03,867
That guy ate a lot.

710
00:57:03,867 --> 00:57:05,800
I really thought he was filming a mukbang

711
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,433
with gesaeki jjambbong, sweet and sour pork,

712
00:57:08,433 --> 00:57:10,400
stir-fried seafood and beef,

713
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,167
five-spice pork, and palbochae.

714
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:15,700
I really feel sorry for your daughter.

715
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:18,167
I just thought that since that man had a lot of money,

716
00:57:18,167 --> 00:57:22,433
even if he ate like that, that woman would go out with him.

717
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:29,200
Manager Park, let's just go now!

718
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,967
Why is it so loud outside in the morning?

719
00:57:35,967 --> 00:57:38,800
I don't know. It's a total mess over there.

720
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,467
They say someone committed suicide.

721
00:57:40,467 --> 00:57:43,233
I heard that a car was found in the sea.

722
00:57:45,133 --> 00:57:50,433
 All the men associated with her are dead. 

723
00:57:57,167 --> 00:57:59,767
 What's going on? 

724
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,500
I'll talk to you later.

725
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:04,667
It's strange that you suddenly told me to cancel all your schedules.

726
00:58:04,667 --> 00:58:07,033
You've never canceled or anything like that.

727
00:58:07,033 --> 00:58:08,867
Oh, Young Won!

728
00:58:08,867 --> 00:58:12,867
A fortune teller I know said you have to go south.

729
00:58:12,867 --> 00:58:15,000
South?

730
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,867
That fortune teller is pretty good at guessing.

731
00:58:21,633 --> 00:58:23,967
Dr. Noh, get on now!

732
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:26,000
I'll call you again.

733
00:58:27,533 --> 00:58:29,967
Where are we going now?

734
00:58:29,967 --> 00:58:32,467
Did you find him?

735
00:58:33,867 --> 00:58:36,800
A car was found in the sea.

736
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:38,700
A car?

737
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,090
Yes.

738
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,270
That's not the car. Right?

739
01:00:08,933 --> 01:00:11,900
Heo 2949.

740
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:14,700
That is the car number that Dr. Choi rented.

741
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:16,480
Oh my.

742
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:41,310
Oh no, Mother!

743
01:01:00,667 --> 01:01:03,790
   

744
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:14,170

745
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:35,100
 There are things you don't know. 

746
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:36,733
 Are you feeling comfortable now? 

747
01:01:36,733 --> 01:01:40,933
 I told you we had to report him. 

748
01:01:40,933 --> 01:01:42,833
 I'm so annoyed that I don't know why he died, 

749
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:44,333
 I'm so annoyed that I don't know why he died, 

750
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:45,967
 but I don't know what's going on. 

751
01:01:45,967 --> 01:01:48,533
 I don't even know what's real and what's fake. 

752
01:01:48,533 --> 01:01:51,400
 Is this the family I used to know? I don't know that, either. 

753
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,033
 Everyone will die. 

754
01:01:53,033 --> 01:01:54,267
 You arrived early. 

755
01:01:54,267 --> 01:01:55,700
 I'm scared too. 

756
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:57,600
 But what should I do? 

757
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,600
 I'm Do Hyun's mother. 

758
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,467
 I can't break down like this.
