1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,033
   

2
00:00:09,867 --> 00:00:15,433
    
 An attitude of trying to control others by taking advantage of their weaknesses.

3
00:00:17,633 --> 00:00:22,200
She is a typical narcissist who thinks she has the upper hand in the game.

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,667
Yeah? Well then, we can take advantage of that.

5
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:28,233
To bring out the hidden Lee Se Na,

6
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:29,600
such people have a hard time

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,667
enduring it and become angry when they fail to achieve what they want to achieve

8
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:36,000
or when their mistakes are revealed.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,667
Like a child who can't control her emotions.

10
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:43,233
I know, there are kids who lie on the ground and throw a tantrum

11
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:45,533
if their mothers don't buy them something they ask for.

12
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:46,800
It's the same thing.

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,233
Yeah, that's what it is.

14
00:00:49,233 --> 00:00:51,300
That's right.

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,967
If you make her angry and upset,

16
00:00:54,967 --> 00:00:59,567
she will not know what to do and will lose control of herself.

17
00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:03,867
Then she'll probably show up and throw a tantrum like a child.

18
00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:08,633
Well then, I guess I shouldn't just give her what she wants.

19
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:10,800
Yeah.

20
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:15,033
By the way, what did you decide to do with the press conference?

21
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:20,067
I think Do Hyun is right.

22
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,100
If we really care about and respect Do Hyun,

23
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,300
I don't think we should think of the revelation as a threat.

24
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:34,733
Do Hyun didn't do anything shameful or wrong.

25
00:01:35,867 --> 00:01:39,967
Then, you should hold a press conference confidently.

26
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:45,600
Since Lee Se Na has staked the game, shall we begin?

27
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:59,950



28
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:08,890
   

29
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,533
I'm a hypocrite.

30
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:19,967
Are the words spoken during cross-examination legally binding?

31
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:22,133
That's right,

32
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:28,133
but he knows that too, so he won't make that mistake.

33
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:35,900
Wow, you really came.

34
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:38,667
Why in such a hurry?

35
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:48,400
Food distribution.

36
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:02,900
 This is a plan for an ending that will satisfy you. 

37
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,900
 You'll be released soon, so buy me some time. 

38
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,833
Why did you come?

39
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,933
I told you all that I didn't do it.

40
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:21,300
It was not me, either.

41
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,933
Dr. Noh said this incident was planned by Lee Se Na,

42
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:27,400
but I said no.

43
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,367
I'm wondering who killed Ahn Yo Seop

44
00:03:29,367 --> 00:03:32,867
and attacked me that day.

45
00:03:32,867 --> 00:03:35,930
So, are you saying that it was me?

46
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,567
The villa was so dark that day.

47
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:42,733
No matter how hard I try to recall the memories,

48
00:03:42,733 --> 00:03:45,600
the montage just won't come to mind.

49
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
But...

50
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:51,233
the smell can't be eliminated.

51
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:52,700
Wait.

52
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,667
A smell?

53
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,467
Do you remember that?

54
00:03:56,467 --> 00:04:01,467
Patrick Suskind's novel, "Perfume (Das Parfum)."

55
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:06,267
"Each human being has his or her own unique scent."

56
00:04:06,267 --> 00:04:11,833
And I have an incredible sense of smell like the main character in that novel.

57
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,433
What are you talking about?

58
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:17,500
Oh, is that so?

59
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,333
Here's my reasoning.

60
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:24,100
Ahn Yo Seop has always used the same perfume.

61
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,167
He's been in my house for 15 years,

62
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:29,800
so there's no way I wouldn't know.

63
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,067
But the guy who attacked me that day

64
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:36,800
didn't have that scent.

65
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,900
How should I put it?

66
00:04:40,033 --> 00:04:43,567
Something smelled odd…

67
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:46,033
What kind of nonsense are you talking about?

68
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:47,633
Are you saying that's the proof that I did it?

69
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:50,233
No, no, no.

70
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:52,000
Just like drawing a montage,

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,600
I can find the culprit by smell.

72
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:06,333
The manuscript I just read is

73
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:09,733
the one that the person who has been threatening me

74
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:12,467
and my family for so long has forced me to read here.

75
00:05:12,467 --> 00:05:14,800
But...

76
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,733
I decided not to do as the blackmailer said.

77
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,833
Just smell this scent.

78
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,933
Me?

79
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,267
Compare this scent with that person's scent.

80
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:38,767
Then you will understand what I mean.

81
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:42,733
How should I smell the scent?

82
00:05:49,467 --> 00:05:52,167
Don't!

83
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:55,900
Don't lie.

84
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,033
I didn't even spray any perfume that day.

85
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:02,267
And I was wearing a fire suit that day,

86
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:05,667
so how come you smelled it?

87
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:07,667
Bingo.

88
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:11,200
That's why I didn't smell anything.

89
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:17,567
The guy was wrapped up in something rustling.

90
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,500
Isn't this a confession now?

91
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,600
Yeah.

92
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:30,067
No.

93
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:33,833
No, it's not.

94
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:38,300
The one who killed Ahn Yo Seop was Lee Se Na.

95
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,767
The one who killed him was Lee Se Na?

96
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:41,633
No, it was him.

97
00:06:41,633 --> 00:06:43,833
I didn't do it.

98
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,500
No, it was you.

99
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,400
Lee Se Na wasn't at the villa that day.

100
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,633
There was no scent of Lee Se Na anywhere.

101
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:53,833
What are you talking about?

102
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:57,533
She was clearly there, so she killed him

103
00:06:57,533 --> 00:06:59,567
and called Noh Young Won.

104
00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:04,033
But I called you. You understand?

105
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:05,300
Oh, I see.

106
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,567
Do you understand now?

107
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:18,033
What?

108
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:21,367
What?

109
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:23,200
What?

110
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,233
Hey!

111
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:27,800
Do you think you'll be safe?

112
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,267
Did you fool me?

113
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:34,833
Do you think you'll be safe?

114
00:07:38,533 --> 00:07:41,833
Is it okay for Lee Se Na to be publicly wanted now?

115
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:50,333
Her face has already been revealed.

116
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,067
What?

117
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:56,700
 This afternoon, the case entered a new phase by obtaining a confession to an accomplice 

118
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,700
 from Dr. Oh, who was the prime suspect in the villa murder case 

119
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,100
 involving Dr. Noh Young Won. 

120
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,600
 In a police investigation, Dr. Oh stated that the person who actually committed the murder 

121
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,667
 was her accomplice, Ms. Lee, 

122
00:08:06,667 --> 00:08:08,233
 and upon identification, it was revealed that 

123
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:11,800
 Ms. Lee was the same person as the blackmailer that 

124
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,333
 Dr. Noh Young Won revealed at the press conference a while ago. 

125
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,800
 Accordingly, the police decided to place Ms. Lee on a public wanted search and announced that 

126
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,267
 they are putting all efforts into chasing the suspect, including analyzing CCTV. 

127
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,100
 Se Na. 

128
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,367
 Admit your sins even now. 

129
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:53,200
 What sin have I committed? 

130
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,600
 You set us on fire! 

131
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,100
 So, I'm saying that killing me was a mistake. 

132
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,700
 There's no one to help you now. 

133
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,300
 You lost. 

134
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,300
 Why did you do this to me? I love you so much. 

135
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,267
 Why did you do that? 

136
00:09:16,267 --> 00:09:19,967
 You lost. You lost. 

137
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,033
No.

138
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,433
I didn't lose.

139
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,333
   

140
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,900
Soyee, look at this.

141
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,167
Still, it seems like everyone is on my mom's side, so that's a relief.

142
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:09,233
Right.

143
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:12,167
I'll just go to the bathroom.

144
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:14,400
Yes.

145
00:10:22,233 --> 00:10:24,500
   

146
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,967
Who the hell are you?

147
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:08,733
   

148
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:11,667
You.

149
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:14,600
Where's Do Hyun now?

150
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,033
He's sleeping.

151
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,067
If you hurt our Do Hyun,

152
00:12:24,367 --> 00:12:26,033
you will die.

153
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:29,167
Suffer more.

154
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:34,500
If you report me, your son will die.

155
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,667
Lee Se Na.

156
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:42,833
Lee Se Na!

157
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,433
Are you all right?

158
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:52,767
- What's happening? 
 - Are you okay?

159
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:56,267
Dr. Noh! Dr. Noh!

160
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,933
Do Hyun! Do Hyun!

161
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:13,000
Do Hyun.

162
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:19,167
 If I press the button, it'll explode. 

163
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:21,967
 You know what I mean. Right? 

164
00:14:30,933 --> 00:14:32,833
 If you want to save him, 

165
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:36,200
 come to the villa alone before the sun rises. 

166
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,633
 If you do something foolish, 

167
00:14:38,633 --> 00:14:43,333
 your son will die the loneliest way. 

168
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:46,033
 Mom. 

169
00:14:55,467 --> 00:14:58,433
No, just a moment, Dr. Noh.

170
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:00,633
- Hold on. 
 - Mother.

171
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:01,800
I have to go quickly.

172
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,600
I have to find Do Hyun.

173
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,400
Let's go together. I can't let you go alone.

174
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
No.

175
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,033
Then I don't know what will happen to Do Hyun.

176
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:11,533
No, how could I let you go alone?

177
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:12,767
No.

178
00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:16,400
Everybody, calm down.

179
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:21,100
I know how Dr. Noh feels right now, but just wait a minute.

180
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:30,200
When I heard that Jae Jin died,

181
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,733
I thought about it calmly and ended up finding Jae Jin. Right?

182
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:38,833
This means Lee Se Na is playing a game with us now.

183
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:42,733
Do Hyun might not be at the villa right now.

184
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:47,100
Please calm down. And sit down.

185
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:52,133
Look at this.

186
00:15:52,133 --> 00:15:55,200
Here.

187
00:15:56,367 --> 00:16:00,233
There's a small window here. Right?

188
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:03,433
This means the wall behind it is higher.

189
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:07,600
What this means is that this is a basement.

190
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,000
But our villa doesn't have a basement.

191
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,633
So, does that mean Do Hyun could be somewhere else?

192
00:16:14,633 --> 00:16:18,400
If it's not a villa, then a villa…

193
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,733
All we have to do is to find Do Hyun before the sun rises.

194
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:27,000
We still have time. Right?

195
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What should I do?

196
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,967
This is something we can definitely solve.

197
00:16:34,967 --> 00:16:38,867
We can definitely solve it together.

198
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:52,567
I usually don't come out when I'm sleeping.

199
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:56,100
You slept so well. I barely woke you up.

200
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,167
When you die, you will continue to sleep soundly.

201
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:03,000
Please help me by concentrating a little.

202
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,300
You said you are a detective. Right?

203
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,433
We don't have time. What will happen to our Do Hyun?

204
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:10,533
It's not the villa. Because there is no basement there.

205
00:17:10,533 --> 00:17:13,400
It cannot be concluded that it is underground.

206
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,633
It could be a warehouse or container located under an empty lot.

207
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:20,933
Judging by the lack of car noise, it seems like a quiet countryside.

208
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:23,733
Wow, it's different because you're a detective.

209
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:26,867
Considering Lee Se Na's tendencies and patterns,

210
00:17:26,867 --> 00:17:29,700
she doesn't play games that are completely unsolvable.

211
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,967
That means it's not a place that has nothing to do with Lee Se Na.

212
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:38,033
Is there perhaps a message in that video?

213
00:17:38,033 --> 00:17:40,900
Psychopaths are good at sending that message.

214
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,567
Because they feel superior there.

215
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:45,600
That… "If you do something foolish,

216
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,167
your son will die the loneliest way."

217
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:51,933
"Die the loneliest way…"

218
00:17:51,933 --> 00:17:55,233
Why did she add the word loneliness?

219
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,133
I think she gave you a clue unconsciously.

220
00:17:58,133 --> 00:18:02,333
The loneliest place for Lee Se Na would have been her home.

221
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:05,167
Then, is it Lee Se Na's house?

222
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,267
The house that caught fire when she was young.

223
00:18:07,267 --> 00:18:09,900
Does that house still exist?

224
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,133
I heard that Lee Se Na bought that Gangneung house.

225
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,967
Then I guess we can go to Gangneung right away.

226
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:18,500
Oh, but she also has a house in Ganghwa.

227
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,533
The very house where her third husband was burned to death.

228
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:25,700
Why are you talking about that now?

229
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,767
It might not be the house.

230
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:32,667
It's also possible that the orphanage that Lee Se Na often went to.

231
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:35,233
Because it's close to the villa.

232
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,300
Then I'll go to the orphanage first.

233
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,500
I'll check and go straight to the villa.

234
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,933
- You go first. I'll follow you. 
 - Yeah.

235
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:46,333
Then, I will take Mrs. Hong to Gangneung.

236
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,567
We'll go to Ganghwa, then.

237
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:52,133
Okay, let's split up and go find out.

238
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:55,167
Dr. Noh goes to the villa.

239
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:06,633
- You look over there. 
 - Okay.

240
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:10,767
Do Hyun! Do Hyun!

241
00:20:10,767 --> 00:20:12,033
Do Hyun!

242
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:14,400
Do Hyun! Do Hyun!

243
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,500
Do Hyun.

244
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,600
Did you find him, sister?

245
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,100
No, there's no one.

246
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,233
Is there any other space underground here?

247
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:55,933
Do Hyun! Do Hyun!

248
00:21:01,533 --> 00:21:05,300
Oh, Young Min! Young Min!

249
00:21:15,133 --> 00:21:16,167
Got it.

250
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:20,267
You guys go to the villa first.

251
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,667
I don't think it's the Ganghwa house.

252
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:25,867
I think it's here.

253
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,867
Yes.

254
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:36,867
   

255
00:21:36,867 --> 00:21:39,600
Jae Jin, did you find him?

256
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,367
He's not at the orphanage.

257
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:43,467
Yeah.

258
00:21:44,133 --> 00:21:45,667
I think I should go in.

259
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:47,467
I'll go straight to the villa.

260
00:21:47,467 --> 00:21:49,333
Be careful not to get caught.

261
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:52,000
Don't come too close. You might provoke her.

262
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,600
Honey, be careful.

263
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,290
Yes.

264
00:22:55,033 --> 00:22:57,033
Where's Do Hyun?

265
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:02,400
I missed you, doctor.

266
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,467
Where's Do Hyun?

267
00:23:06,967 --> 00:23:09,700
The order is wrong.

268
00:23:11,367 --> 00:23:13,800
We need to talk first.

269
00:23:25,967 --> 00:23:27,367
Yeah.

270
00:23:28,767 --> 00:23:30,933
What do you want to talk about?

271
00:23:30,933 --> 00:23:34,360
My family abandoned me, calling me a monster.

272
00:23:34,967 --> 00:23:37,633
But then you said this.

273
00:23:37,633 --> 00:23:42,200
You have to cut off the family that is destroying me.

274
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,200
Did I do more wrong than those who tried to cut me off?

275
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,733
You misunderstood.

276
00:23:47,733 --> 00:23:52,967
What I meant was, don't live so hard and suffer

277
00:23:52,967 --> 00:23:55,100
just because you're family.

278
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,433
Shut up.

279
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,767
   

280
00:24:00,767 --> 00:24:03,633
Now it's my turn to speak.

281
00:24:06,033 --> 00:24:08,233
So I was wondering

282
00:24:09,267 --> 00:24:12,833
if you would acknowledge that your family is ruined and cut them off.

283
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:15,133
Is that what you want?

284
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,500
Then, I'll cut them off.

285
00:24:22,067 --> 00:24:24,233
Please spare Do Hyun.

286
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,833
That's not the answer I'm looking for.

287
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,733
Why are you putting up with it?

288
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:35,667
Why are you trying to protect them?

289
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:39,467
Your in-laws who killed your father and deceived you.

290
00:24:39,467 --> 00:24:41,233
Your husband who lived a fake life.

291
00:24:41,233 --> 00:24:44,367
Even your son lied to you, why!

292
00:24:45,633 --> 00:24:48,267
Why don't you abandon them?

293
00:24:48,267 --> 00:24:49,700
Now,

294
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,833
answer me.

295
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,090
   

296
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:18,900
Yes, Mother.

297
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,100
No, she's not at the orphanage.

298
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,733
Oh, yeah?

299
00:25:22,733 --> 00:25:25,600
Then, he will definitely be here.

300
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,767
Where's Dr. Noh?

301
00:25:26,767 --> 00:25:29,200
I think she's in the villa now.

302
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,400
Yeah, Dr. Choi. I'll find Do Hyun.

303
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,233
Please protect Dr. Noh.

304
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:36,567
I'll call you later.

305
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:38,433
Yes, got it.

306
00:25:41,267 --> 00:25:43,167
Yeah.

307
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,967
It may seem hypocritical.

308
00:25:44,967 --> 00:25:46,440
No.

309
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:50,133
It will seem like hypocrisy to you.

310
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:53,800
But the reason they had to do that to me

311
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,300
was to protect this family.

312
00:25:58,633 --> 00:26:01,100
I don't doubt that.

313
00:26:03,467 --> 00:26:05,667
That's a ruined family.

314
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:07,967
Yeah, we're a ruined family.

315
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,967
But now,

316
00:26:11,967 --> 00:26:16,933
I started looking back at each and every person in the name of family.

317
00:26:18,067 --> 00:26:22,990
If it was broken, it wasn't bad to live broken.

318
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,867
No.

319
00:26:25,867 --> 00:26:28,567
You're lying right now. Right?

320
00:26:28,567 --> 00:26:31,067
Honestly, you want to abandon your family, but you're holding back. Right?

321
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:33,400
I want to abandon them right now.

322
00:26:34,767 --> 00:26:37,100
But now,

323
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:42,133
I truly understand what family is.

324
00:26:43,467 --> 00:26:45,533
This is true.

325
00:26:48,767 --> 00:26:51,433
Don't tell me you understand!

326
00:26:51,433 --> 00:26:53,500
You said your family was ruined.

327
00:26:54,867 --> 00:26:56,833
Do you know that?

328
00:26:56,833 --> 00:26:59,733
My family never tried to understand me.

329
00:26:59,733 --> 00:27:02,967
They just told me I was ruined. Everyone said it was all my fault!

330
00:27:02,967 --> 00:27:06,033
Your family didn't abandon you.

331
00:27:06,033 --> 00:27:10,867
Your wrong obsession is what made them leave.

332
00:27:10,867 --> 00:27:13,680
I will help you right now.

333
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:18,100
Don't do this. Come out with me.

334
00:27:30,933 --> 00:27:36,560
I also know why I wasn't loved by them.

335
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,833
But still, I wanted…

336
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:49,400
I wanted to have a family that wouldn't let me go until the end.

337
00:28:15,267 --> 00:28:16,633
Manager Park!

338
00:28:16,633 --> 00:28:17,967
 Yes. 

339
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:23,467
Here. Do Hyun is here.

340
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:25,133
Just a moment.

341
00:28:40,533 --> 00:28:42,567
Do Hyun!

342
00:28:42,567 --> 00:28:43,600
 Do Hyun! 

343
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,167
Here!

344
00:28:45,167 --> 00:28:48,433
Here! Here!

345
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:04,633
Here!

346
00:29:04,633 --> 00:29:06,467
Here!

347
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,167
We're maybe...

348
00:29:15,733 --> 00:29:18,567
at the same point now.

349
00:29:19,767 --> 00:29:23,130
You dreamed and expected a perfect family,

350
00:29:23,867 --> 00:29:29,000
but now you realize that was wrong.

351
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,167
It's not too late for you now.

352
00:29:33,167 --> 00:29:35,500
You, too, can create that kind of family again.

353
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,767
I'll help you.

354
00:29:48,967 --> 00:29:51,467
So, please spare our Do Hyun.

355
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,633
Please.

356
00:29:58,567 --> 00:30:00,220
Why?

357
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,900
I almost got gaslighted.

358
00:30:06,667 --> 00:30:09,333
So you're saying that you can't cut them off in the end?

359
00:30:10,633 --> 00:30:13,633
Then I'll cut them off for you.

360
00:30:13,633 --> 00:30:15,333
No!

361
00:30:42,233 --> 00:30:45,367
Live through the pain of killing your son.

362
00:31:21,033 --> 00:31:22,400
Do Hyun!

363
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,833
Spare my Do Hyun!

364
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:27,200
Do Hyun!

365
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,700
No!

366
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:34,400
No.

367
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,300
My Do Hyun!

368
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,967
No.

369
00:31:37,967 --> 00:31:39,700
Do Hyun!

370
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,500
Do Hyun!

371
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,233
Do Hyun!

372
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,567
Do Hyun!

373
00:32:03,733 --> 00:32:05,100
My Do Hyun!

374
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,000
Give my Do Hyun back!

375
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,033
No.

376
00:32:09,033 --> 00:32:11,100
Give my Do Hyun back!

377
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,433
My Do Hyun!

378
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:16,033
Give my Do Hyun back!

379
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:24,567
Give my Do Hyun back!

380
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:28,860
Give my Do Hyun back!

381
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,400
Do Hyun!

382
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,200
Stand up.

383
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,933
Do Hyun is alive.

384
00:32:35,933 --> 00:32:37,000
Noh Young Won.

385
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,400
Do Hyun is alive.

386
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,633
Do Hyun is alive.

387
00:32:40,633 --> 00:32:42,367
Do Hyun is alive.

388
00:32:42,367 --> 00:32:44,100
We have to get out of here.

389
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:15,267
In the end, I'm alone again.

390
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:20,150
If I had met someone,

391
00:33:20,867 --> 00:33:25,267
would I have a family that wouldn't let me go like you did?

392
00:34:07,967 --> 00:34:13,100
♫  By the time spring passed  ♫

393
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,500
♫  I used to cry in sadness  ♫

394
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,500
Dr. Noh, good-bye.

395
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,967
We have to get out of here.

396
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:33,467
♫  By the time summer approaches  ♫

397
00:34:33,467 --> 00:34:37,667
♫  I was in love  ♫

398
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:43,167
♫  Even the passionate kiss  ♫

399
00:34:43,167 --> 00:34:48,800
♫  Melts under the sun  ♫

400
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,833
♫  Countless days and nights  ♫

401
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:58,200
♫  Pass by without any regrets  ♫

402
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:06,100
♫  I won't go back to  ♫

403
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:10,733
♫  Any secret's moment  ♫

404
00:35:47,433 --> 00:35:49,567
Mom!

405
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,467
Do Hyun.

406
00:35:52,467 --> 00:35:54,167
- Mom. 
 - Do Hyun.

407
00:35:54,167 --> 00:35:56,367
Mom, are you okay?

408
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,467
Honey, are you okay?

409
00:36:06,867 --> 00:36:08,133
Sis.

410
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:10,300
Young Won.

411
00:36:19,767 --> 00:36:22,400
Dr. Noh.

412
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,000
I really should have burned that darn villa down a long time ago.

413
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,867
You almost got in big trouble.

414
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,600
Sis.

415
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:45,200
Where's Lee Se Na?

416
00:36:50,933 --> 00:36:54,100
The witch was eventually burned to death.

417
00:36:56,067 --> 00:36:58,400
It is horrible.

418
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,600
Ji Eun.

419
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,020
Ji Eun.

420
00:37:13,167 --> 00:37:16,733
Why are you so easily forgiven?

421
00:37:18,167 --> 00:37:23,267
Because of you, my life has been a pain.

422
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,533
Ji Eun, let's go out and talk.

423
00:37:27,533 --> 00:37:30,033
What about my wounds?

424
00:37:30,033 --> 00:37:31,867
What about my pain?

425
00:37:31,867 --> 00:37:35,133
This is nothing to you guys. Right?

426
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,600
Why did you choose Noh Young Won

427
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,867
after you kept acting like a mother to me and told me countless times

428
00:37:44,867 --> 00:37:46,567
that you were looking forward to it?

429
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:49,000
Why not me?

430
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,133
I… I also…

431
00:37:52,133 --> 00:37:55,767
I also tried so hard.

432
00:38:00,567 --> 00:38:03,367
It should have been me.

433
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:05,967
It should have been me!

434
00:38:05,967 --> 00:38:08,300
- Ji Eun! 
 - It's fine.

435
00:38:10,367 --> 00:38:12,467
Ji Eun.

436
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,800
It's okay.

437
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,933
It's fine.

438
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,233
- Mother, are you okay? 
 - I'm okay.

439
00:38:25,233 --> 00:38:26,600
Jae Jin.

440
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,800
It's okay.

441
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,100
What's the matter?

442
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,467
You woke up?

443
00:39:02,933 --> 00:39:07,100
Did you hate me so much that you wanted to kill me?

444
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,633
What should I do? I'm not dead.

445
00:39:17,533 --> 00:39:21,233
I understand how you feel, I mean it.

446
00:39:22,567 --> 00:39:24,833
Sorry, Ji Eun.

447
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,533
Why are you doing this?

448
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:42,850
I shouldn't have done that to you, either.

449
00:39:43,733 --> 00:39:48,167
I said you were family, but I used you.

450
00:39:48,167 --> 00:39:52,650
I forced you to make sacrifices by telling you I expected something from you.

451
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,867
Even though I knew for sure that you yearned for love so much.

452
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:03,900
Have you...

453
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:12,200
ever thought of me as family?

454
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:19,500
Maybe my desire to get into that house...

455
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,970
was greater than my love for Jae Jin.

456
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,800
I wanted to be part of your family.

457
00:41:02,433 --> 00:41:04,180
Yeah.

458
00:41:04,933 --> 00:41:06,800
Ji Eun.

459
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,867
Ji Eun.

460
00:41:16,867 --> 00:41:20,800
How about we forget about today

461
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,233
and spend more time...

462
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:28,267
together, you and me?

463
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,700
Ji Eun.

464
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:46,500
 Ji Eun, come here. 

465
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,467
Oh? Uncle!

466
00:42:17,467 --> 00:42:19,167
Did you come here after hearing the news?

467
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:21,567
I couldn't even contact you because I was worried you might be worried.

468
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,967
I'll go to Ji Eun first.

469
00:42:22,967 --> 00:42:24,533
Hold on.

470
00:42:24,533 --> 00:42:26,567
What?

471
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,000
- Mr. Koo Kyung Tae? 
 - Oh…

472
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,767
Why are you suddenly calling me that awkwardly, Uncle?

473
00:42:32,767 --> 00:42:36,667
I'm not Ji Eun's uncle.

474
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:39,333
What? Stop joking.

475
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:41,633
We are in the hospital now, and Ji Eun is sick.

476
00:42:41,633 --> 00:42:43,267
- What? 
 - Oh.

477
00:42:43,267 --> 00:42:44,533
- Uncle. 
 - That…

478
00:42:44,533 --> 00:42:47,533
- How did that happen? 
 - It's a long story.

479
00:42:47,533 --> 00:42:50,100
 Ms. Lee, who was revealed to be the real culprit of the villa murder case, 

480
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,467
 set fire to the villa where the crime was committed and took her own life. 

481
00:42:53,467 --> 00:42:56,600
 With this, the villa murder case was now only left to the trial of Mr. Oh, 

482
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,133
 who conspired with Ms. Lee to commit the crime. 

483
00:42:59,133 --> 00:43:03,233
 The police have already secured Mr. Oh's confession… 

484
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,833
It's all over now.

485
00:43:11,033 --> 00:43:12,910
I'm sorry.

486
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,367
You may not be able to forgive me,

487
00:43:17,633 --> 00:43:20,033
but if there's a way to turn things around,

488
00:43:20,033 --> 00:43:24,800
please tell me and I'll try.

489
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:30,733
Can our relationship go back to how it was before?

490
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,867
I don't think it's important whether I forgive you or not.

491
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:48,633
Let's put aside for a moment...

492
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,333
who we live for.

493
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,900
No matter how I look at it, it's an X, but why is it called a cross-stitch shape?

494
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,767
Do it like this, like this, and then it looks like a cross.

495
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,300
I see.

496
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,933
How nice it would be

497
00:44:17,933 --> 00:44:21,533
if your dad was here on days like this?

498
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:25,700
Mom, are you back to normal?

499
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,800
Is that so?

500
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:35,167
Doctor, he's still sick.

501
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,933
They say I have an incurable disease, Mom.

502
00:44:42,233 --> 00:44:44,733
 I'm sorry, Mom. 

503
00:44:45,467 --> 00:44:48,400
 But I couldn't help it, either. 

504
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,700
 Dad, 

505
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:54,333
 you shouldn't have done that because you were our dad. 

506
00:44:55,233 --> 00:44:57,700
 Still, even if he was that kind of dad, 

507
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:01,100
 I should have hugged him and stayed with him until the end. 

508
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,467
 Will Dad understand me now, Mom? 

509
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:16,467
Doctor,

510
00:45:16,467 --> 00:45:19,467
my mom said that

511
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:23,667
parents always forgive their children.

512
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:30,733
And she said it's okay to cry sometimes.

513
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:39,700
She is the one who reads books to me.

514
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,733
Mrs. Hong.

515
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,967
I heard you came here sometimes?

516
00:45:54,967 --> 00:45:58,767
I've been here occasionally.

517
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:06,600
Would you please give this to your mom?

518
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:26,533
Thank you.

519
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:28,000
What do you think?

520
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,533
It means you can eat whatever you want.

521
00:46:32,533 --> 00:46:34,467
I really like it.

522
00:46:34,467 --> 00:46:36,567
Guys,

523
00:46:36,567 --> 00:46:38,333
until now,

524
00:46:38,333 --> 00:46:41,900
I think I've always thought that

525
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:48,633
family should be gathered together around the table.

526
00:46:48,633 --> 00:46:50,733
But I read somewhere that

527
00:46:50,733 --> 00:46:54,267
some people become more harmonious after they decide

528
00:46:54,267 --> 00:46:57,533
not to eat breakfast with their family.

529
00:46:57,533 --> 00:47:00,333
What kind of family is that?

530
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:05,533
I feel like

531
00:47:05,533 --> 00:47:09,100
I've been forcing you guys

532
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:12,000
to create the family I want.

533
00:47:14,033 --> 00:47:18,733
I guess I locked you guys up in a cage.

534
00:47:23,733 --> 00:47:26,367
So, as of today,

535
00:47:26,367 --> 00:47:29,333
I have decided to step down as zookeeper

536
00:47:29,333 --> 00:47:32,467
and leave this house.

537
00:47:32,467 --> 00:47:34,933
- What? 
 - Mother.

538
00:47:34,933 --> 00:47:39,533
Now let's each be faithful to our own lives.

539
00:47:41,833 --> 00:47:46,567
Have you guys seen the movie Avatar?

540
00:47:46,567 --> 00:47:49,067
I see you.

541
00:47:50,967 --> 00:47:54,800
I can see what you guys are thinking.

542
00:47:57,567 --> 00:48:01,467
I know you guys very well.

543
00:48:02,267 --> 00:48:05,067
I see you.

544
00:48:07,067 --> 00:48:09,933
Maybe true love is...

545
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:16,167
just looking at that person.

546
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:21,667
So is this...

547
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:25,167
our last meal together?

548
00:48:25,167 --> 00:48:29,500
Let's get together and eat food

549
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,170
whenever we want.

550
00:48:34,033 --> 00:48:36,500
Toast!

551
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:39,733
Mr. Choi Jae Jin,

552
00:49:39,733 --> 00:49:42,500
are you saying that you personally ordered

553
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,700
Vice Director Oh Ji Eun to perform the surgery on your behalf?

554
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:51,667
Yes, Vice Director Oh Ji Eun just did as I asked.

555
00:49:51,667 --> 00:49:55,733
Are you saying you'll give up your medical license for that?

556
00:49:55,733 --> 00:50:00,933
Yes, I am not qualified as a doctor.

557
00:50:00,933 --> 00:50:04,167
Because I'm a doctor who not&lt; only performed surrogate surgeries,

558
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:08,300
but also failed to care for bleeding patients.

559
00:50:24,133 --> 00:50:26,120
   

560
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,967
 A transcript released 29 years after the case was concluded revealed that 

561
00:50:39,967 --> 00:50:44,900
 the main culprit in the embezzlement case was Chairman Hwang Kyeong Ju… 

562
00:50:54,800 --> 00:51:00,767
♫  I don't know if it will be any consolation  ♫

563
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:06,900
♫  It might not be a comforting feeling  ♫

564
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:11,033
♫  Your warm...  ♫

565
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:18,000
Why are you here? I said nothing would change.

566
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,033
Then you should have refused the consultation. Why did you come out?

567
00:51:21,033 --> 00:51:22,733
- Reject. 
 - But what should I do?

568
00:51:22,733 --> 00:51:24,200
That won't work, though.

569
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:28,000
From now on, I'm the correctional counselor at this prison.

570
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,667
What?

571
00:51:29,667 --> 00:51:33,833
So, since you're going to confess anyway, let's take it easy.

572
00:51:33,833 --> 00:51:37,300
Why did you close that popular hospital?

573
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,700
Are you worried about me now?

574
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,867
Who ruined my successful life?

575
00:51:41,867 --> 00:51:43,767
Oh, it was all your fault.

576
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:46,067
Do you have anger management disorder?

577
00:51:46,067 --> 00:51:47,733
You yell all the time.

578
00:51:47,733 --> 00:51:50,400
Do you think I can't get angry so I just stay still?

579
00:51:55,833 --> 00:51:57,967
Okay.

580
00:51:57,967 --> 00:52:02,267
I will get counseling.

581
00:52:02,267 --> 00:52:04,000
But I have one question.

582
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Yeah, okay.

583
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,033
Did you really try to save Lee Se Na back then?

584
00:52:10,033 --> 00:52:12,267
Why?

585
00:52:13,167 --> 00:52:15,733
She's the one who harassed you so much.

586
00:52:15,733 --> 00:52:21,000
Because the desire to be loved and recognized by family is not a sin.

587
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,567
I guess I wanted to let her know that she deserved to be loved, too.

588
00:52:31,667 --> 00:52:34,867
I couldn't save Lee Se Na,

589
00:52:34,867 --> 00:52:37,767
but I'll try to save you.

590
00:52:42,133 --> 00:52:44,000
Look outside.

591
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,167
There's such a beautiful world out there,

592
00:52:46,167 --> 00:52:49,400
so it'd be a shame to lock yourself up.

593
00:52:53,667 --> 00:52:57,633
How about you start studying again?

594
00:52:57,633 --> 00:53:00,367
You're good at math.

595
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,067
I'm good at that.

596
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,500
Isn't it hard?

597
00:53:35,033 --> 00:53:37,467
Hello! Hello!

598
00:53:37,467 --> 00:53:39,690
Hello!

599
00:53:42,367 --> 00:53:44,833
That's right. Let's go.

600
00:53:45,867 --> 00:53:46,900
Let's go.

601
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,733
   

602
00:53:48,733 --> 00:53:50,533
- Sir. 
 - Yes.

603
00:53:50,533 --> 00:53:52,467
It was rescued today.

604
00:53:52,467 --> 00:53:54,867
Let's see.

605
00:53:54,867 --> 00:53:57,400
Come here. How old are you?

606
00:54:02,433 --> 00:54:04,133
Welcome.

607
00:54:04,133 --> 00:54:06,967
You are not abandoned.

608
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,367
 Soyee, what time is it in Korea? 

609
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,933
It's 11:00.

610
00:54:19,933 --> 00:54:22,100
Why aren't you going home quickly?

611
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:24,200
I just got out of the library.

612
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:27,267
I'm just going to talk to you and then go home.

613
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:28,467
 Hi, Soyee! 

614
00:54:28,467 --> 00:54:31,200
What? You guys are always together?

615
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,433
Of course. When will you come?

616
00:54:33,433 --> 00:54:35,233
If I go, will I have somewhere to sleep?

617
00:54:35,233 --> 00:54:37,733
My house is spacious, Soyee.

618
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:39,333
By the way, are you really coming to the US next month?

619
00:54:39,333 --> 00:54:40,500
Yes.

620
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:43,633
So, I'm still working hard at my part-time job.

621
00:54:43,633 --> 00:54:46,367
I'll call you later again.

622
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:49,833
Let's go.

623
00:54:52,867 --> 00:54:54,800
Yes, Ra Kyung.

624
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,167
It's already lunch time.

625
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:58,067
 Yeah, it's almost lunch time. 

626
00:54:58,067 --> 00:55:00,167
You're going to be so busy.

627
00:55:00,167 --> 00:55:01,567
 Where are you now? 

628
00:55:01,567 --> 00:55:03,567
Me? I'm in a bookstore.

629
00:55:03,567 --> 00:55:07,533
I hope Oh Tae Hwan starts studying again.

630
00:55:07,533 --> 00:55:09,567
How long are you going to continue the consultation?

631
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:13,167
If this business fails, you may have to open a hospital again.

632
00:55:13,167 --> 00:55:16,000
You said the fortune teller said you would do well in business.

633
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,200
Is Soyee doing well?

634
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,400
Yes.

635
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,300
Because Soyee is pretty, there are a lot of male customers.

636
00:55:23,533 --> 00:55:24,533
Oh, right, Young Won.

637
00:55:24,533 --> 00:55:27,633
The fortune teller said you should go east.

638
00:55:27,633 --> 00:55:29,300
She said you had to go east to find someone who can help you.

639
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,333
I'll call you later again.

640
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:33,700
- Hello. 
 - Hello, Kyung Tae.

641
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,067
Would you like to order the same thing today?

642
00:55:35,067 --> 00:55:37,333
Yes, thank you.

643
00:55:39,533 --> 00:55:41,900
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

644
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,267
Yes, have a cup of coffee.

645
00:55:43,267 --> 00:55:44,767
- Thank you. 
 - I will drink well.

646
00:55:44,767 --> 00:55:46,667
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

647
00:55:46,667 --> 00:55:47,900
- Goodbye. 
 - Goodbye.

648
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:50,900
Is our director busy today?

649
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:55,100
You know, there are many patients who only want to get surgery from the director.

650
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:58,367
I'm worried she might collapse if she keeps doing that.

651
00:55:58,367 --> 00:56:00,633
The director will be out soon after the surgery is over.

652
00:56:00,633 --> 00:56:03,867
Oh, is that so? Have some sushi.

653
00:56:03,867 --> 00:56:07,200
- I will eat well. 
 - Thank you.

654
00:56:11,833 --> 00:56:13,833
Honey.

655
00:56:16,267 --> 00:56:18,633
You must be tired?

656
00:56:18,633 --> 00:56:19,800
You said you were busy.

657
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,867
There is so much time to see you.

658
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,233
Young Min, what now?

659
00:56:29,233 --> 00:56:32,900
 What do you mean? I'm just taking care of my sister who lives alone. 

660
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:35,900
There's no way our Young Min would do that for me.

661
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:37,700
Sis,

662
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:42,600
how do you know me so well?

663
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,433
I've been thinking about it,

664
00:56:44,433 --> 00:56:47,667
and how about setting up a consultation table for you in our store?

665
00:56:47,667 --> 00:56:50,833
Like the person who reads tarot cards at the cafe.

666
00:56:50,833 --> 00:56:54,467
Young Min, I don't want to hit you anymore.

667
00:56:54,467 --> 00:56:56,933
You just mind your own business.

668
00:56:56,933 --> 00:56:58,867
What?

669
00:56:58,867 --> 00:57:01,167
She hung up.

670
00:57:02,333 --> 00:57:06,067
This is a brilliant idea, but she's not accepting it.

671
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,467
Are you crying?

672
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:10,333
Young Min,

673
00:57:10,333 --> 00:57:11,833
don't we have a day off?

674
00:57:11,833 --> 00:57:14,500
Why? Are you tired already?

675
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,100
Have you already forgotten?

676
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:19,300
You were dissatisfied when your uncle

677
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:22,067
wandered around the store without even opening it.

678
00:57:22,067 --> 00:57:24,633
That's because my uncle didn't open the store for a long time.

679
00:57:24,633 --> 00:57:26,767
That's not it.

680
00:57:26,767 --> 00:57:30,100
You had the passion before.

681
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:34,033
The earnestness and passion you want to feed your boiled noodles to your guests.

682
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:36,633
Where did that passion go? That passion?

683
00:57:37,967 --> 00:57:39,267
That passion?

684
00:57:39,267 --> 00:57:40,600
- Passion! 
 - Passion!

685
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,100
All right.

686
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,700
I'll boil the noodles diligently.

687
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:46,533
- Yeah, that's right. 
 - Yeah.

688
00:57:57,667 --> 00:58:01,267
   

689
00:58:01,267 --> 00:58:05,100
   

690
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:10,333
   

691
00:58:15,933 --> 00:58:17,900
   

692
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:21,667
   

693
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:26,920
 ­  

694
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,810
 ­Chapter 5. Trap, Chapter 6. Everything okay with your family?, Chapter 7. Sweet Hell, Chapter 8. The Swamp of Motherhood...] 

695
00:58:40,567 --> 00:58:45,000
 So, as of today, I have decided to leave my house. 

696
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,967
 My family all looked perplexed at my declaration. 

697
00:58:49,967 --> 00:58:53,133
 Right. They might have been surprised 

698
00:58:53,133 --> 00:58:57,300
 to hear me say this, since I had been obsessed with 

699
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:00,200
 having a happy family all this time. 

700
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:05,367
 But why do I feel relieved now after seeing this? 

701
00:59:05,367 --> 00:59:10,300
 Our family stood in front of the house and looked at our house for the last time. 

702
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:14,867
 Like a soul escaping the cage that imprisons us here. 

703
00:59:14,867 --> 00:59:17,367
 Leaving behind that gigantic creature, 

704
00:59:17,367 --> 00:59:20,700
 we say our final goodbyes. 

705
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:25,233
 I decided not to tell my family where I was going. 

706
00:59:25,233 --> 00:59:28,667
 And I was grateful for their consideration 

707
00:59:28,667 --> 00:59:32,070
 in not asking too many questions until the end. 

708
00:59:32,767 --> 00:59:36,833
 Now, endless snowy mountains are spread out in front of me, 

709
00:59:36,833 --> 00:59:41,630
 and the wind is dancing between me and the mountains. 

710
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:46,067
 There must be distance for the wind to dance. 

711
00:59:46,067 --> 00:59:48,067
 Now this refreshing breeze 

712
00:59:48,067 --> 00:59:51,900
 will dance between our family members. 

713
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:56,367
 Just looking at each other with a gesture of free love, 

714
00:59:56,367 --> 00:59:59,133
 without expectations or possession. 

715
01:00:03,467 --> 01:00:05,350
   

716
01:00:12,767 --> 01:00:16,833
   

717
01:00:49,067 --> 01:00:50,667
I like this scent.

718
01:00:53,033 --> 01:00:55,900
I'm surprised...

719
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,300
you found me.

720
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:00,667
You didn't even tell Jae Jin where you were.

721
01:01:00,667 --> 01:01:04,433
I'm afraid he'll think he has to take care of me.

722
01:01:04,433 --> 01:01:06,900
I don't want to burden my son.

723
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:10,067
I was a little disappointed.

724
01:01:10,067 --> 01:01:14,810
Still, you and I have something like camaraderie.

725
01:01:15,533 --> 01:01:17,367
That's right.

726
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:26,133
Now that the war is over, let's think that we've dispersed.

727
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:29,700
It's already been a year.

728
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:36,233
I think those brief but intense moments,

729
01:01:36,233 --> 01:01:39,100
those nightmarish times,

730
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:43,767
gave some kind of motivation to our family.

731
01:01:43,767 --> 01:01:45,900
Great motivation?

732
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,200
This book…

733
01:01:53,833 --> 01:01:55,033
Yeah.

734
01:01:55,033 --> 01:01:59,700
You read that book when you were young and said that...

735
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:06,233
"unconditional love is determined at the moment of sacrifice."

736
01:02:07,333 --> 01:02:09,433
You still remember that?

737
01:02:09,433 --> 01:02:11,967
You were smart, Dr. Noh.

738
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,600
I think I made the mistake...

739
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:21,733
of thinking that my greed for my family

740
01:02:21,733 --> 01:02:26,967
was a sacrifice on my part.

741
01:02:28,533 --> 01:02:30,390
I guess...

742
01:02:30,933 --> 01:02:35,700
I also didn't want to break the illusion that my family was perfect.

743
01:02:37,267 --> 01:02:39,600
Looking back,

744
01:02:40,933 --> 01:02:43,900
I wonder why I lived my life trying to have everything.

745
01:02:44,967 --> 01:02:49,067
Home is not a place. It's a person.

746
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:52,133
But, Mother,

747
01:02:52,133 --> 01:02:57,367
it must not have been easy for you to decide to leave your family.

748
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:01,500
But I was surprised once again.

749
01:03:02,733 --> 01:03:07,033
I have some years of experience in life.

750
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:10,500
You still have a long way to go to catch up with me.

751
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,467
You're not trying to start a war with me again. Right?

752
01:03:12,467 --> 01:03:14,300
No, no, no.

753
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:17,933
Don't you know that I'm actually an advocate of peace?

754
01:03:17,933 --> 01:03:22,100
Oh, really?

755
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,967
That's surprising.

756
01:03:28,067 --> 01:03:31,733
Come to us whenever you feel lonely.

757
01:03:31,733 --> 01:03:35,867
Our family hasn't disappeared.

758
01:03:35,867 --> 01:03:38,250
It just changed in form.

759
01:03:39,067 --> 01:03:40,867
Sa Gang.

760
01:03:44,267 --> 01:03:49,167
Want to see what I found?

761
01:03:49,167 --> 01:03:53,667
Flowers bloom even in this snow.

762
01:03:58,233 --> 01:04:00,600
Oh, yes.

763
01:04:04,267 --> 01:04:09,500
I guess you can make great corn noodles here, too.

764
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:11,200
That's a relief.

765
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,540
Dr. Noh.

766
01:04:26,167 --> 01:04:29,133
We were pretty good partners, though.

767
01:04:29,133 --> 01:04:31,833
Isn't it present tense, not past tense?

768
01:04:31,833 --> 01:04:37,367
We're the only ones who can cooperate like this.

769
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:08,467
 Is everything okay with your family? 

770
01:05:08,467 --> 01:05:14,400
 I think the important thing is where to set the standard for well-being. 

771
01:05:15,433 --> 01:05:17,633
 I think I, too, have confined my standards 

772
01:05:17,633 --> 01:05:23,533
 of well-being to words like happiness, harmony, and perfection. 

773
01:05:25,267 --> 01:05:27,580
 I think I understand now. 

774
01:05:28,267 --> 01:05:31,033
 There are no broken families, 

775
01:05:31,033 --> 01:05:34,300
 only false expectations. 

776
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:38,500
 So our family decided to break away 

777
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:41,200
 from those false expectations 

778
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,200
 and practice becoming strangers. 

779
01:05:45,367 --> 01:05:47,967
 I believe that 

780
01:05:47,967 --> 01:05:53,567
 love doesn't end when a family falls apart. 

781
01:05:55,100 --> 01:06:01,167
 And if someone asks me about my family's well-being, 

782
01:06:01,167 --> 01:06:03,867
 I can now answer 

783
01:06:03,867 --> 01:06:06,433
 with a more relaxed mind.
