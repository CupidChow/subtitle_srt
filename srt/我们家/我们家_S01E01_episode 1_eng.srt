27

You're back. I've prepared a meal. Eat now.

28
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,700
I'll eat later.

29
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,667
It's bothersome to eat it later.

30
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:12,333
    
 I want to rest.

31
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:15,167
I prepared this for you, but why are you getting annoyed?

32
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:17,400
No, that's not it.

33
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:24,100
    
 I can guess what the situation is.

34
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,533
The husband made it for his wife,

35
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:30,200
but he must be upset that his wife is annoyed. Right?

36
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,800
Yes, the husband is definitely a good man who takes good care of his wife.

37
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,967
But... it's gaslighting.

38
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,367
Is this gaslighting?

39
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:40,467
Yes.

40
00:03:40,467 --> 00:03:44,700
Recently, it is recommended to use the term "emotional and psychological domination."

41
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,233
Since it occurs between intimate relationships,

42
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:49,367
it takes the form of attachment.

43
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:52,633
It can occur among family members without realizing it.

44
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:55,267
Maybe it's something that can happen to anyone,

45
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:58,500
so I probably have gaslighted someone?

46
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,167
Yes, people often say this a lot.

47
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:02,967
"Family is precious."

48
00:04:02,967 --> 00:04:06,100
"I'm saying this for you because we're family."

49
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,067
Of course, they do it because they value and love each other,

50
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:12,533
but it would be wrong to block

51
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:15,967
the emotional independence of family members

52
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:17,833
by forcing something too much.

53
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,400
After hearing what you said,

54
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,500
I think I'll have to think before saying

55
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,533
anything to my husband or child.

56
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:24,833
Yes.

57
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,133
In relationships with family,

58
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,133
we need to think about

59
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:32,400
whether we are emotionally controlling someone

60
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,233
in the name of love.

61
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:38,700
Cut!

62
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,667
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

63
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:09,667
Honey.

64
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:11,533
Oh, did you sleep well?

65
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:14,133
You look pretty from the morning.

66
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:17,700
Just a moment.

67
00:05:24,967 --> 00:05:26,433
Does it look good on me?

68
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:29,067
The olive green color looks good on you.

69
00:05:29,067 --> 00:05:30,233
Yeah?

70
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:32,167
Get ready. I'll wake Do Hyun up.

71
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:34,167
All right.

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,233
Dr. Noh, there's nothing about me you don't know. Right?

73
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:41,133
Of course.

74
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,133
Do Hyun.

75
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,567
It's hard going to school every morning. Right?

76
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:53,967
Just ten more minutes.

77
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:58,033
How nice would it be if you didn't have to do it because it was hard?

78
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,592
   

79
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,033
Son.

80
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:10,700
Isn't your schedule too tight?

81
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,000
Mom, I think I can run for mayor.

82
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,733
I meet so many people every day.

83
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:18,200
What did I say?

84
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,333
Studying is for yourself, not for me.

85
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:24,333
I said you had to make all the choices. Right?

86
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,867
Yeah, I chose to do that.

87
00:06:32,033 --> 00:06:33,700
Yum, it's good.

88
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,267
My father-in-law will like it.

89
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,733
 Eyes met, hands brushed, 

90
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:45,467
 and lips kissed. 

91
00:06:45,467 --> 00:06:47,833
 I unbuttoned his shirt. 

92
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,600
 His hand held my head 

93
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,200
 and pulled me closer. 

94
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,367
 That's how we became one. 

95
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,267
 It was someone I would never meet again. 

96
00:07:00,267 --> 00:07:04,300
 It was just a one-night stand. 

97
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:10,433
 But he showed up at my house the next afternoon. 

98
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:12,533
 He says something shocking. 

99
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,367
 Take responsibility. 

100
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:16,900
 It's a really bad afternoon. 

101
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,533
   

102
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,600
 It's a really bad afternoon. 

103
00:07:28,467 --> 00:07:30,300
That smells good.

104
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,433
It's your favorite red sea bream.

105
00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:33,967
It is very fresh.

106
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:36,567
Wow, red sea bream! That's good.

107
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:38,633
I have to taste it.

108
00:07:43,433 --> 00:07:44,467
It's just perfect. You and I have similar tastes.

109
00:07:44,467 --> 00:07:47,100
It's just perfect. You and I have similar tastes.

110
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,700
- Let's see. 
 - It looks delicious.

111
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,633
Okay, give it to me quickly.

112
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:04,633
Let's eat.

113
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:14,567
Ma'am.

114
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:17,167
I'll eat toast for breakfast.

115
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:20,400
Being a family means

116
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,967
sharing the same food. Right?

117
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:27,667
What is family?

118
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:31,567
We can't emotionally communicate.

119
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,400
Why are you fighting in the morning?

120
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:44,033
Ma'am, I'll do it.

121
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:46,967
I'll make you toast for breakfast again.

122
00:08:46,967 --> 00:08:50,100
The arugula is fresh right now.

123
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,533
You can eat, yes.

124
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:10,867
Dr. Choi, did you say the awards ceremony is next month?

125
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:12,767
Yeah, early next month.

126
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:16,633
People around me are already congratulating me.

127
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:19,000
My son is really great.

128
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,467
Young Won,

129
00:09:20,467 --> 00:09:23,567
it's the first time a couple is receiving an award together. Right?

130
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:25,833
Oh, yes.

131
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:31,033
Dr. Noh is a famous doctor, so it's natural to get it.

132
00:09:32,067 --> 00:09:34,367
It's all thanks to Jae Jin.

133
00:09:34,367 --> 00:09:38,500
Reconstructive surgery isn't something that just anyone can do.

134
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,267
You've also worked hard.

135
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:48,433
Mom, what should I do with the outfit?

136
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:51,367
I usually take care of it,

137
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:54,833
but you know better when it comes to formal occasions.

138
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:58,400
Dr. Choi looks good no matter what he wears.

139
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,567
I'll tell CEO Kim. I'll also tell her about your outfit.

140
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:04,333
Yes.

141
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:07,233
Grandpa, please send me to Jeju Island!

142
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:08,467
Why?

143
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:10,133
What are you suddenly saying?

144
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:13,633
Soyee will go to Jeju Island for an English camp.

145
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:14,867
Can I go there?

146
00:10:14,867 --> 00:10:18,100
Do Hyun, you're so into Soyee. Right?

147
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,333
Soyee?

148
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,233
Who do you resemble?

149
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:24,967
Who do you think he resembles?

150
00:10:24,967 --> 00:10:28,700
It's not a crime to be a romanticist.

151
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,833
You can go.

152
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,400
- Really? 
 - You can go.

153
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,433
That's…

154
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:34,933
It's okay, it's okay.

155
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,267
Father, let's go.

156
00:10:46,267 --> 00:10:48,833
Oh, wait. Jae Bok, here!

157
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,467
You wanted this, right? Here!

158
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,500
- Let's go. 
 - Yes, Father.

159
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,500
- Let's go. 
 - Yes.

160
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,633
What do you want to do?

161
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:42,300
Yes, this is Noh Young Won Clinic.

162
00:11:43,533 --> 00:11:46,100
Yes, you contacted me like this, but I'm sorry.

163
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,867
Dr. Noh's schedule is very tight right now.

164
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:51,633
Yeah, I know.

165
00:11:51,633 --> 00:11:54,967
Yes, you can currently make a reservation after six months.

166
00:11:54,967 --> 00:11:57,633
Yes, sorry.

167
00:11:58,433 --> 00:12:01,700
Doctor, everyone is asking you to take more reservations.

168
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,600
Do Hyun is in his second year, so I have a lot to take care of!

169
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:09,967
Hoist your sail when the wind is fair.

170
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:12,700
It won't be different. I'd become estranged from my family.

171
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,467
I've always said that work is important, but…

172
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:18,100
- Family is also important. 
 - Family is also important.

173
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:22,400
You are really amazing.

174
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,733
You do all the workand also take care of your family.

175
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:29,567
Aren't you feeling frustrated? Just take a breath.

176
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:33,533
I don't like doing too many consultations without thinking.

177
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:35,600
- I have my own level. 
 - That's right.

178
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,133
Here is today's patient list.

179
00:12:39,867 --> 00:12:41,067
Is it a new patient?

180
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:42,633
Yes.

181
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,567
    
 What?

182
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:47,367
Because I'm pretty?

183
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,567
I know.

184
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,467
I'll guide you this way.

185
00:12:53,467 --> 00:12:55,600
Doctor, the patient has arrived.

186
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,100
Yes.

187
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,767
Please sit here.

188
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:05,400
Hello?

189
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,900
Hello, doctor.

190
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,833
Nice to meet you.

191
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:13,400
I really wanted to meet you.

192
00:13:15,033 --> 00:13:17,500
I've been waiting for a really long time.

193
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,567
Really? I'm so sorry.

194
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:24,500
The reason you came to the hospital isn't

195
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,600
because I'm pretty. Right?

196
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,567
That's the reason.

197
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:32,800
Really? I don't feel bad.

198
00:13:35,067 --> 00:13:37,767
What about shortness of breath?

199
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:42,700
What about you? Are you all right?

200
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,900
I also get out of breath sometimes.

201
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,267
We all have things that make us feel suffocated. Right?

202
00:13:50,267 --> 00:13:51,967
"I'm not the only one."

203
00:13:51,967 --> 00:13:53,967
"Everyone else is the same."

204
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:57,033
Thinking like that is also a defense mechanism.

205
00:13:57,033 --> 00:14:02,033
Maybe if you take your time and find the cause first, you'll be fine.

206
00:14:02,033 --> 00:14:06,600
What do you think makes you feel suffocated?

207
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,167
Feeling anxious?

208
00:14:17,633 --> 00:14:20,167
Feeling frustrated?

209
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,733
Actually,

210
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:31,000
I have someone I love.

211
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:36,333
But I feel like I'm dying because that person

212
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,833
doesn't know how I feel.

213
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:41,967
You feel like you're dying?

214
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,400
What about him?

215
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,467
Does he know that you feel that way?

216
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:51,600
I guess he doesn't know.

217
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,133
Do you want him to know how you feel?

218
00:14:57,133 --> 00:15:01,767
I feel anxious and frustrated because I think he's unhappy.

219
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:05,300
He has a family that doesn't suit him.

220
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,300
A family that doesn't suit him?

221
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,233
What can I say…

222
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,200
What I'm frustrated about is.

223
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:20,367
I'm not saying that I want him to divorce for my happiness.

224
00:15:20,367 --> 00:15:24,767
Why can't those people break up if they don't even love each other?

225
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:28,833
Why do they live together just because they are family?

226
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,533
Something like this.

227
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:34,967
I just…

228
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:39,100
I just really want him to be happy.

229
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:44,833
Still, people will criticize me. Right?

230
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:49,500
Are you afraid of people criticizing you?

231
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,767
No, not really.

232
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:56,300
That doesn't matter.

233
00:15:56,967 --> 00:15:58,933
But…

234
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:07,467
What if his family finds out about our relationship?

235
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:13,767
It's funny how they all pretend to know everything about each other,

236
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:16,033
but they don't know anything.

237
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:22,667
Doctor.

238
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:25,033
What about you?

239
00:16:25,033 --> 00:16:26,700
About what?

240
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,733
Do you know everything? About your family?

241
00:16:33,267 --> 00:16:35,067
Well, I don't know.

242
00:16:35,733 --> 00:16:39,967
Do we really need to know everything about each other?

243
00:16:43,633 --> 00:16:45,733
I see.

244
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,033
   

245
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,267
"As expected, it's boring!"

246
00:17:00,267 --> 00:17:03,433
You are more boring.

247
00:17:03,433 --> 00:17:05,467
 Are you mentally all right? 

248
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:08,133
Do you think I'll be fine?

249
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:10,900
 She will not have a husband. 

250
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,733
 Even if she has one, he would still cheat on her! 

251
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:38,567
What are you doing?

252
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,233
What?

253
00:18:41,233 --> 00:18:44,833
I'm currently admiring the work.

254
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,300
I know your tastes are weird,

255
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,900
but let's get rid of this picture.

256
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,500
I'm having nightmares every night.

257
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,733
What's the matter?

258
00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:03,233
It's my room.

259
00:19:03,233 --> 00:19:05,633
Can't I turn off the light?

260
00:19:07,967 --> 00:19:10,967
Okay, I get it.

261
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,067
You never know.

262
00:19:35,733 --> 00:19:37,900
That might fall.

263
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,133
Please let us have precious lives.

264
00:19:58,133 --> 00:20:01,467
I bless and pray in the name of Jesus.

265
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:02,933
Amen.

266
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:04,933
- Amen. 
 - Amen.

267
00:20:04,933 --> 00:20:06,567
Amen.

268
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,933
Prosecutor Choi, it's been a while.

269
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:18,300
- How are you? 
 - It's been a while.

270
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,300
It reminds me of you being a prosecutor in the past.

271
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,900
Is that so?

272
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,500
Every time I look at the prosecutor's office,

273
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,500
I get dizzy thinking about how I lived.

274
00:20:28,767 --> 00:20:30,500
Oh my.

275
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,733
Time really flies.

276
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:37,367
I heard it's really difficult to make an appointment at Dr. Noh's hospital.

277
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:40,433
My niece asked me to help her make a reservation,

278
00:20:40,433 --> 00:20:42,833
but it would be hard even if I pray. Right?

279
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,967
- Doctor Noh? 
 - Yes.

280
00:20:44,967 --> 00:20:47,567
Can you do a consultation for her next week?

281
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:51,433
Mrs. Park's niece asked for a favor.

282
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:53,833
Is that possible?

283
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:57,033
Actually, it's not possible

284
00:20:57,033 --> 00:21:00,467
to change a reservation due to a personal request.

285
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,400
Just a moment.

286
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:11,600
I'm sorry, but this month is fully booked so it might not be possible.

287
00:21:13,767 --> 00:21:15,933
If you give me your niece's number,

288
00:21:15,933 --> 00:21:18,200
our manager will reach out to you.

289
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,367
Oh really? Thank you so much.

290
00:21:22,367 --> 00:21:25,633
Dr. Noh said she'd make a reservation for her.

291
00:21:25,633 --> 00:21:28,367
Oh. Thank you, Dr. Noh!

292
00:21:28,367 --> 00:21:30,800
No, it's nothing.

293
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,467
I'm jealous of you.

294
00:21:32,467 --> 00:21:33,433
Yeah.

295
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:36,333
I feel proud these days thanks to my daughter-in-law.

296
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,800
Oh, no.

297
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,667
Oh, of course. I should do that.

298
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:43,100
You and he have a special relationship.

299
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,867
- Thank you. 
 - Let's go.

300
00:21:46,867 --> 00:21:49,100
Good for you.

301
00:21:51,433 --> 00:21:53,400
Let's go, Mom.

302
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,300
Amen.

303
00:22:00,633 --> 00:22:02,233
Son.

304
00:22:03,467 --> 00:22:04,933
Are you all right?

305
00:22:04,933 --> 00:22:08,067
Just some routine that always repeats itself.

306
00:22:08,067 --> 00:22:09,800
You…

307
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,233
What?

308
00:22:11,867 --> 00:22:14,233
Is it because of that Soyee?

309
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:15,967
No, it's not!

310
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:19,467
No? Were you dumped?

311
00:22:19,467 --> 00:22:21,400
No.

312
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,300
So what is it? Are you two dating?

313
00:22:28,733 --> 00:22:31,567
Tell me. I'll keep it a secret.

314
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:34,767
You'll tell everything to my mom.

315
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:37,333
Why would I tell her all that?

316
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:41,367
You tend to be too controlled by my mom.

317
00:22:46,067 --> 00:22:48,800
That's because I love her.

318
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,833
What about Soyee? What kind of style is Soyee?

319
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:53,000
Don't worry.

320
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,067
Because she's different from my mom.

321
00:23:01,533 --> 00:23:03,067
Soyee!

322
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,400
What are you going to do?

323
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:13,800
You should get your haircut.

324
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,500
Should I?

325
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,367
She's similar to her.

326
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,200
Young Won.

327
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,533
Why did you come at this hour?

328
00:23:36,533 --> 00:23:38,833
Oh, Young Won.

329
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:42,500
I don't think I'm suited for sales.

330
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,367
No, I don't think I fit in with those doctors.

331
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:48,833
Why should my schedule be empty when doctors are having lunch?

332
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:50,400
I also have my own schedule.

333
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,400
That's what you do in sales.

334
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,733
If you're going to work with that attitude, just quit.

335
00:23:55,733 --> 00:23:58,200
Yeah, so I quit!

336
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,033
What?! You…

337
00:24:02,367 --> 00:24:04,633
You quit again in less than a month?

338
00:24:04,633 --> 00:24:07,000
I also have a plan.

339
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,433
Plan? What is it?

340
00:24:08,433 --> 00:24:10,933
I'll… I'll start a startup!

341
00:24:10,933 --> 00:24:12,433
Startup?

342
00:24:12,433 --> 00:24:15,467
I thought about it, and…

343
00:24:15,467 --> 00:24:18,100
The idea is to use ARS to allow each counselor

344
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,800
to hear your prescription.

345
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,400
Or maybe sending it by text.

346
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,733
It's like a kind of AI chatbot system.

347
00:24:24,733 --> 00:24:28,533
By making this paid, many people can…

348
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:31,500
The world is moving forward

349
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,300
based on big data.

350
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,367
It's not something that never existed.

351
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:39,100
Oh my. Think about it carefully.

352
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,400
If you want to share your brilliant advice with many people,

353
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,033
there is no better service than this.

354
00:24:45,033 --> 00:24:47,567
People living in rural areas

355
00:24:47,567 --> 00:24:50,733
and people living overseas are all potential customers.

356
00:24:50,733 --> 00:24:52,467
Can't you see the money?

357
00:24:52,467 --> 00:24:54,967
Can't you see it?

358
00:24:54,967 --> 00:24:58,933
It's an amazing idea, but you don't accept it.

359
00:24:58,933 --> 00:25:00,200
Or Young Won...!

360
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,833
You're tired of dealing with people

361
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:06,933
and consulting with them these days. Right?

362
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:12,300
How about consulting with the dogs?

363
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,067
Ten million people are keeping pets.

364
00:25:15,067 --> 00:25:19,267
Dog camp with Dr. Noh Young Won.

365
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,767
Stop it!

366
00:25:21,633 --> 00:25:23,700
People don't know much about you.

367
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,967
A doctor who seems to embrace everything is so violent.

368
00:25:26,967 --> 00:25:29,633
- People should know it! 
 - What?

369
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,867
- Oh. I'm sad. 
 - Still not going?

370
00:25:36,867 --> 00:25:38,533
I'm going.

371
00:25:38,533 --> 00:25:40,133
Why are you urging me this way?

372
00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:41,967
I'm so sad.

373
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:31,733
   

374
00:26:44,033 --> 00:26:49,367
   

375
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,667
What is that?

376
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:57,333
No, it's nothing.

377
00:26:57,333 --> 00:27:01,700
I made a reservation for Chairman Lee's niece two weeks later.

378
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,600
Okay. Good job, thank you.

379
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,367
Even if it's a chairman's favor,

380
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:10,067
they can't reserve Dr. Noh's consultation with money.

381
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,700
- Thank you. 
 - All right.

382
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:41,167
 Hold on for a while. 

383
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,367
 Young Won, it's okay. 

384
00:27:45,367 --> 00:27:50,300
 Sometimes, you might slip and fall like this. 

385
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,700
 It hurts if you slip. 

386
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,667
 That's why there is an ointment. 

387
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:57,533
 I'll be there for you when you get sick more. 

388
00:27:59,067 --> 00:28:03,167
 Now, it's done. 

389
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:09,533
 Young Won, life... 

390
00:28:09,533 --> 00:28:14,833
 isn't always this smooth and easy. 

391
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:19,833
 You could fail or slip like before. 

392
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:24,533
 So, as life... 

393
00:28:24,533 --> 00:28:30,367
 goes up and down, you become stronger. 

394
00:28:30,367 --> 00:28:32,800
 So the slide at the playground 

395
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,500
 is for practicing slipping. Right? 

396
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,500
 No. 

397
00:28:38,667 --> 00:28:41,367
 I won't slip. 

398
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:21,500
Are you okay?

399
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,600
What? I'm fine.

400
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:57,533
You've worked hard.

401
00:30:17,367 --> 00:30:19,433
Let's go eat.

402
00:30:19,433 --> 00:30:21,933
Everyone must be hungry.

403
00:30:21,933 --> 00:30:23,567
All right.

404
00:30:25,233 --> 00:30:26,800
Yes, I should do that.

405
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,633
   

406
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:34,133
There's the kimchi stew restaurant…

407
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:35,667
Mister.

408
00:30:37,467 --> 00:30:40,733
Tae Oh. What's going on? You haven't contacted me.

409
00:30:40,733 --> 00:30:43,433
You have a lunch appointment.

410
00:30:43,433 --> 00:30:45,800
I should have called you.

411
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,133
Doctor Oh,

412
00:30:50,133 --> 00:30:53,433
I forgot I had a prior engagement today.

413
00:30:53,433 --> 00:30:55,133
A prior engagement?

414
00:30:55,633 --> 00:30:57,667
You didn't say that.

415
00:30:57,667 --> 00:30:59,500
I'm hungry.

416
00:31:01,767 --> 00:31:03,933
Eat something delicious with this.

417
00:31:03,933 --> 00:31:05,733
Eat something delicious.

418
00:31:05,733 --> 00:31:07,300
I'll go!

419
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,900
Why didn't you tell me?

420
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,733
I missed you.

421
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:18,333
The Doctor of the Year award?

422
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:20,767
I expected Dr. Noh,

423
00:31:20,767 --> 00:31:23,900
but I didn't expect Dr. Choi.

424
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:29,900
Your predictions are usually wrong.

425
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,400
Anyway, I'm sure you're happy that your son and daughter-in-law

426
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,167
both received awards.

427
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:39,567
This outfit would also be perfect for an awards ceremony.

428
00:31:39,567 --> 00:31:41,833
Well, should I really go?

429
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:45,000
Aren't you going to the awards ceremony?

430
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,633
I'm not sure.

431
00:31:47,133 --> 00:31:50,033
When will you wear this clothes?

432
00:31:53,233 --> 00:31:58,067
By the way, when will the winner come for the fitting?

433
00:31:58,067 --> 00:32:02,200
How many years has it been since you tailored Dr. Choi's clothes?

434
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,967
Just do it yourself.

435
00:32:03,967 --> 00:32:06,467
And you know Jae Jin.

436
00:32:06,467 --> 00:32:10,400
He's not interested in receiving awards.

437
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,533
No, I was talking about Dr. Noh.

438
00:32:13,533 --> 00:32:16,967
Everything Dr. Noh wears becomes a hot topic.

439
00:32:16,967 --> 00:32:20,200
I'm very concerned about it.

440
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:23,700
When is she coming?

441
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,700
What is this?

442
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,267
Clothes here aren't as stylish as they used to be.

443
00:32:31,267 --> 00:32:35,000
The clothes are a bit out of style.

444
00:32:52,767 --> 00:32:54,880
This restaurant still exists?

445
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,770
   

446
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,200
   

447
00:33:06,233 --> 00:33:07,667
Oh my.

448
00:33:09,133 --> 00:33:10,800
Welcome.

449
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:43,000
Does the soup suit your taste?

450
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,533
It's been a while.

451
00:34:00,533 --> 00:34:04,333
Yes, how have you been?

452
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:09,600
But how did you open this…

453
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,567
You asked me what you should eat when you were feeling empty.

454
00:34:11,567 --> 00:34:14,833
You asked me what you should eat when you were feeling empty.

455
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:18,800
It was the only food I served at that time.

456
00:34:19,567 --> 00:34:22,733
I was afraid the taste you liked would change.

457
00:34:22,733 --> 00:34:24,867
I took over the restaurant.

458
00:34:31,033 --> 00:34:32,433
It's too much.

459
00:34:32,433 --> 00:34:35,033
- Eat this. 
 - Thank you.

460
00:34:38,267 --> 00:34:40,000
It's so sweet.

461
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,033
Drink your coffee.

462
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,067
Jae Jin, there's something I wanted to ask.

463
00:34:48,067 --> 00:34:51,000
You said Do Hyun is eighteen, right?

464
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,200
Yes, that's right.

465
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,567
I think you're a very friend-like dad.

466
00:34:54,567 --> 00:34:56,667
Yeah, we're like friends!

467
00:34:56,667 --> 00:35:00,033
The two of us are the dumbest in my family.

468
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,967
He was so cute.

469
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,133
Jae Jin?

470
00:35:05,133 --> 00:35:07,233
Honey.

471
00:35:07,233 --> 00:35:08,800
This is my husband.

472
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,400
Hello.

473
00:35:11,267 --> 00:35:13,867
- I'll go out first. 
 - Oh, okay.

474
00:35:15,233 --> 00:35:17,333
You also had lunch here?

475
00:35:17,333 --> 00:35:18,867
Yes.

476
00:35:19,767 --> 00:35:21,500
This is my senior's son.

477
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,433
He passed the medical school entrance exam!

478
00:35:23,433 --> 00:35:25,500
He's your junior.

479
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,267
I see. Nice to meet you.

480
00:35:28,267 --> 00:35:31,567
Hello, I'm Moon Tae Oh.

481
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:36,600
Haven't we seen each other somewhere? You look familiar.

482
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,400
Yes, we have!

483
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,233
Where?

484
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,000
On TV, you're so famous.

485
00:35:49,467 --> 00:35:50,667
Then, enjoy your meal.

486
00:35:50,667 --> 00:35:52,033
All right, see you later.

487
00:35:52,033 --> 00:35:54,133
See you later. It was nice to meet you.

488
00:35:54,133 --> 00:35:56,867
Yes, it was nice meeting you.

489
00:35:59,567 --> 00:36:01,667
I feel like I'm seeing a celebrity.

490
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:03,867
She also had lunch here.

491
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,267
Yes, Ra Kyung?

492
00:36:28,267 --> 00:36:32,733
A rumor video has been uploaded.

493
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:34,333
What is it?

494
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:38,267
That's about your father's case.

495
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:42,600
Oh, just send it to me.

496
00:36:50,067 --> 00:36:52,700
 Dr. Noh Young Won said on TV that 

497
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:56,200
 if a family member is harassing you, you should cut them off. 

498
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,833
 But you know what? 

499
00:36:57,833 --> 00:37:01,467
 That she herself had a family she couldn't cut off. 

500
00:37:01,467 --> 00:37:04,000
 Dr. Noh has a father who committed suicide. 

501
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,433
 He committed suicide while being investigated for embezzlement, 

502
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:10,267
 but the truth is that he was involved in 

503
00:37:10,267 --> 00:37:13,033
 against a female secretary! 

504
00:37:13,033 --> 00:37:16,800
 What does she think about her father molesting his secretary? 

505
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,767
 Is it common sense for a person who is unable to cut off her family 

506
00:37:20,767 --> 00:37:23,433
 and asks a patient to cut off their family 

507
00:37:23,433 --> 00:37:26,900
 to fix the mentality of others? 

508
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:37,100
 Hwangju Group Director Noh was investigated on charges of embezzlement 

509
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,900
 and returned home early this morning. 

510
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,067
 The investigation, which started round 10 a.m. yesterday 

511
00:37:42,067 --> 00:37:43,567
 and continued overnight, 

512
00:37:43,567 --> 00:37:46,167
 ended around 5 a.m. today, 19 hours later. 

513
00:37:46,167 --> 00:37:48,667
 Mr. Noh is suspected of embezzling 

514
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:53,367
 public funds from Hwangju Group during the prosecution investigation. 

515
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,833
 Why did you do that? 

516
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:12,200
 What does that mean? 

517
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,400
 That's not it. 

518
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,567
 Secretary Song has already stated that she was sexually harassed. 

519
00:38:18,567 --> 00:38:21,533
 Don't you know me? I told you I didn't. 

520
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:23,500
 That's not the point. 

521
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,600
 The point is that she's making very specific 

522
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,433
 and consistent statements. 

523
00:38:27,433 --> 00:38:28,667
 Goh Myeon. 

524
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:31,867
 No matter what anyone says,
you have to trust me! 

525
00:38:33,433 --> 00:38:35,567
 I honestly don't know. 

526
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,133
 It's too late for me to do anything. 

527
00:38:40,133 --> 00:38:42,300
 - I'll go. 
 - Goh Myeon. 

528
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,800
 Goh Myeon! 

529
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,133
 No, Young Won. 

530
00:38:57,133 --> 00:39:01,367
 No, I feel it's unfair. 

531
00:39:01,367 --> 00:39:04,600
 I really didn't do that. I mean it! 

532
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,333
 Prove it. 

533
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,233
 If that's true, just prove it! 

534
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:13,767
 You said that 

535
00:39:13,767 --> 00:39:17,033
 people become stronger as they slip. 

536
00:39:18,767 --> 00:39:21,433
 You've slipped this far, 

537
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:24,667
 so now you need to get stronger! 

538
00:39:25,933 --> 00:39:28,767
 You have to protect our family! 

539
00:39:31,367 --> 00:39:33,567
 Because you're a dad. 

540
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:24,030
♫  How pathetic (I am) Do you hate...? (This world)  ♫

541
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:29,620

545
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,533
Yeah, so did you find out something?

546
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,067
There is no criminal record, and nothing special about SNS.

547
00:42:04,133 --> 00:42:06,233
There's nothing.

548
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:09,500
It's weirder that there's nothing.

549
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:13,333
Find out more. There must be something there.

550
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:14,967
Yes.

551
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,600
I'll prepare a glass of whiskey.

552
00:42:41,533 --> 00:42:43,000
Are you still drinking, Father?

553
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,433
Yeah, you didn't sleep?

554
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,767
Bring a glass and have a seat.

555
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:51,800
Let's have a drink after such a long time.

556
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,233
Yes.

557
00:42:58,833 --> 00:43:00,800
I'll pour you a drink.

558
00:43:08,867 --> 00:43:11,200
Do you have any concerns?

559
00:43:13,233 --> 00:43:15,633
It's just…

560
00:43:15,633 --> 00:43:18,167
I'm thinking of him today.

561
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,333
Your father-in-law, Young Won's dad.

562
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:23,867
Yes.

563
00:43:26,567 --> 00:43:29,367
Be nice to Young Won.

564
00:43:29,367 --> 00:43:32,833
All right, Father.

565
00:43:34,033 --> 00:43:37,367
Jae Jin, come here.

566
00:43:37,367 --> 00:43:39,433
In the past, I…

567
00:43:39,433 --> 00:43:41,433
Don't you sleep?

568
00:43:42,267 --> 00:43:44,433
Dr. Choi, aren't you tired?

569
00:43:44,433 --> 00:43:45,867
Oh, yes.

570
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,867
He's tired now.

571
00:43:51,933 --> 00:43:56,000
Your mom still thinks you're a kid.

572
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,700
Yeah, go in and sleep. Get some rest.

573
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,233
You've drank a lot.

574
00:44:00,233 --> 00:44:01,767
Just drink this and go to sleep.

575
00:44:01,767 --> 00:44:03,667
Okay.

576
00:44:05,967 --> 00:44:07,700
I'm going to sleep.

577
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,467
What do you not like so much?

578
00:44:19,967 --> 00:44:24,367
You've been cheating your whole life, and now you're

579
00:44:24,367 --> 00:44:27,333
suddenly acting like a father?

580
00:44:27,333 --> 00:44:29,700
It would be better if I do that now.

581
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,567
And...

582
00:44:31,567 --> 00:44:35,100
when he was young, you were the one who kept me from going near Jae Jin.

583
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,433
Why did I do that?

584
00:44:38,567 --> 00:44:41,933
He had nothing to learn from you.

585
00:44:41,933 --> 00:44:44,900
Not letting your child touch dirty things

586
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,800
is what maternal love is all about.

587
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,000
I'm not telling you to thank me for not letting him know about

588
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,700
the many affairs that have been happening

589
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,600
and keep your position as a prosecutor.

590
00:44:57,567 --> 00:44:59,600
So,

591
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:03,300
will you live your life without bothering me?

592
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:07,633
Was that for me?

593
00:45:07,633 --> 00:45:10,567
Or did you do it for our family?

594
00:45:10,567 --> 00:45:12,000
That's not it.

595
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,033
That was all done to protect your noble image.

596
00:45:16,033 --> 00:45:17,133
Why?

597
00:45:17,133 --> 00:45:19,700
Because you'll be embarrassed.

598
00:45:21,233 --> 00:45:23,467
That's absurd.

599
00:45:23,467 --> 00:45:26,733
I can't believe you have such poor empathy.

600
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:32,200
I really regret...

601
00:45:32,867 --> 00:45:36,700
protecting someone like you...

602
00:45:37,933 --> 00:45:40,000
as a family member!

603
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,900
Mrs. Hong!

604
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:47,200
Do you really think that you have maintained this family

605
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:51,233
and everything with just your own efforts?

606
00:45:51,233 --> 00:45:52,767
Regret?

607
00:45:53,467 --> 00:45:56,367
That pride and prejudice

608
00:45:56,367 --> 00:46:00,067
is ruining your life and Jae Jin's!

609
00:46:00,833 --> 00:46:02,733
You know that?

610
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,867
Oh, that's right.

611
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:27,467
Jae Bok, go slowly.

612
00:46:27,467 --> 00:46:29,733
All right? Jae Bok.

613
00:46:36,633 --> 00:46:39,367
Jae Bok, it's fine.

614
00:46:39,367 --> 00:46:41,333
That was dangerous.

615
00:47:24,433 --> 00:47:27,267
   
 Our daughter-in-law, who comes to mind 

616
00:47:27,267 --> 00:47:30,167
 with the word of eternal beauty. Fighting! 

617
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,567
Oh? Jae Jin.

618
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,833
Yes.

619
00:47:43,133 --> 00:47:44,833
What's the matter?

620
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,500
Oh my! Goh Myeon!

621
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,567
How could my brother,

622
00:48:43,567 --> 00:48:46,667
who took such good care of himself, get hit by a rock and die!

623
00:48:46,667 --> 00:48:51,367
There's no way that could happen.

624
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,267
Let's take Mother out.

625
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:59,167
Brother!

626
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,367
I'll have the car waiting.

627
00:49:19,367 --> 00:49:20,833
You stay here.

628
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:24,433
You know my father's guests well.

629
00:49:25,533 --> 00:49:27,067
I'll…

630
00:49:27,067 --> 00:49:28,800
I'll take her to my car.

631
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,700
Could you do that?

632
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,900
Thank you, Doctor Oh.

633
00:50:16,567 --> 00:50:18,533
Doctor.

634
00:50:25,567 --> 00:50:27,767
Lee Se Na?

635
00:50:30,167 --> 00:50:33,033
Why are you here?

636
00:50:35,633 --> 00:50:38,333
Do you know my father-in-law?

637
00:50:55,733 --> 00:51:01,067
 I have someone I love. 

638
00:51:01,067 --> 00:51:04,933
 He has a family that doesn't suit him. 

639
00:51:04,933 --> 00:51:08,833
 Why can't those people break up if they don't love each other? 

640
00:51:08,833 --> 00:51:13,300
 Why do they live together just because we are family? 

641
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,100
 Something like this. 

642
00:51:19,633 --> 00:51:21,533
I'm sorry.

643
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,133
See you next time, Doctor.

644
00:52:11,467 --> 00:52:15,433
Yeah, you probably have no appetite, either.

645
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,800
Hold on.

646
00:52:42,133 --> 00:52:45,667
He really liked this picture.

647
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:50,467
It's been quite some time since you took care of him.

648
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:52,667
It's been 15 years.

649
00:52:53,367 --> 00:52:58,500
He joked that I should do it for 20 years even if it was boring.

650
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,900
He really liked you.

651
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:06,633
Thank you for still being with us.

652
00:53:36,867 --> 00:53:40,433
I should have had another drink then, Father.

653
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:41,667
   

654
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:04,120
   

655
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:13,867

659
00:56:42,767 --> 00:56:47,267
 Prosecutor Choi, please handle Director Noh. 

660
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:52,267
 And you should come to our Hwangju Group. 

661
00:56:52,267 --> 00:56:56,300
 But Chairman, he has such an upright personality, 

662
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:59,200
 so I don't think he will stay still. 

663
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,267
 So, we have no choice but to link this 

664
00:57:02,267 --> 00:57:05,233
 to the sexual harassment case. 

665
00:57:05,233 --> 00:57:06,800
 Yes, then, 

666
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:11,367
 she will make a statement that she was sexually harassed by him. Right? 

667
00:57:11,367 --> 00:57:13,067
 But, Chairman, 

668
00:57:13,067 --> 00:57:16,833
 you have to make sure that the secretary does her job. 

669
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:19,300
 Of course. 

670
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:21,433
 All right. 

671
00:57:21,433 --> 00:57:23,200
 I'll do that. 

672
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:27,267
 You must make sure that the secretary does her job. 

673
00:57:27,267 --> 00:57:30,333
 If it turns out that was a false statement, 

674
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:32,800
 we're in big trouble. 

675
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,067
 I definitely worked on it. 

676
00:57:35,067 --> 00:57:37,833
 I gave her a lot of money. 

677
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,300
 No, Young Won, I feel it's unfair. 

678
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,733
 If that's true, just prove it! 

679
00:58:01,733 --> 00:58:04,233
 You have to protect our family. 

680
00:58:14,033 --> 00:58:16,133
   

681
00:58:20,867 --> 00:58:22,533
 Young Won. 

682
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,267
 Jae Jin, come here. 

683
00:58:31,033 --> 00:58:32,767
 Sis!

 There's a rumor that your mother-in-law killed him. 

697
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:05,667
 Prosecutor Choi's death is 

698
01:01:05,667 --> 01:01:09,067
 exactly the same as in Hong Sa Gang's novel! 

699
01:01:09,067 --> 01:01:11,933
 How long will the conference last? 

700
01:01:11,933 --> 01:01:14,667
 There was no conference on plastic surgery. 

701
01:01:14,667 --> 01:01:16,733
 I'm back. 

702
01:01:16,733 --> 01:01:19,433
 I'm so proud 

703
01:01:19,433 --> 01:01:20,833
 of what we've achieved so far. 

704
01:01:20,833 --> 01:01:23,133
 Did you already know that? 

705
01:01:23,133 --> 01:01:24,267
 Does that matter? 

706
01:01:24,267 --> 01:01:26,867
 You don't have to know everything about family. 

707
01:01:26,867 --> 01:01:29,133
 Is that really true?
