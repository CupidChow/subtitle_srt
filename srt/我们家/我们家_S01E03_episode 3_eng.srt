1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
   

2
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,967
Dr. Oh?

3
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:13,833
Dr. Oh!

4
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:16,400
She didn't die.

5
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,000
Mother.

6
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:41,167
I didn't kill her.

7
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,633
Then who did…

8
00:01:44,633 --> 00:01:47,500
I haven't been here for long.

9
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,733
When I arrived, she was already like that.

10
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,700
But, Dr. Noh.

11
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,367
You're not doubting me. Right?

12
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,633
Let's talk about that later.

13
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:05,333
I think she hurt her head.

14
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,700
I'll have to check with the hospital…

15
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,333
911?

16
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,067
Dr. Noh,

17
00:02:12,067 --> 00:02:15,300
how will you explain this situation?

18
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:20,800
- But… 
 - Let's not make a big deal out of nothing.

19
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,333
The whole country knows you.

20
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:27,600
Can you handle that?

21
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,667
I have to save her first.

22
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:48,600
It would be better to go to Honghak Hospital which is closest to here.

23
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,000
Yeah, good idea.

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,200
That's exactly what I was thinking!

25
00:02:56,433 --> 00:02:58,667
What are you doing?

26
00:02:58,667 --> 00:02:59,733
Me?

27
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:02,100
We need to move her!

28
00:03:31,367 --> 00:03:33,733
There are police.

29
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:37,867
In times like these, you have to be calm.

30
00:03:46,567 --> 00:03:48,767
Please open the window.

31
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,367
Could you please lower the window further?

32
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:09,900
You are Dr. Noh Young Won. Right?

33
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,900
Yes.

34
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,200
You can just go.

35
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,933
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

36
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:40,533
Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name.

37
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:42,367
Thy Kingdom come. Thy Will be done,

38
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,467
on earth as it is Heaven.

39
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:46,567
Give us this day our daily bread.

40
00:04:46,567 --> 00:04:49,967
And forgive us our trespasses...

41
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,210
     

42
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,980
   

43
00:05:28,033 --> 00:05:32,010
   

44
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,067
Mrs. Hong!

45
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:40,033
What happened? Who is this person?

46
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:42,667
She came to my house to visit and suddenly got hurt,

47
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:45,700
so I was embarrassed.

48
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,867
It's an honor to be of some help to you, Madam.

49
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:52,467
I didn't help you because I wanted something.

50
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:57,267
Of course not, but we received a lot of help.

51
00:05:57,267 --> 00:06:00,667
I am always grateful to you.

52
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:05,467
Madam, it is thanks to you that this hospital can be run like this.

53
00:06:05,467 --> 00:06:08,767
Please come visit us anytime, whenever you need us. 
    

54
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:11,210
   

55
00:06:22,233 --> 00:06:27,733
It's a temporary shock, so she'll regain consciousness soon.

56
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:31,400
Fortunately, there's no internal bleeding,

57
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,533
but a concussion can have aftereffects.

58
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:37,433
Who tried to harm Dr. Oh…

59
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:41,700
We'll find out when Dr. Oh wakes up.

60
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,567
I guess I should report it.

61
00:06:43,567 --> 00:06:47,067
We need to find out who tried to harm Dr. Oh.

62
00:06:48,967 --> 00:06:50,710
Mother?

63
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,833
What are you doing?

64
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,700
Jae Jin could have done that!

65
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:04,200
Jae Jin?

66
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,067
I said Jae Jin might have done it. I didn't say he did it.

67
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:10,433
Is this the time to make a pun?

68
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:12,600
That villa.

69
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,867
Do you remember that?

70
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,633
Because you used to come over to play when you were little…

71
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:20,533
I heard that Jae Jin sold that villa one day…

72
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:23,933
But he didn't.

73
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:31,000
And the fact that Dr. Oh went there means that...

74
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,633
it has something to do with Jae Jin.

75
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,633
A downright lie.

76
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:41,567
Me?

77
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,333
Are you not believing me?

78
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,700
I got a text yesterday.

79
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,133
It's a downright lie.

80
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:51,067
Who sent something like that?

81
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:55,500
But why did you go to the villa?

82
00:07:56,667 --> 00:08:01,033
Why did you go there then?

83
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:05,833
A miniature of the villa arrived along with a strange text message.

84
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:09,100
I also received a photo of Jae Jin taken at the villa before that.

85
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:14,000
I went there since I had a reasonable suspicion that it had something to do with Jae Jin.

86
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:16,033
I see.

87
00:08:16,033 --> 00:08:22,767
Besides, the academic conference that Jae Jin has been attending for a year didn't even exist.

88
00:08:23,267 --> 00:08:27,867
The place he went to every week for conferences was Yangpyeong, where the villa is located.

89
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,967
Why did Jae Jin do that?

90
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:36,067
But Dr. Oh was lying down in that villa and you were there,

91
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:39,033
so it can't help but seem strange.

92
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:40,767
So, are you saying that

93
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:44,367
Jae Jin is cheating on you?

94
00:08:44,367 --> 00:08:45,800
Don't be suspicious.

95
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,000
Dr. Choi isn't that kind of person.

96
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,667
Now, tell me. How did you go to that villa?

97
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:54,967
Me?

98
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,233
I went for a drive.

99
00:08:56,233 --> 00:08:57,233
Went for a drive?

100
00:08:57,233 --> 00:09:00,567
Why can't I drive in my own car?

101
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:04,600
I just went out for a drive and went near the villa,

102
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,067
and the villa was still there, with the lights on inside.

103
00:09:08,067 --> 00:09:10,767
So, I couldn't help but wonder.

104
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:14,533
No, no, Dr. Noh.

105
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:19,233
There should be no suspicion among family members at this time.

106
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:23,933
Now, I wonder if this is the family I knew.

107
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:27,233
Anyway, I need to find out what happened yesterday!

108
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,267
Not even a day has passed!

109
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:34,467
You'll have someone to greet, so stay a little longer.

110
00:09:34,467 --> 00:09:38,433
I'll call Jae Jin. Okay?

111
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,640
   

112
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,100
Is it that much fun to do?

113
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,700
Doctor,

114
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:16,167
did I tell you that my husband got promoted to director?

115
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:21,100
The chairman held my hand tightly

116
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:27,233
and said that without my husband, the company would not exist.

117
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:30,933
You must be proud.

118
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,033
Did I tell you that...

119
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,533
my daughter got first place in the whole school again?

120
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:51,133
My daughter is good at everything.

121
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:55,467
She is good at both studying and sports.

122
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:59,000
And she's so pretty.

123
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:01,360
Yes.

124
00:11:03,433 --> 00:11:05,800
Then, what's the use?

125
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,600
That bitch...

126
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,633
has a knife for a mouth!

127
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:14,900
Toxic bitch.

128
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:55,667
I'm quitting smoking.

129
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:57,400
All right.

130
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,867
What about CCTV? Was there anything that was turned on?

131
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:06,133
Everything was turned off.

132
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:07,867
What about Dr. Oh's cell phone?

133
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:09,300
There wasn't.

134
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,900
- Even in the car? 
 - Yes.

135
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,900
Since I couldn't reach Jae Jin,

136
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,767
I have no way of knowing what happened.

137
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:23,200
There's something you need to see for a moment.

138
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,800
 You can't talk about her here. 

139
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,233
 You have no sense. 

140
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:14,867
 Contact me in advance when you come. 

141
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,300
 Why? It's my villa. 

142
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,300
 Why don't you keep doing it? 

143
00:14:41,233 --> 00:14:44,700
I should have burned this place down then!

144
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:01,567
Clear everything out of here. Without a trace!

145
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,300
Yes.

146
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,967
But over there…

147
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:08,000
What?

148
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,300
You'll know when you see it.

149
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:39,000
It's ridiculous.

150
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:43,033
   

151
00:15:43,033 --> 00:15:46,500
He used to read books, though.

152
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,540
   

153
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:05,200
 Please leave a message after the beep… 

154
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:14,033
Hello.

155
00:16:14,033 --> 00:16:14,967
Here.

156
00:16:14,967 --> 00:16:16,700
Doctor! What brings you here?

157
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,600
Dr. Choi has the day off today.

158
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,600
I know, I was passing by and thought of you guys, so I bought it.

159
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,100
Thank you.

160
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,867
Dr. Choi texted me that he couldn't come because he had an urgent conference.

161
00:16:27,867 --> 00:16:32,467
But today, Dr. Oh didn't come to work, either.

162
00:16:32,467 --> 00:16:34,767
Have you tried contacting Dr. Oh?

163
00:16:34,767 --> 00:16:37,133
She doesn't answer the phone.

164
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:42,133
Is there something happening to her? She left work in a hurry yesterday.

165
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:44,267
Get back to your work.

166
00:16:53,433 --> 00:16:55,467
Hello.

167
00:16:55,467 --> 00:16:57,000
Nurses!

168
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,733
Jae Jin, no… Where's Dr. Choi?

169
00:16:58,733 --> 00:16:59,733
Jae Jin, no… Where's Dr. Choi?

170
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:03,400
I have to see him today.

171
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,667
Dr. Choi didn't come to work today.

172
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,633
So, why did you come here?

173
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:24,267
I came to see Jae Jin.

174
00:17:24,267 --> 00:17:27,733
We're closer than you think.

175
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:31,033
We ate together,

176
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:34,400
went to the sauna, and did everything!

177
00:17:37,467 --> 00:17:39,000
Why are you being so scary to me?

178
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,967
Young Min, there are a few things

179
00:17:41,967 --> 00:17:45,533
people do when they lie.

180
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:48,533
If I were to interpret it psychologically,

181
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:51,133
I guess I don't even need to talk about that.

182
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:53,100
You know that I worked part-time

183
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,533
- as an investigative consultant when I was in college. Right? 
 - Yes!

184
00:17:56,533 --> 00:18:00,100
You said you need money, right?

185
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,333
- What? 
 - You don't need it?

186
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,500
You don't need it?

187
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,367
I need money!

188
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:08,133
Good idea, Sis!

189
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:09,667
If you give me just 50 million won,

190
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:12,733
I have an awesome startup idea.

191
00:18:12,733 --> 00:18:14,833
Really? Then, shall I listen to it?

192
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,967
- Listen! 
 - No, not that.

193
00:18:16,967 --> 00:18:20,110
What were you talking to my husband about?

194
00:18:24,633 --> 00:18:26,667
That is…

195
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:31,067
That's right! I went to him to borrow some money.

196
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,000
 Brother-in-law. 

197
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,967
 I was startled. You're back? 

198
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:40,700
 Yes. 

199
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,800
 Why did you come without contacting me? 

200
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,733
 That could be possible, since we are close. 

201
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:50,467
 And why do you call me like that? Just call me Young Min. 

202
00:18:50,467 --> 00:18:52,033
 By the way, Jae Jin. 

203
00:18:52,033 --> 00:18:54,667
 You know, I have a brilliant business idea. 

204
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,633
 Well, Young Min. 

205
00:18:56,633 --> 00:19:00,833
 I have some urgent work to do, so let's talk later. 

206
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,333
 Is it urgent? Where are you going? 

207
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,467
 There is an academic conference. 

208
00:19:05,467 --> 00:19:06,900
 I'm late, so next time… 

209
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,267
 But he said he was going to a conference and left in a hurry. 

210
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:12,467
 Oh, I have to talk with him. 

211
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:15,900
 Let's talk about it on your way to the conference. 

212
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,833
 Young Min, I said, let's talk about it later. 

213
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,967
 You can just drop me off on the way. 

214
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:22,733
 You said it was urgent? Move! 

215
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:24,500
 No. 

216
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,800
 It'll be over soon. 

217
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,733
 Jae Jin, this is what I said. You know my sister. Right? 

218
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:33,300
 I told about this to my sister. 

219
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,333
 Even when I spoke to her, she didn't listen. 

220
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:42,033
 Anyway, this is possible with just 20 million won. 

221
00:19:42,033 --> 00:19:45,000
 You have that much money. Right? 

222
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,133
 Yes. 

223
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,033
 Is that possible? 

224
00:19:51,033 --> 00:19:54,967
 Young Min, I think you should get off there. 

225
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:56,367
 Rest area? 

226
00:19:56,367 --> 00:19:59,267
 Why are you going on the freeway? 

227
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,400
 The conference is being held in Yangpyeong?! 

228
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,167
 I'll drop you off here for now. 

229
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:08,433
 Oh my. 

230
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:17,800
 I almost went to Yangpyeong. 

231
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:23,000
 My phone! 

232
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:26,967
 - However, he didn't answer me.  
  - Please leave a message after the beep… 

233
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:29,100
 The phone must have rung. 

234
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,267
So?

235
00:20:30,267 --> 00:20:32,567
Seung Jae came to pick me up.

236
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,467
Seung Jae?

237
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:38,400
Yeah, my military colleague.

238
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,067
Seung Jae, who makes corn noodles at the noodle restaurant.

239
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:44,567
Seung Jae, who makes corn noodles at the noodle restaurant?

240
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:47,167
He's my best friend. Don't you know him?

241
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,867
You've never met him? Why?

242
00:20:50,867 --> 00:20:55,567
See, you don't care about me at all.

243
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:59,100
Even in the past, no one was interested in me.

244
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,233
Both Mom and Dad only talked about you to people.

245
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:05,300
No one said anything about me! It's so frustrating.

246
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,950
Oh my.

247
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:10,033
That's all!

248
00:21:10,633 --> 00:21:14,300
So, when can you give me the money?

249
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,500
What kind of money?

250
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,533
I told you everything because you said you'd give me money.

251
00:21:18,533 --> 00:21:21,567
You should have followed him all the way! You haven't found out anything.

252
00:21:21,567 --> 00:21:24,500
What happened to Jae Jin?

253
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,067
Get off.

254
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:29,967
You said you'd give me money if I just told you about that day!

255
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:31,833
Then, just give me 10 million won.

256
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,300
Stop!

257
00:21:34,967 --> 00:21:37,933
Oh! You always hit me.

258
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:40,800
Okay, okay.

259
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,167
People should know that you are so two-faced!

260
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:47,167
Go.

261
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,500
I got fooled by her again.

262
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:58,233
 Okay, Young Min. I'll give you the money. 

263
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,567
 But your sister doesn't know that I'm going to Yangpyeong. 

264
00:22:04,567 --> 00:22:06,200
 This is the kind of conference that Young Won hates… 

265
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,667
 So I can't go. 

266
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:12,567
 You know what? If I do something that Young Won hates… 

267
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:14,733
 I know! I know! 

268
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,867
 You too have a lot of trouble. 

269
00:22:18,633 --> 00:22:21,800
 Then, if you give me money after going to the conference… 

270
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,400
 I'll give it to you later. 

271
00:22:27,567 --> 00:22:31,800
 I should get it from him quickly before my sister talks to him. 

272
00:22:33,133 --> 00:22:37,233
 But he doesn't even know that she knows that he went to the conference. 

273
00:22:37,233 --> 00:22:40,000
I feel so sorry for him.

274
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,667
I need to talk to him.

275
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:44,767
What?

276
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:51,500
Oh my! My phone!

277
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:04,200
   

278
00:23:08,067 --> 00:23:09,700
- Hello. 
 - Sis.

279
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,033
Is my cell phone in the car?

280
00:23:13,467 --> 00:23:14,867
You…

281
00:23:14,867 --> 00:23:17,333
Why do you always drop your phone?

282
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:18,833
I'm at Jae Jin's hospital now.

283
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:22,033
Come here, I'll be in front of the hospital.

284
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:26,933
Hang up the phone for a while.

285
00:23:36,267 --> 00:23:38,120
   

286
00:23:42,033 --> 00:23:44,767
- Enjoy your lunch. 
 - Thank you.

287
00:24:23,633 --> 00:24:25,433
 Is there something happening to her? 

288
00:24:25,433 --> 00:24:28,567
 She left work in a hurry yesterday. 

289
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:53,700
Dr. Oh,

290
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,580
what happened?

291
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:09,867
Sorry, Dr. Oh.

292
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,367
Hi.

293
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:39,167
   

294
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:55,267
They've known each other since then?

295
00:27:04,567 --> 00:27:06,700
 The number you have dialed is not available. 

296
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,830
 You'll be connected to voice mail 

297
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:11,000
 and charged after the beep. 

298
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,700
Son.

299
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,600
You should answer my calls.

300
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,133
Mother.

301
00:27:22,067 --> 00:27:23,900
Dr. Noh.

302
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,033
What are you doing without even knocking?

303
00:27:26,033 --> 00:27:27,667
Why did you clean it up?

304
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:29,867
Where are you talking about?

305
00:27:29,867 --> 00:27:31,567
I mean the villa!

306
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,233
Why did you go there again?

307
00:27:33,233 --> 00:27:35,267
That's a crime scene.

308
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:39,967
Then should I just leave it like that?

309
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,733
By the way, I need to find Dr. Oh's cell phone.

310
00:27:45,733 --> 00:27:49,967
Anyway, she is the vice director, so I think we should contact the hospital.

311
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:56,067
This?

312
00:27:56,067 --> 00:27:58,000
Lord!

313
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,733
You, Dr. Oh, and Jae Jin have known...

314
00:28:03,733 --> 00:28:05,967
You, Dr. Oh, and Jae Jin have known...

315
00:28:06,533 --> 00:28:08,833
each other for a long time. Right?

316
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:11,800
Why did you keep it from me?

317
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,367
I have never kept anything.

318
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,867
You never asked.

319
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,233
Are you suspicious of their relationship?

320
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:29,267
No.

321
00:28:29,867 --> 00:28:32,033
No, it's not.

322
00:28:32,933 --> 00:28:37,833
Those two aren't in the relationship you think they are.

323
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:41,867
It's just that Dr. Oh was orphaned when she was young

324
00:28:41,867 --> 00:28:45,767
and our family sponsored her.

325
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:50,200
It can't be helped that she likes him alone.

326
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:55,100
Objectively, Jae Jin is good-looking. Right?

327
00:28:58,167 --> 00:29:00,933
I'm late to contact you.

328
00:29:00,933 --> 00:29:04,000
I'm on vacation

329
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,633
for a while.

330
00:29:07,633 --> 00:29:13,733
I already told Dr. Choi, but I don't think it was delivered.

331
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:20,300
Isn't it strange if the vice director keeps not contacting them?

332
00:29:21,033 --> 00:29:25,300
That darn bitch, how dare she…

333
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,700
You shouldn't just delete other people's photos.

334
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,333
Why? It's a picture of my son!

335
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:36,167
Mother.

336
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,960
   

337
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,033
Did you find anything?

338
00:31:28,033 --> 00:31:30,967
There is something you need to check urgently.

339
00:31:30,967 --> 00:31:32,200
What is it?

340
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,100
I found the video of Dr. Choi that night!

341
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,800
The video of Jae Jin?

342
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,833
Yes.

343
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:41,233
I'll send it to you right away!

344
00:32:12,967 --> 00:32:15,490
   

345
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:19,267
 Tuesday. 

346
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,800
 If he wasn't with Dr. Oh, 

347
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,100
 who was he with? 

348
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:55,267
   

349
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,667
Are there these things in the noodles because they are handmade?

350
00:33:04,133 --> 00:33:07,533
Anyway, you're running errands for your uncle?

351
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:10,100
Surprisingly, you think about your family a lot.

352
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:13,167
I can't help but run errands for my uncle.

353
00:33:13,167 --> 00:33:15,733
My uncle raised me.

354
00:33:15,733 --> 00:33:19,267
The most successful person in my family is my uncle.

355
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:24,133
The one who runs the corn noodle restaurant is the most successful person in your family?

356
00:33:24,133 --> 00:33:26,833
I guess it's kind of a hobby after retirement.

357
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:28,600
But what kind of errand is it?

358
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,900
He told me not to tell anyone.

359
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,767
You are quite good at keeping secrets.

360
00:33:32,767 --> 00:33:35,133
My uncle is better at keeping secrets.

361
00:33:35,133 --> 00:33:37,933
My uncle is the best at keeping secrets in my family.

362
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:41,700
Oh my gosh, he's family, but he doesn't even tell me who he voted for

363
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,133
in the presidential election.

364
00:33:44,133 --> 00:33:46,933
It's harsh. My sister is like that, too.

365
00:33:46,933 --> 00:33:49,200
Anyway, just eat it and go.

366
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,767
I have to let the corn dough mature before I go.

367
00:33:51,767 --> 00:33:53,467
So I'm very busy.

368
00:33:53,467 --> 00:33:55,500
This bastard.

369
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,300
I've made a big deal

370
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,100
with my brother-in-law, so now I'm going to focus

371
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,933
solely on business!

372
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,100
Did your brother-in-law say he would give you money?

373
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:12,600
Then what about me?

374
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,733
Seung Jae!

375
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,167
How long are you going to knead corn dough

376
00:34:18,167 --> 00:34:19,700
at your uncle's noodle restaurant and run errands for him?

377
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,667
at your uncle's noodle restaurant and run errands for him?

378
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:26,800
You should have your own corn noodle restaurant too!

379
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,330
Me?

380
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,467
Can I run it?

381
00:34:30,467 --> 00:34:33,100
Hey, don't you remember when we were in the military?

382
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,700
Have you forgotten everything? We had passion.

383
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,900
- Passion? 
 - Passion.

384
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,700
- Come on. 
 - Come on.

385
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:55,000
Let's eat.

386
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,133
Where is Dad?

387
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:02,233
Didn't you tell him that Dr. Choi went to the conference?

388
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:05,100
Yes. Your dad went to a conference.

389
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,200
When is he coming back?

390
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,700
- Oh, soon. 
 - Maybe a long time.

391
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:14,800
Oh, well… Do Hyun.

392
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,967
Like an idol going on a world tour,

393
00:35:17,967 --> 00:35:21,600
your father also gets invited to various academic conferences

394
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,800
and goes on tour.

395
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,900
But why is his phone turned off?

396
00:35:30,233 --> 00:35:34,767
He called me and he said he was busy.

397
00:35:34,767 --> 00:35:39,000
Now I see that you love your dad this much.

398
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,833
That's not it.

399
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:43,567
I'm bored because he isn't here.

400
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,867
What is this?

401
00:35:51,867 --> 00:35:54,700
Isn't this a hidden camera?

402
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,500
What happened?

403
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,500
- A hidden camera was found in the men's bathroom. 
 - Hidden camera?

404
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,067
Yes, also in the men's locker room.

405
00:36:03,067 --> 00:36:05,100
Oh, in the director's office too.

406
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,800
Even in the director's office?

407
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,533
But the director didn't come?

408
00:36:11,433 --> 00:36:15,733
He must have been so shocked that he is now resting.

409
00:36:15,733 --> 00:36:16,833
Oh, yes…

410
00:36:16,833 --> 00:36:20,067
The vice director is also on vacation.

411
00:36:22,967 --> 00:36:27,200
Does it make sense that there are hidden cameras in hospitals?

412
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,633
He found a hidden camera in the men's bathroom.

413
00:36:30,633 --> 00:36:32,433
Oh, I see.

414
00:36:32,433 --> 00:36:34,700
You must be surprised. Are you okay?

415
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,367
Oh… Well…

416
00:36:36,367 --> 00:36:39,800
What can I do for you? Maybe compensation?

417
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,200
We should compensate him, but first we have to take action.

418
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,567
Have you reported it?

419
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,633
I don't need anything.

420
00:36:49,633 --> 00:36:53,300
All I want is for this hospital to close down!

421
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:59,233
It doesn't make sense to continue running it after something like this happened.

422
00:36:59,233 --> 00:37:01,467
That's not what we did.

423
00:37:01,467 --> 00:37:03,533
Yes, please calm down for a moment.

424
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:05,133
Oh… Well…

425
00:37:05,133 --> 00:37:08,633
Since this is the opinion of our patient,

426
00:37:08,633 --> 00:37:10,533
we will unconditionally follow it.

427
00:37:10,533 --> 00:37:11,967
What?

428
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:14,467
You will do that. Right?

429
00:37:14,467 --> 00:37:18,133
Then, I'll believe what you said and go.

430
00:37:18,133 --> 00:37:19,567
But!

431
00:37:19,567 --> 00:37:22,267
I'll make sure to check whether the hospital

432
00:37:22,267 --> 00:37:27,167
is actually closed or not. Okay?

433
00:37:29,467 --> 00:37:31,400
Are you going to close the hospital?

434
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:36,367
Now that things have come to this, the hospital needs to be renamed

435
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:39,900
and remodeled again.

436
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,233
Remodeling?

437
00:37:41,233 --> 00:37:42,500
Yeah.

438
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,967
Just think of it as paid vacation for about a month.

439
00:37:44,967 --> 00:37:46,433
What? Paid vacation?

440
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:48,733
- Now? 
 - Right now.

441
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,333
Thank you.

442
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,600
It was you. Right?

443
00:38:08,467 --> 00:38:10,367
What?

444
00:38:10,367 --> 00:38:13,733
Otherwise, we have to catch the culprit.

445
00:38:13,733 --> 00:38:16,867
This time, I'll really report it.

446
00:38:18,133 --> 00:38:22,333
Dr. Noh, did you always report things that well?

447
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:26,567
Why do you say that you report it every time something happens?

448
00:38:35,133 --> 00:38:37,900
The hospital's director and vice director both disappeared.

449
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,600
What should I do?

450
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,467
It's something that anyone can doubt.

451
00:38:41,467 --> 00:38:44,133
But, do we need to close the hospital like this?

452
00:38:44,133 --> 00:38:48,200
It's more suspicious that remodeling is being done because of hidden cameras.

453
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,767
It seems like you're getting better at subtly teasing me?

454
00:38:52,767 --> 00:38:55,333
Are you making such a big deal out of it

455
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,100
and deceiving me again?

456
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,600
Again? What am I doing again?

457
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,633
What are you hiding from me?

458
00:39:06,167 --> 00:39:08,200
You said...

459
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:15,000
- you once received a strange text message. Right? 
 - Yes.

460
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,467
This is the text I received on Prosecutor Choi's memorial day.

461
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,000
   

462
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,833
He or she must be the one

463
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:33,133
who wrote that Prosecutor Choi's death was related to my novel.

464
00:39:33,533 --> 00:39:37,133
I think it's very similar to the novel.

465
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,167
Are you still doubting me?

466
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:49,133
Actually, I received a strange package before that too.

467
00:39:49,133 --> 00:39:52,333
A pigeon doll with its head cut off…

468
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:54,867
Along with a family photo?

469
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,200
Yes, that's right.

470
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:02,367
It's just an obvious cliché.

471
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:08,200
Just like in my novel, killing Prosecutor Choi is an obvious cliché!

472
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,300
Want to see this?

473
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,767
No way, Jae Jin…

474
00:40:45,767 --> 00:40:48,633
No, it's not.

475
00:40:49,733 --> 00:40:51,233
You know what my son is like.

476
00:40:51,233 --> 00:40:53,600
Jae Jin isn't that kind of person.

477
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,867
Now I don't know what kind of person Jae Jin is.

478
00:40:58,367 --> 00:41:00,133
Still don't get it?

479
00:41:00,133 --> 00:41:02,933
We fell into a trap.

480
00:41:05,867 --> 00:41:08,133
A trap?

481
00:41:08,767 --> 00:41:10,267
Then who is that?

482
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:11,933
The one who caught us in a trap.

483
00:41:11,933 --> 00:41:13,233
How could I know

484
00:41:13,233 --> 00:41:14,833
all of that?

485
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:16,733
I don't know that, either.

486
00:41:16,733 --> 00:41:20,000
The only thing that's certain is that

487
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
we're in a trap.

488
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,810
So,

489
00:41:24,633 --> 00:41:27,400
we have to solve this together.

490
00:41:33,133 --> 00:41:35,333
Who are you?

491
00:41:35,333 --> 00:41:38,667
Oh, you are Dr. Choi's wife, and you are his mother.

492
00:41:38,667 --> 00:41:42,867
I heard about the situation outside. My name is Koo Kyung Tae.

493
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:48,800
I'm the boyfriend of Dr. Oh Ji Eun, the vice director of this hospital.

494
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:52,867
But for what reason?

495
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,500
Ji Eun…

496
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,533
disappeared.

497
00:42:04,367 --> 00:42:09,000
I know Dr. Oh is on vacation right now.

498
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,033
All of a sudden?

499
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:15,300
That can't be possible.

500
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,900
She just announced it on the hospital group chat?

501
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,033
And she doesn't even answer the phone.

502
00:42:20,033 --> 00:42:22,167
Oh my.

503
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:24,000
Ji Eun doesn't do that.

504
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,267
Dr. Oh is not a child. She must have her own circumstances!

505
00:42:28,267 --> 00:42:30,567
No.

506
00:42:30,567 --> 00:42:33,800
Something has definitely happened!

507
00:42:34,867 --> 00:42:37,100
You said your name is Koo Kyung Tae, right?

508
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:41,167
First, calm down a bit.

509
00:42:41,167 --> 00:42:43,467
Oh? Dr. Noh Young Won?

510
00:42:44,767 --> 00:42:46,350
Yes.

511
00:42:48,633 --> 00:42:50,167
Doctor,

512
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:52,633
what kind of psychological emotions does Ji Eun have

513
00:42:52,633 --> 00:42:55,100
to act like this?

514
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,700
And what should I do now?

515
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,667
Why do you think that

516
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:06,300
something happened just because

517
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:09,000
Dr. Oh didn't reach you?

518
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,067
That can't be true,

519
00:43:11,067 --> 00:43:12,733
and it shouldn't be like that.

520
00:43:12,733 --> 00:43:16,167
Is it because you are afraid that Dr. Oh,

521
00:43:16,167 --> 00:43:20,767
who you couldn't reach, might leave you?

522
00:43:20,767 --> 00:43:22,967
Of course, liking someone comes

523
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:26,133
with a certain kind of anxiety.

524
00:43:26,133 --> 00:43:28,100
- But… 
 - I'm not…

525
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,667
I'm not just guessing!

526
00:43:30,667 --> 00:43:36,100
All of the circumstances suggest that something happened to Ji Eun!

527
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,233
Circumstances?

528
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:43,233
Are you a police officer or something?

529
00:43:43,233 --> 00:43:45,700
I'm actually...

530
00:43:50,367 --> 00:43:52,667
    
 a police officer

531
00:43:52,667 --> 00:43:54,067
A police officer!

532
00:43:54,067 --> 00:43:56,000
I am the one

533
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,400
who studied hard for 15 years

534
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:04,900
in the hope of becoming a real public servant.

535
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,067
In my opinion,

536
00:44:07,067 --> 00:44:12,133
something about this is a little strange.

537
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:17,733
If three days have passed, you can report her missing and track her phone.

538
00:44:17,733 --> 00:44:19,233
Just wait and see!

539
00:44:19,233 --> 00:44:22,200
I will uncover this case...

540
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:27,867
and find my girlfriend!

541
00:44:33,733 --> 00:44:36,833
Why did you upset someone who was enraged?

542
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:38,933
Does that matter now?

543
00:44:38,933 --> 00:44:41,667
We have another variable now.

544
00:44:43,267 --> 00:44:46,233
Is it Myeong Tae or Dong Tae?

545
00:44:46,233 --> 00:44:50,933
That police officer who is Dr. Oh's boyfriend, his name is Kyung Tae.

546
00:44:50,933 --> 00:44:54,867
Koo Kyung Tae, a police officer who became a police officer after 15 years.

547
00:44:54,867 --> 00:44:56,833
Yeah, Koo Kyung Tae, a police officer

548
00:44:56,833 --> 00:45:01,233
who became a police officer after 15 years.

549
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,167
We have to deal with Dr. Oh's cell phone first.

550
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:15,200
Do you know the password?

551
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,733
Me, Hong Sa Gang, the Agatha Christie of Korea.

552
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:41,067
1, 3, 5, 0, and asterisk.

553
00:45:43,933 --> 00:45:47,667
This is Jae Jin's birthday.

554
00:46:22,633 --> 00:46:26,933
Dr. Noh, pack Dr. Oh's clothes and things in the suitcase.

555
00:46:26,933 --> 00:46:29,733
Shouldn't it look like she's really been on a trip?

556
00:46:29,733 --> 00:46:30,900
Oh, yes.

557
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,767
Should I put her phone…

558
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,933
Around here?

559
00:46:38,933 --> 00:46:42,367
Then, no matter how much they track the phone, it'll lead them to the house.

560
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:48,000
Then there'll be no way to confirm Dr. Oh's location anymore.

561
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:51,467
You're good at hiding something.

562
00:46:54,267 --> 00:46:57,267
Is she subtly making fun of me now?

563
00:48:28,133 --> 00:48:30,367
Ji Eun.

564
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,200
Ji Eun.

565
00:48:38,267 --> 00:48:40,767
I'll do my best.

566
00:48:40,767 --> 00:48:44,933
Ji Eun.

567
00:48:48,033 --> 00:48:50,567
Where have you gone?

568
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:33,233
Who are you?

569
00:49:33,233 --> 00:49:35,500
What are you doing now?

570
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:40,300
Who are you?

571
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:43,033
Dr. Oh.

572
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,600
I'm Ji Eun's uncle.

573
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:50,633
Who are you?

574
00:49:50,633 --> 00:49:55,000
Yes. I'm Ji Eun's boyfriend, Koo Kyung Tae.

575
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,133
Oh, boyfriend.

576
00:49:57,133 --> 00:50:01,167
Are you here because you couldn't reach her, either?

577
00:50:01,167 --> 00:50:03,533
- Reach her? 
 - Yes.

578
00:50:10,767 --> 00:50:13,567
   
 Dr. Oh went on vacation. 

579
00:50:14,667 --> 00:50:18,400
I think you're mistaken.

580
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,933
Ji Eun went on a trip.

581
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:23,133
I got a text message! Here.

582
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,133
- Is that so? 
 - Yes.

583
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,600
No! Something is strange.

584
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:42,533
Someone may have texted you from Ji Eun's phone number.

585
00:50:42,533 --> 00:50:45,567
It's a common method in disappearance cases.

586
00:50:45,567 --> 00:50:47,667
Disappearance case?

587
00:50:47,667 --> 00:50:51,233
Actually, I'm a police officer.

588
00:50:56,367 --> 00:50:59,867
It's also strange that her phone suddenly turned off.

589
00:50:59,867 --> 00:51:02,667
She said she went on a trip,

590
00:51:02,667 --> 00:51:05,233
but her suitcase is still there.

591
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,330
   

592
00:51:14,933 --> 00:51:17,333
   

593
00:51:48,433 --> 00:51:50,133
Even though you are her boyfriend,

594
00:51:50,133 --> 00:51:54,433
I don't understand this kind of behavior!

595
00:51:54,433 --> 00:51:56,933
What kind of behavior?

596
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,100
Why is...

597
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:08,300
Ji Eun's cell phone here…

598
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:12,600
It seems like Ji Eun went on a trip without her cell phone.

599
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,667
Well then, let's go out

600
00:52:15,667 --> 00:52:17,600
and have some warm tea and talk.

601
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,233
Why is her phone here…

602
00:52:20,233 --> 00:52:22,633
- What kind of food do you like? 
 - Sushi.

603
00:52:22,633 --> 00:52:26,033
- Oh, sushi. 
 - Sushi is good.

604
00:52:33,667 --> 00:52:35,900
Well done, Do Hyun.

605
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:38,533
You were so fast.

606
00:52:41,767 --> 00:52:44,167
You still can't reach your dad?

607
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,000
His phone is off.

608
00:52:47,667 --> 00:52:51,467
Do you think you know everything about your dad?

609
00:52:51,467 --> 00:52:54,967
To what extent can I say I know everything?

610
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:00,133
Yeah. That's also ambiguous.

611
00:53:00,133 --> 00:53:02,467
Then, Do Hyun,

612
00:53:02,467 --> 00:53:05,610
what do you think about your family?

613
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,400
The work of my grandma and mom?

614
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,433
The work?

615
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:17,267
I'll go now.

616
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,033
Are you going to the academy?

617
00:53:20,033 --> 00:53:21,733
I don't want to, actually.

618
00:53:21,733 --> 00:53:24,867
- But I have to stick to the schedule. 
 - Because your mom likes it?

619
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,800
Do Hyun,

620
00:53:31,467 --> 00:53:33,200
I used to be like that too.

621
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,933
But I think like this.

622
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,367
The choice is yours.

623
00:53:41,367 --> 00:53:43,633
Your mom said that too.

624
00:53:47,533 --> 00:53:49,167
Then let's play one more round!

625
00:53:49,167 --> 00:53:51,267
That's good.

626
00:53:51,267 --> 00:53:54,500
Instead, when my mom calls, will you tell her that we studied together?

627
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,833
Do Hyun, you…

628
00:53:58,333 --> 00:54:02,233
You think too much. Let's go!

629
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:15,067
Oh my! What are you doing there?

630
00:54:15,833 --> 00:54:17,667
Mrs. Hong Sa Gang...

631
00:54:17,667 --> 00:54:21,167
and Dr. Noh Young Won. Right?

632
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,900
Who are you?

633
00:54:25,167 --> 00:54:26,733
Prosecutor Choi made the request.

634
00:54:26,733 --> 00:54:28,733
   

635
00:54:28,733 --> 00:54:30,533
A private investigator?

636
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:32,900
People often call me a detective.

637
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,833
Prosecutor Choi made the request?

638
00:54:42,833 --> 00:54:46,667
Yes, I served him when I was young.

639
00:54:46,667 --> 00:54:49,467
I never thought he would die in vain…

640
00:54:52,633 --> 00:54:55,133
I gave a monetary gift for his funeral.

641
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:59,067
What did he request from you?

642
00:54:59,067 --> 00:55:02,667
One day he reached out to me and asked me to investigate someone.

643
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:04,667
Investigate who?

644
00:55:10,433 --> 00:55:12,467
Lee Se Na?

645
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:16,333
Who? Do you know her?

646
00:55:16,333 --> 00:55:18,500
She was my patient.

647
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:22,733
Why did he ask you to investigate Lee Se Na?

648
00:55:43,367 --> 00:55:45,867
There are a lot of pictures of them.

649
00:55:56,033 --> 00:55:59,600
That's why he went to the villa…

650
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,033
What are you trying to say now?

651
00:56:02,033 --> 00:56:05,067
Are you saying that Dr. Choi is cheating on Dr. Noh?

652
00:56:05,067 --> 00:56:10,100
Yes, Ms. Lee Se Na, she is Choi Jae Jin's mistress.

653
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:16,033
Prosecutor Choi worried a lot about Dr. Noh while he was alive.

654
00:56:16,033 --> 00:56:19,367
That's probably why he secretly investigated his son.

655
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,200
But Prosecutor Choi sensed something.

656
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,200
Even when he was a prosecutor, he solved the case with that instinct,

657
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,967
and he was right this time too.

658
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:34,633
According to the investigation,

659
00:56:34,633 --> 00:56:36,467
Lee Se Na, she's a witch.

660
00:56:36,467 --> 00:56:38,433
Witch!

661
00:56:38,433 --> 00:56:40,633
Witch?

662
00:56:40,633 --> 00:56:42,867
This isn't the Middle Ages!

663
00:56:42,867 --> 00:56:48,567
All the men she was involved with are dead.

664
00:56:50,667 --> 00:56:53,233
Two weddings and three funerals.

665
00:56:53,233 --> 00:56:55,533
That is what she went through.

666
00:56:56,567 --> 00:57:01,233
So you're saying all those husbands are dead?

667
00:57:01,233 --> 00:57:02,667
Yes.

668
00:57:02,667 --> 00:57:05,100
They say there are coincidences in this world,

669
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:08,567
but are there coincidences like this?

670
00:57:08,567 --> 00:57:10,700
So,

671
00:57:11,533 --> 00:57:15,467
what do you mean by two weddings and three funerals?

672
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:21,600
Then I'll tell you why she is called a witch.

673
00:57:23,233 --> 00:57:27,633
To be exact, she's a whistling witch.

674
00:57:27,633 --> 00:57:29,300
Whistling?

675
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:33,300
Yes, a whistling witch.

676
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:36,433
It is said that she always whistled.

677
00:57:36,433 --> 00:57:40,933
After the man died…

678
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:47,333
Her first husband's cause of death was addiction.

679
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,767
Are you saying he was poisoned?

680
00:57:51,767 --> 00:57:53,600
Well, it was treated as an accidental death.

681
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:57,033
But it was true that the fish was poisoned.

682
00:57:57,033 --> 00:57:59,200
I don't know if it was a coincidence or an inevitability.

683
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:03,000
The important thing is that she received a significant amount of insurance money

684
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,633
due to her first husband's death.

685
00:58:10,033 --> 00:58:11,800
And that day!

686
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:15,333
The rumors started.

687
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,167
People thought she was crying,

688
00:58:21,167 --> 00:58:23,567
but it was actually a whistle.

689
00:58:23,567 --> 00:58:26,900
Her second husband's cause of death was drowning.

690
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,400
As a result of this accident,

691
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:41,000
she once again received a significant amount of insurance money.

692
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,967
After going through this, getting married would have been horrible.

693
00:58:43,967 --> 00:58:46,967
She didn't marry the third man.

694
00:58:46,967 --> 00:58:49,200
And that guy too?

695
00:58:49,967 --> 00:58:52,200
He died in a fire.

696
00:58:54,533 --> 00:58:56,867
It was also treated as an accidental death.

697
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:59,800
No one knows whether he was burned to death or the fire was set deliberately.

698
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:04,067
The important thing is that the third man's insurance beneficiary was also Lee Se Na.

699
00:59:04,067 --> 00:59:06,600
The important thing is that the third man's insurance beneficiary was also Lee Se Na.

700
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:11,200
Then, are you saying it was a murder for insurance money?

701
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,633
Lord!

702
00:59:12,633 --> 00:59:14,900
Since there is no confirmation, we can't be sure.

703
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:19,200
But two weddings and three funerals.

704
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:23,467
Lee Se Na. She must be a witch.

705
00:59:23,467 --> 00:59:25,767
What a disgusting bitch!

706
00:59:25,767 --> 00:59:29,633
I should have taken care of her sooner.

707
00:59:29,633 --> 00:59:32,167
Before this happened!

708
00:59:32,867 --> 00:59:35,267
What are you talking about?

709
00:59:37,367 --> 00:59:39,933
Did you already know?

710
00:59:39,933 --> 00:59:42,833
She probably didn't know the danger of Lee Se Na.

711
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:48,100
Only Prosecutor Choi had an intuition that she was a dangerous person.

712
00:59:50,467 --> 00:59:53,667
This might not be just an affair.

713
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,400
Dr. Choi could also be in danger.

714
01:00:02,033 --> 01:00:04,267
A fourth funeral...

715
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:08,067
may be coming.

716
01:00:25,933 --> 01:00:28,700
Since when have you known?

717
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:32,100
How dare she take my son?!

718
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,833
You knew about their relationship,

719
01:00:33,833 --> 01:00:36,633
so that's why you went to the villa that day.

720
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:39,167
Why did she take our innocent

721
01:00:39,167 --> 01:00:40,900
Dr. Choi away…

722
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:42,967
Mother! Please answer me.

723
01:00:42,967 --> 01:00:46,400
He hasn't done anything wrong…

724
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,967
Lord!

725
01:00:47,967 --> 01:00:51,867
Please save your innocent little lamb.

726
01:00:51,867 --> 01:00:53,333
Mother!

727
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:55,433
Dr. Noh,

728
01:00:56,433 --> 01:00:59,000
I guess I was careless too much.

729
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,167
No! No!

730
01:01:01,167 --> 01:01:04,767
I have to report it first.

731
01:01:07,267 --> 01:01:11,467
If you report it, how would you explain this situation?

732
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:14,067
Noh Young Won's husband had an affair and ran away?

733
01:01:14,067 --> 01:01:15,867
Are you going to let everyone know like that?

734
01:01:15,867 --> 01:01:19,433
He says our Jae Jin is with a witch!

735
01:01:19,433 --> 01:01:21,300
Aren't you worried?

736
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:23,367
What would you do if Jae Jin really died?

737
01:01:23,367 --> 01:01:27,867
I'm angrier at Jae Jin for falling for that kind of woman.

738
01:01:27,867 --> 01:01:29,467
No.

739
01:01:29,467 --> 01:01:31,867
Our Jae Jin is so naive.

740
01:01:31,867 --> 01:01:34,900
He's so naive that he got fooled.

741
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:39,867
Yes, he was so naive that he fooled me so well for a year.

742
01:01:39,867 --> 01:01:41,400
But, Mother,

743
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:46,433
I can't lose what I've built so far because of someone like that!

744
01:01:47,867 --> 01:01:50,367
So, what do you want to do?

745
01:01:50,967 --> 01:01:53,300
I'll find him.

746
01:01:54,067 --> 01:01:57,000
Wouldn't it be better

747
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,933
to die by me than by a witch?

748
01:02:10,533 --> 01:02:13,520
   

749
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:24,220

750
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:42,700
 We're a team now. 

751
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:45,467
 Shouldn't we find Jae Jin together? 

752
01:02:45,467 --> 01:02:48,767
 This is what people call ridiculous. 

753
01:02:48,767 --> 01:02:50,233
 Hello. 

754
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:51,533
 Please give me dessert first. 

755
01:02:51,533 --> 01:02:52,700
 What the hell! 

756
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,600
 You are also someone's wife. 

757
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:57,867
 What on earth did that innocent Dr. Choi do wrong? 

758
01:02:57,867 --> 01:02:58,900
 Lord! 

759
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,700
 It makes no sense to only protect her son. 

760
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,033
 It makes no sense to only protect her son. 

761
01:03:02,033 --> 01:03:03,800
 A mother's heart is truly beautiful and sad. 

762
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:07,767
 We're all going to die. 

763
01:03:07,767 --> 01:03:09,633
 We'll all die. 

764
01:03:09,633 --> 01:03:11,367
 Still don't get it? 

765
01:03:11,367 --> 01:03:14,367
 We fell into a trap.
