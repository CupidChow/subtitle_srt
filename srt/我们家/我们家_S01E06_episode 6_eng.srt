1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,753
   

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:08,891
Ms. Lee Se Na, I'll ask you again.

3
00:00:08,891 --> 00:00:12,565
You were in a common-law relationship with the deceased Kang Tae Sik,

4
00:00:12,565 --> 00:00:15,310
and you were at home together that day,

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,200
but didn't you know that his body was on fire?

6
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,790
The on-site investigation clearly showed

7
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,600
that the fire started from a bonfire in the yard.

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,800
Was there a fight with Kang Tae Sik that day?

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,350
It was my birthday.

10
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,992
♪ Happy birthday ♪

11
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:51,260
♪ to Lee Se Na ♪

12
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,100
Happy birthday.

13
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,060
Your birthday? That's why you two fought?

14
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,000
He ate my cake.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,900
What?

16
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,000
Didn't you hear?

17
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:35,190
Then what were you doing when Mr. Kang Tae Sik was burned to death in the yard?

18
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,350
He ate my cake.

19
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,680
I didn't even blow out the candles.

20
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,120
So, did you stand by and watch Kang Tae Sik die?

21
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:05,290
Professor, that woman is out of her mind.

22
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,890
Her husband died, but she's talking about her birthday.

23
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,046
This is a characteristic of a narcissist.

24
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:13,110
Well, that doesn't mean everyone commits murder.

25
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,218
Let's get a confession from her.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,090
There was a large garden in my house.

27
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,360
My father had a big business.

28
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,200
I guess...

29
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,400
that's why my mom always had parties in the garden.

30
00:02:33,003 --> 00:02:34,570
My parents

31
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:40,590
danced a waltz to my elder sister's piano playing.

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,100
My dad was not good at dancing

33
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,900
so my mom scolded him.

34
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,619
What about you?

35
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:50,864
Me?

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,190
I drew a picture of my sister playing the piano.

37
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,996
Then what about the picture of your parents dancing a waltz?

38
00:02:59,996 --> 00:03:03,290
I told you that my dad was not good at dancing.

39
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,768
Then it becomes a bad picture.

40
00:03:07,404 --> 00:03:09,370
I see.

41
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,541
I guess you liked your sister a lot.

42
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,240
My sister was pretty.

43
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,840
Everyone said she was pretty.

44
00:03:20,484 --> 00:03:22,068
I also...

45
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:29,864
really liked her.

46
00:03:31,195 --> 00:03:34,163
 So I tried to protect her. 

47
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,008
 Se Eun? What happened? 

48
00:03:43,008 --> 00:03:44,916
 Are you okay? 

49
00:03:45,668 --> 00:03:48,700
 - I'm fine. 
 - Oh my. 

50
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,900
What happened to your sister?

51
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,600
All three of them are dead.

52
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,565
I was the only one left in that big house.

53
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:15,000
If I had known, I would have let the cat live.

54
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,640
Did you kill the cat?

55
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,800
Because it hurt my sister.

56
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,822
 Why did you do that? Why? 

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,800
But everyone said it was my fault.

58
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,690
I was just trying to protect my family.

59
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:46,420
So, did you wish for your husbands to die?

60
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,476
Do you think I killed them?

61
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,249
I think you're seriously mistaken

62
00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:02,380
about loving someone.

63
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,310
Sir,

64
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,520
you don't know what love is. ight?

65
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,000
It seems like you've never even been married.

66
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,000
I think you should get professional help.

67
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,400
Being overly obsessed with love means

68
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,800
you are relying on the wrong thing.

69
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,636
That means…

70
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,700
   

71
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,900
 Then, 

72
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,906
 all the effort I put in was for nothing. Right? 

73
00:05:56,906 --> 00:06:02,100
 Why doesn't my family understand my feelings and just resent me? 

74
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,280
 I put up with it for my family. 

75
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,050
 Now everyone is blaming me and trying to leave. 

76
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:14,820
 I think if a family is causing you pain, 

77
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,020
 you should get away from it, not tolerate it. 

78
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,600
 But they are my family. 

79
00:06:24,576 --> 00:06:28,803
    
 I did everything I could to protect my family.

80
00:06:28,803 --> 00:06:32,041
But my family despised me and tried to leave me.

81
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,740
They say they're my family,

82
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,580
but they're the ones who end the love first.

83
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:44,450
Have you ever thought about why they wanted to leave?

84
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,491
You said it was to protect your family,

85
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:52,790
but haven't you ever thought that it actually made things difficult for your family?

86
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,390
Are you saying what I did was wrong?

87
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:00,800
You can't criticize me for trying to protect my family.

88
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,000
A perfect family can't be like that.

89
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,000
What is a perfect family?

90
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,788
It's a relationship that is firmly connected to each other through the line of love.

91
00:07:14,788 --> 00:07:19,690
But if that line is rotting away in pain,

92
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,024
shouldn't it be cut off?

93
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:32,800
Your actions to protect your family ended up failing.

94
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,873
Because it was the wrong method.

95
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,819
Why are you so confident?

96
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,495
So what kind of family do you live with?

97
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,738
 Yes, come in. 

98
00:08:15,364 --> 00:08:17,013
 You're here? 

99
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,120
 It doesn't hurt. Right? 

100
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,444
 Yes. 

101
00:08:24,444 --> 00:08:26,780
 Just a moment. 

102
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,826
 You've worked hard. 

103
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,299
 Now the burn treatment is over for today. 

104
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:40,435
 Thank you. 

105
00:08:40,435 --> 00:08:44,540
 It's not easy to get surgery directly from you. 

106
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:49,710
 Still, I think it was a good thing I waited and received it from you. 

107
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,740
 Are there any other aftereffects? 

108
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,618
 There is one. 

109
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:02,058
 Can you treat that too? 

110
00:09:02,058 --> 00:09:05,360
 Are you feeling bad? What are your symptoms? 

111
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:17,570
 I'd like to buy you dinner as a thank-you gift. 

112
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:21,870
 Do I have to wait several months to even have dinner with you? 

113
00:09:23,684 --> 00:09:25,047
 Yes. 

114
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,672
 I would like to order a course meal. 

115
00:09:33,672 --> 00:09:35,070
 Yes. 

116
00:09:35,812 --> 00:09:37,530
 Same for me. 

117
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,100
 What is the dessert today? 

118
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,690
 It is a fondant chocolate baked with ganache. 

119
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,780
 Then, 

120
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,612
 I'd like to have dessert first. 

121
00:09:48,612 --> 00:09:50,790
 Okay, me too. 

122
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,640
 Okay, then I'll prepare dessert first. 

123
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,180
 Do you have dessert first? 

124
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,380
 Who knows what will happen in the future? 

125
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:06,623
 It would be unfair if I died without being able to have such delicious food. 

126
00:10:06,623 --> 00:10:09,826
 What's so unfair about dying? 

127
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:12,220
 I guess that's what happens... 

128
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,630
 when the whole family dies. 

129
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,600
 I'm sorry. I didn't know that. 

130
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,830
 It's okay. 

131
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,370
 It was a long time ago. 

132
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,330
 When my dad went on a business trip to Paris, 

133
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,910
 my family went with him together. 

134
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,118
 That day, the plan was to climb the Eiffel Tower 

135
00:10:35,118 --> 00:10:39,808
 and have dinner at a restaurant in front of it. 

136
00:10:39,808 --> 00:10:46,380
 But I liked the hotel so much that I didn't want to leave. 

137
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,766
 So, except for me, 

138
00:10:51,612 --> 00:10:53,928
 my parents and my sister... 

139
00:10:56,832 --> 00:11:01,320
 went out to the city as planned. 

140
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,680
 It was a car accident... 

141
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,350
 and the car was completely burned out. 

142
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:23,700
 I have this burn scar. 

143
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,990
 I did that myself. 

144
00:11:27,837 --> 00:11:32,900
 Maybe it's self-blame that I'm the only one who survived. 

145
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,470
 I felt like I should burn myself, too. 

146
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,449
 Now the scars are all gone. 

147
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,710
 Don't blame yourself too much. 

148
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,250
 Director, 

149
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,100
 shall I tell you something interesting? 

150
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,520
 Yes. 

151
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,500
 After the surgery and... 

152
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,664
 the scars disappeared, 

153
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,804
 I felt relieved. 

154
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,011
 Because you saved me. 

155
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,056
   

156
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,460
 My mother was a novelist. 

157
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,731
 She was once a famous mystery novelist. 

158
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,460
 This was her writing room, 

159
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,530
 and she stopped writing after I got a little older, 

160
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,030
 but it was probably because of me. 

161
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:46,340
 Because of my father's affair, 

162
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,719
 the two of them didn't get along very well. 

163
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:52,150
 I think it was from that time. 

164
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:56,592
 It seemed like my mother decided to live only for me. 

165
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:02,790
 So it was really hard to refuse my mother's opinion. 

166
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,590
 That's why you went to medical school 

167
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,200
 even though you were so afraid of blood. 

168
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,400
 But my mother knew that, too. 

169
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,510
 But she did not give up her will to make her son a doctor. 

170
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:21,150
 Is that why she made Dr. Oh Ji Eun a doctor? 

171
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:32,190
 Dr. Noh still doesn't know these secrets? 

172
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,290
 I've thought about what it would be like if she found out. 

173
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:43,570
 Maybe Young Won will never understand me. 

174
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,070
 Never. 

175
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:50,110
 She probably just wants me to remain a normal doctor husband. 

176
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:54,190
 Regardless of my will. 

177
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,850
 Just like my mother made me like she thought. 

178
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:59,420
 Then what did you originally want to do? 

179
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,008
 Me? 

180
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,400
 What did I... 

181
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,000
 What did I want to do? 

182
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,172
 I can't even remember what it was. 

183
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,640
 It's okay. 

184
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,680
 Just dream again. 

185
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,560
 What do you wish for? 

186
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:48,170
 It was about escaping the hurt I felt about my family, 

187
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,870
 but you already saved me. 

188
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:57,340
 That's enough for me. 

189
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 I really want to be nice to you. 

190
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 I know. 

191
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,560
 Then make me happier. 

192
00:16:10,464 --> 00:16:11,936
   

193
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:13,024
   

194
00:16:13,024 --> 00:16:14,580
   

195
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,280
 Nice to meet you. 

196
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,410
 I wanted to meet you. Seriously. 

197
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,450
 It's funny how the family all pretend to know everything about each other, 

198
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,290
 but they don't know anything. 

199
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,000
 Doctor, what about you? 

200
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,990
 - About what? 
 - Do you know everything? 

201
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,530
 About your family? 

202
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,960
 Well, I don't know. 

203
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:03,130
 Do we really need to know everything about each other? 

204
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,784
 I see. 

205
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,410
 Are you still feeling unfair? 

206
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,620
 I had no choice but to do that too. 

207
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,490
 But instead, 

208
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,290
 just like I promised, I accepted Young Won as family. 

209
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,860
 She's doing well. 

210
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,460
 So you too… 

211
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:42,070
 You don't need to know everything about your family? 

212
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:47,810
 Would you be okay if you found out your family lied to you? 

213
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,690
 Why did you die? 

214
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,290
 It's not fun. 

215
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,550
 I would like to give this honor to my husband who 

216
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,900
 gave me so much support that I could receive this award, 

217
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:10,660
 Mrs. Hong Sa Gang, and my father-in-law who loved this sight more than anyone else, 

218
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,272
 who cherished me like a daughter. 

219
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:19,060
 Are you going to hide the secret of your father's death? 

220
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,000
 That's funny. 

221
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,560
   

222
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,930
 Noh Young Won left after receiving a miniature villa. 

223
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,752
 Se Na. 

224
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:41,432
 You're here? 

225
00:18:41,432 --> 00:18:43,600
 - You waited a long time, right? 
 - No. 

226
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,740
 I bought this on my way here. 

227
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,100
 You like yellow, right? 

228
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,900
 Happy 1st anniversary. 

229
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,224
 Thank you. 

230
00:18:53,224 --> 00:18:55,164
 This is white wine. 

231
00:18:56,085 --> 00:18:59,820
 I tried to come quickly, but Nurse Park kept taking on more patients. 

232
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,290
 Even when I told her to stop, she kept doing it. 

233
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:06,600
 Because the VIP came again this time. So I can't refuse it. 

234
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,960
 It's okay. Hurry up and change your clothes. 

235
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,744
 I got it. 

236
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,340
 You weren't in the plan. 

237
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:12,060
 Everyone is going to die. 

238
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,820
 Se Na. 

239
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,432
 Are you hurt? 

240
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,864
 Ji Eun. 

241
00:20:33,028 --> 00:20:35,210
 Ji Eun. 

242
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:39,650
 She's bleeding. 

243
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:42,320
 She rushed at me, trying to kill me. 

244
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,440
 Did she? 

245
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,860
 I told you. She is stalking you. 

246
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:55,000
 So she tried to kill me. 

247
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,680
 All right. 

248
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,376
 Were you startled? I'm sorry. 

249
00:21:02,376 --> 00:21:05,380
 When Ji Eun wakes up, I'll talk to her about it. 

250
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,510
 First, we need to take Ji Eun to the hospital. 

251
00:21:23,264 --> 00:21:25,310
   

252
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,000
 I've told you. 

253
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,300
 Oh Ji Eun lived for Mrs. Hong Sa Gang, not for you. 

254
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,150
 You know Mrs. Hong Sa Gang's personality. Right? 

255
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:45,720
 She got the report, so she'll be here right away. 

256
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,950
 Then what should I do? 

257
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:54,300
 We should leave here before she comes. 

258
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,060
 What about Ji Eun? 

259
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,632
 Are you feeling anxious? 

260
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,900
 Se Na, if my mom found out everything… 

261
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,200
 I know and I understand. 

262
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,790
 Shall we just leave like this? 

263
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:00,660
 Do you… 

264
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:04,090
 Do you want to go back? 

265
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,770
 Then again, you have to pretend that everything is okay. 

266
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:11,000
 I'm so sad about that. 

267
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,500
 I can't just stand by and watch that. 

268
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,610
 - Se Na. 
 - That family won't change even if you disappear. 

269
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,710
 You know I can't do without you. 

270
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:28,100
 Didn't you also want to be liberated? 

271
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,332
 That's right, 

272
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,860
 but they'll find us by any means necessary. 

273
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,200
 What if they can't find us? 

274
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,330
 This time... 

275
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,200
 I will save you. 

276
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,820
 Now, 

277
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,800
 no one can find us. 

278
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,284
 No one. 

279
00:24:19,972 --> 00:24:21,643
 Se Na, 

280
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:26,100
 I think I can be truly happy now. 

281
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:39,990
 I think you all came because of the rumors going around, 

282
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:44,064
 but that incident has nothing to do with our family. 

283
00:24:44,064 --> 00:24:46,790
 Are you saying that Mr. Choi in the disappearance case… 

284
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,840
Jae Jin.

285
00:24:59,012 --> 00:25:00,524
Your hand.

286
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,130
What are you doing?

287
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:20,804
How does it feel to be born again?

288
00:25:20,804 --> 00:25:22,530
What?

289
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:25,500
You just died

290
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,010
and you're born again.

291
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:30,210
So now...

292
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,200
you have to live a new life.

293
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:44,256
A new life?

294
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,210
What are you talking about?

295
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,690
So you're saying it doesn't matter if Jae Jin dies?

296
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:53,190
Yes, I don't care if he dies.

297
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:56,500
That person is now dead from my life.

298
00:25:57,005 --> 00:25:59,300
Would you still be like this even if Do Hyun was like this?

299
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,690
Even if Do Hyun is with a dangerous woman, would you still be like this?

300
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:07,080
Yes, from now on, I'll take care of my son first.

301
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:13,600
I'm more worried about how I should explain this situation and his father's ugly lies to Do Hyun.

302
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,560
Is there any need to explain this to family?

303
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,220
A family?

304
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:23,300
Is the husband who lied to me and deceived me like this a family?

305
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,390
Then, what? Are you going to divorce?

306
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:29,090
No, why am I getting a divorce?

307
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:31,590
I can't just let him go like this.

308
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:34,810
When Jae Jin comes back,

309
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:37,880
I will give back everything I went through

310
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,570
because of him.

311
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,636
Dr. Noh!

312
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,320
At the very least,

313
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,480
I will make sure that your son

314
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,300
will not be neglected by his own son,

315
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:54,290
so please stop saying that I have to worry about him.

316
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,616
Son.

317
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,810
You mean there's nothing wrong with my dad. Right?

318
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:16,300
Yes.

319
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,000
Then where is he?

320
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,220
I'll tell you the truth.

321
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:26,720
He doesn't answer the phone.

322
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,430
I guess… He just wants to go away for a while.

323
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:33,300
Then, is it true that Mr. Choi of the Tongyeong incident

324
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,300
in the news is my father?

325
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,200
Right.

326
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,770
But…

327
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:41,110
Is it true that my father is having an affair?

328
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,600
Yes, that's right.

329
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:52,900
Are you getting a divorce?

330
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,550
I'll follow whatever you choose.

331
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,900
If it's okay with you.

332
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,910
You're closer to your dad than me.

333
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:17,510
Your dad will be sad to hear this.

334
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,640
I thought the way I treated him...

335
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:28,356
must have been a bit frustrating for him.

336
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:32,800
You've felt frustrated because of your study schedule.

337
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,190
Still, I am not uncomfortable with it.

338
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,700
Because I know how hard you've worked for us.

339
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,900
And this is my dad's fault.

340
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,190
Thank you.

341
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,780
My son is all grown up.

342
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,200
Are you all right?

343
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,468
Yes.

344
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:06,520
I hope you're honest about your feelings, too.

345
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:10,130
Whether you're sad or angry.

346
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,000
Right.

347
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,430
I had that thought

348
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,900
while going through this.

349
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,170
What if your dad was

350
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:27,310
honest with me?

351
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:34,180
I wish Do Hyun would be honest with me.

352
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,136
Let's go.

353
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:13,520
Do Hyun.

354
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,790
Do Hyun, wake up.

355
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,300
You're tired, right?

356
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,260
Take a shower and come down.

357
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,296
I bought cod since it is in season. Is it good?

358
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:32,444
Yes, it's good.

359
00:30:32,444 --> 00:30:35,528
Because it's in season, the fish is full of meat.

360
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,150
Dr. Choi really liked spicy fish stew…

361
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,180
It's good.

362
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:44,410
Good morning, Mother.

363
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:47,300
Ma'am, please change my pillow.

364
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,000
I couldn't sleep at all.

365
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,450
Yes.

366
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:53,200
Couldn't you sleep?

367
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,300
Then, do you want a cup of tea?

368
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:59,240
They say guava-leaf tea is the best for immunity.

369
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,340
What are you doing now?

370
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,604
What?

371
00:31:02,604 --> 00:31:04,900
This is you blatantly making fun of me.

372
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,880
Do you think I'm in the mood for some guava-leaf tea right now?

373
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,780
Why? I'm just back to normal life.

374
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,380
How is this normal?

375
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,580
Dr. Choi isn't here right now.

376
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,590
As long as he didn't fall into the water, it's okay.

377
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:23,000
Would you like some chilled vegetables?

378
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,600
I'll add your favorite mung-bean sprouts and cucumbers.

379
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,200
- Cold. 
 - That's why it's called chilled vegetables.

380
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,440
You like chilled vegetables, right?

381
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,180
I don't like that.

382
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,900
I really hate cold things.

383
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,000
She's sensitive today.

384
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,410
Is it because she couldn't sleep?

385
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,200
Noh Young Won's Eternal Solution!

386
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,600
Today again, we are with Dr. Noh, who will give you a refreshing solution.

387
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,800
- Hello, Doctor. 
 - Hello, I'm Noh Young Won.

388
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,600
How is your family this week?

389
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:12,210
Doctor, actually, it's not easy to tell others about my family.

390
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:16,580
Also, I feel burdened when others talk about my family.

391
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,480
Of course.

392
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:25,290
As you know, my family's story is often talked about by the public these days,

393
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:28,090
so I guess I know how they feel.

394
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:31,860
But it all turned out to be false. Right?

395
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,400
Yes, that's right.

396
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:38,200
But it seems like there are still people who doubt our family.

397
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:44,610
Of course, I think that is also your interest and concern about me.

398
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,180
However...

399
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:51,350
I believe that every family has a different form of love.

400
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:56,690
It's a very scary thing to have your family history made public.

401
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:59,220
To those who, despite their fears,

402
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,520
have the courage to send their stories

403
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,390
to protect their families,

404
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:09,730
I hope that you will not say such stories too easily.

405
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:22,310
Faking a suicide means the murder wasn't planned.

406
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,380
Then, why did she take our Jae Jin?

407
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,230
Yes, Madam.

408
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:45,200
Here is this colorless ball of thread called life.

409
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:51,340
 There is an orange thread of murder in this ball of thread. 

410
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,690
It is our detectives' job

411
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:57,350
to unravel these threads

412
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:00,020
and expose them one by one to the world.

413
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,180
Sherlock Holmes.

414
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,760
Manager Park,

415
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,930
I need a clue to figure out why Lee Se Na is acting like this.

416
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:15,100
Where are Lee Se Na's items that you brought from that villa?

417
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:21,370
There will be an orange thread in that bundle that may be a clue.

418
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:22,840
Yes.

419
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,710
   

420
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,700
Have you found a clue?

421
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,000
- Manager Park. 
 - Yes.

422
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,110
I was the one that Lee Se Na was after.

423
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,600
You?

424
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,590
There have often been cases where psychos who are fanatical about mystery novels

425
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:15,390
act according to the novels of the authors they admire.

426
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,200
Wait.

427
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,440
Look at this.

428
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:35,000
    
 This is the bulletin board for the internet novel I'm writing recently.

429
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,752
This one.

430
00:35:37,752 --> 00:35:42,000
This is clearly a warning given to me by Lee Se Na.

431
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,360
I wondered who sent such malicious comments…

432
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,830
Why didn't you tell me then?

433
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:55,560
Because it was a secret that I was the "cigarette queen."

434
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,100
Actually, I knew about this.

435
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,100
Then, you are…

436
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,040
   

437
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,608
Hourglass?

438
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,312
Yes.

439
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,028
Mrs. Hong.

440
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,700
See, I was right. Right?

441
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,190
Jae Jin didn't commit suicide.

442
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,370
Then why did he write a will?

443
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:38,000
It doesn't make sense.

444
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,270
Then that's all lies.

445
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,782
Right.

446
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:45,150
Then, that means my sister also knew it was a lie.

447
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,500
Mrs. Hong,

448
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,420
is my sister okay? Isn't she about to go crazy?

449
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,720
She is totally fine.

450
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:56,230
Well, my sister is mentally strong.

451
00:36:56,230 --> 00:37:00,700
But Jae Jin wasn't just having an affair.

452
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,100
He even faked it as suicide.

453
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,600
He's the crazy one.

454
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,800
You are too harsh.

455
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,640
How many times do I have to tell you that

456
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,000
our Jae Jin is not crazy,

457
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,804
but is being controlled by Lee Se Na?

458
00:37:16,804 --> 00:37:18,680
He's not a child.

459
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,380
How can he be manipulated?

460
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,580
He does that because he likes it.

461
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:25,950
Young Min, didn't you say that your brother-in-law lives

462
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:29,544
with your sister even though he's being manipulated by her?

463
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:35,376
I told you not to tell anyone that.

464
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,170
Jae Jin's brother-in-law.

465
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:47,840
Don't go around talking nonsense if you don't know anything.

466
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,064
This is all because our Jae Jin is so nice.

467
00:37:52,064 --> 00:37:54,576
That's not nice.

468
00:37:54,576 --> 00:37:56,200
He lied like that.

469
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,100
It doesn't make sense.

470
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,928
My sister tried to be good to your family. How could he betray her like this?

471
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:07,900
What are you talking about?

472
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:12,300
I'm the one who accepted Dr. Noh as family.

473
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,800
What doesn't make sense?

474
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,470
People are really inconsistent.

475
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:20,700
Why are you saying it like that? You're being harsh, too.

476
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:25,220
You're the one who took away Young Won and made her distant from us.

477
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:29,290
To be honest, all my sister did was work hard for your family.

478
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:33,260
Have your family forgotten how grateful you were to my sister?

479
00:38:36,932 --> 00:38:38,444
Uncle.

480
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:53,210
- Doctor. 
 - What?

481
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:55,810
Somebody put something like this in the mailbox.

482
00:38:59,554 --> 00:39:02,280
Just in case, please open it now.

483
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:08,340
   

484
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,850
   

485
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,450
 Is it a weed or not? 

486
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,570
 If you can't cut off the bud,  

487
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:36,120
 keep it close and see if it turns into a weed or a new leaf. 

488
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:40,193
 The more you hesitate about something, the closer you have to watch it. 

489
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,090
   

490
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:01,300
 If she's telling me lies in order. 

491
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:17,360
   

492
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,170
 What about you? 

493
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:27,270
 Do you know everything about your family? 

494
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 You said that last time, right? 

495
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,680
 Families don't have to know everything. 

496
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:39,540
 Are human beings truly capable of forgiving 

497
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:44,992
 and understanding in the name of family, 

498
00:40:44,992 --> 00:40:47,068
 even if they know the truth? 

499
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,730
Bring it on.

500
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:59,070
   

501
00:41:00,341 --> 00:41:02,840
I have something to tell you.

502
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:06,140
Yes, I also have something to tell you.

503
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:09,080
Lee Se Na. I don't think it's just an affair.

504
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,110
You know that now.

505
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,450
Dr. Noh,

506
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:16,790
do you know what Lee Se Na is really after?

507
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:20,290
You don't know that. Right?

508
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:23,500
It is me.

509
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,120
All of a sudden?

510
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:34,240
It's my book that Lee Se Na was reading at the villa.

511
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,910
I didn't realize it at the time, but this was a clue.

512
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:42,280
Isn't it clear that she's targeting me at this rate?

513
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:47,250
It's a picture that came with the pigeon doll that had its head cut off before.

514
00:41:47,876 --> 00:41:51,000
- There are numbers… 
 - Written on this photo?

515
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,990
You know that?

516
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:05,740
The story of a woman trying to take over a family.

517
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:08,880
The pigeon carcass you received last time

518
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,000
and all these numbers...

519
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:15,110
are the same as in this novel.

520
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:19,420
That's right. It's not just an affair.

521
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:23,120
This is clearly what she intends to do to my family.

522
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:29,000
She's telling me the truth about some lies in the order listed here.

523
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,800
    
 This is also a book I wrote.

524
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,070
Someone left it in the mailbox.

525
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:38,000
According to Lee Se Na's pattern,

526
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
the third clue is about you.

527
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:47,280
Is there something you're still hiding from me?

528
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,710
If anyone hears what you're saying, they'll think I'm the kind of person who lies.

529
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:54,600
Actually, your lies don't matter to me anymore.

530
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,600
The important thing is why Lee Se Na does this.

531
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,790
And the fourth is Do Hyun.

532
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:03,652
If Lee Se Na is planning to harm Do Hyun…

533
00:43:03,652 --> 00:43:05,204
I got it.

534
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,500
I'll find Lee Se Na.

535
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:12,000
You take care of Do Hyun.

536
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,250
Let us each focus on our own sons.

537
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,730
   

538
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,490
I'll get going.

539
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,200
Mr. Moon?

540
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,630
It's chilly. Let's go in now.

541
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:37,260
   

542
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,500
 Yeah. 

543
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:04,410
Do Hyun, you've studied hard.

544
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,320
How was today's class?

545
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,880
I'm a little tired because it's the day of solving mock exam problems.

546
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:24,170
 It's always the same. 

547
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:26,600
 But I'm particularly tired this week. 

548
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,990
Is private tutoring less tiring than going to a private academy?

549
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:36,110
Well, isn't studying all tiring?

550
00:45:38,792 --> 00:45:40,550
How about Mr. Moon?

551
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:41,792
Mr. Moon?

552
00:45:41,792 --> 00:45:43,460
Yes.

553
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:49,460
I heard that Mr. Moon's goal is to become a great psychiatrist like you.

554
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,000
Really?

555
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,160
I didn't know that.

556
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:57,830
Do you two meet outside, too?

557
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,024
No.

558
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,800
Did you say the girl you like is Soyee?

559
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,650
What kind of girl is she?

560
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:15,120
Why are you suddenly asking that?

561
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:19,960
She's the girl you like, so of course I'm curious about her.

562
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:24,090
Are you two dating?

563
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,000
So you two decided to date, right?

564
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,672
That's good.

565
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:38,610
I wonder what kind of person Soyee is.

566
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:40,780
Shall we invite her to our home next time?

567
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:43,610
I don't think this is the right time.

568
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:10,540
 She's telling me the truth about some lies in the order listed here. 

569
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,680
 Someone left it in the mailbox. 

570
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,649
 According to Lee Se Na's pattern, 

571
00:47:14,649 --> 00:47:18,350
 the third clue is about you. 

572
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,150
 A mother's heart... 

573
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:29,860
 is truly beautiful and sad. 

574
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:47,260
 He's my senior's son and has passed medical school.  

575
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:48,850
 He's your junior. 

576
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:51,450
 Hello, I'm Moon Tae Oh. 

577
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:54,000
 You said he's your high school senior's son. Right? 

578
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,620
 Why don't I know that senior? 

579
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:58,750
 That's weird. 

580
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:02,000
 Is there anything you don't know about me? 

581
00:48:06,252 --> 00:48:08,392
- I'm here. 
 - Yes.

582
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,900
Moon Tae Oh is a medical student.

583
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:16,400
He has good grades and volunteers at a psychological counseling center.

584
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,000
Everyone was praising him.

585
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,192
- Yeah? 
 - Who is Moon Tae Oh?

586
00:48:21,192 --> 00:48:23,240
Do Hyun's private tutor.

587
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:28,450
Do Gangnam moms do background checks on their sons' private tutors?

588
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:33,590
But why do you doubt him?

589
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:36,830
Is there any family relationship listed in the academic record?

590
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,160
I can't access to the academic record.

591
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,730
Where did you find his tutor?

592
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:43,720
Jae Jin said Mr. Moon is his high school senior's son, but…

593
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,170
Oh... I get it.

594
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:51,470
But you can't believe Jae Jin, right?

595
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,260
Well, considering the current situation,

596
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:56,680
even if Moon Tae Oh is Jae Jin's son

597
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,680
rather than his senior's son…

598
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:10,912
But why is Jae Jin telling a lie that will get him caught one day?

599
00:49:10,912 --> 00:49:13,000
How did he become a doctor?

600
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,600
You've worked hard. Get off now.

601
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,700
Sis, just believe me.

602
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:21,410
I'm going to scold Jae Jin when he comes back.

603
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:24,510
I'll make a big fuss. Got it?

604
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,880
You're not getting divorced, right?

605
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,490
Why? Can't I get a divorce?

606
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:32,380
Are you going to divorce?

607
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:36,290
People will start gossiping again.

608
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:37,668
Get off.

609
00:49:37,668 --> 00:49:39,240
All right.

610
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,690
I'm hungry.

611
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:49,560
I need to visit that red brick house first.

612
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,530
You said it was in the Seongbuk neighborhood, right?

613
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:54,840
I need to find it and cut it off completely.

614
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:57,640
I will take you to Seongbuk neighborhood.

615
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,280
   

616
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,020
Who came?

617
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:10,330
   

618
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:20,200
Madam said she was coming back.

619
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,800
Okay, get back to your work.

620
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:26,120
Yes.

621
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:34,290
It looks good on you.

622
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,900
You are the one who came to the hospital to see the director before. Right?

623
00:51:42,124 --> 00:51:43,180
You saw that.

624
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:46,420
You were standing in front so that everyone could see you.

625
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:47,655
Right.

626
00:51:47,655 --> 00:51:52,690
But what kind of relationship do you have with the director?

627
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:54,890
I'm tutoring Do Hyun.

628
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:56,630
Tutoring?

629
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:59,600
Do Hyun isn't here right now.

630
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,300
There are times when I arrive before Do Hyun.

631
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:03,800
Because they treat me like family.

632
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:12,510
Oh, I only tried this on once.

633
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:13,910
No, I understand.

634
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:17,350
There are so many pretty clothes here.

635
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:19,480
Then please pretend you don't know.

636
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,150
However,

637
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:30,312
the clothes you are wearing,

638
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:34,152
this space,

639
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,300
and...

640
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:43,370
this necklace match you very well.

641
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:51,000
Is it because Jae Jin talks about you a lot?

642
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:53,568
It feels like...

643
00:52:55,155 --> 00:52:57,890
you and I used to know each other.

644
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:00,190
What did he say about me?

645
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:07,000
He said he really depended on you.

646
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:12,970
He said he trusted you too much

647
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:16,670
and nothing would be possible without Ji Eun.

648
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:20,580
Did he really say that?

649
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:33,000
You may know Jae Jin better than his family.

650
00:53:42,664 --> 00:53:44,380
Right?

651
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:51,000
I'll go. Change your clothes comfortably.

652
00:53:56,104 --> 00:53:57,776
Where's Dr. Oh?

653
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:03,750
She was here, but where did she go?

654
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:05,960
Madam, you are back?

655
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,700
- Tae Oh is here too. 
 - Yes.

656
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:13,700
Dr. Oh is here, too?

657
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:16,000
- Do you two know each other? 
 - Of course,

658
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,570
I've seen her in front of Jae Jin's hospital.

659
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:21,370
She went to the bathroom, but she'll be back soon.

660
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:25,370
Why did she go to the second-floor bathroom?

661
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:26,610
Sorry.

662
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:30,100
I told her to use that because I thought it would be easier to use.

663
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,580
- Ma'am! 
 - Yes.

664
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:34,550
You should have seen if a guest was coming.

665
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:36,650
Yes, Madam.

666
00:54:38,732 --> 00:54:40,680
You are back?

667
00:54:42,668 --> 00:54:44,460
Follow me.

668
00:54:49,904 --> 00:54:51,868
Are you feeling well?

669
00:54:52,716 --> 00:54:54,180
Yes.

670
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,800
You knew about the relationship between Jae Jin and Lee Se Na. Right?

671
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:02,610
Why didn't you tell me?

672
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:05,518
Why should I tell you?

673
00:55:05,518 --> 00:55:08,220
You've always been like that.

674
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:10,000
I need to know all about him because…

675
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
You don't have to know everything.

676
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:19,000
I'm feeling sad, Madam.

677
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,400
When I woke up and Dr. Noh came to see me,

678
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,000
I kept the whole secret.

679
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,340
Anyway, Dr. Noh found out the truth.

680
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:30,000
I think that is better.

681
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,640
She is my family member, and I can't keep hiding it.

682
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,480
You said I'm part of the family, too.

683
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:41,690
Yes. Thank you, Ji Eun.

684
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:44,590
Please take good care of him in the future as well.

685
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:49,430
Like this, now that Dr. Noh has found out,

686
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:53,530
I can't keep Jae Jin as a doctor.

687
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:58,668
You take charge of the hospital and run it well.

688
00:55:58,668 --> 00:56:00,130
Yes.

689
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:05,540
But, Madam,

690
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:09,610
will Dr. Noh stay still?

691
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:14,200
You said she knew all of Jae Jin's lies.

692
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:19,400
Those two will divorce, right?

693
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:22,320
Divorce?

694
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,690
No, that won't happen.

695
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:26,898
No. Dr. Noh will leave Jae Jin.

696
00:56:26,898 --> 00:56:29,230
So from now on, I will be by his side…

697
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:30,830
Hold on.

698
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:34,670
Are you saying you want to become his wife?

699
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
No, no, Dr. Oh.

700
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
That doesn't make sense.

701
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:45,600
Why doesn't it make sense?

702
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:51,300
I helped you when your grandfather passed away and you were left alone.

703
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,880
It won't work like that.

704
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:56,190
You should look for a job at another hospital.

705
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:02,200
You know how much I've sacrificed for him all this time,

706
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,200
and now you want to kick me out like this?

707
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,800
Kick you out? Did I?

708
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,100
I've never accepted you.

709
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:11,840
And you just said you sacrificed yourself?

710
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,100
I thought that's what you wanted.

711
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:16,100
If it weren't for me,

712
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,950
Jae Jin wouldn't be where he is today.

713
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:23,300
No, there were many people who could replace you.

714
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:15,640
Dr. Noh, you should go somewhere with me.

715
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,900
What do you think of these pictures?

716
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:28,140
I think I found out about Lee Se Na's feelings while consulting with her.

717
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:31,752
Was she already your patient?

718
00:59:31,752 --> 00:59:33,620
Yes.

719
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:39,680
But I think it may have been much earlier than that.

720
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:43,890
So she's trying to get revenge on you?

721
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:47,800
That's such a cliche.

722
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:52,200
Of course, every crime has a motive.

723
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:02,810
Should I report this crazy psycho?

724
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:19,230
Even if you report it, there is nothing you can do.

725
01:00:19,230 --> 01:00:22,560
Also, there is no exact evidence that Lee Se Na sent it.

726
01:00:24,448 --> 01:00:26,800
We're in trouble.

727
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:29,140
Do Hyun could be in danger.

728
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:31,310
We need to find Lee Se Na quickly.

729
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:34,910
Right. We have to find her.

730
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:38,000
We have to find our Jae Jin.

731
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:22,520
♫  By the time summer approaches  ♫

732
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:26,700
♫  I was in love  ♫

733
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:32,130
♫  Even the passionate kiss  ♫

734
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:37,100
♫  Melted under the sun  ♫

735
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:43,000
♫  Countless days and nights  ♫

736
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,150
♫  Pass by without any regrets  ♫

737
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:55,080
♫  I won't go back to  ♫

738
01:01:55,080 --> 01:02:00,400
♫  Any moment of secret  ♫

739
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,290
What are you doing?

740
01:02:36,448 --> 01:02:39,630
   

741
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:11,260
 Look at this. She's a total psychopath. 

742
01:03:11,944 --> 01:03:14,300
 Noh Young Won is also such a pitiful person. 

743
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:15,570
 I need to liberate her. 

744
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:18,700
 Now I want to free you who have been deceived without knowing anything. 

745
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:20,480
 That's why I'm trying to end it like this. 

746
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,480
 It's all because of that woman, Lee Se Na. 

747
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,310
 I don't want to keep secrets from you. 

748
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:27,980
 Please save this lamb from Satan. 

749
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:32,080
 You promised me that you would hate those who abandon you. 

750
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:33,190
 Come to your senses. 

751
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:35,560
 You are being gaslighted by Lee Se Na. 

752
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,660
 It's all over now, Young Won. 

753
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:40,760
 We are not the family you think.
