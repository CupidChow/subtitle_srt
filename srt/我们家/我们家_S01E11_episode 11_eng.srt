1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,867
   

2
00:00:03,867 --> 00:00:08,000
    
 Oh my, there's too much water.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,467
You.

4
00:00:13,467 --> 00:00:17,800
You can never win with psychological warfare.

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,333
You got caught right away.

6
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,433
Can't you be quiet?

7
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:25,567
I have to show her that she was reckless.

8
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:30,100
Noh Young Won must have thought that her son's secret was pregnancy.

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,667
That's why I said we should just reveal the secret all at once.

10
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,733
Why did you make me tutor him

11
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:38,100
and wait for my turn?

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,233
We can just reveal the secret quickly,

13
00:00:40,233 --> 00:00:42,533
and ruin Noh Young Won's son.

14
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:47,367
    
 I think it would be fun just to think about

15
00:00:47,367 --> 00:00:50,167
Noh Young Won suffering because of her son.

16
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:53,467
Why do you only think about yourself?

17
00:00:53,467 --> 00:00:55,000
Have you forgotten?

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,100
We decided that the ending for Noh Young Won would be one that would satisfy all of us.

19
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,333
As expected, your empathy is lacking.

20
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:08,300
I don't like that word the most.

21
00:01:09,233 --> 00:01:13,367
I can't relate to your thoughts.

22
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:17,800
Wouldn't it be faster and more accurate to just reveal the secret to people

23
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,033
and watch Noh Young Won suffer?

24
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:24,133
It's more fun to stimulate her imagination.

25
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:28,500
A person's imagination is the scariest thing.

26
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,967
Will the secret be revealed to the public?

27
00:01:30,967 --> 00:01:34,700
What happens when it's revealed?

28
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,700
She will be suffering in her imagination.

29
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,267
I'm going to torture her like hell

30
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:47,600
until she finally gives up on everything.

31
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,400
Just a moment, oh my.

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,400
What is it again?

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,967
 Tae Oh, I confessed to my mom. 

34
00:02:02,967 --> 00:02:05,167
 My mom said she would protect me. 

35
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,367
What did you do so that he said this?

36
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:10,700
Oh, I don't know. I'll reveal the secret.

37
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,933
You don't know the rules of this game.

38
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:17,367
Just wait.

39
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,067
I'll have to make another plan.

40
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:27,833
Wait, again? How long do I have to wait?

41
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,100
Have you forgotten about the past?

42
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,900
If you keep bothering me,

43
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,400
getting rid of you won't be a big deal.

44
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:44,910
You know that, right?

45
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:54,950



46
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,733
Se Na.

47
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:41,333
Se Na.

48
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:44,700
You're here.

49
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,333
Manager Ahn?

50
00:04:14,867 --> 00:04:19,267
Who do you think installed the hidden camera in that house?

51
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:24,100
Why didn't you tell me about that?

52
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:30,267
The timing is perfect because he was recently fired.

53
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:35,800
But what was surprising was that he didn't tell the police about me.

54
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:40,567
Why didn't you tell me

55
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:44,600
that Manager Ahn was an internal spy?

56
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,467
Now he has nothing to do with us.

57
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:49,700
He's going to die anyway.

58
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,967
Take it.

59
00:04:50,967 --> 00:04:52,700
Is he…

60
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,600
- Is he going to die? 
 - A more interesting idea came to my mind.

61
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,967
The one who attacked Noh Young Won

62
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:12,300
out of resentment for being fired.

63
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:18,100
Noh Young Won accidentally kills him.

64
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,700
I think I should write a mystery novel.

65
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,533
Are you trying to...

66
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:26,833
frame Noh Young Won for murder now?

67
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:31,433
Since she won't give up, I have to force her to give up.

68
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:33,333
If she wants to clear her name,

69
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:38,067
she has to reveal everything and give up.

70
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:40,700
She has to ruin herself.

71
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:47,933
Se Na, how many times do I have to tell you that she…

72
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:51,367
she's the kind of person who can stand to ruin herself.

73
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:55,667
It pains her more to see her family ruined than to see herself destroyed.

74
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:57,933
How many times do I have to tell you?

75
00:06:04,867 --> 00:06:06,967
What-What are you…

76
00:06:56,967 --> 00:06:58,600
You know that, right?

77
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,633
Our purpose is to get revenge on Noh Young Won.

78
00:07:02,633 --> 00:07:05,133
Trust me and follow me this time as well.

79
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,900
Why didn't you give me this?

80
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,233
No.

81
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,333
This time, I'll decide.

82
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:45,970
 What if everyone finds out your family's secret? 

83
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:49,133
 I'll give you an hour. 

84
00:08:40,933 --> 00:08:43,767
 This is really creepy. 

85
00:08:46,633 --> 00:08:49,367
   

86
00:08:50,267 --> 00:08:53,467
 Please leave a message after the beep… 

87
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:55,833
How could he…

88
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:17,167
I should have abandoned him a long time ago.

89
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:50,800
   

90
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,067
Yes, this is the Gangnam police station.

91
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,033
Yes.

92
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:14,333
The real culprit?

93
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,333
- Yes, please give me the address. 
 - What is it?

94
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,367
Yes.

95
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,433
What is it?

96
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:24,900
He is saying that he is the real culprit of the Yangpyeong villa murder case.

97
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,367
Hello. Hello.

98
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:33,260
   

99
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,867
You should have listened to me.

100
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,767
 I think I've found the real culprit. 

101
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:32,633
 Just a moment. 

102
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:34,667
 Wow, look at this. 

103
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:36,433
It's so crazy here, so crazy.

104
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:40,433
Oh, I think you should see this.

105
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,700
Hold on.

106
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:46,867
But the tenant here is a man

107
00:11:46,867 --> 00:11:49,533
 in his 20s named Oh Tae Hwan. 

108
00:11:49,533 --> 00:11:52,600
 Is this person also related to Lee Se Na? 

109
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,367
Oh Tae Hwan is Moon Tae Oh.

110
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:57,033
He's Do Hyun's private tutor.

111
00:11:57,033 --> 00:12:00,410
What? Is that the same person?

112
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:04,333
I think he ran away already.

113
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:07,000
Yes, I'll try to find him quickly.

114
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,167
No.

115
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:12,433
I know how to bring him to us.

116
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:22,067
 You were right. 

117
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:24,433
 My mom doesn't acknowledge me. 

118
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:27,233
 Come here and save me. 

119
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,100
Hello.

120
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,900
You're here.

121
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,567
Yes, where's Do Hyun?

122
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,633
The one who is from Yangju cathedral orphanage.

123
00:12:50,633 --> 00:12:53,267
The one who impersonated Moon Tae Oh from Hankuk University.

124
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:56,233
The one who is Oh Ji Hwan's twin brother.

125
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,533
Oh Tae Hwan.

126
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:06,600
Since when have you known Lee Se Na?

127
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:15,933
You figured it out.

128
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:22,367
So that's why you called me here in the name of Do Hyun?

129
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:27,533
You were the one who was at the villa with Lee Se Na that day. Right?

130
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:29,433
What are you talking about?

131
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,900
The man who fought with Mother that day at the villa

132
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,833
The man who fought with Mother that day at the villa

133
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,333
was you. Right?

134
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:44,100
Do you have proof that it was me?

135
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:51,667
Are you doing this

136
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:55,233
because of what happened 16 years ago?

137
00:13:56,733 --> 00:13:58,933
I remember that.

138
00:13:59,633 --> 00:14:03,000
A twin brother who looked exactly like you

139
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,233
and a mother covered in bruises.

140
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:11,133
I thought your mother would come back again.

141
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:14,333
So, I just sent her back home.

142
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,400
You just sent her back home?

143
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,933
Did you think it that way?

144
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:31,900
I think you're misunderstanding something.

145
00:14:37,433 --> 00:14:39,933
You just sent her back home?

146
00:14:48,033 --> 00:14:51,533
Yeah, you should have just sent her home...

147
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,500
instead of spouting that nonsense!

148
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,800
It's all because of the words you blurted out without thinking.

149
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,600
No. No.

150
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:06,000
Die! Die!

151
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,133
Now!

152
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,667
Jae Jin.

153
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:23,867
Let's go in quickly…

154
00:16:23,867 --> 00:16:25,167
Where are you going?

155
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:26,733
- Come here. 
 - Let me go.

156
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:28,767
Come here.

157
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,067
Young Min.

158
00:16:38,467 --> 00:16:41,167
You bastard! Bastard!

159
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:44,500
Are you all right?

160
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,000
No.

161
00:16:57,733 --> 00:16:59,767
Let go.

162
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:06,133
Let go! Let go!

163
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:08,367
Catch him!

164
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:15,400
We are the police.

165
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:24,100
Catch him!

166
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,700
   

167
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,100
Nice to meet you.

168
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,667
Yes, hello.

169
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:49,100
Yes, I'm Oh Ji Eun's boyfriend, Koo Kyung Tae.

170
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,067
- Oh, yes, hello. 
 - Nice to meet you.

171
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,100
Well, Mr. Choi.

172
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,200
Ji Eun…

173
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,333
Let's talk about it later.

174
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,367
Yes.

175
00:18:05,767 --> 00:18:09,167
Thanks to you, we arrested him, but it was a dangerous operation.

176
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:11,367
We had no choice.

177
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:14,633
Yes, well, he's still insisting that he doesn't know anything,

178
00:18:14,633 --> 00:18:17,433
but bloody clothes and a knife were found,

179
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:20,200
so he won't last long.

180
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:24,333
Your mother will be able to return home.

181
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:28,767
Well, that doesn't mean she's completely off the suspect list yet.

182
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:30,833
Oh, I see.

183
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:36,533
Did you find out what I asked you to find out? About Oh Tae Hwan's younger brother.

184
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,067
Oh, yes.

185
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:41,900
But he died young.

186
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:48,300
Except for Oh Tae Hwan, everyone in that family died.

187
00:18:51,267 --> 00:18:54,500
It's similar to Lee Se Na as expected.

188
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,700
I'd like to meet him.

189
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,867
Are you okay with that?

190
00:19:00,867 --> 00:19:02,000
Wouldn't it be dangerous?

191
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,467
Yes, it's fine.

192
00:19:04,467 --> 00:19:06,867
Please go this way.

193
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:27,267
Wouldn't that be dangerous?

194
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:29,733
If it's dangerous, I'll go in right away.

195
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:31,733
Yes.

196
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:43,267
You think it's because of me that your family was unhappy. Right?

197
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,767
Why did you do that then?

198
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:53,433
I thought there was something wrong with your parents.

199
00:19:53,433 --> 00:20:00,767
I just told her what was more urgent in treating your brother.

200
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,533
What would have happened if you hadn't said...

201
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:09,133
such irresponsible things to my mom?

202
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:11,967
I thought about it every night.

203
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:16,300
Every night since the day my family all died.

204
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,233
 Put it away. 

205
00:20:40,267 --> 00:20:45,133
 Why? Why? 

206
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,333
 Stop it. 

207
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,867
 Stop what? 

208
00:20:49,867 --> 00:20:51,733
 Stop it! 

209
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:55,167
 She said it was all your fault. 

210
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,167
 Did she say that? 

211
00:20:57,167 --> 00:20:59,733
 What did you hear that madeyou come and do this to me? 

212
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:00,933
 Is this because of me? 

213
00:21:00,933 --> 00:21:02,800
 Yeah, it's because of you. 

214
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,467
 It's because of you. 

215
00:21:04,467 --> 00:21:06,600
 Don't do that to your kids. 

216
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,300
 Do you think you're qualified to talk about kids? 

217
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:16,233
 It's because of you. It's because of you! 

218
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:18,800
 Mom! 

219
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:26,067
If only you hadn't said that,

220
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:30,900
and if my mom hadn't tried to kill my dad,

221
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:34,133
my family wouldn't have all died like that.

222
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:40,290
I want to make you feel that too.

223
00:22:41,067 --> 00:22:42,867
I want to make you feel

224
00:22:42,867 --> 00:22:49,133
the pain of seeing your family destroyed before your eyes.

225
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:51,767
Yeah.

226
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:57,900
I can't understand the pain you must have gone through.

227
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,133
But...

228
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,233
it's a mistake to think it was because of me.

229
00:23:06,033 --> 00:23:10,867
My judgment at the time, when I told her to cut off her abusive husband first,

230
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:15,000
is still the same.

231
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,000
Why are you so confident?

232
00:23:22,867 --> 00:23:25,000
Do you think everything you say is correct?

233
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,100
Do you think what you say is correct?

234
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,400
I'm asking you.

235
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,067
Do you think that's correct?

236
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,400
You.

237
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,500
You don't know what kind of pain I felt.

238
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,800
That's why we want you to be ruined.

239
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,400
She's in danger. I need to tell her to come out.

240
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,267
Hold on.

241
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:46,800
We?

242
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,400
Are you talking about Lee Se Na?

243
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,567
No.

244
00:23:50,567 --> 00:23:53,100
The patients you abandoned,

245
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,100
everyone who was ruined because of you.

246
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,667
Are you going to protect Lee Se Na until the end,

247
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:02,833
knowing what your situation is right now?

248
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:07,033
Leaving all the evidence in your house means

249
00:24:07,033 --> 00:24:09,667
she's abandoned you.

250
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:11,733
Think about it carefully.

251
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:16,633
You were also gaslighted by Lee Se Na.

252
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,600
No... No.

253
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,033
No, it's not.

254
00:24:23,033 --> 00:24:26,000
Why are you talking about Lee Se Na and not me?

255
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:29,067
Let go!

256
00:24:47,133 --> 00:24:49,300
Are you all right?

257
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,567
Don't pay attention to what that bastard said.

258
00:24:52,567 --> 00:24:55,800
Even so, does it make sense to do it this way?

259
00:24:56,767 --> 00:25:02,500
His family members died horribly before his eyes,

260
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,133
so he probably feels resentful toward me.

261
00:25:04,133 --> 00:25:06,900
I know it's a bit weird for me to say this,

262
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:11,967
but you once told me that it was more important for doctors to have cognitive empathy

263
00:25:11,967 --> 00:25:14,500
for their patients than emotional empathy.

264
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,200
You told me that I shouldn't let my emotions cloud my judgment.

265
00:25:19,033 --> 00:25:21,567
You did well.

266
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:25,233
They became unhappy because of bad parents.

267
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,733
Are you okay with your injury?

268
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,800
Yeah, I'm okay.

269
00:25:37,767 --> 00:25:40,100
It was dangerous.

270
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,533
 While Dr. Noh Young Won's mother-in-law is being arrested on suspicion of murder, 

271
00:25:55,533 --> 00:25:59,733
 another suspect is being arrested, causing a big stir in the case. 

272
00:25:59,733 --> 00:26:02,333
 The police revealed that a large amount of evidence with the victim's DNA 

273
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:06,000
 was found in the house of suspect A who was arrested this time, and that 

274
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,767
 the content confirmed in the text messages sent by suspect A suggested that 

275
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,433
 the case may have been fabricated 

276
00:26:10,433 --> 00:26:14,933
 by involving writer Hong Sa Gang, Dr. Noh Young Won's mother-in-law. 

277
00:26:14,933 --> 00:26:17,967
 Accordingly, writer Hong Sa Gang requested a review of the adequacy of her arrest, and 

278
00:26:17,967 --> 00:26:23,100
 the police announced they plan to investigate without detention for the time being. 

279
00:26:49,967 --> 00:26:52,200
You're here alone?

280
00:27:01,267 --> 00:27:04,633
You had a hard time, Mother.

281
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:06,330
Yeah.

282
00:27:07,967 --> 00:27:10,533
Let's go back home.

283
00:27:20,367 --> 00:27:24,000
I remember driving to the beach in Tongyeong with you

284
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,400
in a car like this when I was young.

285
00:27:34,633 --> 00:27:37,433
I was driving too fast

286
00:27:37,433 --> 00:27:41,150
so you grabbed my hand.

287
00:27:42,033 --> 00:27:45,267
Why did you do that?

288
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:51,667
It's nice.

289
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,600
Shall we go and see the sea for a while?

290
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,867
Shall we?

291
00:27:56,867 --> 00:27:58,380
Yes.

292
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,633
Do you remember the video you took for me?

293
00:28:06,633 --> 00:28:08,900
The video you kept filming while playing hide and seek…

294
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,367
Sure, I remember that.

295
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:16,000
We were playing hide and seek that day, too.

296
00:28:19,167 --> 00:28:22,800
The day I first found out the truth.

297
00:28:31,133 --> 00:28:32,867
 95, 96, 97, 

298
00:28:32,867 --> 00:28:36,700
 98, 99… 100! 

299
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,900
 I'll find you. 

300
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:49,167
 Ready or not, here I come. 

301
00:28:52,067 --> 00:28:53,750
 Jae Jin. 

302
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,767
 Jae Jin. 

303
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:59,400
 Where did you go? 

304
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,967
 Our Jae Jin. 

305
00:29:01,967 --> 00:29:04,033
 Jae Jin. 

306
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:09,367
 Ready or not, here I come. 

307
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:14,400
 Ready or not, here I come. 

308
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:20,267
 Ready or not, here I come. 

309
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,660
 Turn it off. 

310
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,400
 What are you doing? 

311
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,000
 Jae Jin isn't here. 

312
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,333
 I told him he'd get in trouble if he played in the study. 

313
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:32,800
 He'll be on the 2nd floor. 

314
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,967
 Oh, and let him run around outside. 

315
00:29:35,967 --> 00:29:38,733
 Why are you making him play inside the house all day long? 

316
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:42,167
 Why are you playing hide and seek with a boy? 

317
00:29:42,167 --> 00:29:44,567
 Don't you know that the yellow dust is really severe right now? 

318
00:29:44,567 --> 00:29:48,670
 Don't you know that our Jae Jin has a weak respiratory tract? 

319
00:29:52,367 --> 00:29:54,900
 Our Jae Jin? 

320
00:29:56,233 --> 00:29:59,667
 He's not even your child. 

321
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:02,300
 You are very obsessed with him. 

322
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,767
 Is that because you can't have children? 

323
00:30:09,467 --> 00:30:11,933
 That's also a kind of obsession. 

324
00:30:26,767 --> 00:30:30,833
 I can't find you anywhere. 

325
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:32,767
 Jae Jin. 

326
00:30:32,767 --> 00:30:36,233
 I can't find you anywhere. 

327
00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:45,200
 Jae Jin. 

328
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:54,633
 Mom! 

329
00:30:54,633 --> 00:31:02,133
♫  On a bright spring day  ♫

330
00:31:02,133 --> 00:31:06,167
♫  With the sun shining  ♫

331
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:09,867
 Oh, my son. 

332
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:12,967
 My son. My son. 

333
00:31:12,967 --> 00:31:16,533
♫  Mother who was very young  ♫

334
00:31:16,533 --> 00:31:24,767
♫  Laughed like a flower and sang like a bird  ♫

335
00:31:24,767 --> 00:31:30,933
♫  The scent of flowers  ♫

336
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:35,833
Why didn't you tell me all these years?

337
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,533
I think I didn't want to be abandoned by you.

338
00:31:39,533 --> 00:31:42,967
That would have never happened.

339
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:45,700
Sorry, Jae Jin.

340
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,233
I'm sorry for everything.

341
00:31:47,233 --> 00:31:49,070
No, it's okay.

342
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:53,130
Maybe it was my choice that day.

343
00:31:53,767 --> 00:31:56,067
I'll pretend not to know

344
00:31:56,067 --> 00:32:00,100
and live as your son until I die.

345
00:32:12,033 --> 00:32:14,667
"Son.

346
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:18,633
I wanted to be a strong sun for you

347
00:32:18,633 --> 00:32:22,490
until you bloomed.

348
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:27,333
Without even knowing that I was burning myself.

349
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:31,300
Now, with a burning heart,

350
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:35,890
I look at the white moon beyond the bars.

351
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:39,933
I will be the gentle moonlight to you.

352
00:32:39,933 --> 00:32:46,400
It will become a night sky that simply captures the shining you.

353
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:53,133
So don't look back or hesitate.

354
00:32:53,133 --> 00:32:55,300
Just don't forget

355
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,300
that you are the first

356
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:03,033
and last bright light in my life."

357
00:33:07,033 --> 00:33:14,567
♫  Flowers bloom without a care  ♫

358
00:33:16,033 --> 00:33:17,567
Jae Jin.

359
00:33:19,767 --> 00:33:21,967
Jae Jin.

360
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:33,800
♫  The scent of flowers  ♫

361
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:40,833
♫  Carried by the wind is dizzying  ♫

362
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:44,867
♫  But there is no mother  ♫

363
00:33:44,867 --> 00:33:52,867
♫  Who blushed and was shy  ♫

364
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:59,533
♫  My mother, whose tired body  ♫

365
00:33:59,533 --> 00:34:03,433
♫  Lost its light  ♫

366
00:34:03,433 --> 00:34:09,867
♫  And left ahead of the spring path  ♫

367
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,700
Grandmother.

368
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,233
You had a hard time.

369
00:34:23,233 --> 00:34:26,500
Yeah, thank you.

370
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,733
I love you.

371
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:30,067
I love you, too.

372
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:36,700
Mrs. Hong, welcome back.

373
00:34:38,633 --> 00:34:43,100
Sister! Sister!

374
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,000
Sister!

375
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,633
All right.

376
00:34:46,633 --> 00:34:49,467
You had a hard time. Right?

377
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:52,167
I got it, so…

378
00:34:52,167 --> 00:34:54,767
Let go…

379
00:34:54,767 --> 00:34:57,833
I prepared food because you are back.

380
00:34:57,833 --> 00:34:59,400
- Sis, let's go in. 
 - Yeah.

381
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,867
Let's all go in.

382
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:04,567
Ta-da.

383
00:35:04,567 --> 00:35:06,933
Sis, I love you.

384
00:35:12,733 --> 00:35:14,467
   

385
00:35:14,467 --> 00:35:17,000
This is truly a release party.

386
00:35:17,567 --> 00:35:20,067
It's almost a tofu party.

387
00:35:21,233 --> 00:35:23,267
Are you teasing me now?

388
00:35:23,267 --> 00:35:24,533
No.

389
00:35:24,533 --> 00:35:29,167
They say that eating tofu will cure bad luck.

390
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,900
Family.

391
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:41,967
I would like to thank my family

392
00:35:41,967 --> 00:35:44,667
for worrying about me all this time.

393
00:35:44,667 --> 00:35:46,833
Dr. Choi.

394
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:48,900
Dr. Noh.

395
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,033
And especially our Do Hyun.

396
00:35:51,033 --> 00:35:54,700
Oh, did you just say Dr. Noh?

397
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:59,000
Oh, Young Won. You got promoted.

398
00:36:00,633 --> 00:36:02,300
I'm talking right now.

399
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,733
Yes.

400
00:36:03,733 --> 00:36:06,900
I'm especially grateful to Jae Jin's brother-in-law

401
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:10,000
who came here to celebrate my release,

402
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,633
and to Aunt who prepared such a delicious meal for the family.

403
00:36:14,633 --> 00:36:17,267
Thank you so much.

404
00:36:17,267 --> 00:36:22,467
Let's forget all the bad memories of our past

405
00:36:22,467 --> 00:36:26,533
and toast together for this beautiful moment today!

406
00:36:26,533 --> 00:36:28,800
- Toast! 
 - Toast!

407
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,600
Family is the most important thing. Right?

408
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:40,100
Last time I saw you, it seemed like you and Jae Jin wouldn't meet again,

409
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:42,567
but I guess you've made up. Right?

410
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,933
Is there a need for family reconciliation?

411
00:36:44,933 --> 00:36:46,567
I'm sorry about what happened last time.

412
00:36:46,567 --> 00:36:48,567
I'm sorry about what happened last time.

413
00:36:48,567 --> 00:36:50,067
I'm also sorry to Aunt and Young Min.

414
00:36:50,067 --> 00:36:55,300
Well, they say family is basically a gathering of people who have a lot to apologize for.

415
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:59,433
Doesn't this family have too much to apologize for?

416
00:37:09,433 --> 00:37:13,067
I think you should apologize first.

417
00:37:13,067 --> 00:37:15,100
Me?

418
00:37:17,767 --> 00:37:20,133
Sis,

419
00:37:20,133 --> 00:37:22,300
I'm sorry.

420
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:27,300
That's not what I meant…

421
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,433
Mother, try this tofu pancake.

422
00:37:29,433 --> 00:37:31,533
It looks so good.

423
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,633
Aunt, thank you for the food. It looks so good.

424
00:37:37,633 --> 00:37:39,067
Thank you.

425
00:37:39,067 --> 00:37:40,367
Let's try this.

426
00:37:40,367 --> 00:37:43,967
- Thank you for the meal. 
 - Thank you.

427
00:37:43,967 --> 00:37:46,267
Thank you for the meal.

428
00:37:58,233 --> 00:38:00,333
Yes.

429
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,267
Thank you. And about my mom, too.

430
00:38:05,267 --> 00:38:07,600
No, it's not.

431
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,233
You've had a hard time, too.

432
00:38:09,233 --> 00:38:11,267
Yes.

433
00:38:16,267 --> 00:38:19,130
What? What is it?

434
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:22,667
I have something to say.

435
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,900
Actually…

436
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,333
Oh, just hearing that makes me nervous now.

437
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:31,100
Hurry up and tell me, what is it?

438
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,930
Actually,

439
00:38:38,933 --> 00:38:40,967
I…

440
00:38:40,967 --> 00:38:43,433
I'm not my mother's biological son.

441
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,400
What are you talking about?

442
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,633
She's not my biological mother.

443
00:38:50,633 --> 00:38:53,267
I don't even know who my biological mother is.

444
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,500
Are you sure about that?

445
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,367
I'm sure about this.

446
00:38:57,367 --> 00:39:00,233
I've known it for a long time.

447
00:39:03,533 --> 00:39:07,833
Mother doesn't know that you know. ight?

448
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:10,067
I just ended up telling her.

449
00:39:10,067 --> 00:39:12,867
The day before the incident at our villa.

450
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,267
Are you all right?

451
00:39:24,267 --> 00:39:26,900
Yeah, I feel relieved.

452
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,267
Is it a bit wrong to say it like this?

453
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:34,000
No, I think that might be possible.

454
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,167
Mother must be very shocked.

455
00:39:45,233 --> 00:39:47,467
Maybe it's because I've been locked up,

456
00:39:47,467 --> 00:39:49,900
so now I don't really feel that way.

457
00:39:51,933 --> 00:39:53,600
You had a hard time.

458
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:58,500
Dr. Noh also had a hard time catching Oh Tae Hwan.

459
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,600
No matter how much he hates you,

460
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,867
how can he do something like that?

461
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:06,667
That's true.

462
00:40:06,667 --> 00:40:10,333
But since that family went through something like that,

463
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:15,367
I feel guilty about whether my judgment was really right.

464
00:40:15,433 --> 00:40:18,633
At times like this, Dr. Noh has become soft-hearted.

465
00:40:18,633 --> 00:40:21,900
There are all different types of patients.

466
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:26,300
All doctors have to do is fulfill their mission based on their beliefs.

467
00:40:32,633 --> 00:40:36,667
I heard that from Jae Jin.

468
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:39,500
I think it's amazing...

469
00:40:40,567 --> 00:40:43,600
that you did that.

470
00:40:46,133 --> 00:40:49,000
The day I first met Jae Jin,

471
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,400
he held my hand tightly

472
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,833
and wouldn't let go,

473
00:40:55,833 --> 00:41:01,667
and I couldn't let go of that small hand.

474
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:06,567
I guess this is what fate means

475
00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:10,067
between a mother and a son.

476
00:41:12,033 --> 00:41:16,933
At first, I hid Jae Jin without anyone knowing

477
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:19,500
and said I was pregnant.

478
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,767
I played pregnant for several months

479
00:41:22,767 --> 00:41:27,300
as if my stomach was getting bigger and bigger.

480
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,067
But it was so weird.

481
00:41:30,067 --> 00:41:36,167
It really felt like Jae Jin was growing inside my stomach.

482
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:41,667
It's really amazing that...

483
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:45,333
you tried to protect Jae Jin.

484
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:47,600
Oh, Dr. Noh.

485
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:52,433
He was really the only sparkle in my life.

486
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:58,500
I think that's why I'm so obsessed with Jae Jin.

487
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:04,533
At times like this, you also have a delicate side.

488
00:42:04,533 --> 00:42:06,900
No, no, no.

489
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:11,700
It's not the right time to be emotional now.

490
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,490
Let's see.

491
00:42:21,733 --> 00:42:23,667
- Dr. Noh. 
 - Yes, Mother.

492
00:42:23,667 --> 00:42:26,433
What are you doing? Please help me with this.

493
00:42:26,433 --> 00:42:28,333
   

494
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:32,100
Mother, when did you do this thing…

495
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:36,633
So, according to your reasoning,

496
00:42:36,633 --> 00:42:41,433
- the one who fought with me was Oh Tae Hwan, 
 - Yes.

497
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:45,900
but the one who planned to frame me for murder was Lee Se Na. Right?

498
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:49,400
It must have been Lee Se Na who reported it to the police.

499
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,333
The fact that she blamed everything on Oh Tae Hwan

500
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:54,667
means that she wants to play the last game with me.

501
00:42:54,667 --> 00:42:58,467
She murdered her assistant Ahn Yo Seop

502
00:42:58,467 --> 00:43:01,567
and also reported on Oh Tae Hwan.

503
00:43:01,567 --> 00:43:05,400
Until now, Lee Se Na has always

504
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,833
looked for helpers around us.

505
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:12,100
So we should pay close attention to our surroundings. Right?

506
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:16,267
We need to get Oh Tae Hwan to talk about Lee Se Na as soon as possible.

507
00:43:16,933 --> 00:43:22,167
I really can't believe that Oh Tae Hwan, who looks so normal,

508
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:28,700
taught our Do Hyun with such impure intentions.

509
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:32,633
So, you have to be careful when letting people

510
00:43:32,633 --> 00:43:36,333
into our house from now on, Dr. Noh.

511
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,600
Mother, it was Jae Jin who brought Oh Tae Hwan into the house.

512
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:44,000
He even lied and said he was his senior's son.

513
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,067
Is that so?

514
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:53,867
At that time, our Dr. Choi was in the midst of being deceived.

515
00:43:53,867 --> 00:44:00,767
- It was you who liked him, saying, "He's a hot young man who likes George Orwell." 
 - Did I?

516
00:44:00,767 --> 00:44:03,800
I remember it was you who recommended him

517
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,633
to meet Do Hyun after hearing that he had won the Olympiad.

518
00:44:07,633 --> 00:44:09,833
Did I say that?

519
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,267
Why do you have such a good memory?

520
00:44:13,267 --> 00:44:16,733
Are you taking any medicine to make you smarter?

521
00:45:05,988 --> 00:45:08,060
   

522
00:45:18,567 --> 00:45:20,733
Ji Eun.

523
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:26,733
Ji Eun, I'm trying to get out of hospital work now.

524
00:45:26,733 --> 00:45:29,567
I want you to take charge of the hospital.

525
00:45:30,133 --> 00:45:32,633
I don't need the hospital.

526
00:45:32,633 --> 00:45:36,490
If you're leaving, I'll go with you.

527
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,680
Leaving?

528
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:44,168
You said you'd like to be free from your family.

529
00:45:46,433 --> 00:45:48,467
Why?

530
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,400
Will it not be possible again because Mrs. Hong is back?

531
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,733
So, did you decide to go back and live in that house?

532
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,867
Jae Jin, why can't you sort it out?

533
00:46:01,867 --> 00:46:03,967
I'm here. I'll help you.

534
00:46:03,967 --> 00:46:05,833
Yes.

535
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:08,433
No, Ji Eun.

536
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:14,133
First of all, I have some family matters to sort out.

537
00:46:14,133 --> 00:46:15,680
Family?

538
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,900
Family?

539
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:21,900
Please stop saying family.

540
00:46:22,967 --> 00:46:25,767
Don't you know why I performed the surgery on your behalf?

541
00:46:25,767 --> 00:46:30,867
Don't you know that because of her, you and I are both living the wrong lives?

542
00:46:32,867 --> 00:46:38,300
If this is the case, I'll reveal everything and end it.

543
00:46:38,933 --> 00:46:42,867
Yeah, it was all wrong.

544
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,300
If you want to do that, you can do so.

545
00:46:53,433 --> 00:46:55,967
Sorry, Ji Eun.

546
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,333
Stop crying.

547
00:47:29,767 --> 00:47:32,000
How did you…

548
00:47:32,733 --> 00:47:34,800
Stop there.

549
00:47:38,133 --> 00:47:41,033
I came because I have something to say.

550
00:47:41,033 --> 00:47:43,733
The only reason I approached Choi Jae Jin

551
00:47:43,733 --> 00:47:47,233
was to get revenge on Noh Young Won.

552
00:47:47,233 --> 00:47:51,600
I'm saying that I had no other intentions at all.

553
00:47:53,467 --> 00:47:57,367
The problem is not us, but those people,

554
00:47:57,367 --> 00:48:00,067
Hong Sa Gang and Noh Young Won.

555
00:48:00,067 --> 00:48:03,600
But why are we suffering?

556
00:48:04,133 --> 00:48:07,333
I know you've been holding it in too.

557
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:12,200
Since you received help from that family since you were young,

558
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,500
they took advantage of your noble heart

559
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:19,400
by deceiving you with the word "family".

560
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:24,600
But you never showed greed.

561
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,067
You were the one who did the surgery,

562
00:48:27,067 --> 00:48:30,867
and you were the one who sacrificed by Choi Jae Jin's side

563
00:48:30,867 --> 00:48:34,533
when he achieved fame,

564
00:48:34,533 --> 00:48:38,633
and you didn't show any greed

565
00:48:38,633 --> 00:48:41,800
when Jae Jin married Noh Young Won.

566
00:48:44,567 --> 00:48:47,700
Because you thought they were family.

567
00:48:51,333 --> 00:48:57,467
But Hong Sa Gang was ready to abandon you at any time.

568
00:48:59,233 --> 00:49:03,430
It's enough for you to have endured for those people so far.

569
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:06,833
Now you have to be freed.

570
00:49:08,533 --> 00:49:11,233
You have that weapon.

571
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:15,980
You can tell people about the humiliation you suffered from Hong Sa Gang.

572
00:49:19,933 --> 00:49:25,267
If that family is destroyed, Choi Jae Jin will come to you.

573
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:54,033
 If it wasn't for me, Jae Jin wouldn't be where he is today. 

574
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:55,400
 No, 

575
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,600
 there were many people who could replace you. 

576
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:03,267
 This is why I can't really trust you. 

577
00:50:15,133 --> 00:50:20,467
Director Choi enters the operating room and finds his seat to listen to music.

578
00:50:20,467 --> 00:50:23,200
The surgery was the responsibility of the vice director, Dr. Oh.

579
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,133
    
 What kind of situation is this?

580
00:50:26,667 --> 00:50:30,133
This CCTV footage was revealed by Oh Ji Eun, the vice-director of

581
00:50:30,133 --> 00:50:33,400
Dr. Noh Young Won's husband, Choi Jae Jin's hospital,

582
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,367
by whistleblowing that she had performed surgery

583
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:40,067
on his behalf at the request of his mother, Hong Sa Gang.

584
00:50:40,067 --> 00:50:45,133
Can you elaborate in more detail?

585
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,433
I have been...

586
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:53,333
gaslighted by Mrs. Hong Sa Gang...

587
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:58,533
since I was young.

588
00:50:58,533 --> 00:51:02,600
 Since she has supported me for a long time, 

589
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,667
 I felt I should follow her words. 

590
00:51:04,667 --> 00:51:07,200
 But it was for her son 

591
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:12,900
 and for her family. 

592
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:16,950
 She sent me to medical school to make her son a doctor... 

593
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,900
 and had me do surrogate surgeries. 

594
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:25,100
It sounds like she treated you almost like a slave.

595
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:29,133
But was there ever a moment when you thought something was wrong?

596
00:51:29,133 --> 00:51:32,100
Whenever I felt guilty,

597
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:35,567
she always deceived me with the word "family".

598
00:51:35,567 --> 00:51:39,900
 She tried to control me by taking advantage 

599
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,200
 of my weakness as an orphan. 

600
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:46,533
 She thoroughly gaslighted me into believing that 

601
00:51:46,533 --> 00:51:49,067
 I had to be accepted by her first... 

602
00:51:50,767 --> 00:51:53,733
 before I could be accepted by her family. 

603
00:51:54,767 --> 00:51:58,333
Why do things like this keep happening in my sister's family?

604
00:51:58,333 --> 00:52:00,567
Is this all true?

605
00:52:00,567 --> 00:52:02,233
Surrogate surgery is a fact.

606
00:52:02,233 --> 00:52:04,433
He confessed it recently about that.

607
00:52:04,433 --> 00:52:06,833
Oh my.

608
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:10,333
Anyway, people are crazy about this revelation.

609
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:13,133
People make her a hero in an instant.

610
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:17,367
But Dr. Oh Ji Eun shouldn't do this, either.

611
00:52:17,933 --> 00:52:20,200
Hey, Young Min.

612
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:24,900
- Something strange is going through my head right now. 
 - What is it?

613
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,700
Could it be that my uncle was also gaslighted?

614
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:29,500
Could it be that my uncle was also gaslighted?

615
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,867
She's not that kind of person.

616
00:52:35,533 --> 00:52:37,133
Hey, hey.

617
00:52:37,133 --> 00:52:40,367
I don't think your uncle was gaslighted by her,

618
00:52:40,367 --> 00:52:43,067
but I think he loves her.

619
00:52:43,667 --> 00:52:46,067
That's even more scary.

620
00:52:58,767 --> 00:53:00,467
 Are you all right? 

621
00:53:00,467 --> 00:53:03,133
 Please just give me instructions. 

622
00:53:09,467 --> 00:53:11,167
Is our family that kind of family?

623
00:53:11,167 --> 00:53:13,200
Are you saying that my family is the kind of family

624
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,933
that has lived as respected doctors, but made people do surrogate surgeries for us?

625
00:53:15,933 --> 00:53:16,967
Do Hyun.

626
00:53:16,967 --> 00:53:20,133
I'm so embarrassed that I was so proud of you

627
00:53:20,133 --> 00:53:22,367
without even knowing it.

628
00:53:23,933 --> 00:53:26,340
You are very disappointed. Right?

629
00:53:27,267 --> 00:53:29,367
Sorry.

630
00:53:29,933 --> 00:53:35,467
Actually, I'm a little scared of seeing blood.

631
00:53:35,467 --> 00:53:38,250
So, I couldn't become a doctor.

632
00:53:40,167 --> 00:53:41,700
It's all my fault.

633
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,833
Then you shouldn't have done it.

634
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:46,133
If you're an adult, can you not make your own choices?

635
00:53:46,133 --> 00:53:48,500
 I told him to do that. 

636
00:53:50,267 --> 00:53:53,133
It's all my fault that I asked

637
00:53:53,133 --> 00:53:57,267
your father to be a doctor, and that I had Dr. Oh perform the surgery

638
00:53:57,267 --> 00:53:59,167
on your father's behalf.

639
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:01,067
I'll take responsibility.

640
00:54:01,067 --> 00:54:03,133
No.

641
00:54:04,667 --> 00:54:08,167
I wish Dad would take responsibility right now.

642
00:54:13,233 --> 00:54:15,300
It's my fault.

643
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,567
I'll handle it.

644
00:54:16,567 --> 00:54:18,900
No, Mother.

645
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,567
It was all just for me.

646
00:54:21,567 --> 00:54:26,200
As Do Hyun said, it was my fault for making the wrong choice from the beginning.

647
00:54:34,233 --> 00:54:36,733
- Yes, Ra Kyung. 
  - Young Won. 

648
00:54:36,733 --> 00:54:38,400
Something is weird.

649
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,867
They said they got a call that we were having a press conference.

650
00:54:42,867 --> 00:54:45,367
What press conference?

651
00:54:45,367 --> 00:54:50,067
Oh Ji Eun is going to make a statement regarding the revelation.

652
00:54:52,467 --> 00:54:53,567
When is that?

653
00:54:53,567 --> 00:54:56,167
It's 6:00 p.m. tonight.

654
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:59,167
And I just received a package,

655
00:54:59,167 --> 00:55:01,967
but there is no sender again.

656
00:55:10,467 --> 00:55:13,060
   

657
00:55:25,633 --> 00:55:27,933
 I'm a hypocrite. 

658
00:55:27,933 --> 00:55:31,800
 I came up with a seemingly simple solution to other people's family problems, 

659
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:36,300
 but in reality, I was busy hiding the problems in my own family. 

660
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:41,533
 Everything that Dr. Oh Ji Eun revealed is also true. 

661
00:55:50,467 --> 00:55:53,600
It can't be worse than this.

662
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:59,300
Oh Ji Eun is also part of Lee Se Na's plan.

663
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:02,067
Why on earth is she doing this?

664
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:06,067
Young Won, you can cancel the press conference right now.

665
00:56:07,633 --> 00:56:10,633
Are you really going to do as she said?

666
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:13,800
Are you going to expose the mess of the family?

667
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,967
Manager Kim.

668
00:56:15,967 --> 00:56:18,733
Sorry, I didn't realize it…

669
00:56:18,733 --> 00:56:20,567
Let's just tell the truth.

670
00:56:20,567 --> 00:56:22,800
Dr. Choi!

671
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:28,900
What's the problem with revealing our family's secrets?

672
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,500
It hurts my pride to be threatened by someone like her

673
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:35,500
and have to do whatever she says.

674
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,633
So, even more so, you shouldn't do what she tells you to do.

675
00:56:38,633 --> 00:56:41,833
Young Won, I'll cancel the press conference right now.

676
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:44,067
If I cancel it,

677
00:56:44,633 --> 00:56:47,533
she'll release Do Hyun's video right away.

678
00:56:47,533 --> 00:56:50,267
Is she blackmailing you with my secret?

679
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:52,933
Then I'll let people know my secret myself.

680
00:56:52,933 --> 00:56:54,033
No.

681
00:56:54,033 --> 00:56:55,900
Why not?

682
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:58,400
You all said you'd understand and respect me,

683
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,333
but you're afraid of otherpeople knowing it now?

684
00:57:02,233 --> 00:57:04,867
Do Hyun, that's not it.

685
00:57:04,867 --> 00:57:07,167
The situations that will arise because of that

686
00:57:07,167 --> 00:57:10,033
can be much more difficult than we thought.

687
00:57:10,033 --> 00:57:12,667
You said that

688
00:57:12,667 --> 00:57:16,933
it doesn't matter what other people think as long as the family doesn't feel embarrassed,

689
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:20,600
so don't be afraid.

690
00:57:24,967 --> 00:57:30,300
So don't ever compromise with her because of me.

691
00:57:34,467 --> 00:57:37,733
No, I can't do that.

692
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:43,333
Young Won.

693
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,067
Do Hyun, let's give your mom some time.

694
00:58:07,833 --> 00:58:12,267
   

695
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:39,300
It's Oh Ji Eun.

696
00:58:41,367 --> 00:58:43,667
Ji Eun, please take a look here.

697
00:58:43,667 --> 00:58:46,033
Ji Eun.

698
00:58:46,033 --> 00:58:48,833
Ji Eun, please take a look here.

699
00:58:53,267 --> 00:58:55,533
Oh? It's Noh Young Won.

700
00:59:13,267 --> 00:59:15,410
   

701
00:59:24,033 --> 00:59:26,890
   

702
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:39,533
I'm a hypocrite.

703
00:59:39,533 --> 00:59:43,333
I came up with a seemingly simple solution to other people's family problems,

704
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:48,133
but in reality, I was busy hiding the problems in my own family.

705
00:59:48,133 --> 00:59:53,733
Everything that Dr. Oh Ji Eun revealed is also true.

706
00:59:53,733 --> 00:59:58,200
 My family and I have been hiding an ugly secret. 

707
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:01,467
 My father-in-law accused my father of sexual assault 

708
01:00:01,467 --> 01:00:03,833
 and made him commit suicide. 

709
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:08,033
 - My mother-in-law planned the marriage of me and her son even after knowing the truth. 
 - Oh, Dr. Noh. 

710
01:00:08,033 --> 01:00:12,233
- Living with such a strong woman makes the husband suffer. 
  - A husband who had an affair while enjoying social fame through surrogate surgery. 

711
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:14,067
- She acted out recently, right? 
 - I know.

712
01:00:14,067 --> 01:00:16,500
 Even knowing all this 

713
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:20,567
 I, Noh Young Won, who never denied that we are a perfect family, 

714
01:00:20,567 --> 01:00:23,910
will reveal all of this today and at the same time...

715
01:00:24,833 --> 01:00:30,140
cut off my work and my family and leave.

716
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:48,167
The manuscript I just read

717
01:00:48,167 --> 01:00:51,367
was forced to be read by the person

718
01:00:51,367 --> 01:00:54,633
who has been threatening me and my family.

719
01:00:54,633 --> 01:01:00,467
 It says I have to reveal my family secrets and leave my family. 

720
01:01:00,467 --> 01:01:06,233
 But I decided not to do as the blackmailer said. 

721
01:01:06,233 --> 01:01:12,133
Actually, there was a secret in my family that I wanted to hide.

722
01:01:12,133 --> 01:01:18,000
Of course, I was also afraid that the secret would be revealed.

723
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,267
 But now I won't be afraid of any secret revelations. 

724
01:01:23,267 --> 01:01:26,067
Because I realized that my family is more

725
01:01:26,067 --> 01:01:29,860
important than other people's understanding.

726
01:01:31,967 --> 01:01:34,900
No matter how much we are ruined,

727
01:01:36,633 --> 01:01:40,200
I want to protect my family.

728
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:47,267
 However, I admit that I was not honest about my own family 

729
01:01:47,267 --> 01:01:51,867
while easily talking about other people's families.

730
01:01:51,867 --> 01:01:55,767
If anyone has been hurt by my counseling,

731
01:01:55,767 --> 01:01:58,733
I will ask for forgiveness

732
01:01:58,733 --> 01:02:02,900
and if there is any criticism, I will gladly accept it.

733
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:07,860
And even if I had to give up everything,

734
01:02:09,133 --> 01:02:12,030
I decided to reveal my family's blackmailer...

735
01:02:12,833 --> 01:02:14,433
and the real culprit of the villa murder case

736
01:02:14,433 --> 01:02:17,567
and the real culprit of the villa murder case

737
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:20,300
to correct the wrong.

738
01:02:21,133 --> 01:02:23,167
A real culprit?

739
01:02:35,567 --> 01:02:37,333
Lee Se Na.

740
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:39,067
 She is a heinous criminal 

741
01:02:39,067 --> 01:02:42,200
 who not only made elaborate and persistent threats, 

742
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:45,833
 but also murdered an innocent person to frame me for murder. 

743
01:02:45,833 --> 01:02:47,600
Is it a woman?

744
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,000
She's young.

745
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,167
 She was born in 1994, and she's currently 29 years old. 

746
01:02:52,167 --> 01:02:54,000
 She grew up in Gangneung 

747
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,200
 and is the only survivor and arson suspect of 

748
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,033
 the Gangneung family fire incident in 2009. 

749
01:03:00,033 --> 01:03:03,833
 She was later adopted to Norway, returned to Korea in 2015, 

750
01:03:03,833 --> 01:03:06,567
 and was also implicated in insurance fraud 

751
01:03:06,567 --> 01:03:10,567
 resulting in the deaths of three husbands. 

752
01:03:14,633 --> 01:03:17,033
 I will risk 

753
01:03:17,033 --> 01:03:22,300
 everything I have to catch Lee Se Na. 

754
01:03:22,967 --> 01:03:28,333
 So please help me... 

755
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,450
 catch this criminal. 

756
01:03:46,467 --> 01:03:49,367
I can't believe it.

757
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:51,400
How did she do something like that?

758
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:54,600
- What? 
 - Does that make sense?

759
01:04:09,467 --> 01:04:12,733
Are you saying that the photo you just released is the real culprit in the villa incident?

760
01:04:12,733 --> 01:04:14,467
Is there any evidence that she is the real culprit?

761
01:04:14,467 --> 01:04:17,633
Since when have you been threatened?

762
01:04:28,267 --> 01:04:33,233
 Do the police also know that the blackmailer is the real culprit behind the murder? 

763
01:04:47,433 --> 01:04:48,767
- You had a hard time. 
 - I'm home.

764
01:04:48,767 --> 01:04:50,767
Yes.

765
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:58,533
Oh, Soyee.

766
01:04:58,533 --> 01:05:01,967
Did Do Hyun come home?

767
01:05:01,967 --> 01:05:05,300
He said he was going to the bathroom, but I haven't been able to reach him.

768
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:06,600
Oh, yeah?

769
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:10,533
I'll contact him, okay? Thanks.

770
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:14,967
Did Do Hyun come home?

771
01:05:14,967 --> 01:05:17,933
No, he hasn't come back yet.

772
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,900
Why? What's happening?

773
01:05:33,533 --> 01:05:35,733
Do Hyun, where are you now?

774
01:05:35,733 --> 01:05:37,333
Why didn't you answer the phone?

775
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:40,900
- Soyee said… 
  - You have to protect him before he gets ruined. 

776
01:05:52,533 --> 01:05:55,367
Where's Do Hyun now?

777
01:06:00,633 --> 01:06:03,633
If you hurt our Do Hyun,

778
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:07,267
you will die.

779
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:19,433
   

780
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:33,520



781
01:06:46,267 --> 01:06:47,500
 Lee Se Na! 

782
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,267
 If you do something foolish, 

783
01:06:49,267 --> 01:06:53,133
 your son will die the loneliest way. 

784
01:06:53,133 --> 01:06:54,167
 I have to go quickly. I have to find Do Hyun. 

785
01:06:54,167 --> 01:06:55,767
 I have to go quickly. I have to find Do Hyun. 

786
01:06:55,767 --> 01:06:58,433
 This means Lee Se Na is playing a game on us now. 

787
01:06:58,433 --> 01:07:00,433
 Why did she add the word loneliness? 

788
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:03,267
 The loneliest place for Lee Se Na would have been her home. 

789
01:07:03,267 --> 01:07:06,067
 Your in-laws who killed your father and deceived you. 

790
01:07:06,067 --> 01:07:07,467
 Your husband who lived a fake life. 

791
01:07:07,467 --> 01:07:10,067
 Even your son lied to you, why? 

792
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:11,467
 I'll cut them off from you. 

793
01:07:11,467 --> 01:07:13,400
 Save our Do Hyun! 

794
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,767
 Live through the pain of killing your son. 

795
01:07:15,767 --> 01:07:18,767
 You can't cut me off.
