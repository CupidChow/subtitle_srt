1
00:00:00,468 --> 00:00:02,784
   

2
00:00:03,833 --> 00:00:07,900
    
 I'll announce the Doctor of the Year Award.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,067
This year's award is a bit more special.

4
00:00:11,067 --> 00:00:14,833
As you all know, the couple shared the award.

5
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:17,267
I will announce it.

6
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,967
Psychiatrist, Dr. Noh Young Won.

7
00:00:19,967 --> 00:00:22,000
Plastic surgeon, Dr. Choi Jae Jin.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Congratulations.

9
00:00:45,567 --> 00:00:48,533
My sincere congratulations to you both.

10
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:50,067
When I checked,

11
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:52,833
I heard that this year was the first time

12
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:55,133
a couple received a doctor's award jointly.

13
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:58,967
We can't help but listen to your thoughts, Dr. Noh?

14
00:00:58,967 --> 00:01:00,333
Do it first.

15
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:03,667
- You do it first. 
 - You do it first.

16
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:11,000
Well, somehow

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,267
this happened to me.

18
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:18,967
I don't know if it is an award I deserve to receive.

19
00:01:18,967 --> 00:01:21,800
I will continue to work hard

20
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,733
to treat and help people.

21
00:01:24,733 --> 00:01:28,133
I would also like to thank

22
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:30,967
by my side and given me...

23
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:33,500
a lot of support...

24
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,267
until I received this award.

25
00:01:39,267 --> 00:01:41,067
Thank you.

26
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:45,400
As I heard, he's really a loving husband.

27
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,233
Then, we can't help but hear the thoughts of Dr. Noh,

28
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:53,233
the spiritual mentor of Dr. Choi, and a psychiatrist responsible for

29
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:57,067
the mental health of Korean people. Right?

30
00:01:57,067 --> 00:02:01,267
I am also truly grateful.

31
00:02:01,267 --> 00:02:04,233
I'm a person with shortcomings,

32
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,400
but I'll try harder to become a doctor

33
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,467
who can fill in some of the empty space for patients.

34
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:15,300
I would like to dedicate this honor to my husband

35
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,833
who gave me so much support that I could receive this award,

36
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:25,067
Mrs. Hong Sa Gang, and my father-in-law

37
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:29,200
who loved this sight more than anyone else,

38
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:34,300
and who cherished me...

39
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:37,600
like a daughter.

40
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:48,200
Personally, when I listen to Dr. Noh Young Won's advice and solutions,

41
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,233
I think it all comes down to family.

42
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:55,967
So what does family mean to you, Doctor?

43
00:02:57,433 --> 00:03:00,233
I think family is

44
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:03,667
the lifeline to me.

45
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:05,467
A lifeline?

46
00:03:05,467 --> 00:03:06,567
Yes.

47
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:09,433
This is where the real Noh Young Won exists

48
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:12,333
and the power to get me back up.

49
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,300
If it weren't for my family,

50
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,400
I wouldn't be here.

51
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,833
So, my family is the only thing

52
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:24,133
I have to protect until the end.

53
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:28,133
Protecting my family from being cut off

54
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:30,333
is probably the reason...

55
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,767
for my life and existence.

56
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,070
   

57
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:44,500

76
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:59,067
 What are you doing? 

77
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:02,600
 I have something to tell you. 

78
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,533
 Talk about what? Now? 

79
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:11,433
 What kind of important thing do you want to tell me? 

80
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:23,667
 What's going on? 

81
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:30,800
 Do you remember how my father passed away? 

82
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:36,333
 I also remember how vainly he passed away. 

83
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:39,333
 The cases my father was involved in... 

84
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,833
 were all framed, I think. 

85
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,067
 And my father-in-law... 

86
00:06:48,633 --> 00:06:50,800
 was involved in that. 

87
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,433
 He got involved? 

88
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:59,567
 I remember that he was the prosecutor in charge of Mr. Noh's case. 

89
00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:01,900
 Get straight to the point. 

90
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,000
 Prosecutor Choi, please handle Director Noh. 

91
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 And you should come to our Hwangju Group. 

92
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,467
 But, Chairman, 

93
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:23,633
 he has such an upright personality, 

94
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:26,600
 so I don't think he will stay still. 

95
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,733
 So, we have no choice but to link this 

96
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:32,700
 to the sexual harassment case. 

97
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,267
 Yes, then 

98
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:38,767
 she will make a statement that she was sexually harassed by him, right? 

99
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:44,400
 But, Chairman, you have to make sure that secretary does her job. 

100
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:46,867
 Of course. 

101
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:48,867
 All right. 

102
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:51,033
 I'll do that. 

103
00:07:55,633 --> 00:07:59,467
 This guy really annoys me even after he's dead. 

104
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:01,633
 How could he... 

105
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,100
 be involved in framing my father? 

106
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,733
 And he made me marry Jae Jin. 

107
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,967
 Did you already know? 

108
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:19,600
 Does it matter to you now? 

109
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,900
 What? 

110
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,133
 So what do you want to do? 

111
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:25,033
 Will you report it to the police? 

112
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:27,967
 Or will you reveal it to the world? 

113
00:08:29,867 --> 00:08:31,433
 I understand. 

114
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:33,000
 You want to kill him, right? 

115
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,333
 But, Dr. Noh, he's dead now. Right? 

116
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,700
 Mr. Noh is also dead. 

117
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,333
 Now, for whom and whose apology do you want to receive? 

118
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,667
 You have to be rational. 

119
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:50,133
 So are you saying that I should just pretend not to know and move on? 

120
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:53,167
 You're so emotional today. 

121
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:55,200
 Unlike your usual self. 

122
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,867
 The important thing is 

123
00:08:56,867 --> 00:09:01,333
 what you'll get from revealing this secret. 

124
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,600
 All right. 

125
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,733
 What can I do now that they're both dead? 

126
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:11,867
 Still, 

127
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:18,133
 wouldn't I be curious to know if at least the remaining family knew about this? 

128
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:21,433
 As you know, that person and I were not close enough 

129
00:09:21,433 --> 00:09:26,167
 to share such a secret. Right? 

130
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:32,667
 And I understand your anger towards that person. 

131
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:36,233
 I, too, have lived my life being angry at Prosecutor Choi. 

132
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:38,167
 But you should think carefully. 

133
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:42,167
 What if everyone in the world knew that 

134
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:47,333
 your father-in-law was the one who drove your father to suicide? 

135
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:51,700
 Then, what do you think people will say about you, living as the daughter-in-law 

136
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,700
 without even knowing it? 

137
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,100
 Can you let go of everything that 

138
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,467
 you have achieved so far? 

139
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:23,900
 I understand how you feel. 

140
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,933
 It's been long since we've been together in this house. 

141
00:10:26,933 --> 00:10:29,067
 I totally understand. 

142
00:10:30,733 --> 00:10:33,600
 But isn't the important thing here 

143
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,133
 not revealing the truth, 

144
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:38,700
 but the well-being of our families? 

145
00:10:40,467 --> 00:10:44,000
 Just think about what will happen to our family 

146
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,900
 because of that one truth. 

147
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,000
 Think about what you need to keep. 

148
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:52,767
 The choice is yours. 

149
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:21,667
   

150
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:29,533
It's such a blessing to have the time

151
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:33,000
every morning with my family.

152
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,867
Just because we eat together doesn't mean we're family.

153
00:11:35,867 --> 00:11:38,700
Emotional communication and sharing.

154
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,633
Those are important.

155
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,567
What do you think, my grandchild?

156
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:49,933
It's stuffy.

157
00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:03,900
Amen.

158
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,267
Okay! We said Amen, so let's all eat.

159
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:08,467
Yes.

160
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:22,567
It's braised fish.

161
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:28,300
He really liked braised fish.

162
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,700
Why do you say that? She didn't make it for that.

163
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,100
Why do you say that? She didn't make it for that.

164
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,133
He liked braised fish.

165
00:12:41,967 --> 00:12:43,900
- Ma'am! 
 - Yes.

166
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,400
- I'll eat toast! 
 - All right.

167
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,333
I'm sorry, Mother.

168
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,000
Are you all right?

169
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:17,933
Did you feel this way, too? After your father passed away?

170
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,100
So,

171
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:26,267
I felt like the words 'suddenly' and 'all of a sudden' meant this.

172
00:13:26,267 --> 00:13:28,133
After my father passed away,

173
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:32,600
I suddenly felt a surge of longing.

174
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,167
You'll feel the same now.

175
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:42,067
Right.

176
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:44,733
How about you?

177
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:48,333
The one who loved you the most in this house was him.

178
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:58,200
Do you think you knew everything about him?

179
00:13:59,067 --> 00:14:00,500
Why ask?

180
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:02,770
No,

181
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,550
just…

182
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,730
I didn't know much about my father.

183
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:15,700
And, Honey,

184
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,567
no matter how bad the relationship between my mother and my father was,

185
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:23,533
I think she was very shocked.

186
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:26,233
Why is she suddenly talking about a biscuit tin?

187
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:28,100
I feel like that Mother's defense mechanism is

188
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,067
I feel like that Mother's defense mechanism is

189
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:33,167
to act brighter to forget her sadness.

190
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:36,867
I don't think she is.

191
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,533
Please take care of my mom.

192
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:46,200
All right.

193
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,200
- I'll go. 
 - Yes.

194
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,800
Dr. Noh.

195
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,100
Yes.

196
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,033
Can I have a glass of lemonade?

197
00:15:05,033 --> 00:15:06,867
I'll get you some cookies, too.

198
00:15:06,867 --> 00:15:09,633
Dr. Noh, no.

199
00:15:09,633 --> 00:15:11,900
I'd like some biscuits!

200
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,633
All right.

201
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,367
   

202
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,067
 This is so boring! 

203
00:15:23,067 --> 00:15:25,100
 She probably doesn't have any friends. 

204
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,800
 Friends talk like that? 

205
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,500
 This is just a flop! 

206
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,000
 This is a shit afternoon after reading this! 

207
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,333
 Looking at the sentences, it seems like you have no talent. 

208
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:39,400
 Why don't you stop struggling and find another job? 

209
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,533
 - She's not that kind of person. 
 - What do you know, bastard? 

210
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:46,200
 Then you'll get scolded, bastard. 

211
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,967
Hourglass?

212
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:51,167
 Writer Hong Sa Gang, are you secretly having fun? 

213
00:15:57,233 --> 00:16:00,300
What? Does she know me?

214
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:42,270
♫  Life is an endless adventure  ♫

215
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:47,650
♫  Happiness is special  ♫

216
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:52,330
♫  Hidden in all the small moments  ♫

217
00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:01,700
Doctor.

218
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,067
How was the surgery?

219
00:17:04,067 --> 00:17:06,633
The surgery went well.

220
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:10,167
Thank you. Thank you, doctor.

221
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,267
Thank you, doctor.

222
00:17:13,267 --> 00:17:15,500
Can everything be cured now?

223
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,567
That… That is…

224
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,767
Her condition is…

225
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:22,300
He was very focused during the surgery.

226
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,933
Let me explain it for you.

227
00:17:23,933 --> 00:17:26,300
First, the surgery went well.

228
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,467
That's true,

229
00:17:28,467 --> 00:17:30,500
but since Yu Jin is so young,

230
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,333
I think we'll have to observe her

231
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:36,267
and do surgeries and other treatments in stages.

232
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,800
Don't worry too much.

233
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,567
Dr. Choi said he would provide the remaining treatment free of charge.

234
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:45,300
Thank you, doctor.

235
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,933
- Thank you, doctor. 
 - Thank you.

236
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,533
Oh my.

237
00:17:49,533 --> 00:17:52,000
- Thank you. 
 - Sir, calm down…

238
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:12,667
Toast.

239
00:18:22,933 --> 00:18:26,133
You should have a drink, too.

240
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,467
   

241
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,567
Dr. Noh.

242
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:35,667
Our Dr. Choi,

243
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:40,467
isn't he a really good husband and a considerate son-in-law?

244
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:47,133
The two of them were so close even while they were alive.

245
00:18:47,133 --> 00:18:50,267
They are still by each other's side.

246
00:18:50,267 --> 00:18:52,200
He…

247
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:54,700
He also passed away in vain.

248
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,733
At the prime of his life.

249
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:06,433
Goh Myeon.

250
00:19:07,033 --> 00:19:09,833
He's not the kind of person who would die like that.

251
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,367
Aunt, how are you doing?

252
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:12,900
Yes.

253
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,200
There's no way she is doing fine.

254
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,700
He died so ridiculously…

255
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:25,133
How could he be stoned to death?

256
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:28,067
What's the point of working out

257
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:30,300
and thinking about his body his whole life?

258
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,633
He was stoned to death.

259
00:19:32,633 --> 00:19:34,333
I know…

260
00:19:39,267 --> 00:19:43,167
I came here because it was a memorial service, but you only brought wine?

261
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:44,700
Doing nothing?

262
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,233
We go to church.

263
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:53,067
Church? But you hold memorial services?

264
00:19:56,167 --> 00:19:57,567
Where's Do Hyun?

265
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,233
He's…

266
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:00,400
He went to school.

267
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,133
This is his grandpa's memorial service.

268
00:20:05,433 --> 00:20:06,933
Jae Jin,

269
00:20:06,933 --> 00:20:09,100
how did you teach him?

270
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,000
You used the wrong word.

271
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:17,933
This place is nice, but it's empty.

272
00:20:17,933 --> 00:20:19,333
- Son. 
 - Yes.

273
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,233
If I die, bury me here.

274
00:20:21,233 --> 00:20:23,500
If I die, bury me here.

275
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,633
It's expensive here.

276
00:20:25,867 --> 00:20:28,300
- Is it expensive? 
 - Yes.

277
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,200
How much is one space here?

278
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,967
Jae Jin, let's go.

279
00:20:37,467 --> 00:20:41,333
I know you bought a few.

280
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:44,333
How about just buying this place for the whole family?

281
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:48,867
My brother must have saved quite a bit of money over the years.

282
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:52,733
Don't you know where he spent all the money he earned?

283
00:20:54,533 --> 00:20:57,067
Tell the women with whom he had an affair

284
00:20:57,067 --> 00:21:00,833
to buy all the empty spaces next to Prosecutor Choi.

285
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,967
And ask for your own space, too.

286
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:08,500
We'll go.

287
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,050
Relax.

288
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:31,800
She's the type of person who's too tiring to live with.

289
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,533
Isn't she?

290
00:21:33,533 --> 00:21:35,300
No, she's not.

291
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,733
Young Won,

292
00:21:36,733 --> 00:21:40,833
my brother cared for you a lot.

293
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:44,067
He cared for you so much.

294
00:21:44,067 --> 00:21:48,367
By the way, have you heard about the novel?

295
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:50,633
What novel?

296
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:52,967
You don't know about it.

297
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:56,400
My son said that there's a rumor on the internet

298
00:21:56,433 --> 00:21:59,633
that your mother-in-law killed him.

299
00:21:59,633 --> 00:22:02,767
It's exactly like her novel.

300
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,500
You know that? She is not an ordinary person.

301
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,467
Be careful.

302
00:22:11,467 --> 00:22:15,033
There might be a novel about killing a daughter-in-law!

303
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:17,033
Oh my.

304
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:21,567
I'm not joking.

305
00:22:21,567 --> 00:22:25,067
Don't regret it and look for it carefully.

306
00:22:25,067 --> 00:22:27,333
- I'll go. 
 - Bye.

307
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,367
Ra Kyung, I'll go now.

308
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:45,867
 Did you get the analysis file? 

309
00:22:45,867 --> 00:22:49,533
Oh right! I'll take it!

310
00:23:28,467 --> 00:23:31,100
Come here.

311
00:23:37,033 --> 00:23:39,867
You're good at drawing.

312
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:45,333
Why aren't you here holding hands with your mom?

313
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:48,500
I was trying to draw them holding hands.

314
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,667
It's weird.

315
00:23:50,667 --> 00:23:52,367
But, Ga Young,

316
00:23:52,367 --> 00:23:56,567
your mom's nails here look like the devil's nails.

317
00:23:57,633 --> 00:24:02,533
Do you know what the biggest fear of children

318
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:05,300
Ga Young's age right now is?

319
00:24:06,433 --> 00:24:11,333
They are afraid

320
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:16,767
of hurting their mother and losing her love.

321
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,267
So, even if their parents let go of their hands,

322
00:24:21,267 --> 00:24:23,567
children quickly grab them again.

323
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:30,467
The child's forgiveness saves the adult from guilt.

324
00:25:28,467 --> 00:25:30,633
   

325
00:26:20,267 --> 00:26:22,300
Can you tell me where it was sent?

326
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,367
Since we only act as intermediaries,

327
00:26:24,367 --> 00:26:27,667
it's difficult to confirm the exact sender's information.

328
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:29,267
Even if the sender's information is missing,

329
00:26:29,267 --> 00:26:31,367
if the recipient's address is correct,

330
00:26:31,367 --> 00:26:33,300
we have no choice but to ship it.

331
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,900
Oh… I see.

332
00:26:38,967 --> 00:26:41,000
Hold on!

333
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,300
Can you tell?

334
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,567
Are you Dr. Noh Young Won?

335
00:26:49,433 --> 00:26:52,533
I think you're Dr. Noh Young Won.

336
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:58,467
 Can I meet you for a moment? 

337
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,467
You must have been surprised,

338
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:17,933
but I was actually quite surprised, too.

339
00:27:17,933 --> 00:27:20,933
He wasn't like that before.

340
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:22,933
Of course, there are some students

341
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:26,633
who give up after taking the test. Because of the pressure.

342
00:27:26,633 --> 00:27:31,200
- But Do Hyun… 
 - He left during the exam and never came back?

343
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,600
He didn't come back that day.

344
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,133
But what worries me more is that the next day,

345
00:27:36,133 --> 00:27:39,933
he comes back as if nothing happened.

346
00:27:39,933 --> 00:27:45,000
I'm worried about what this is.

347
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:28,067
You've been waiting a long time.

348
00:28:28,067 --> 00:28:30,000
No, I haven't.

349
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,333
First, fill your stomach with warmth.

350
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:34,967
I…

351
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:39,500
I came here for a favor.

352
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,267
I was waiting.

353
00:28:44,067 --> 00:28:48,233
I think I need to organize things first.

354
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:57,167
Son,

355
00:28:57,167 --> 00:28:59,767
can I ask why you did that?

356
00:29:00,267 --> 00:29:03,767
I think you had your reasons.

357
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:06,467
I'm not scolding you.

358
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:10,433
I want to find a reason together.

359
00:29:13,733 --> 00:29:15,700
All right.

360
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,733
Talk to me later.

361
00:29:17,733 --> 00:29:20,467
I believe that there is a reason

362
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:23,333
behind every decision my son makes.

363
00:29:24,033 --> 00:29:25,867
You know that as long as you can

364
00:29:25,867 --> 00:29:28,233
take responsibility for that decision,

365
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:31,500
I'm on your side no matter what.

366
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,233
You know that?

367
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:51,800
I'm back.

368
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,333
Dr. Noh? Come here.

369
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:55,900
Yes.

370
00:29:57,567 --> 00:29:59,333
You're back? Where's Do Hyun?

371
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:01,233
I think he's tired.

372
00:30:05,867 --> 00:30:09,300
Dr. Noh. I heard you've met Tae Oh.

373
00:30:11,533 --> 00:30:12,967
Yes.

374
00:30:13,667 --> 00:30:16,000
Hello, Dr. Noh.

375
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:21,900
He asked me to go home and have dinner.

376
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,400
Dr. Noh.

377
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,367
Tae Oh is very smart guy.

378
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:30,567
He is a passionate young man who loves George Orwell's novels.

379
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:32,833
Honey, is Do Hyun fine?

380
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:34,800
Yes, he's fine.

381
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,933
Why? What happened to our grandson?

382
00:30:38,933 --> 00:30:42,700
Well… I guess he's a little stressed out because of math.

383
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,933
If it's okay, can I meet him for a bit?

384
00:30:46,933 --> 00:30:49,067
And also I'd like to say hello.

385
00:30:49,067 --> 00:30:51,500
Oh yeah, that would be great!

386
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,633
I heard you also won the Math Olympiad?

387
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:56,733
- Yes. 
 - It's okay, right?

388
00:30:56,733 --> 00:30:58,000
Yes.

389
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,167
I'll be back soon.

390
00:31:17,467 --> 00:31:21,767
It would be good for him to say hello to my family.

391
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:24,933
It's good for Do Hyun to go to college and to have him

392
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:28,767
by his side like an elder brother.

393
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:32,000
I know you like people.

394
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,367
I'm worried about letting strangers into my house.

395
00:31:34,367 --> 00:31:36,300
You don't have to worry.

396
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,767
Do Hyun also seems to follow him well.

397
00:31:38,767 --> 00:31:40,933
So,

398
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:45,633
how about asking him to tutor Do Hyun in math?

399
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:47,767
By the way.

400
00:31:47,767 --> 00:31:50,600
You said he's the son of your senior, right?

401
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,600
Yes.

402
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,733
Why don't I know that senior?

403
00:31:53,733 --> 00:31:55,833
Oh yeah?

404
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:57,000
No way.

405
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,500
Don't lie to me.

406
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,200
Do Hyun seems to be hiding something.

407
00:32:02,633 --> 00:32:05,567
You guys are annoying me these days.

408
00:32:05,567 --> 00:32:09,200
How can we fool you?

409
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,833
It's okay.

410
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:14,567
 Good, that's good! 

411
00:32:14,567 --> 00:32:16,167
Follow me.

412
00:32:17,633 --> 00:32:19,333
Come on.

413
00:32:24,733 --> 00:32:27,767
It looks like they're already close.

414
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,733
Practice is important.

415
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,833
When we throw this ball,

416
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:41,067
it draws a parabola. Right?

417
00:32:41,067 --> 00:32:44,600
So, what do you think you need to do to get the direction

418
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,533
and speed you want?

419
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:48,300
Give force in the direction I want?

420
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,967
You know it well.

421
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:52,467
It's the same with baseball and math.

422
00:32:52,467 --> 00:32:53,700
- Let's try again. 
 - Yes.

423
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,500
It's not difficult.

424
00:32:56,633 --> 00:32:58,167
In the direction I want.

425
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:00,267
Same as math.

426
00:33:04,633 --> 00:33:06,367
It's okay, it's okay.

427
00:33:06,367 --> 00:33:08,533
It's okay, it's okay.

428
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:14,500
Mister.

429
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,800
Why baseball suddenly?

430
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,400
Oh, he's Tae Oh.

431
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,700
Hello, I'm Moon Tae Oh.

432
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,600
I'm Ahn Yo Seop.

433
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,333
- Let's do it again! 
 - There's no ball!

434
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:31,433
You like playing catch?

435
00:33:37,733 --> 00:33:39,500
Shall we try again?

436
00:33:41,867 --> 00:33:44,033
Now, slowly.

437
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,100
The reservation holder is waiting.

438
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,933
It's Lee Se Na.

439
00:34:04,733 --> 00:34:07,267
Were you surprised that day?

440
00:34:07,267 --> 00:34:10,267
Yes, a little bit.

441
00:34:10,267 --> 00:34:12,167
Me too.

442
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,833
When you first came here,

443
00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:19,333
didn't you know it was my father-in-law?

444
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:22,433
Does that matter to you?

445
00:34:23,567 --> 00:34:26,667
It's true that I came here to seek counseling as a patient.

446
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:29,533
I still have to ask.

447
00:34:29,533 --> 00:34:32,500
What was your relationship with him?

448
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,633
I thank him, and

449
00:34:46,633 --> 00:34:48,633
I am grateful to him.

450
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,400
It's still like this.

451
00:34:57,367 --> 00:34:59,900
I'd better stop talking.

452
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:03,700
That's why I'm telling you.

453
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:08,067
I don't think we can rule out personal feelings.

454
00:35:08,067 --> 00:35:11,633
So, I'll introduce you to another doctor.

455
00:35:11,633 --> 00:35:13,367
No!

456
00:35:13,967 --> 00:35:16,367
He's dead anyway!

457
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:23,033
I just want to get some advice from you.

458
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:41,100
Are they happy?

459
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:46,967
What are you doing now?

460
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,633
Sorry.

461
00:35:49,633 --> 00:35:52,967
I just wonder if everyone is happy.

462
00:35:52,967 --> 00:35:55,533
Life is short,

463
00:35:55,533 --> 00:35:58,433
but it would be so sad to live without knowing that.

464
00:35:58,433 --> 00:36:03,167
Do you think my family doesn't look happy?

465
00:36:03,167 --> 00:36:06,067
What do you think?

466
00:36:06,767 --> 00:36:09,100
Are you happy?

467
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,567
The person who came to receive counseling is you.

468
00:36:11,567 --> 00:36:14,200
If you came here for the purpose of provoking me,

469
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,733
I will refuse.

470
00:36:15,733 --> 00:36:18,033
You said that last time, right?

471
00:36:18,033 --> 00:36:21,667
It's not like you have to know everything just because you're family.

472
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:24,933
Is that really true?

473
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:30,300
Are human beings truly capable of forgiving

474
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:34,967
and understanding in the name of family,

475
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,367
even if they know the truth?

476
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:48,400
Oh, right.

477
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,900
Isn't that really creepy?

478
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,167
Prosecutor Choi's death is

479
00:36:57,167 --> 00:37:01,567
exactly the same as in Hong Sa Gang's novel!

480
00:37:39,267 --> 00:37:41,467
   

481
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,000
Doctor.

482
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:58,267
I'm here.

483
00:37:59,067 --> 00:38:02,867
Please give me the coffee ratio of two to one.

484
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,800
My brother used to nag me not to eat sweets, but your father-in-law was very strict

485
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,900
about his health, wasn't he?

486
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,833
Then what's the use? He died so absurdly.

487
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:27,467
Your mother-in-law's family is rich, so they have a lot of wealth.

488
00:38:27,467 --> 00:38:31,433
It was my brother who made this much money.

489
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:35,300
He had a lot of connections in politics and business.

490
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,133
But since he died,

491
00:38:37,133 --> 00:38:41,567
it's said one man sows and another man reaps.

492
00:38:41,567 --> 00:38:45,467
Aunt, is that what you came to say?

493
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:53,767
   

494
00:38:53,767 --> 00:38:57,633
Do you think it really happened like in the novel?

495
00:38:58,367 --> 00:39:02,867
But it's a freaking coincidence.

496
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:06,167
If you look at her character there,

497
00:39:06,167 --> 00:39:09,667
it makes sense to say that she killed my brother.

498
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:12,967
Your mother-in-law hated my brother a lot.

499
00:39:12,967 --> 00:39:15,933
A brother who cheated on her his whole life is a problem,

500
00:39:15,933 --> 00:39:17,733
but how can a man be affectionate

501
00:39:17,733 --> 00:39:21,300
when she ignores people like that?

502
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,567
You know, your mother-in-law

503
00:39:24,567 --> 00:39:29,800
has this strange, dismissive way of looking at people.

504
00:39:32,533 --> 00:39:34,733
   

505
00:39:34,733 --> 00:39:36,667
 Isn't that really creepy? 

506
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:39,333
 Prosecutor Choi's death is 

507
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:43,600
 exactly the same as in Hong Sa Gang's novel! 

508
00:39:44,867 --> 00:39:48,467
At that time, I was a fan of Hong Sa Gang.

509
00:39:48,467 --> 00:39:51,033
No one knows what will happen

510
00:39:51,033 --> 00:39:54,367
in human relationships.

511
00:39:54,367 --> 00:39:57,367
- Don't worry, Young Won. 
 - Why?

512
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:02,000
I looked it up and there was no story about you and me.

513
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,700
There was no such thing as a daughter-in-law dying or a sister-in-law dying.

514
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,933
Oh, Aunt.

515
00:40:08,933 --> 00:40:11,267
What? I read it again.

516
00:40:11,267 --> 00:40:14,133
I wonder if there is such a thing.

517
00:40:15,533 --> 00:40:17,433
However,

518
00:40:17,433 --> 00:40:20,233
you know what's more surprising?

519
00:40:20,233 --> 00:40:21,567
What is it?

520
00:40:21,567 --> 00:40:25,267
In this book, the sister-in-law...

521
00:40:26,533 --> 00:40:31,100
also hates the female protagonist so much.

522
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,967
- Aunt. 
 - Yes.

523
00:40:37,967 --> 00:40:40,033
Can I read this book?

524
00:40:40,033 --> 00:40:41,433
Yes!

525
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,600
   

526
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,100
 This morning, former Prosecutor General Choi 

527
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:54,667
 was found dead at the foot of the Mountain trail. 

528
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:57,267
 It is reported that Mr. Choi, who went out hiking with his dog 

529
00:40:57,267 --> 00:41:00,667
 died after being hit by a rock that suddenly fell during the walk. 

530
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,367
 Police are investigating 

531
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:04,800
 the cause of the accident, which they believe 

532
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,500
 was caused by rocks falling from the weakened ground 

533
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,933
 on the hiking trail due to recent rain. 

534
00:41:09,933 --> 00:41:12,300
 Questions are being raised as to whether 

535
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,433
 the rockfall accident can be simply determined as an accident 

536
00:41:15,433 --> 00:41:17,133
 caused by a natural disaster. 

537
00:41:17,133 --> 00:41:18,767
 It was revealed that the ground 

538
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:22,200
 at the time was not high enough to cause a rockfall accident, 

539
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:26,433
 and they're considering other possibilities for the cause of his death… 

540
00:41:34,933 --> 00:41:36,967
I wonder if it's possible to conclude

541
00:41:36,967 --> 00:41:42,067
that a rockfall death is an accidental death caused by a natural disaster.

542
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,967
Even though he's been to the mountains a lot,

543
00:41:44,967 --> 00:41:47,700
it's still hard for me to accept it.

544
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,200
Why didn't you perform an autopsy?

545
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,400
An autopsy?

546
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,300
I don't know why you are raising such questions now.

547
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:59,033
We clearly recommended that an autopsy be performed

548
00:41:59,033 --> 00:42:01,133
even in cases of natural disasters.

549
00:42:01,133 --> 00:42:03,767
It was your family who rejected it.

550
00:42:03,767 --> 00:42:06,200
They refused an autopsy?

551
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,700
Who did that?

552
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,533
Just a moment.

553
00:42:22,133 --> 00:42:24,067
Take a look here.

554
00:42:26,767 --> 00:42:28,700
    
 Signed by Hong Sa Gang.

555
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:32,267
    
 Is she Choi Goh Myeon's wife?

556
00:42:44,933 --> 00:42:47,300
 The mountain he had been running on for decades 

557
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:52,367
 seemed like a flat carpet to him, 

558
00:42:52,367 --> 00:42:55,467
 but did he slip in the rain that fell all morning? 

559
00:42:55,467 --> 00:42:58,000
 Did he misstep? 

560
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,433
 What was wrong? 

561
00:43:00,433 --> 00:43:03,600
 His body slid down. 

562
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:07,933
 No, life doesn't end like this. 

563
00:43:07,933 --> 00:43:11,333
 He was confident that it was his job to cut it off. 

564
00:43:11,333 --> 00:43:15,500
 Was there someone who laughed at that arrogance? 

565
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,967
 A heavy stone hit him in the head. 

566
00:43:22,067 --> 00:43:24,633
 If it was not a rockfall accident, 

567
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:27,000
 someone… 

568
00:43:43,133 --> 00:43:45,933
What are you doing there, Mother?

569
00:43:46,433 --> 00:43:50,100
Can't I even go for a walk on the mountain?

570
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:53,367
Why did you come out from there?

571
00:43:54,733 --> 00:43:57,733
I dropped my lighter.

572
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:03,800
What are you doing here?

573
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,367
    
 Are you… Are you doubting me now?

574
00:44:07,367 --> 00:44:11,767
Are you believing the rumor that I killed that person?

575
00:44:12,533 --> 00:44:15,200
It's true that you hated him.

576
00:44:17,433 --> 00:44:19,033
Even if he was alive,

577
00:44:19,033 --> 00:44:22,067
who wouldn't want to kill him?

578
00:44:22,933 --> 00:44:24,867
But,

579
00:44:25,333 --> 00:44:28,367
why didn't you do an autopsy?

580
00:44:28,367 --> 00:44:32,400
The detectives suggested an autopsy just in case.

581
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:37,233
Sinful human, even if someone killed him,

582
00:44:37,233 --> 00:44:41,167
wouldn't it be better to have him stoned to death?

583
00:45:11,433 --> 00:45:12,833
   

584
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:16,700
   

585
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:23,133
 They say "Murder in a Frame" is identical to the death of a prosecutor. 

586
00:45:23,933 --> 00:45:26,667
 It's an insult to a great work of literature. 

587
00:45:26,667 --> 00:45:30,067
 I'll catch the person who spread the rumor. 

588
00:45:37,733 --> 00:45:40,833
 This bastard is back again. 

589
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:42,667
 This bastard will... 

590
00:45:43,367 --> 00:45:47,033
 be on stage until there's no one like you. 

591
00:45:47,033 --> 00:45:49,533
 What's your deal with her? 

592
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:54,600
 Insulting the author is unforgivable. 

593
00:46:03,767 --> 00:46:05,933
Knock knock.

594
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:13,433
This is the wine that Tae Oh gave me as a gift.

595
00:46:13,433 --> 00:46:15,433
Have a drink.

596
00:46:24,433 --> 00:46:25,467
It's nice.

597
00:46:25,467 --> 00:46:27,333
It's good.

598
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:34,367
Why? What are you worried about?

599
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:47,300
Actually, I got a strange package a while ago.

600
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,733
Package? What is it?

601
00:46:49,733 --> 00:46:53,300
A pigeon doll with its head cut off.

602
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,633
You must have been startled.

603
00:46:55,633 --> 00:46:58,600
Who sent that?

604
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,900
There was no sender.

605
00:47:02,267 --> 00:47:04,233
I guess there are a lot of people

606
00:47:04,233 --> 00:47:07,433
who are jealous because you're doing well.

607
00:47:07,433 --> 00:47:11,000
It seems like they want us to fall.

608
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,633
Right.

609
00:47:12,633 --> 00:47:16,167
Just in case, be careful yourself.

610
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,700
All right.

611
00:47:18,433 --> 00:47:20,633
I will go in. I'm sleepy.

612
00:47:20,633 --> 00:47:23,533
You go to the conference tomorrow?

613
00:47:23,533 --> 00:47:26,333
That conference has been going on for over a year.

614
00:47:26,333 --> 00:47:28,900
How long will it last?

615
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:30,500
I'm not sure.

616
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,967
I'll go to bed now.

617
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,233
 The picture in the frame is complete. 

618
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:10,433
 Can you come pick it up? 

619
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:35,100
Hello.

620
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,067
 Did the filming end well? 

621
00:48:37,067 --> 00:48:39,433
Yeah, did you do what I said?

622
00:48:39,433 --> 00:48:43,633
Yes. We installed a total of five at the entrance and the consultation room.

623
00:48:43,633 --> 00:48:47,167
But why are you installing additional CCTVs?

624
00:48:47,167 --> 00:48:49,900
I'm just supplementing it.

625
00:48:52,433 --> 00:48:55,200
I got a text. See you tomorrow.

626
00:49:00,067 --> 00:49:04,000
   

627
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,100
   

628
00:49:34,767 --> 00:49:39,333
 The customer is unable to answer the phone. You will be connected to voicemail. 

629
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:07,000
There was no conference on plastic surgery.

630
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,600
There wasn't one last year.

631
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,200
   

632
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,400
Thank you.

633
00:50:26,867 --> 00:50:28,233
Hello?

634
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:30,433
The conference took long.

635
00:50:30,433 --> 00:50:32,800
Where is it held?

636
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,100
 Always there, Songdo. 

637
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:39,067
Oh… Is that so?

638
00:50:39,767 --> 00:50:41,900
I'm done and leaving the hall now.

639
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:44,100
I'll call you again.

640
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,067
   

641
00:51:08,867 --> 00:51:12,233
 Is there anything you don't know about me? 

642
00:51:12,233 --> 00:51:14,233
 You go to the conference tomorrow? 

643
00:51:14,233 --> 00:51:17,067
 That conference has been going on for over a year. 

644
00:51:17,067 --> 00:51:19,000
 How long will it last? 

645
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,600
 I'm not sure. 

646
00:51:21,233 --> 00:51:22,967
 I'll go to bed now. 

647
00:51:54,667 --> 00:51:56,967
I'm back.

648
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,300
How was the conference?

649
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:13,033
It's always the same.

650
00:52:13,033 --> 00:52:15,633
I'm particularly tired this week.

651
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,867
Aren't you going in?

652
00:52:19,867 --> 00:52:21,500
Let's go.

653
00:52:57,110 --> 00:52:58,940
   

654
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:04,680
   

655
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:46,690
   

656
00:54:05,067 --> 00:54:08,333
   

657
00:54:10,833 --> 00:54:14,000
 My cell phone was in your car? 

658
00:54:15,933 --> 00:54:19,667
Why is your cell phone in your brother-in-law's car?

659
00:54:20,667 --> 00:54:24,867
 Why is your cell phone in your brother-in-law's car? 

660
00:54:24,867 --> 00:54:26,333
Oh, Young Won…

661
00:54:26,333 --> 00:54:28,133
 Yeah, I asked you just now. 

662
00:54:28,133 --> 00:54:31,833
Why is your cell phone in your brother-in-law's car?

663
00:54:31,833 --> 00:54:33,667
The thing is…

664
00:54:34,233 --> 00:54:37,600
I went there because he bought me food

665
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,867
and I think my phone fell off.

666
00:54:39,867 --> 00:54:41,370
Today?

667
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:43,760
When? Where?

668
00:54:43,767 --> 00:54:46,533
- Are you obsessed with him? 
 - Just tell me everything.

669
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,267
He went to the conference today.

670
00:54:48,267 --> 00:54:50,033
When and where did you meet him?

671
00:54:50,033 --> 00:54:52,067
Did you know everything?

672
00:54:52,067 --> 00:54:55,633
He said you didn't know about the Yangpyeong conference?

673
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,833
Yangpyeong conference?

674
00:54:58,833 --> 00:55:00,567
It's a secret.

675
00:55:01,467 --> 00:55:05,400
 Sis, don't tell him you spoke— 

676
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,500
   

677
00:55:39,133 --> 00:55:43,333
   
   

678
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,900
What are you doing? You scared me.

679
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:33,267
Why? Did you think I ran away?

680
00:56:33,267 --> 00:56:34,733
Yeah.

681
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,367
Honey, you seemed especially tired yesterday.

682
00:56:38,367 --> 00:56:40,833
What was the conference topic?

683
00:56:40,833 --> 00:56:42,533
A restoration technique

684
00:56:42,533 --> 00:56:45,900
using 3D implants for facial asymmetry treatment is being developed.

685
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:48,667
We discussed the characteristics and clinical case

686
00:56:48,667 --> 00:56:51,400
results of 3D-printed implants made of ceramic

687
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,400
and polycaprolactone (PCL) composites.

688
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,100
We…

689
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:58,967
It's what I do, but it's not fun.

690
00:57:00,033 --> 00:57:03,333
You're really cool when you do this.

691
00:57:03,333 --> 00:57:04,567
Honey,

692
00:57:04,567 --> 00:57:10,033
I'm so proud of what we've accomplished so far.

693
00:57:10,467 --> 00:57:12,800
It's all thanks to you.

694
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:14,967
Phone is ringing.

695
00:57:23,467 --> 00:57:25,610
 Yes, Dr. Oh! 

696
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,900
Young Won?

697
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,500
Yeah.

698
00:57:52,267 --> 00:57:54,067
What's wrong?

699
00:57:54,067 --> 00:57:55,833
No, nothing.

700
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,100
We've been together for so long.

701
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:02,500
I can tell just by looking.

702
00:58:03,933 --> 00:58:05,333
What is it?

703
00:58:05,333 --> 00:58:06,833
The package arrived.

704
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:09,600
But the sender isn't written.

705
00:58:14,633 --> 00:58:16,433
Ra Kyung.

706
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,200
You open it.

707
00:58:36,633 --> 00:58:38,600
What's this?

708
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,667
It looks like a miniature?

709
00:59:18,467 --> 00:59:20,600
   

710
00:59:50,033 --> 00:59:53,900
 You and I have similar tastes. It's good. 

711
01:00:01,867 --> 01:00:03,733
 So what do you want to do, Mr. Noh? 

712
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:05,567
 Will you report it to the police? 

713
01:00:05,567 --> 01:00:07,800
 Or will you reveal it to the world? 

714
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,167
 I understand. 

715
01:00:09,167 --> 01:00:10,967
 You want to kill him, right? 

716
01:00:10,967 --> 01:00:12,767
 But, Dr. Noh, 

717
01:00:12,767 --> 01:00:14,567
 he's dead now. Right? 

718
01:00:21,733 --> 01:00:24,167
 It's always the same. 

719
01:00:24,167 --> 01:00:26,900
 I'm particularly tired this week. 

720
01:01:02,833 --> 01:01:06,733
Seojong-myeon 742-3?

721
01:01:27,533 --> 01:01:30,467
 Okay, Jae Jin, look at this carefully. 

722
01:01:30,467 --> 01:01:33,033
 Don't be scared, one, two. 

723
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,500
 You have to take it from your chest. 

724
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:36,733
 Don't be afraid. 

725
01:01:36,733 --> 01:01:38,233
 Here. 

726
01:01:38,233 --> 01:01:41,033
 You can't avoid the ball. Don't avoid it. 

727
01:01:41,033 --> 01:01:44,000
 Just accept it with your chest. 

728
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,290
 With your chest! 

729
01:01:45,290 --> 01:01:46,830
 One more. 

730
01:01:48,867 --> 01:01:50,467
 Look straight at the ball. 

731
01:01:50,467 --> 01:01:52,667
 - Let me see. 
 - Are you okay? 

732
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:54,800
 It's okay, it's okay. 

733
01:01:55,633 --> 01:01:57,967
 I threw the ball gently. 

734
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,267
 It's okay. 

735
01:02:05,967 --> 01:02:09,667
 Do you want to play catch with me? 

736
01:02:15,267 --> 01:02:18,333
 Wow, what's this! 

737
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,767
 - You're doing great. 
 - Good. 

738
01:02:21,767 --> 01:02:24,133
 You're so good at it. 

739
01:02:24,133 --> 01:02:25,867
 Once more. 

740
01:02:26,467 --> 01:02:28,933
 I'm jealous of you. 

741
01:02:28,933 --> 01:02:30,733
 I wish I had a daughter like her. 

742
01:02:30,733 --> 01:02:32,767
 It's not easy. 

743
01:05:13,533 --> 01:05:15,433
Dr. Oh?

744
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:22,533
Dr. Oh!

745
01:05:22,533 --> 01:05:24,967
She didn't die.

746
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:36,533
Mother.

747
01:05:45,033 --> 01:05:48,133
   

748
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:58,300

749
01:06:16,967 --> 01:06:19,400
 She's a witch. Witch. 

750
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,167
 I should have burned this place down then. 

751
01:06:22,167 --> 01:06:24,800
 I don't know what kind of person Jae Jin is. 

752
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,867
 Does that matter now? 

753
01:06:26,867 --> 01:06:29,633
 We've got another problem. 

754
01:06:31,267 --> 01:06:32,800
 And you still don't know? 

755
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:34,667
 We fell into a trap. 

756
01:06:34,667 --> 01:06:36,700
 Then who is that? 

757
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:39,100
 The one who caught us in a trap.
