1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,295
Yes, mom

2
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:06,340
I'm looking at it now

3
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,142
But mom...

4
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,686
Well...

5
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,396
About studying abroad...

6
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:27,527
No

7
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:29,905
Yes, I checked my passport

8
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:32,950
Yes

9
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:39,456
What are you doing?

10
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:42,125
Mom asked me to check something

11
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,879
You seem close with your mom

12
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:47,506
No, not really

13
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,549
What do you mean no?

14
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,176
Even though she's a bit strict

15
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,427
She seems like a really good person

16
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:55,472
She gives you everything you want

17
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,475
What I want?

18
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,103
Yeah, look

19
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,813
In these times of recession

20
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,982
She lets you study what you want

21
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:07,567
Got you this cozy apartment

22
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,861
New laptop, allowance

23
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,279
Isn't she great?

24
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,076
The basic things one should enjoy as a human

25
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,619
To solve them alone

26
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,746
The world is too harsh

27
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,124
Above all else

28
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:24,626
You're lucky to have good parents

29
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:27,838
Do you really think so?

30
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,257
There you go talking from privilege again

31
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:32,217
People I know who've been in Seoul

32
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,681
But they got you a place

33
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,182
So you can focus only on studying

34
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:41,393
How thoughtful they are

35
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,563
Without knowing anything

36
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,356
What?

37
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,191
Without knowing anything

38
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,484
Don't talk like that

39
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,408
Do you know how hard it is to live

40
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:57,826
Wearing and eating what you're told

41
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,661
Since birth?

42
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:06,960
Not being able to do anything

43
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,212
By yourself, what do you know?

44
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,010
Without knowing anything...

45
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,190
One more glass of soju, please

46
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,400
What's this?

47
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,819
What do you mean what?

48
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,328
Where's a grown lady without fear

49
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,287
Not knowing her alcohol limit

50
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,664
Drinking soju like this?

51
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,624
Drink with me

52
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,545
Thank you

53
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,882
You need to learn alcohol properly from the start

54
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,760
If you drink carelessly

55
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,846
You could really end up in trouble

56
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,851
And pretty girls like you

57
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,686
Shouldn't drink alone, day or night

58
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:48,353
Got it?

59
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,409
I need water

60
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,178
Don't laugh

61
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,348
After letting out everything inside

62
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,684
I thought you'd be crying alone somewhere

63
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,812
Didn't expect you to do something this bold

64
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,105
I'm a bit surprised

65
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,404
Aren't you angry?

66
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,281
Me?

67
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,657
No...

68
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,618
I'm the one who provoked you

69
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,827
Why would I be angry?

70
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,706
So did you do it on purpose?

71
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,503
Remember when we first met?

72
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,633
When you transferred to our class in elementary school

73
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:04,846
You haven't changed at all since then

74
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,516
What was I like then?

75
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:15,607
Like a beautiful caged canary

76
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,652
In fifth grade...

77
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,780
When we went to the snack shop instead of academy

78
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,574
Your mom caught us and you got scolded

79
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,868
After that you started avoiding me

80
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,329
Until we met again in middle school

81
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,044
That's when I realized

82
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,506
It was a cage I shouldn't carelessly open

83
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,426
I remember

84
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,221
How is it now?

85
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,391
Is it still warm and nice in there?

86
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,019
It's suffocating

87
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:56,189
But I'm scared to leave

88
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:01,152
If I choose what I want

89
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,779
What if I'm wrong?

90
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,448
Who do I blame if I get hurt?

91
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,409
Do you think like that?

92
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,452
Yes

93
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,471
I'll be by your side

94
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:32,434
If you fail, I'll feel sad and get angry with you

95
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:41,735
Yes?

96
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,239
I don't want to study abroad

97
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,075
Study abroad?

98
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,327
What are you saying?

99
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:51,369
You're going to study abroad?

100
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,919
They keep telling me to study

101
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,713
Their only daughter

102
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,174
Seems like they want me to study until I die of old age

103
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:09,471
Since studying is the only thing I'm good at

104
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:11,890
I just kept doing it because of that

105
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,225
But I really don't want to do it anymore

106
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,562
I don't want to be apart from you either

107
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,565
When and where are you going?

108
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,068
Next week to London

109
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:26,821
They say it rains 300 days out of 365 there

110
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,242
What if I get depressed and die?

111
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,164
What if I face racial discrimination

112
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:39,084
And develop social anxiety?

113
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,470
If you don't want to go, you don't have to

114
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:52,680
It's your freedom

115
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,395
Really?

116
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,576
Let's run away

117
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,370
To a place where there's no one

118
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,287
Really?

119
00:08:17,287 --> 00:08:18,622
Could we do that?

120
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,042
I just need you

121
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:31,386
I'll go anywhere with you

122
00:09:27,524 --> 00:09:29,736
You asked me since when I've liked you, right?

123
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:30,278
Yes

124
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,071
Since I first saw you

125
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,698
Since fifth grade in elementary school

126
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,950
So am I your first love?

127
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,161
Uh... maybe?

128
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,541
Hey, who did you date in elementary school?

129
00:09:43,832 --> 00:09:45,084
I don't know, I don't remember

130
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,169
Ah, I'm hungry!

131
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:46,961
What do you want to eat?

132
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,337
No, don't change the subject

133
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,421
Who did you date?

134
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:50,048
Should we get hamburgers?

135
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,591
No... hey

136
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:52,759
Let's get hamburgers

137
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,885
Who was it?
