1
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,057
What's this, showing up without notice?

2
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:17,976
Since when do we need to give notice?

3
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:19,978
Ah, it's freezing outside

4
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,104
Can I come in?

5
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,399
Don't tell me you ran away from home?

6
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:32,282
Wow

7
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,910
How come your room is so warm?

8
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,955
Do you keep the boiler on all winter?

9
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,500
Wow, figures...

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,877
A rich kid's place is different alright

11
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,964
Are you saying you're gonna live at my place?

12
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:47,464
Yep

13
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,131
How about it?

14
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:49,841
It'll be fun, right?

15
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,635
Hey, Choi Hye-na

16
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,845
I know you're a total P-type but

17
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,764
Isn't this too impulsive?

18
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,478
Did your parents approve?

19
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,813
Of you staying at my place?

20
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:06,400
No, this won't do

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,943
I should call and ask them

22
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,111
Ah!

23
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,196
Don't call

24
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,739
I'm a grown adult, 26 years old

25
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,074
Can't I run away if I want to?

26
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,250
What's wrong now?

27
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,295
Why are you so concerned?

28
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,131
I just got hurt

29
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,592
But how exactly did you get hurt?

30
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,263
There was a tangerine on the ground

31
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,806
I slipped when I stepped on it

32
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:40,100
Then got scratched by a table corner

33
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,018
Happy now?

34
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:45,689
Seriously, always rolling around and getting hurt

35
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,399
You've been like this since you were little

36
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:49,776
Right

37
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:53,280
Do you think I might have attention deficit?

38
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,865
Like adult ADHD or something?

39
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,534
Could be?

40
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,830
Ah, this is comfortable

41
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,623
I could fall asleep right now

42
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,421
You're really shameless

43
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,215
Shouldn't you at least ask if I'm okay with living together?

44
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,301
Like "Is it okay?" Shouldn't you ask that?

45
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,095
Hmm... you're right

46
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,513
Is it okay?

47
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:20,140
No

48
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:24,186
It's not

49
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,563
But you must need me too, right?

50
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,233
I live just fine on my own

51
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,359
Don't need you

52
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,080
Oh, but how did all these dishes pile up?

53
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,414
What's this?

54
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,125
I was just busy, was going to do them tomorrow

55
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,045
Hey, someone living alone can't be like that

56
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,838
You gotta do them right away, every day

57
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,840
Hey, stop it

58
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,966
I'll do them

59
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,344
Forget it, I already did them anyway...

60
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,388
Besides, I like doing this stuff

61
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:11,858
See?

62
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,110
Useful, right?

63
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,613
Don't worry about breakfast either

64
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,448
I'm pretty confident in my cooking

65
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,118
I don't eat breakfast

66
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,287
Then you should start now

67
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,331
It's boring to eat alone

68
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:27,874
What are you on about?

69
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,047
What are you doing?

70
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,716
Your place has hot water, right?

71
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,759
I'm gonna take a shower

72
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,095
Uh... um...

73
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,763
Bathroom's that way

74
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,853
I said bathroom's that way

75
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:49,980
Just kidding!

76
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,860
Oh... seriously

77
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,877
I...

78
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,754
Used to buy and use

79
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,756
The same shampoo as you

80
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:19,551
Really?

81
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:20,886
Yeah

82
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,599
I loved how you smelled

83
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,352
So I decided to go for it

84
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,105
Bought that expensive shampoo but

85
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,482
But what?

86
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:39,821
After a while...

87
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,448
You disappeared

88
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,495
Were you upset about that?

89
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:49,789
Yeah

90
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,667
I was upset

91
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,754
And then I realized

92
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,048
Ah...

93
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:02,219
It's not just about changing shampoo

94
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,348
You and I

95
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:09,184
Live in completely different environments

96
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,319
You...

97
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,864
Always smell nice

98
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,714
You smell nice too

99
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:00,902
Hye-na

100
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,529
Hye-na

101
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:03,780
Hmm?

102
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:04,990
Outside...

103
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,074
Huh?

104
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,034
What?

105
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,497
Who is it?

106
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:16,251
Don't know, probably the guy next door

107
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,627
He gets like this sometimes when he drinks

108
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:18,670
Hmm?

109
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,423
Oh really

110
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,258
What are you trying to do?

111
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,385
We should tell him to stop

112
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,053
No, don't

113
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,764
That guy's huge and scary

114
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:32,434
Don't worry

115
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,019
I'll handle it and come back

116
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,658
Ugh... it's cold

117
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,452
Huh? Why did you come out?

118
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:52,787
Are you okay?

119
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,748
As you can see

120
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,917
He apologized and said he won't do it again

121
00:06:58,877 --> 00:06:59,627
Really?

122
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:01,796
What did you say to him?

123
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,465
Well...

124
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,009
I asked what he was doing in front of someone's house

125
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,302
He took one look at me and said

126
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,595
"You're not the woman who lives here?"

127
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,304
That's what he said

128
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:10,680
And then?

129
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:11,973
So I said

130
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,059
"I'm her older sister

131
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,685
Just got out of prison recently"

132
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,646
"The fresh air feels so nice after so long"

133
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,774
"Want to share a smoke?" That's what I said

134
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:22,901
What?

135
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,362
Then he flinched and asked

136
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,613
"Why were you in prison?"

137
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,032
"Accidentally killed someone

138
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:30,658
It really was an accident

139
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,786
I feel so wronged about it

140
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,038
So I'm a bit angry right now"

141
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,623
After that

142
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:37,999
His face went pale

143
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,627
He kept apologizing and left

144
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,464
Remember?

145
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,007
When I was in the drama club?

146
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,134
That acting practice back then

147
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,719
Finally came in handy

148
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:52,472
Seriously

149
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,849
You always choose to do the weirdest things

150
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,520
An eye for an eye

151
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,522
For a weirdo, even weirder behavior

152
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,023
You know what I mean?

153
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:04,984
Alright

154
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,576
Shall we?

155
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,621
Yeah... I'm sleepy

156
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,957
Let's go to sleep

157
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,296
Hye-na...

158
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:26,965
Yeah?

159
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,884
I grind my teeth...

160
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,514
And I sometimes snore

161
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,143
But I'll try not to today

162
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,230
How can you control teeth grinding while sleeping?

163
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,983
Just go to sleep

164
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,862
You try not to snore too...

165
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:01,958
Ji-yu

166
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,086
Ji-yu

167
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,944
I'll try to hold back too
