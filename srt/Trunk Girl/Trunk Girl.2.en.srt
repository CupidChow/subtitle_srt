1
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,098
No mom, I'm fine

2
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,687
I'm fine

3
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,441
Yes

4
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,152
Yes

5
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,880
Do you have a cold?

6
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,383
Yeah, seems like it

7
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,844
You look really sick

8
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,221
Are you running a fever?

9
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,098
But where are you going?

10
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,641
I'm going to work out

11
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,017
Work out?

12
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,062
If you're sick, you should rest or go to the doctor

13
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,313
Why exercise?

14
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,149
It's my routine

15
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:07,901
After finishing my master's

16
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,945
They said I gained weight from resting too much

17
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,281
Don't worry

18
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,117
I'll feel better after I go

19
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,953
Is that routine also set by your mom?

20
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,540
Hey, am I a kid?

21
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,625
I set it myself

22
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,419
At night, before bed

23
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:26,712
Writing a gratitude journal too?

24
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,256
Yeah

25
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:36,972
You have a fever

26
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:39,891
It's okay, it's just a low fever

27
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,184
No, it's a fever

28
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,395
The house is this warm

29
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:44,646
And you're shivering

30
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:53,864
What happens if you don't go exercise?

31
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,785
Will your mom scold you?

32
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:03,957
I don't know

33
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,837
You've never tried it, have you?

34
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,259
The things your mom tells you to do

35
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,053
You've never not done them, right?

36
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,015
Yeah

37
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,021
If you're sick, you should go to the doctor

38
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,397
Or take medicine

39
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,940
Anyway, no exercise

40
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,657
I'll buy medicine and porridge

41
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,077
You stay in bed like the dead

42
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:40,869
Got it?

43
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,040
No really, I'm fine

44
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,387
All the porridge shops were closed

45
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:00,806
Does it taste okay?

46
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,015
Yeah

47
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:03,725
It's delicious

48
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,519
That's good

49
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,943
Seems like your fever's gone down too

50
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,155
What else is set for you?

51
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,990
Anything you must do?

52
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,700
Or must not do?

53
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:24,955
What else is there?

54
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:26,957
Ah right

55
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,500
You don't drink coffee either

56
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,418
Is that because of your parents too?

57
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,878
Yeah

58
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,922
They say caffeine is bad for your body

59
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,632
They absolutely won't let me drink it

60
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,219
Well, caffeine isn't good for you

61
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,054
And what else?

62
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,724
Is there anything you've always wanted to try?

63
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:46,768
Yeah, that's right

64
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,770
There's something I want to do

65
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:49,896
What?

66
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,232
Buy white sneakers

67
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,025
White sneakers?

68
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,026
Yeah

69
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,613
They say white sneakers get dirty quickly

70
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,823
So they won't let me buy them

71
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:01,741
So until now

72
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,201
I've never worn white sneakers

73
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,370
Right...

74
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,288
Come to think of it

75
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,956
I've never seen you wear white sneakers

76
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,083
White sneakers...

77
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,128
Can't you just buy them and wear them secretly?

78
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,255
Well yeah

79
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,216
But I can't seem to do it

80
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,055
Don't worry too much

81
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,432
I used to

82
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,350
Not even be able to style my hair as I wanted

83
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,935
But now my hair is completely

84
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,478
Done my way

85
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,315
Things are getting better gradually

86
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:35,734
Are you done?

87
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,155
Well, seems like your fever's gone down

88
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,948
Should we go for a light walk?

89
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:43,700
A walk?

90
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:50,540
Wait a minute

91
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,007
Wear these from now on

92
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:00,383
Huh?

93
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,762
We have the same shoe size anyway

94
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,805
Though they're not an expensive brand

95
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:06,890
They're really comfortable

96
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,396
I'm okay

97
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,441
Wearing white sneakers

98
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,984
Nothing's going to happen

99
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,736
If anything happens

100
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,571
I'll switch back with you

101
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,331
Are they mine?

102
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,040
Yeah

103
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,751
I added some syrup to yours

104
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,920
Since you're drinking it, might as well make it taste good

105
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:38,755
Thanks

106
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,134
How is it?

107
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,762
The taste...

108
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:46,972
There isn't any

109
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:47,806
Huh?

110
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,975
Is it too bitter?

111
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:54,062
It's bitter but how should I say it?

112
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,440
I think I might like it?

113
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,566
I think it's okay

114
00:05:59,109 --> 00:05:59,943
Right?

115
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,069
See?

116
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,238
Having caffeine occasionally is fine

117
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,825
Cold? Let's go inside to drink

118
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,965
What's wrong?

119
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,261
I feel anxious

120
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:28,638
Is it because I'm doing things

121
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,141
My parents told me not to do?

122
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,645
Could be

123
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,190
You know what?

124
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:44,821
Fleas can jump 200 times their height

125
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,407
But if you take those fleas

126
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,201
And raise them in a small box

127
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,330
Later when you open the box

128
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,706
They can't jump out

129
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,584
Because they think they can only jump that high

130
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,671
So

131
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,548
You're like a flea

132
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,635
What's that supposed to mean?

133
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,222
I don't know exactly how much

134
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:14,017
Your parents' restrictions mean to you

135
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:15,810
But look

136
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,313
Nothing's happened, right?

137
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,192
Rather, trapped in that frame

138
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,819
You might be missing out on things you like

139
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,074
Actually...

140
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,078
Living the way my parents set for me

141
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,246
Was frustrating but comfortable

142
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,917
Even if I didn't try to get recognition

143
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,627
If I just followed those rules well

144
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,670
They loved me

145
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,674
That's why I'm anxious I guess

146
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:49,844
Wondering if they'll love me like this too...

147
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,559
If I had raised you

148
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,396
I would've eaten you up from head to toe

149
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,236
You're so cute I want to eat you up

150
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,530
So don't try so hard

151
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,365
You're beautiful as you are

152
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,283
Okay?

153
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:14,744
Yeah

154
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,044
Your hands are very chapped

155
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,296
You don't use hand cream?

156
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,301
What's this?

157
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,136
I'll put some on when we get home

158
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,437
What? Is there something on my face...

159
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,100
Hyena

160
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:24,189
Huh?

161
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,274
Look at me

162
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,419
Why did you do that earlier?

163
00:09:51,381 --> 00:09:52,800
Well...

164
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,388
I'm sorry

165
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,558
What are you sorry for?

166
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,354
For doing as I pleased...

167
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,981
For kissing you

168
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:09,901
Also...

169
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,653
Also?

170
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,658
For doing as I pleased...

171
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,118
For falling for you

172
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,509
I'm sorry too

173
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:35,760
Huh?

174
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,513
For falling for you on my own too
