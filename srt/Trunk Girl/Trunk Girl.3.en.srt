1
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,257
What? You're awake?

2
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:11,845
Why are you looking at me like that?

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,097
Is my face puffy?

4
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,934
Yes, like a steamed bun

5
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:18,685
What?

6
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:19,603
Don't look at me

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,818
Do you remember what happened yesterday?

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,237
Yes

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,199
How could I forget?

10
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,034
I didn't even drink

11
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,245
I thought maybe the caffeine got to me

12
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,539
No way...

13
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,255
I never dreamed

14
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:48,757
What?

15
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,551
That you would like me

16
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,596
Hmm...

17
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:55,722
What is it?

18
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,057
Isn't that true?

19
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,519
Actually, it's more than that

20
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,147
You've been by my side since we were young

21
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,025
No matter what I was like

22
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,987
You always liked me and found me pretty

23
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,826
Whenever I felt lonely, I thought

24
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:18,120
If only Hyena were here...

25
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,122
If only I had Hyena

26
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:21,873
Those kinds of thoughts?

27
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,793
I...

28
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:25,919
Right after you graduated

29
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,629
You went into the master's program

30
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,047
You seemed so busy

31
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,216
I deliberately didn't contact you

32
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,302
You were lonely

33
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,855
Now I'll stay right by your side

34
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,620
How's the taste today?

35
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,913
Yes, it's delicious

36
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,248
I knew it!

37
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,542
I added syrup twice more today

38
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,294
You're still such a baby, our Jiyu

39
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:08,920
It's delicious

40
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:11,214
But...

41
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:12,591
Yes?

42
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,552
Since when have you liked me?

43
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,014
Hmm...

44
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:19,890
Who knows?

45
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:20,849
What?

46
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:21,850
Since when?

47
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:23,477
It's a secret

48
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:25,854
Come on

49
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,984
Let's get up in 5 minutes

50
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,320
You're going to work again?

51
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,659
Regular ones are 3...

52
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,536
Sometimes 4 when I fill in

53
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,331
Do you have any days off?

54
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,334
No

55
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,463
Instead of that, should we go on a trip?

56
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,340
A trip?

57
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,007
Yes

58
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,760
How about Japan? It's close by

59
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,470
A hot spring trip

60
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,851
You must have saved quite a bit, right?

61
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,896
I also have savings from my teaching assistant work

62
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,566
Or...

63
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,777
Ah! How about the Philippines?

64
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,739
A trip suddenly is a bit...

65
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,494
No, you could quit some jobs

66
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,538
You can find new ones when we get back

67
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,541
Besides, I don't know when I'll get busy again

68
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:39,803
Father?

69
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,555
Should I answer it?

70
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,058
No

71
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,144
I'll take the call and come back

72
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,270
Keep eating

73
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,348
How many times do I have to say it?

74
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,766
I don't have money

75
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,436
I sent you money last week

76
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:30,937
I told you that would be the last time

77
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,564
I told you clearly

78
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,196
Let me live! Me too!

79
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,449
Why do you think I left home?

80
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,202
Why is everyone so selfish?

81
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,495
Am I an ATM?

82
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,707
Why does everyone treat me like this?

83
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,261
This time is really the last

84
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,176
Hyena

85
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,137
Hyena, wait a moment

86
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,561
Why...

87
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,063
Don't you like it?

88
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,860
I earlier...

89
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,157
I heard your phone call

90
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,330
I'm sorry...

91
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,668
What are you sorry for?

92
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,548
I suggested we go on a trip

93
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,092
Told you to quit your jobs

94
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,846
I don't think I considered your situation

95
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,059
What's my situation?

96
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,812
Well...

97
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,731
Sometimes people...

98
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,234
There are things we should pretend not to see

99
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:47,115
You probably don't understand because everything in your life is happy

100
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:04,924
Hyena

101
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:11,765
I'm sorry...

102
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,308
Huh?

103
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,144
These sneakers...

104
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,854
They're quite expensive

105
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,776
You just don't have white sneakers

106
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,944
Actually, you have all the expensive things

107
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:27,781
Honestly...

108
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,783
Isn't this a privileged complaint?

109
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,368
That's what I thought

110
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,750
It's my inferiority complex...

111
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,168
I know

112
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,297
That's why I hate myself so much

113
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,298
Jiyu

114
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,053
When I'm in front of you...

115
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,222
I feel so small

116
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,059
You who has everything you want

117
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,061
And yet you don't show off

118
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,649
Nor do you look down on others...

119
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,819
I feel jealous of you

120
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,364
I'm so pathetic

121
00:08:17,162 --> 00:08:20,125
I think I made a mistake

122
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,294
What do you mean?

123
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:26,381
I shouldn't have come looking for you

124
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,136
I'll come get my things later

125
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,888
Thank you for everything until now

126
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,807
Hyena

127
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,438
You need me too

128
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:46,109
You came because you needed a place to rest, right?

129
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,865
You can leave whenever you want

130
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,158
But not now

131
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,577
Hyena, please look at me

132
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:09,174
I like you

133
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,814
I need you

134
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,859
And I want to be with you right now
