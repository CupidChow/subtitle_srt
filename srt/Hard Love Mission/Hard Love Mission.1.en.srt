1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,135
(This series is just a fictitious story. It’s not related to
actual people, places, organizations, or real happening.)

2
00:00:56,038 --> 00:00:56,660
He’s

3
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,497
Putter.

4
00:00:57,605 --> 00:01:02,369
The most popular star
that everyone is interested in at this time.

5
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:05,237
Even the new series that he has starred in
are so many that they are scheduled until next year.

6
00:01:05,237 --> 00:01:06,943
Photo shoot for him has been always coming in.

7
00:01:06,943 --> 00:01:08,943
We even talk about his personal life.

8
00:01:09,051 --> 00:01:09,647
Nah!

9
00:01:09,647 --> 00:01:10,534
It’s tough.

10
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,428
But one thing
that’s more difficult to reach to

11
00:01:13,622 --> 00:01:14,122
is

12
00:01:14,122 --> 00:01:15,354
personal interview.

13
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,119
But I got a chance

14
00:01:17,571 --> 00:01:18,629
to interview him,

15
00:01:18,844 --> 00:01:20,507
so here I am.

16
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:23,997
Ohhh!

17
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,607
By the time I got here,

18
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:29,289
I don't know how many times that I slept.

19
00:01:31,082 --> 00:01:31,582
Jeez!

20
00:01:31,582 --> 00:01:33,194
You repeated tired and tired.

21
00:01:33,431 --> 00:01:35,094
You've been sitting all the way here
yet you still feel tired.

22
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:35,896
How about me?

23
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:36,604
I was the one who drove the car.

24
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,427
Almost disabled.

25
00:01:38,664 --> 00:01:40,090
It’s Samed.

26
00:01:42,761 --> 00:01:43,975
Ohhh.

27
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:48,613
What a bad horoscope of us to interview Putter.

28
00:01:49,604 --> 00:01:51,966
I’ve tried to contact him for a month

29
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:53,586
since his new series ended recently.

30
00:01:54,017 --> 00:01:54,553
He will start

31
00:01:54,553 --> 00:01:55,713
shooting the new series again,

32
00:01:55,713 --> 00:01:56,730
yet I haven't interviewed him until now.

33
00:01:57,418 --> 00:01:58,106
Same same.

34
00:01:58,423 --> 00:01:59,434
You know

35
00:01:59,434 --> 00:02:01,216
I called him about ten times

36
00:02:01,216 --> 00:02:03,547
and the answer was still “busy”.

37
00:02:03,547 --> 00:02:04,241
Bla bla.

38
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:05,875
So, when I went to interview,

39
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,875
he said he’s not ready
to talk about his personal matters.

40
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:08,734
I don’t know either.

41
00:02:08,906 --> 00:02:09,483
Well.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,666
But

43
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:12,048
we’re lucky that

44
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,422
I used to work with Putter's manager “Louis”.

45
00:02:14,422 --> 00:02:16,853
So, I know that he came to
photo shoot the outfit at Samed.

46
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:18,013
Luck is coming my way!

47
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:18,513
Otherwise

48
00:02:18,793 --> 00:02:20,198
boss must hit us.

49
00:02:21,334 --> 00:02:21,943
Of course.

50
00:02:25,986 --> 00:02:27,188
See?

51
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,548
Speak of the devil.

52
00:02:31,973 --> 00:02:32,998
Hello Boss.

53
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,034
Haven’t you met Putter yet?

54
00:02:36,978 --> 00:02:38,362
Not yet.

55
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,308
Today there’s a traffic jam

56
00:02:41,308 --> 00:02:43,588
since it’s long holiday.

57
00:02:43,911 --> 00:02:44,411
Well,

58
00:02:44,734 --> 00:02:46,849
but if we see him,

59
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:49,358
we will hurry to meet and interview him.

60
00:02:49,358 --> 00:02:50,845
And we will make it an in-depth interview

61
00:02:50,845 --> 00:02:53,828
and guarantee we'll get super hot info
for our page exclusively, boss.

62
00:02:53,828 --> 00:02:55,744
Don't come bakck unless you get your work done.

63
00:02:55,744 --> 00:02:57,205
I’ve been waiting for a long time.

64
00:02:57,597 --> 00:02:58,700
The sponsor is asking me everyday

65
00:02:59,023 --> 00:03:00,320
and we've already got the money in advance.

66
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:01,186
You know,

67
00:03:01,552 --> 00:03:02,784
if we can’t interview Putter

68
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,901
for his info to post on our page,

69
00:03:04,073 --> 00:03:05,284
I will be discredited.

70
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:08,481
Therefore even if he doesn't want to talk about it,

71
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:10,308
you must try all means to let him talk.

72
00:03:10,308 --> 00:03:11,145
If not,

73
00:03:11,145 --> 00:03:14,186
two of you prepare to resign from your work.

74
00:03:17,395 --> 00:03:18,327
Okay boss

75
00:03:20,953 --> 00:03:21,813
Huhhhh

76
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,122
If he didn’t want to give an interview.

77
00:03:24,122 --> 00:03:25,484
How can I force him huh?

78
00:03:25,656 --> 00:03:26,156
Yeah

79
00:03:26,888 --> 00:03:27,777
I’m on the call…

80
00:03:29,132 --> 00:03:29,632
Anyway

81
00:03:29,632 --> 00:03:31,153
if you don’t want to be fired

82
00:03:31,153 --> 00:03:32,536
just make it happen.

83
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:33,208
Bye

84
00:03:37,731 --> 00:03:39,534
Hurry, get into the room.

85
00:03:39,663 --> 00:03:40,809
I don’t want to be unemployed.

86
00:03:42,029 --> 00:03:42,529
Fine

87
00:03:43,132 --> 00:03:43,904
Prepare your stuff

88
00:03:45,153 --> 00:03:46,572
Did you prepare your camera yet?

89
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:48,682
Help me

90
00:03:59,752 --> 00:04:00,847
Hello Louis

91
00:04:01,515 --> 00:04:02,381
We have arrived

92
00:04:02,747 --> 00:04:05,329
Where can we meet to talk about this work?

93
00:04:05,999 --> 00:04:07,186
You've arrived, Yoshi?

94
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:08,671
Ahh...

95
00:04:08,671 --> 00:04:09,828
I will tell you that…

96
00:04:10,108 --> 00:04:11,448
I didn’t go to Koh Samed.

97
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:14,770
Why?

98
00:04:16,282 --> 00:04:18,590
you say Putter has Photo shoot at Koh Samed.

99
00:04:20,507 --> 00:04:21,236
How can I do now?

100
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:22,320
Where are you?

101
00:04:22,749 --> 00:04:23,784
We’ll be in trouble.

102
00:04:23,784 --> 00:04:24,564
Calm down

103
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,122
Listen till the end.

104
00:04:27,254 --> 00:04:28,386
I didn’t go of course

105
00:04:29,032 --> 00:04:30,379
but Putter went.

106
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:31,596
Then

107
00:04:32,347 --> 00:04:33,507
why didn't you come?

108
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,306
And Putter comes with whom?

109
00:04:35,306 --> 00:04:36,229
I’ll contact to him.

110
00:04:37,034 --> 00:04:38,365
He came alone.

111
00:04:39,635 --> 00:04:40,135
Huh

112
00:04:41,859 --> 00:04:44,677
I can’t go cause I’m busy.

113
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:46,242
So...

114
00:04:46,242 --> 00:04:48,716
Can I mind your help to be his manager?

115
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:51,138
Take care of him for me

116
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,284
I trust you

117
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,219
because you used to work with me.

118
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,801
I just only want to interview him, Louis

119
00:05:01,952 --> 00:05:04,509
I haven’t taken care of an actor for a long time.

120
00:05:05,414 --> 00:05:07,294
I'm afraid I'd do something that makes Putter furious.

121
00:05:07,294 --> 00:05:08,971
And if he doesn't give me an interview

122
00:05:08,971 --> 00:05:10,496
I’m gonna be done for.

123
00:05:11,013 --> 00:05:12,297
About your interview

124
00:05:12,887 --> 00:05:17,821
In fact I give Putter all the titles you wanna talk about him.

125
00:05:18,036 --> 00:05:18,761
He said

126
00:05:18,912 --> 00:05:20,900
you have too many personal questions.

127
00:05:21,395 --> 00:05:23,254
So I didn't promise that Putter

128
00:05:23,534 --> 00:05:25,215
will give you an interview.

129
00:05:25,401 --> 00:05:26,152
but

130
00:05:26,475 --> 00:05:28,475
if you can work for me.

131
00:05:28,755 --> 00:05:30,495
I will try to talk to him

132
00:05:31,507 --> 00:05:32,200
OK?

133
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,699
Okay

134
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:37,534
but

135
00:05:37,857 --> 00:05:39,542
you must help me

136
00:05:40,188 --> 00:05:40,989
I promise

137
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:41,916
Ahh!

138
00:05:42,282 --> 00:05:43,249
In this shoot

139
00:05:43,357 --> 00:05:45,903
he pairs with the heroine of the series
that has just ended.

140
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:47,010
They're a duo

141
00:05:47,785 --> 00:05:49,440
to promote the clothes Brand

142
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,449
and this heroine

143
00:05:50,707 --> 00:05:53,533
has been trying to pursue him
since they were shooting the ended Series.

144
00:05:53,942 --> 00:05:55,268
Anyway, please take a look.

145
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:56,713
Ummm

146
00:05:56,907 --> 00:05:57,816
That’s right.

147
00:05:58,074 --> 00:05:59,866
Putter will arrive soon.

148
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:01,809
I’ll send you a location in LINE.

149
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:03,472
I’ll let him go to you.

150
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:06,121
And as for the schedule in Koh Samed

151
00:06:06,358 --> 00:06:07,612
I will send it to you right away.

152
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:11,101
Come on!

153
00:06:11,984 --> 00:06:14,152
This is a chance to be close to him.

154
00:06:14,453 --> 00:06:16,729
When you two are closer

155
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:20,000
try to ask him bit by bit.

156
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:20,840
That’s it!

157
00:06:21,366 --> 00:06:22,646
You can do it.

158
00:06:22,948 --> 00:06:24,331
Is that easy?

159
00:06:26,894 --> 00:06:28,019
Ready?

160
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,485
Putter arrived

161
00:06:29,485 --> 00:06:31,033
Louis just sent me a location.

162
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:31,942
arrived now?

163
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,550
Cheer up buddy

164
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:01,010
Hello Putter

165
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:02,790
Hi

166
00:07:03,565 --> 00:07:04,464
Louis said

167
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,034
you're gonna be my manager right?

168
00:07:07,982 --> 00:07:08,482
Yes

169
00:07:08,697 --> 00:07:09,692
I’m Yoshi

170
00:07:09,692 --> 00:07:12,274
the one who will be your manager for a while.

171
00:07:12,576 --> 00:07:13,238
Okay

172
00:07:14,408 --> 00:07:15,000
Uhh

173
00:07:15,151 --> 00:07:16,534
can we go to the room now?

174
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:17,987
It’s a long way.

175
00:07:18,245 --> 00:07:19,082
I feel uncomfortable.

176
00:07:19,728 --> 00:07:20,403
Here we go

177
00:07:20,726 --> 00:07:22,066
Where is your accommodation?

178
00:07:23,996 --> 00:07:25,409
I thought you would book it for me.

179
00:07:26,744 --> 00:07:27,382
Aha

180
00:07:27,985 --> 00:07:29,298
I have to book it…

181
00:07:32,313 --> 00:07:33,971
I can stay in the same place as you

182
00:07:34,556 --> 00:07:36,649
It will be convenient if I want something.

183
00:07:38,588 --> 00:07:39,282
Alright

184
00:07:40,122 --> 00:07:41,001
I’ll book it

185
00:07:41,238 --> 00:07:41,959
Another room

186
00:07:42,734 --> 00:07:43,550
Wait a minute

187
00:07:43,744 --> 00:07:44,670
Okay

188
00:07:51,023 --> 00:07:52,026
Hello

189
00:07:52,737 --> 00:07:53,545
Yes

190
00:07:54,905 --> 00:07:56,734
Contact from Amphere.

191
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:58,512
Yes

192
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,288
I want to book another room please.

193
00:08:02,451 --> 00:08:03,167
Yes

194
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:05,721
Beside my room

195
00:08:07,255 --> 00:08:08,014
Okay

196
00:08:08,014 --> 00:08:08,816
We'll be there soon

197
00:08:11,551 --> 00:08:13,171
We'll fetch the keycard

198
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:14,274
Right

199
00:08:14,274 --> 00:08:15,262
Thank you.

200
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:20,464
Well. Finished booking another room.

201
00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:23,316
So, we’ll go to the room.

202
00:08:23,316 --> 00:08:24,161
It’s hot here.

203
00:08:24,441 --> 00:08:24,941
Fine

204
00:08:26,987 --> 00:08:27,514
Uhh...

205
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:28,648
Putter

206
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,061
you forgot your luggage.

207
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,657
Putter, so you live in this room

208
00:08:46,657 --> 00:08:48,426
we live beside

209
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:51,094
If you have anything you want, just call us

210
00:08:51,094 --> 00:08:52,034
Yep

211
00:08:52,336 --> 00:08:53,655
Yoshi sleeps with me right?

212
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:54,770
Uhh

213
00:08:55,158 --> 00:08:56,358
Sleep with you?

214
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:00,541
Didn’t Louis tell you?

215
00:09:00,821 --> 00:09:02,355
I never sleep alone.

216
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,759
When I go out for work

217
00:09:04,082 --> 00:09:06,068
I must have someone who sleeps with me every night.

218
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:07,668
Ahh

219
00:09:10,462 --> 00:09:12,484
He didn’t tell me

220
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:18,225
This time can you sleep alone?

221
00:09:18,613 --> 00:09:19,140
No

222
00:09:19,534 --> 00:09:20,785
I’m really scared of ghosts.

223
00:09:21,087 --> 00:09:22,018
That's it.

224
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,134
Hurry.

225
00:09:48,161 --> 00:09:49,060
Oh!

226
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:51,822
Like bad and good luck mixed together.

227
00:09:53,847 --> 00:09:56,142
You’re a man, it must be you

228
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:57,216
Nothing will happen

229
00:09:58,409 --> 00:09:59,602
Hey

230
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,183
You booked a single or a twin bed?

231
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,108
a single bed

232
00:10:05,573 --> 00:10:08,206
Who knows he can’t sleep alone.

233
00:10:12,923 --> 00:10:17,536
like working near each other

234
00:10:17,536 --> 00:10:18,734
something like that

235
00:10:18,734 --> 00:10:19,443
Understand it?

236
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,783
Before you go to sleep

237
00:10:20,783 --> 00:10:23,308
you may ask about 2-3 questions.

238
00:10:24,064 --> 00:10:24,686
Go

239
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,832
take your stuff to another room

240
00:10:27,097 --> 00:10:28,039
Quickly!

241
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,229
uh

242
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:50,158
Why don’t you wear your clothes properly first?

243
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,006
You look sweaty.

244
00:10:53,006 --> 00:10:55,006
go for a shower.

245
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:56,471
Uhhh

246
00:10:56,471 --> 00:10:57,488
ummm

247
00:10:57,488 --> 00:11:00,263
So I'll go for a shower then.

248
00:11:00,263 --> 00:11:04,848
You just wear some clothes before I finish showering.

249
00:11:12,267 --> 00:11:13,434
Uhh

250
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,816
I forgot my luggage

251
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,659
Yoshi

252
00:11:57,659 --> 00:11:59,121
Huh

253
00:11:59,121 --> 00:12:00,654
I think you forgot something

254
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:02,301
What?

255
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,943
You forgot a towel

256
00:12:07,097 --> 00:12:08,085
You’ll come out

257
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:09,719
or let me go inside?

258
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:11,209
Uhh

259
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:13,908
You just pick it and hand me outside the door

260
00:12:13,908 --> 00:12:15,916
I’ll open the door a little and pick it.

261
00:12:16,411 --> 00:12:17,668
Are you sure?

262
00:12:17,668 --> 00:12:19,589
You don’t want me to go inside?

263
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,222
Yoshi

264
00:12:57,407 --> 00:12:57,907
Huh

265
00:12:58,571 --> 00:13:00,426
I think you forgot something

266
00:13:00,918 --> 00:13:01,418
What?

267
00:13:02,663 --> 00:13:03,908
You forgot a towel.

268
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:09,564
You’ll come out or let me go inside.

269
00:13:10,262 --> 00:13:12,782
You just pick it and hand me outside the door

270
00:13:12,782 --> 00:13:15,233
I’ll open the door a little and pick it.

271
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:19,049
Sure? Don’t want me to go inside?

272
00:13:31,971 --> 00:13:36,894
Umm why it’s wet.
Don’t you give me a new one?

273
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:43,547
I wanted to give you a new one.
But the one you pulled, it’s not in my hand

274
00:13:45,614 --> 00:13:53,718
Oh, I’m sorry. I don’t know.
Never mind I’ll use my shirt.

275
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:13,779
Why don’t you go to sleep early.
You said you’re tired.

276
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:19,099
After taking a shower
it feels fresh so I'm not sleepy.

277
00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:23,819
Cute

278
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:28,974
your clothes is cute. I like it.

279
00:14:31,377 --> 00:14:35,793
Seriously?

280
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:39,486
I didn't know the interview thing till this morning,

281
00:14:39,486 --> 00:14:41,486
so I came out hurriedly,

282
00:14:41,486 --> 00:14:45,099
having no time to choose the clothes.

283
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:48,166
You only came for the interview?

284
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:52,333
Louis said you're gonna be my manager.

285
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:56,742
I talked with him about the interview many times.

286
00:14:56,742 --> 00:15:01,707
But you never ever agree to that.
So I came as per his request.

287
00:15:01,707 --> 00:15:03,979
And he said

288
00:15:03,979 --> 00:15:08,813
if I work as your temporary manager.

289
00:15:08,813 --> 00:15:12,339
He will talk to you about this interview.

290
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:17,000
Of course, he’s my manager.

291
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,026
But if there's some work
I don’t really what to do, I won’t.

292
00:15:20,026 --> 00:15:23,379
It's not up to him.

293
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:26,274
Whether giving an interview or not
depends on me.

294
00:15:28,755 --> 00:15:31,236
well

295
00:15:34,173 --> 00:15:36,540
Can I interview you?

296
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,049
I'll ask about normal things. Your family.

297
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:42,049
And how you became an actor.

298
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:44,601
Yeah, and your relationship.

299
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:46,242
If you're okay.

300
00:15:46,242 --> 00:15:49,724
Me and Amphere will find you a comfortable seat.

301
00:15:49,724 --> 00:15:52,979
And record with a camera.
It will take less than an hour.

302
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:02,404
What if I say no, how it would be?

303
00:16:03,316 --> 00:16:05,755
I’ll be fired.

304
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:13,057
Then I’ll let you be my temporary manager.

305
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:16,194
I’ll keep watcing your performance.

306
00:16:16,194 --> 00:16:20,138
If you’re good in take care of me.
I’ll let you do the interview.

307
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,341
If it’s bad. Just try to look for a new work.

308
00:16:26,341 --> 00:16:29,539
Umm but it just takes a few minutes only and…

309
00:16:29,539 --> 00:16:34,788
Now I want some cold americano,
brownie and some cookies.

310
00:16:35,524 --> 00:16:38,055
I’m easy-going and not picky.

311
00:16:38,055 --> 00:16:41,739
I will not take up much of your time putter

312
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:43,511
If you don’t wanna do. Never mind.

313
00:16:50,695 --> 00:16:54,343
Brownie and cold americano right?

314
00:16:54,343 --> 00:16:55,979
Small or bi…

315
00:16:55,979 --> 00:16:58,723
Big one

316
00:17:00,091 --> 00:17:01,378
Yep.

317
00:17:09,304 --> 00:17:09,812
Tan

318
00:17:09,812 --> 00:17:10,312
Yes

319
00:17:10,312 --> 00:17:12,106
Get the camera man ready please.

320
00:17:12,435 --> 00:17:13,346
umm this?

321
00:17:13,346 --> 00:17:13,846
Yes

322
00:17:13,846 --> 00:17:14,346
Okay

323
00:17:20,175 --> 00:17:22,246
That way. Check if it's ready.

324
00:17:28,322 --> 00:17:29,593
Hello Joe

325
00:17:29,593 --> 00:17:30,093
Hi

326
00:17:32,136 --> 00:17:33,099
How’s your day vivi?

327
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:34,625
It’s fine.

328
00:17:34,871 --> 00:17:36,398
Wait a minute. Putter’s coming.

329
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:37,083
Alright.

330
00:17:40,138 --> 00:17:41,386
Hey Putter.

331
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:47,401
Buddy, it’s gonna be too chaotic if I’m here.

332
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:48,789
I'll be waiting in near café.

333
00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:51,339
Huh? Are you leaving me?

334
00:17:51,668 --> 00:17:54,550
Not leaving you. I standby for you right here.

335
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:58,096
If putter lets you interview. Call me soon okay?

336
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:02,785
Okay bye. Concentrate on your work.

337
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:09,743
Hi Joe

338
00:18:09,743 --> 00:18:10,243
Hi Putter

339
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,910
How do you do? Long time no see.

340
00:18:14,588 --> 00:18:15,380
Great.

341
00:18:15,945 --> 00:18:18,502
Aha maybe we’re going for dinner soon.

342
00:18:18,502 --> 00:18:20,830
Sounds good. But reply me in LINE also.

343
00:18:21,637 --> 00:18:23,039
You two were so close.

344
00:18:23,752 --> 00:18:26,744
Absolutely yes. We used to work with each other.

345
00:18:27,729 --> 00:18:30,395
Putter now put some makeup. They’re calling.

346
00:18:30,895 --> 00:18:31,395
OK

347
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:46,112
Vivi

348
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,085
Yes

349
00:18:47,352 --> 00:18:50,522
Can I ask you something?
You want to be more famous, won’t you?

350
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,734
Of course I do. What’s wrong?

351
00:18:55,432 --> 00:18:59,888
I have a plan that will make you more famous.

352
00:19:00,388 --> 00:19:04,625
Wowww Don’t tell me
that famous brand contacted me to photo shoot?

353
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:05,249
Nuh

354
00:19:06,008 --> 00:19:09,684
I saw both of you are so close.

355
00:19:10,272 --> 00:19:13,837
I think if you can spice things up a little.

356
00:19:14,338 --> 00:19:17,919
It’ll be great news and make you more famous   .

357
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:23,744
More importantly, now putter is the most famous actor.

358
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,213
Uhh it will be good?

359
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:33,498
What if someone takes a rather cynical view of me.

360
00:19:34,443 --> 00:19:38,219
The news comes and goes.
No one will care after some time.

361
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:49,579
If you wanna stay long in the show business,
just do as I told you.

362
00:19:52,454 --> 00:19:53,690
Okay but…

363
00:19:55,012 --> 00:19:58,181
Chuuuu that’s it.

364
00:19:58,826 --> 00:20:04,543
The thing you gonna do right now
is to be close to him.

365
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:08,082
The other things are all on me.

366
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:10,082
Uh-huh

367
00:20:17,392 --> 00:20:18,873
Hi putter

368
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:21,219
Hi Li..

369
00:20:21,383 --> 00:20:24,449
Haha remember me? I’m Lip

370
00:20:25,768 --> 00:20:26,379
Hi

371
00:20:27,212 --> 00:20:28,825
Who’s this?

372
00:20:29,325 --> 00:20:33,339
He’s Yoshi, my manager

373
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:38,581
Uh how about Louis? He quit?

374
00:20:39,379 --> 00:20:44,419
Not yet, he’s a bit busy.
Yoshi came to take care of me.

375
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:46,419
Ok

376
00:20:56,398 --> 00:21:01,662
Okay, Smile, smile more. A bit closer

377
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:08,083
Closer, look into each other's eyes, keep looking.

378
00:21:08,432 --> 00:21:09,610
Great

379
00:21:14,338 --> 00:21:17,239
May you take a look for his hairstyle please?

380
00:21:17,506 --> 00:21:18,006
I do it

381
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:25,015
Vivi, you make his hair properly.
It’s gonna cover his eyes.

382
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,712
Okay then.

383
00:21:34,484 --> 00:21:36,848
OK, a bit closer please.

384
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,619
Great That’s great

385
00:21:52,662 --> 00:21:54,767
Show your clothes.

386
00:21:57,056 --> 00:21:59,345
OK great, so cute.

387
00:22:00,427 --> 00:22:01,509
Awesome!

388
00:22:02,932 --> 00:22:04,951
OK That’s it, complete.

389
00:22:04,951 --> 00:22:06,621
Go for relax.

390
00:22:08,184 --> 00:22:09,747
Let’s go for relax. It’s hot

391
00:22:18,618 --> 00:22:21,442
Yoshi, I’m thirsty. Can I have some water?

392
00:22:21,853 --> 00:22:22,353
OK

393
00:22:34,858 --> 00:22:35,862
Thanks

394
00:22:36,957 --> 00:22:38,504
How’s going on? Tired?

395
00:22:40,023 --> 00:22:43,536
Not much but so hot. Want to take a shower.

396
00:22:44,086 --> 00:22:47,265
uh.. be patient. The yacht has almost reached the shore.

397
00:22:57,223 --> 00:22:59,105
are you looking at me?

398
00:23:01,899 --> 00:23:05,185
No just look around.

399
00:23:05,514 --> 00:23:06,014
why ?

400
00:23:06,722 --> 00:23:09,566
I saw that you were looking at me.

401
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:12,098
No

402
00:23:12,427 --> 00:23:13,939
I don't believe you.

403
00:23:14,823 --> 00:23:15,974
No, I didn’t look.

404
00:23:15,974 --> 00:23:16,783
I saw it

405
00:23:21,588 --> 00:23:26,224
See what you have done? I’ll mop it.

406
00:23:27,312 --> 00:23:28,154
Ouch!!!

407
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:31,485
Are you okay? I’m sorry.

408
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,956
Uh I’m alright.

409
00:23:43,217 --> 00:23:44,649
It’s fine.

410
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:48,995
Your cut would be more bleeding.
Stay still. Let me look.

411
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:20,659
I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt you.

412
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,678
It’s okay.

413
00:24:29,517 --> 00:24:32,379
Hey! Can we go now?

414
00:24:48,723 --> 00:24:50,723
Shall we go back to the room first?

415
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:52,107
Get you bandaged.

416
00:24:52,107 --> 00:24:53,532
It’s bleeding.

417
00:24:53,922 --> 00:24:56,044
Never mind. I’ll do it.

418
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,965
Delicious?

419
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:02,568
Of course

420
00:25:02,924 --> 00:25:04,677
If I come here again

421
00:25:04,677 --> 00:25:06,512
I’ll come to this restaurant again.

422
00:25:07,662 --> 00:25:10,010
Maybe we can come together.

423
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:11,887
You treat me then, super star.

424
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:15,099
What a jealousy.

425
00:25:15,243 --> 00:25:17,118
Are you in a relationship?

426
00:25:18,293 --> 00:25:19,468
What are you doing?

427
00:25:20,235 --> 00:25:21,905
Uh, arrange the mattress.

428
00:25:22,192 --> 00:25:24,068
You're lying in bed today

429
00:25:24,212 --> 00:25:25,739
I’m going to sleep on the couch.

430
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,313
what are you doing?
