1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,950
This series is just a fictitious story. It’s not related to actual people, places, organizations, or real happening.

2
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:52,813
Hi

3
00:00:53,288 --> 00:00:57,137
Louis said you're gonna be my manager
aren’t you?

4
00:00:57,137 --> 00:00:58,289
Yoshi will sleep with me, right?

5
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,196
Sleep with you?

6
00:01:05,758 --> 00:01:08,706
Why don’t you wear your clothes properly first?

7
00:01:08,706 --> 00:01:09,733
Cutie

8
00:01:11,996 --> 00:01:12,888
Ouch!!!

9
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:15,313
Are you okay?

10
00:01:15,656 --> 00:01:18,661
Hey! Can we go now?

11
00:01:19,161 --> 00:01:20,900
You alright, buddy?

12
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,900
It's full of blood.

13
00:01:23,496 --> 00:01:24,619
It's fine

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,370
Just got cut by the glass.

15
00:01:28,025 --> 00:01:28,705
Hey!

16
00:01:28,705 --> 00:01:29,792
Are you okay?

17
00:01:30,794 --> 00:01:32,647
Maybe you should bathe the wound first.

18
00:01:32,647 --> 00:01:34,498
Joe, can you come for a while?

19
00:01:34,498 --> 00:01:36,423
I’ll go for looking them first.

20
00:01:36,423 --> 00:01:36,923
OK

21
00:01:36,923 --> 00:01:37,449
Thanks

22
00:01:38,662 --> 00:01:40,455
Shall we go back to the room first

23
00:01:40,455 --> 00:01:42,020
to get you fixed up?

24
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,175
It’s bleeding.

25
00:01:43,175 --> 00:01:44,059
Uh

26
00:01:44,059 --> 00:01:46,021
You take care of Yoshi for me.

27
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:47,811
I’ll get some water

28
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:48,523
Got it

29
00:01:48,523 --> 00:01:49,868
Okay, be well soon.

30
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:50,626
Bye

31
00:01:50,626 --> 00:01:51,254
Thanks

32
00:01:51,254 --> 00:01:52,384
Slowly

33
00:01:53,096 --> 00:01:53,685
Ouch!

34
00:01:54,185 --> 00:01:55,265
You alright?

35
00:01:55,765 --> 00:01:56,265
yes

36
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:26,189
Oh!

37
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:27,536
I’m so sorry for…

38
00:02:27,536 --> 00:02:28,312
Never mind

39
00:02:28,312 --> 00:02:29,132
I didn’t…

40
00:02:41,237 --> 00:02:42,243
Oh wow!

41
00:02:42,243 --> 00:02:43,853
What a big drug box

42
00:02:43,853 --> 00:02:45,219
It’s just a cut

43
00:02:45,562 --> 00:02:47,673
I pick up the biggest one

44
00:02:48,016 --> 00:02:49,146
full is better than empty.

45
00:02:50,676 --> 00:02:52,152
I’ll do it for you

46
00:03:05,575 --> 00:03:07,076
Never mind

47
00:03:07,076 --> 00:03:07,995
I’ll do it

48
00:03:07,995 --> 00:03:08,974
No problem

49
00:03:09,238 --> 00:03:10,706
I made you hurt

50
00:03:10,706 --> 00:03:11,882
I’ll do it

51
00:03:12,304 --> 00:03:13,798
The wound is on your foot

52
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,626
you can’t do it by yourself.

53
00:03:15,626 --> 00:03:16,728
I’ll do it

54
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,690
How it’s going?

55
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:18,967
Huh?

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,773
It’s complete

57
00:04:21,773 --> 00:04:23,101
Does it still hurt?

58
00:04:24,578 --> 00:04:25,487
Ah

59
00:04:25,883 --> 00:04:27,051
not much hurt

60
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,479
just a little cut

61
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:31,013
Don’t you make it be a big problem.

62
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,269
go for shooting

63
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:34,765
The team is waiting.

64
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,955
Only 1 set left on the beach

65
00:04:36,955 --> 00:04:39,334
The shooting will be late
if it is out of light.

66
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:42,153
Ok

67
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:44,508
Are you sure

68
00:04:44,508 --> 00:04:46,287
that you don’t hurt anymore?

69
00:04:48,344 --> 00:04:49,566
not a big deal

70
00:04:50,146 --> 00:04:51,841
don’t mention it

71
00:04:51,841 --> 00:04:52,814
Go

72
00:04:54,853 --> 00:04:55,758
Ok

73
00:05:20,706 --> 00:05:22,037
How do you do?

74
00:05:23,514 --> 00:05:24,772
Water

75
00:05:24,772 --> 00:05:25,696
Thanks

76
00:05:28,075 --> 00:05:29,109
Huhh

77
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:30,340
You’re fine now

78
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:31,586
You did it yourself?

79
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:33,615
You’re insane

80
00:05:33,615 --> 00:05:35,506
you know I'm scared of blood.

81
00:05:36,693 --> 00:05:39,079
He did it for me

82
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:40,710
He went out for shooting already

83
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:42,543
What?

84
00:05:44,336 --> 00:05:47,703
The most popular star doing your cut?

85
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,298
or….

86
00:05:50,298 --> 00:05:51,692
He likes you?

87
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:53,911
What are you talking about?

88
00:05:54,676 --> 00:05:58,231
Don’t forgot that he’s a popular star of the country

89
00:05:58,336 --> 00:06:01,463
I’m just an ordinary office employee

90
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,045
It’s impossible between us.

91
00:06:03,045 --> 00:06:04,246
Umm

92
00:06:04,246 --> 00:06:05,935
You speaking like that

93
00:06:05,935 --> 00:06:07,302
means you thought it over.

94
00:06:07,302 --> 00:06:08,248
Enough

95
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:09,491
never

96
00:06:09,491 --> 00:06:11,887
There, go to take care of him

97
00:06:11,887 --> 00:06:14,100
I want to rest for a while

98
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,312
maybe I’ll be well soon

99
00:06:15,312 --> 00:06:16,533
since it's a small cut.

100
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:20,199
Okay wait here

101
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:20,699
I’ll come again

102
00:07:23,006 --> 00:07:24,284
Just woke up?

103
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:28,724
The shooting team will have a dinner party on 7 PM

104
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:34,728
How about Putter?

105
00:07:34,842 --> 00:07:37,419
There, walking around the beach

106
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:38,903
He maybe will meet you in the restaurant.

107
00:07:39,615 --> 00:07:41,324
Are you coming?

108
00:07:42,168 --> 00:07:47,936
I want to ask you that can you go alone?
I’m tired of lights.

109
00:07:47,936 --> 00:07:49,213
Absolutely

110
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,948
go for a rest

111
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:52,051
Thanks

112
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:52,971
Never mind

113
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:55,642
Helping each other, that's our job.

114
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,195
Bye

115
00:07:57,195 --> 00:07:58,008
I’ll go for a shower

116
00:07:58,008 --> 00:07:58,795
Ah

117
00:08:07,841 --> 00:08:09,621
How are you?

118
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:10,935
Is your wound healed yet?

119
00:08:11,805 --> 00:08:14,099
It’s good

120
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:15,986
when did you come?

121
00:08:15,986 --> 00:08:17,654
Just now

122
00:08:17,654 --> 00:08:20,185
I took a walk on the beach
so I didn’t pick you up.

123
00:08:20,185 --> 00:08:22,185
It’s alright

124
00:08:42,352 --> 00:08:43,117
Putter

125
00:08:43,776 --> 00:08:46,922
when will your new series start shooting?

126
00:08:46,922 --> 00:08:49,108
About next month

127
00:08:49,108 --> 00:08:53,182
But it will start shooting in Taiwan, China
and end in Thailand.

128
00:08:53,472 --> 00:08:57,829
Is it the one series of Chinese Taiwan production
that gives Thai team a fund to make it?

129
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,281
Yes, that’s right

130
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:01,960
I'm totally jealous of you

131
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,653
It seems to be a big production

132
00:09:04,653 --> 00:09:09,079
and will be airing
on the big-streaming platforms of 10 countries.

133
00:09:09,738 --> 00:09:10,720
Wowww

134
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,921
Putter must be more famous

135
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:17,370
He's going to have many fan clubs
from other countries.

136
00:09:17,845 --> 00:09:23,048
Fortunately, the stream
of early series with Vivi is great.

137
00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:26,377
The capitalist of Taiwan, China changed their mind

138
00:09:26,377 --> 00:09:28,997
to choose you instead of another one.

139
00:09:30,395 --> 00:09:31,617
Instead of another one?

140
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,773
Really?

141
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,303
Yes, instead of another one.

142
00:09:38,151 --> 00:09:40,112
Don’t take it seriously.

143
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,312
You’re famous

144
00:09:42,312 --> 00:09:46,357
Good works would come for you, right?

145
00:09:49,891 --> 00:09:51,474
Ah! Dinner time!

146
00:09:55,316 --> 00:09:56,547
Let’s start

147
00:09:57,391 --> 00:09:59,453
Go Yoshi

148
00:10:19,865 --> 00:10:20,793
Delicious?

149
00:10:23,931 --> 00:10:25,000
Of course

150
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,348
If I come here again

151
00:10:27,348 --> 00:10:28,785
I’ll come to this restaurant for sure.

152
00:10:29,603 --> 00:10:32,444
Maybe we can come together

153
00:10:34,606 --> 00:10:36,698
You treat me then, super star.

154
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:49,285
Uh

155
00:10:49,285 --> 00:10:49,851
never mind

156
00:10:49,851 --> 00:10:50,414
I do it.

157
00:10:53,368 --> 00:10:55,978
I’ll go to the restroom with Vivi for a while.

158
00:10:56,478 --> 00:10:57,321
Sure

159
00:10:57,717 --> 00:10:58,605
Me?

160
00:10:58,605 --> 00:10:59,814
Yes, you

161
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,959
Come

162
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,269
We’re going to the rest room, aren’t we?

163
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:22,256
You’re so dumb

164
00:11:22,256 --> 00:11:23,842
Why do we have to go to the rest room huh?

165
00:11:23,842 --> 00:11:27,536
So, have you invited Putter to the room
according to the plan we talked about yet?

166
00:11:29,435 --> 00:11:30,527
Not yet

167
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,174
It's two of his managers

168
00:11:34,174 --> 00:11:36,342
They follow him not far away

169
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,776
If it's not these two

170
00:11:38,776 --> 00:11:41,910
there were other people
who came with him anyway

171
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,595
so I didn't know how to invite him.

172
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,084
You must invite him now

173
00:11:47,084 --> 00:11:49,547
You can't miss a chance like this

174
00:11:49,547 --> 00:11:52,312
we'll make Putter on the news

175
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,086
It's not an easy chance.

176
00:11:54,772 --> 00:11:58,383
But Putter is about to get a job in Taiwan, China

177
00:11:58,383 --> 00:12:00,858
If it has a negative effect on his work

178
00:12:00,858 --> 00:12:02,343
I think he'll be done for.

179
00:12:02,343 --> 00:12:03,891
It's a big job, Lip.

180
00:12:04,656 --> 00:12:06,476
before worrying about others

181
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:07,836
worry about your own life first

182
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:09,692
But…

183
00:12:09,692 --> 00:12:10,739
Enough

184
00:12:10,739 --> 00:12:13,122
Stop talking

185
00:12:13,122 --> 00:12:15,290
What I say is you have to do it

186
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,422
Putter is a man.

187
00:12:17,422 --> 00:12:18,920
He got nothing to lose.

188
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,688
But if you still want to stay in this industry

189
00:12:21,688 --> 00:12:23,294
Go back to the table

190
00:12:23,294 --> 00:12:26,183
Then find an opportunity to invite Putter to your room.

191
00:12:26,183 --> 00:12:27,879
Go

192
00:12:28,354 --> 00:12:30,270
You will come in?

193
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:33,630
I'll be around here for a while

194
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,000
you go first

195
00:12:51,957 --> 00:12:52,932
Well

196
00:12:53,248 --> 00:12:55,000
Do you get any images that can be used?

197
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,469
Nothing has progressed yet

198
00:12:58,469 --> 00:13:01,645
There are only general pictures and original pictures.

199
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,516
But this evening

200
00:13:03,806 --> 00:13:05,176
I saw Putter

201
00:13:05,176 --> 00:13:06,523
hold his manager into his arms

202
00:13:07,182 --> 00:13:08,517
I almost got the picture

203
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,899
but his friend pushed forward and hit me first.

204
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:16,114
After all

205
00:13:16,114 --> 00:13:17,692
it's a pity as well

206
00:13:18,114 --> 00:13:19,619
If we get a clip

207
00:13:19,619 --> 00:13:21,316
to release on social media

208
00:13:21,316 --> 00:13:24,039
that the hottest young star

209
00:13:24,777 --> 00:13:29,539
held the young manager very romanticly

210
00:13:30,607 --> 00:13:33,138
it will be probably a fair amount of current.

211
00:13:33,824 --> 00:13:35,000
But if

212
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,434
Vivi succeeds in bringing Putter to her room

213
00:13:37,434 --> 00:13:39,982
You just take important shots

214
00:13:40,483 --> 00:13:42,751
People who saw him would think

215
00:13:42,751 --> 00:13:46,219
that he was caught in the bed with an actress.

216
00:13:46,219 --> 00:13:48,445
This could only be scandalous news.

217
00:13:49,236 --> 00:13:50,524
Alright

218
00:13:53,873 --> 00:13:55,613
Be patient

219
00:13:55,613 --> 00:13:57,758
anyway try to take a picture

220
00:13:58,496 --> 00:13:59,709
Now

221
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:02,553
if Putter had any bad news

222
00:14:02,553 --> 00:14:05,740
The organizer in Taiwan, China might change his mind

223
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,329
then come back and choose you to play again.

224
00:14:09,226 --> 00:14:11,364
it hurts

225
00:14:11,364 --> 00:14:13,374
He actually chose me first

226
00:14:15,196 --> 00:14:16,385
Well

227
00:14:16,385 --> 00:14:17,681
just choosing

228
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:20,623
but not signing a contract is useless anyway

229
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:23,421
Now it's up to you

230
00:14:23,421 --> 00:14:24,787
Don't make it another mistake

231
00:14:26,294 --> 00:14:27,801
In fact

232
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:29,112
apart from the scandal

233
00:14:29,112 --> 00:14:35,369
There are other ways to prevent Putter from performing

234
00:14:37,136 --> 00:14:38,627
Like injured

235
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,164
unable to perform

236
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,977
They will come back and choose me.

237
00:14:43,977 --> 00:14:44,727
Hey

238
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,223
Don't do anything crazy

239
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:50,487
I'm just speaking it

240
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:53,933
in case tonight fails

241
00:14:56,992 --> 00:14:58,565
I will find another way

242
00:15:00,886 --> 00:15:02,075
Whatever you do

243
00:15:02,075 --> 00:15:03,301
think carefully

244
00:15:03,301 --> 00:15:06,158
don't do anything that is too harsh

245
00:15:06,158 --> 00:15:08,809
Become a rising star in Asia

246
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:11,570
rather than become a rising criminal to prison

247
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,091
I don't take it

248
00:15:13,091 --> 00:15:14,606
it's not immune

249
00:15:15,687 --> 00:15:16,779
Yes

250
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:18,225
I'll be careful

251
00:15:18,225 --> 00:15:20,000
I go back to the restaurant first

252
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,396
It's been a long time since I was out.

253
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,582
Where are you going, Yoshi?

254
00:16:17,551 --> 00:16:19,270
Uh, I'm going to the rest room.

255
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:20,964
Can you walk?

256
00:16:21,274 --> 00:16:22,138
Want my help?

257
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:23,829
That's ok,

258
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:24,450
you stay here.

259
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,347
I can walk.

260
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:31,502
Uh...

261
00:16:32,815 --> 00:16:33,637
Putter.

262
00:16:34,335 --> 00:16:34,874
Yes

263
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:38,995
I want to invite you to the room for a drink.

264
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:40,843
Would that be nice?

265
00:16:43,016 --> 00:16:44,657
Since the end of the shooting last time

266
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,406
we've barely met.

267
00:16:48,613 --> 00:16:51,078
And then I tried to invite you for several times.

268
00:16:51,342 --> 00:16:52,884
You were also busy.

269
00:16:53,401 --> 00:16:55,909
I was really busy shooting

270
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,208
so I didn't go for dinner with you.

271
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:01,305
So, today

272
00:17:01,305 --> 00:17:03,472
you have to go for a drink in my room.

273
00:17:05,408 --> 00:17:08,182
yes, but I have not much time to go

274
00:17:08,182 --> 00:17:10,130
because I have to take care of Yoshi.

275
00:17:10,983 --> 00:17:11,763
Oh

276
00:17:12,694 --> 00:17:13,790
what a jealousy.

277
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,143
Are you in a relationship?

278
00:17:15,505 --> 00:17:16,005
No!

279
00:17:17,376 --> 00:17:18,892
He hurt his foot because of me

280
00:17:18,892 --> 00:17:19,961
so I had to take care of him.

281
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:22,122
Okay

282
00:17:22,381 --> 00:17:24,096
I'm sure it will definitely not be late tonight

283
00:17:24,303 --> 00:17:26,510
so you can go back and shower.

284
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,782
I'll send you the location of my room

285
00:17:29,273 --> 00:17:31,945
It's definitely not far from your place.

286
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:33,956
OK

287
00:17:34,891 --> 00:17:36,602
See you.

288
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:52,461
Let’s go back.

289
00:17:54,504 --> 00:17:55,245
okay

290
00:17:56,745 --> 00:17:57,779
Tonight

291
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:00,020
I have to go for a drink in Vivi's room.

292
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,296
Would you be lonely

293
00:18:02,658 --> 00:18:03,839
would your foot feel hurt

294
00:18:04,641 --> 00:18:05,349
or

295
00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:06,507
would I not go?

296
00:18:06,507 --> 00:18:07,654
You could go to Vivi's room.

297
00:18:10,188 --> 00:18:10,912
that's okay.

298
00:18:13,705 --> 00:18:15,252
And do you want me to go?

299
00:18:18,203 --> 00:18:22,525
You will go or not, it’s none of my business.

300
00:18:23,456 --> 00:18:24,215
So

301
00:18:24,878 --> 00:18:26,450
why don't I want you to go?

302
00:18:28,726 --> 00:18:29,778
Okay

303
00:18:30,462 --> 00:18:31,859
so let's get back to room.

304
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:33,212
I’m going to take a shower.

305
00:18:48,097 --> 00:18:49,367
What are you doing?

306
00:18:49,858 --> 00:18:50,707
Uh

307
00:18:50,707 --> 00:18:51,671
arrange the mattress.

308
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,119
You're lying in bed today

309
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:55,602
and I’m going to sleep on the couch.

310
00:18:56,262 --> 00:18:57,802
You’re lying in bed

311
00:18:57,802 --> 00:18:59,127
I’ll be lying here.

312
00:19:00,342 --> 00:19:01,208
Uh

313
00:19:01,467 --> 00:19:02,182
It's okay.

314
00:19:02,699 --> 00:19:04,337
I hurt my foot

315
00:19:04,596 --> 00:19:06,337
and sleeping in bed is probably inconvenient.

316
00:19:06,337 --> 00:19:07,582
I'm lying on the couch.

317
00:19:07,918 --> 00:19:09,702
You can get ready to go outside.

318
00:19:09,702 --> 00:19:10,823
I'll get sleep.

319
00:19:14,182 --> 00:19:15,377
You hurt your foot

320
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,702
lying here is hard.

321
00:19:18,568 --> 00:19:19,434
You can sleep in bed

322
00:19:19,693 --> 00:19:20,761
I can sleep here.

323
00:19:20,968 --> 00:19:21,468
Uh

324
00:19:21,468 --> 00:19:21,968
it's okay

325
00:19:22,252 --> 00:19:23,473
that's fine

326
00:19:27,921 --> 00:19:28,835
what are you going to do?

327
00:19:29,714 --> 00:19:30,431
Uh

328
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:32,539
uh

329
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:34,548
what are you doing?

330
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:39,962
I said

331
00:19:40,505 --> 00:19:41,962
I could sleep on the couch

332
00:19:44,285 --> 00:19:47,158
I told you too, that you hurt your foot.

333
00:19:47,158 --> 00:19:48,925
It was hard to get up on the couch

334
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:50,182
so lying here then.

335
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:52,491
Uh, but...

336
00:19:54,715 --> 00:19:55,586
You know?

337
00:19:55,845 --> 00:19:56,739
for a stubborn kid

338
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,415
what's going to be his punishment?

339
00:20:07,363 --> 00:20:08,699
If you’re stubborn again

340
00:20:10,018 --> 00:20:11,347
I'm not gonna give you an interview.

341
00:20:17,786 --> 00:20:18,852
I'm going

342
00:20:19,317 --> 00:20:20,477
won’t take a long time.

343
00:20:20,477 --> 00:20:21,391
I’ll be back soon.

344
00:20:43,194 --> 00:20:44,182
Whoa.

345
00:20:44,466 --> 00:20:46,362
I called you all day, but you didn't take it

346
00:20:46,582 --> 00:20:48,168
or read LINE.

347
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,789
Er, blame me for being on a quick errand.

348
00:20:52,754 --> 00:20:54,017
What's an urgent errand?

349
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,716
I saw you with your babe on a trip.

350
00:20:57,052 --> 00:20:58,431
Lip showed me all pics.

351
00:20:58,902 --> 00:21:01,789
That's why this lady really can't be trusted.

352
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:05,163
Told my secret to all.
I'll disclose her behaviour.

353
00:21:05,939 --> 00:21:07,939
Don't involve others into it.

354
00:21:07,939 --> 00:21:09,396
You left me here.

355
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:12,968
I'm going to ask about all the expenses.

356
00:21:13,262 --> 00:21:16,012
I took my personal money
for the accommodation first, Louis.

357
00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:17,671
Er, I’m sorry.

358
00:21:17,904 --> 00:21:19,594
Send me the bills.

359
00:21:19,594 --> 00:21:20,456
I’ll transfer to you

360
00:21:20,456 --> 00:21:23,194
not a big deal.

361
00:21:23,194 --> 00:21:24,806
but where's Putter?

362
00:21:24,806 --> 00:21:25,782
I’d like to speak to him.

363
00:21:25,782 --> 00:21:28,584
Uh, Putter went outside.

364
00:21:28,584 --> 00:21:30,325
Went for a drink in Vivi's room.

365
00:21:30,325 --> 00:21:30,825
What?

366
00:21:31,325 --> 00:21:33,273
Why did you let him go with Vivi?

367
00:21:33,702 --> 00:21:35,779
I told you to be careful with this girl.

368
00:21:36,063 --> 00:21:38,854
You know how many actors were in the news with Vivi.

369
00:21:38,854 --> 00:21:41,604
A lot of people who get photographed are all in the news.

370
00:21:41,604 --> 00:21:44,182
So, what if it affects Putter's job?

371
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:48,708
It's about millions baht of the jobs
that are going to be filmed at the beginning of the month.

372
00:21:49,095 --> 00:21:49,894
Uh

373
00:21:51,191 --> 00:21:53,165
He wants to go out on his own.

374
00:21:53,372 --> 00:21:55,102
How am I going to ban him?

375
00:21:55,464 --> 00:21:57,605
Now you’re his manager, Yoshi.

376
00:21:57,812 --> 00:21:58,959
why can't you?

377
00:21:59,812 --> 00:22:01,006
Oh darn!!!

378
00:22:01,006 --> 00:22:02,644
Hurry up and get Putter back right now.

379
00:22:02,644 --> 00:22:03,661
before anything happens.

380
00:22:03,661 --> 00:22:04,601
Uh, but I’m...

381
00:22:04,601 --> 00:22:06,062
There's nothing about that.

382
00:22:06,062 --> 00:22:07,651
Get Putter back now.

383
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:09,652
Because if there is bad news.

384
00:22:09,652 --> 00:22:13,099
I will hold you accountable for all the damages incurred.

385
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,814
He said these.

386
00:22:16,314 --> 00:22:16,902
Och

387
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:18,980
just walk over and tell Putter to go back to the room.

388
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,182
It's hard?

389
00:22:20,182 --> 00:22:21,096
It’s crazy.

390
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:23,691
going to walk along for no reason?

391
00:22:23,691 --> 00:22:26,570
It's not like mother walks after her child
to eat dinner in the house

392
00:22:27,035 --> 00:22:28,545
So, what are we gonna do?

393
00:22:28,545 --> 00:22:31,010
Going to walk over and tell that Putter

394
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,979
Louis told you to go back to the room.

395
00:22:32,979 --> 00:22:35,806
Because sitting down and talking to Vivi
two by two in the dark

396
00:22:35,806 --> 00:22:36,927
is not good

397
00:22:36,927 --> 00:22:37,622
isn't it?

398
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,111
Oh, you just keep talking.

399
00:22:39,111 --> 00:22:41,344
Can you please find a way for it to look good

400
00:22:41,344 --> 00:22:42,517
a little quicker.

401
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:44,541
Oh

402
00:22:45,188 --> 00:22:46,645
what the freaking nonsense.

403
00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:48,127
This way I'm going to be fired.

404
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:50,182
That way we 're going to be sued for millions.

405
00:22:50,544 --> 00:22:53,035
What kind of karma is my life doing? Heh

406
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:10,522
Uh

407
00:23:12,487 --> 00:23:15,131
why did you change your mind?

408
00:23:16,286 --> 00:23:17,855
Well, I want to see the view too.

409
00:23:18,214 --> 00:23:19,693
So why did you come down so quickly?

410
00:23:19,693 --> 00:23:21,900
Oh, when you sent LINE message to me.

411
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,590
I ordered a drink and waited for you.

412
00:23:28,384 --> 00:23:29,262
thank you

413
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:33,660
How are you doing now Putter?

414
00:23:35,031 --> 00:23:35,946
It's busy,

415
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,661
don’t have time to relax like this.

416
00:23:37,997 --> 00:23:38,497
Oh

417
00:23:38,497 --> 00:23:39,514
And how are you?

418
00:23:39,514 --> 00:23:43,066
Great, but not as many as you.

419
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,308
I see that you’re busy every day.

420
00:23:46,308 --> 00:23:47,325
Still want more work?

421
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:48,196
Oh

422
00:23:48,196 --> 00:23:50,299
if it's about work, I fight!

423
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:52,066
I work really really hard.

424
00:23:55,376 --> 00:23:56,029
Uh

425
00:23:56,365 --> 00:23:57,113
Putter

426
00:23:58,018 --> 00:23:59,902
can you take a photo for me?

427
00:23:59,902 --> 00:24:00,402
OK

428
00:24:00,402 --> 00:24:01,522
It's pretty good right here.

429
00:24:02,182 --> 00:24:02,948
Here

430
00:24:06,781 --> 00:24:07,385
Ready

431
00:24:07,385 --> 00:24:07,885
Yes

432
00:24:11,014 --> 00:24:11,978
Can I borrow your glass.

433
00:24:11,978 --> 00:24:12,478
Yes

434
00:24:19,745 --> 00:24:20,360
Uh...

435
00:24:20,953 --> 00:24:21,546
Putter

436
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,953
can we take a photo together

437
00:24:23,953 --> 00:24:25,742
so we can have it as a souvenir.

438
00:24:37,483 --> 00:24:38,406
just a moment

439
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:42,117
Hello Lip

440
00:24:43,262 --> 00:24:47,502
I'm with Putter now at the bar of the hotel

441
00:24:49,025 --> 00:24:50,027
Right now?

442
00:24:52,596 --> 00:24:53,510
Okay Okay

443
00:24:56,182 --> 00:24:56,897
Putter

444
00:24:57,414 --> 00:25:00,142
Well, Lip forgot her stuff in my room.

445
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,942
It's personal stuff

446
00:25:02,182 --> 00:25:03,690
and I have to go now.

447
00:25:04,155 --> 00:25:05,431
Just a moment.

448
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,927
what's that?

449
00:25:18,961 --> 00:25:20,251
haven't we talked about it?

450
00:25:20,872 --> 00:25:22,582
Why haven't you brought Putter up to the room.

451
00:25:23,978 --> 00:25:24,522
Well

452
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:27,564
Putter wants to chill on the beach.

453
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,653
I don't know what to do.

454
00:25:31,765 --> 00:25:32,435
But...

455
00:25:32,849 --> 00:25:35,418
I'm trying to get as close to Putter as possible.

456
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:37,649
This should probably be enough.

457
00:25:38,321 --> 00:25:39,696
Other than that,

458
00:25:40,343 --> 00:25:43,370
the camera man can't take anything else.

459
00:25:44,477 --> 00:25:45,894
Take a photo.

460
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:48,932
Otherwise. How would I know
the movements of the two of you

461
00:25:49,242 --> 00:25:51,035
where you were, what you both were doing?

462
00:25:52,095 --> 00:25:55,527
Knock some sense into yourself.

463
00:25:55,903 --> 00:25:58,742
Trifles like two people walking on the beach together

464
00:25:58,742 --> 00:26:00,044
taking a photo together

465
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,022
eating together

466
00:26:01,022 --> 00:26:02,182
working together

467
00:26:02,789 --> 00:26:03,396
just like this

468
00:26:03,927 --> 00:26:05,217
how can it be news?

469
00:26:07,217 --> 00:26:07,846
But

470
00:26:08,053 --> 00:26:09,543
I saw other celebrities

471
00:26:09,931 --> 00:26:11,245
just did like this

472
00:26:12,021 --> 00:26:14,323
some are even less than this

473
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:16,323
but I wish it was more than this

474
00:26:17,047 --> 00:26:17,719
got it?

475
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:22,917
Vivi

476
00:26:24,338 --> 00:26:24,983
You

477
00:26:25,862 --> 00:26:28,299
get Putter up in the room.

478
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:31,126
I'll put sleeping pills in a drink

479
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:33,172
When he comes up

480
00:26:33,379 --> 00:26:35,042
you just give him the drink

481
00:26:35,947 --> 00:26:36,920
When he's unconscious

482
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:38,753
drag Putter up to the bed

483
00:26:39,528 --> 00:26:41,182
Remove all his clothes

484
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,944
take the blanket and cover him with it

485
00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:48,910
Then you go up and take a selfie with him.

486
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:51,235
When people see this picture

487
00:26:51,726 --> 00:26:53,105
they would feel

488
00:26:54,036 --> 00:26:58,069
Putter looking alike man lies undressed
in bed with a woman.

489
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,084
But

490
00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:02,007
it's not going to be too serious, is it?

491
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,427
What if it's big news?

492
00:27:05,048 --> 00:27:06,797
It will be really bad for Putter.

493
00:27:08,969 --> 00:27:11,537
- Is it good, Lip?
- You don't have to ask any questions.

494
00:27:12,675 --> 00:27:14,634
You don't have to ask any questions.

495
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:15,134
Huh

496
00:27:19,293 --> 00:27:19,961
Vivi

497
00:27:21,521 --> 00:27:23,081
if I tell you to do something

498
00:27:23,622 --> 00:27:24,422
you must do it

499
00:27:25,948 --> 00:27:27,649
and if you

500
00:27:27,934 --> 00:27:30,632
still want to have a good job.

501
00:27:31,589 --> 00:27:33,848
You don't have to ask too much

502
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:35,901
go for it.

503
00:27:44,823 --> 00:27:45,394
Huh

504
00:27:51,782 --> 00:27:53,145
I’m sorry Putter

505
00:27:53,352 --> 00:27:55,352
it's a very small piece

506
00:27:55,352 --> 00:27:57,481
it took a long time to find.

507
00:27:58,481 --> 00:27:59,481
Never mind

508
00:28:02,283 --> 00:28:02,783
Uh

509
00:28:02,938 --> 00:28:03,929
Putter

510
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,180
I think… it's better to go for a drink at my room

511
00:28:07,775 --> 00:28:12,289
the mosquitoes have bitten all over my body now.

512
00:28:13,194 --> 00:28:15,253
Another day would be better

513
00:28:16,118 --> 00:28:16,673
Well

514
00:28:16,854 --> 00:28:19,405
tomorrow we have to wake up early to take photos

515
00:28:19,595 --> 00:28:20,897
It's not too late now

516
00:28:21,725 --> 00:28:23,686
stay with me for a little while.

517
00:28:23,867 --> 00:28:24,988
Another day is better

518
00:28:30,393 --> 00:28:31,150
Maybe…

519
00:28:31,705 --> 00:28:32,260
You

520
00:28:32,818 --> 00:28:34,720
continue to drink with me
for just one more glass

521
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,823
then I will let you go back to sleep

522
00:28:37,987 --> 00:28:38,997
because after this

523
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:40,960
we won’t meet again.

524
00:28:41,632 --> 00:28:42,482
Please

525
00:28:42,818 --> 00:28:44,638
Putter please

526
00:28:44,897 --> 00:28:45,604
Alright

527
00:28:45,604 --> 00:28:47,992
but just one glass and I'll go back.

528
00:28:48,354 --> 00:28:49,047
Let’s go

529
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:51,905
Putter

530
00:28:52,681 --> 00:28:53,236
Yes

531
00:28:53,624 --> 00:28:54,983
have been finding you for a long time

532
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:55,821
Well

533
00:28:56,054 --> 00:28:57,873
I went to see Yoshi in the room

534
00:28:58,132 --> 00:28:59,098
he’s full of sweat

535
00:28:59,098 --> 00:29:00,374
and complaining that it's cold

536
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:02,058
then his body is hot

537
00:29:02,317 --> 00:29:03,820
I don't know if he’s sick

538
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,174
maybe because of the wound

539
00:29:05,174 --> 00:29:07,303
being on an island like this
I can't do anything right

540
00:29:07,657 --> 00:29:09,258
can you take a look for me Putter?

541
00:29:10,111 --> 00:29:10,718
Ok

542
00:29:11,408 --> 00:29:12,985
Maybe another day

543
00:29:13,942 --> 00:29:14,862
Uh Okay

544
00:29:25,258 --> 00:29:25,967
Hello

545
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:28,255
He’s going to your room

546
00:29:28,772 --> 00:29:29,667
Why so late?

547
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:31,977
I've been lying in bed for half an hour now

548
00:29:31,977 --> 00:29:33,227
It's hot and I gonna die now.

549
00:29:33,227 --> 00:29:35,201
Oh, in the whole island

550
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:38,182
I've found him it's a blessing.

551
00:29:38,182 --> 00:29:39,381
Then don't have to call me anymore.

552
00:29:39,381 --> 00:29:40,243
I will sleep

553
00:29:40,243 --> 00:29:42,682
Let's make it smooth, that's all.

554
00:29:44,342 --> 00:29:45,056
Amphere

555
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:46,522
Amphere

556
00:29:47,246 --> 00:29:48,068
What?

557
00:29:51,611 --> 00:29:52,822
Are you okay?

558
00:29:54,787 --> 00:29:56,875
Well, it's okay

559
00:29:57,884 --> 00:29:59,850
Amphere is probably thinking too much

560
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:00,764
Sorry for that.

561
00:30:04,307 --> 00:30:07,224
Oh, you’re not okay

562
00:30:07,224 --> 00:30:08,577
hot like this.

563
00:30:10,827 --> 00:30:13,309
Why you covered in such a thick blanket?

564
00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:14,182
Isn't it hot?

565
00:30:15,049 --> 00:30:15,916
Take it off

566
00:30:15,916 --> 00:30:16,416
I’ll…

567
00:30:16,416 --> 00:30:18,002
You don't have to

568
00:30:18,002 --> 00:30:19,278
go to rest.

569
00:30:37,614 --> 00:30:38,684
It’s alright

570
00:30:38,684 --> 00:30:40,037
I'll wipe myself

571
00:30:55,077 --> 00:30:57,279
I'm going to wash for you

572
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,967
you will take off clothes

573
00:30:58,967 --> 00:31:00,439
or just wipe it like this?

574
00:31:01,462 --> 00:31:04,942
today we will have a set of sportswear shooting

575
00:31:07,622 --> 00:31:09,044
you wipe by yourself

576
00:31:09,313 --> 00:31:12,813
Please wipe it for me. It's hot.

577
00:31:14,075 --> 00:31:15,445
My word!

578
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,050
What Amphere?

579
00:31:18,507 --> 00:31:21,765
I think there must have been something good last night

580
00:31:21,765 --> 00:31:22,607
How's going on?

581
00:31:22,902 --> 00:31:24,886
There's no evidence to bind it at all

582
00:31:26,444 --> 00:31:27,938
Can I ask you something?

583
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:31,227
When shooting an ATV

584
00:31:31,227 --> 00:31:33,062
Does the speed have to be fast?

585
00:31:36,678 --> 00:31:37,342
be careful Putter!

586
00:31:37,342 --> 00:31:38,183
it's dangerous!

587
00:31:38,183 --> 00:31:39,154
Putter!

588
00:31:39,154 --> 00:31:39,880
Wait
