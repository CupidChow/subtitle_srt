1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,904
This series is just a fictitious story. It’s not related to actual people, places, organizations, or real happening.

2
00:00:51,949 --> 00:00:53,949
When you did it, why weren't you afraid?

3
00:00:53,949 --> 00:00:55,910
You guys should go to jail.

4
00:00:56,285 --> 00:00:59,034
Then you will remember it
and not to do it with other people again.

5
00:00:59,034 --> 00:01:01,034
Please.

6
00:01:01,034 --> 00:01:02,137
Don't tell the police.

7
00:01:02,137 --> 00:01:03,459
Oh!!!

8
00:01:03,459 --> 00:01:04,691
Stop crying.

9
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:05,888
Annoying.

10
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:07,654
Oh no!

11
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,726
You're too kind

12
00:01:11,726 --> 00:01:13,835
You should put them in jail.

13
00:01:13,835 --> 00:01:17,228
If they do this again, we can report them.

14
00:01:17,638 --> 00:01:19,039
Wowwwwwww!

15
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:21,039
So pretty decent guy!

16
00:01:21,806 --> 00:01:22,824
Watch out Putter!

17
00:01:25,929 --> 00:01:26,881
And then

18
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:28,881
Huh???

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,405
Why are you arranging stones like this?

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,960
Want to try?

21
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:38,870
Um

22
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,210
Nah

23
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,057
I don't believe this.

24
00:01:43,753 --> 00:01:45,760
Do you want to do the interview?

25
00:01:46,224 --> 00:01:47,192
Right

26
00:01:47,192 --> 00:01:48,156
You ready?

27
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,022
I go get my stuff first.

28
00:01:55,965 --> 00:01:56,465
OK

29
00:01:57,322 --> 00:01:58,165
Ready?

30
00:01:58,629 --> 00:01:59,449
Yes

31
00:01:59,806 --> 00:02:00,788
Well

32
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,431
I will start the interview.

33
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:05,092
I really want your answer with true feelings

34
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:06,731
like normal talk.

35
00:02:07,338 --> 00:02:08,046
Right

36
00:02:08,046 --> 00:02:08,743
Ready?

37
00:02:08,743 --> 00:02:09,351
Okay

38
00:02:09,637 --> 00:02:10,778
Okay

39
00:02:11,028 --> 00:02:14,444
I want you to tell the story of your childhood

40
00:02:14,444 --> 00:02:16,123
Is there any prospect
of entering the entertainment industry

41
00:02:16,123 --> 00:02:17,142
since childhood?

42
00:02:18,623 --> 00:02:19,769
Ummm

43
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:22,233
My father passed away
when I was a child

44
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,786
I lived with my mom.

45
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:26,498
I was the so-called

46
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:29,479
mama's boy until high school.

47
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:31,991
I left my mom

48
00:02:31,991 --> 00:02:33,991
when I went to university.

49
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:38,841
When I was a child, I didn't have any dreams.

50
00:02:39,947 --> 00:02:42,574
I didn't think much about the future.

51
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,781
Ahhhh

52
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:48,998
Next will be a very important question.

53
00:02:48,998 --> 00:02:50,195
Because

54
00:02:50,195 --> 00:02:52,195
Many fans want to know

55
00:02:52,195 --> 00:02:55,718
To become the hottest star,

56
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:58,575
what did you do to
get into the entertainment industry?

57
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,673
I actually put in a lot of effort.

58
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:05,837
I've cast almost a hundred times.

59
00:03:07,425 --> 00:03:11,502
I made great efforts to
practice both singing and acting

60
00:03:12,448 --> 00:03:14,101
but never got any job.

61
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:19,692
So I thought I was going to do it one last time.

62
00:03:19,692 --> 00:03:21,007
If I didn't get this job

63
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:24,759
I would give up my dream of becoming an actor

64
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,759
and return to work

65
00:03:27,205 --> 00:03:29,559
I was discouraged then

66
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:31,948
Because I love acting so much

67
00:03:33,893 --> 00:03:36,310
but all I got was only disappointment.

68
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:41,744
At that point, I had to stop.

69
00:03:43,118 --> 00:03:46,152
At that time, my mother was already very old.

70
00:03:46,723 --> 00:03:48,085
It was tough for her to work.

71
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,133
The work that I was doing at that time

72
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:54,000
was a part-time job at a restaurant.

73
00:03:54,964 --> 00:03:58,170
My income was low

74
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,792
and it couldn't cover our expenses.

75
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:06,290
So I wanted to try to
concentrate on it one more time.

76
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:08,244
If I really couldn't pass,

77
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:09,994
I'd give up,

78
00:04:09,994 --> 00:04:12,193
return to work in a restaurant

79
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,611
and earn extra income from other places

80
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,794
for my mother.

81
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,240
Uhhh

82
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,800
I want you to tell about

83
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,800
the details of that day.

84
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:30,329
The day I went to the last casting event...

85
00:04:39,895 --> 00:04:40,957
Thank you

86
00:05:15,078 --> 00:05:16,344
Oh I'm sorry.

87
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,264
Is there anything I can help?

88
00:05:26,264 --> 00:05:27,665
I came to cast

89
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:30,303
Where's the room?

90
00:05:30,303 --> 00:05:32,183
The casting was done 15 minutes ago.

91
00:05:32,183 --> 00:05:33,635
Why are you wet?

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,994
when I came in

93
00:05:36,994 --> 00:05:40,029
someone splashed water on me and I got wet.

94
00:05:40,172 --> 00:05:40,672
Well

95
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,331
Can I still go up to the casting?

96
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:44,653
It was done 15 minutes ago.

97
00:05:44,653 --> 00:05:46,661
Come on time next time.

98
00:05:46,661 --> 00:05:48,333
Did you see my glasses?

99
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:50,022
No

100
00:05:50,022 --> 00:05:51,501
Who's this, isn't it over yet?

101
00:05:51,644 --> 00:05:53,453
He was so late.
There's no need to let him try it.

102
00:05:54,238 --> 00:05:55,665
Go get me some glasses.

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,980
Has anyone seen Yoshi's glasses?

104
00:05:59,248 --> 00:06:00,812
Don't be late next time.

105
00:06:00,812 --> 00:06:01,901
The director is still upstairs

106
00:06:01,901 --> 00:06:03,901
you can go up.

107
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:05,269
Really?

108
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:06,000
Yes

109
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,049
Thank you so much.

110
00:06:07,049 --> 00:06:08,983
Why are you so wet?

111
00:06:10,518 --> 00:06:11,383
Here you go

112
00:06:11,383 --> 00:06:13,665
It's not big
but use it to wipe yourself a little first.

113
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:19,022
Today might not be a good day for you

114
00:06:19,022 --> 00:06:21,022
But there must be a day.

115
00:06:21,022 --> 00:06:22,456
Opportunities don't come often.

116
00:06:22,456 --> 00:06:24,277
If there is, hurry and grab it.

117
00:06:24,527 --> 00:06:25,842
Cheer up and be encouraged.

118
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:28,605
Has anyone seen my glasses?

119
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:45,101
Hi, my name's Putter.

120
00:07:32,344 --> 00:07:33,469
So

121
00:07:33,679 --> 00:07:35,251
that person is you.

122
00:07:35,881 --> 00:07:37,096
Yes

123
00:07:37,411 --> 00:07:39,726
I got the job that day because of you.

124
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:41,313
Woww

125
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,780
Why can't I remember you?

126
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:45,270
Ohh

127
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,040
Don't say like that
or I will feel neglected.

128
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,355
I remember you

129
00:07:49,355 --> 00:07:51,355
I never forget.

130
00:07:52,131 --> 00:07:52,907
Well

131
00:07:53,274 --> 00:07:55,773
I resigned from there and did it here instead.

132
00:07:55,773 --> 00:07:56,689
Ah

133
00:07:56,689 --> 00:07:57,381
And

134
00:07:57,976 --> 00:08:00,260
That day I was busy about resigning from work.

135
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,454
And I wasn't wearing glasses

136
00:08:01,454 --> 00:08:02,846
so I can't remember.

137
00:08:02,986 --> 00:08:04,016
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:05,175
Never mind.

139
00:08:06,102 --> 00:08:06,912
But

140
00:08:06,912 --> 00:08:07,647
from now on

141
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,862
Don't forget me.

142
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:12,583
No wonder!

143
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,737
So you worked so well with me

144
00:08:14,737 --> 00:08:16,737
becuase you remember me.

145
00:08:16,737 --> 00:08:17,734
Right

146
00:08:20,411 --> 00:08:21,122
So

147
00:08:21,524 --> 00:08:23,038
Is the interview finished?

148
00:08:23,475 --> 00:08:24,616
Ah

149
00:08:24,616 --> 00:08:26,616
just 1 question left.

150
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:34,520
Are you...

151
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,520
in a relationship?

152
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,911
You've already asked this question.

153
00:08:41,136 --> 00:08:41,984
But

154
00:08:42,631 --> 00:08:44,426
I didn't record it.

155
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,255
Can you answer one more time?

156
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:58,996
I already have the person I like.

157
00:09:00,686 --> 00:09:02,236
He's..

158
00:09:02,236 --> 00:09:03,908
a good hearted person.

159
00:09:04,283 --> 00:09:05,774
He likes to help others

160
00:09:06,124 --> 00:09:08,227
and thinks of others all the time.

161
00:09:09,347 --> 00:09:12,372
He is a person whom I'm very grateful for.

162
00:09:12,372 --> 00:09:15,699
I wouldn't be what I am today without him.

163
00:09:16,644 --> 00:09:19,142
But I haven't seen him for a long time.

164
00:09:19,877 --> 00:09:21,049
Today

165
00:09:21,696 --> 00:09:23,454
I met him one more time.

166
00:09:24,434 --> 00:09:25,760
I will never

167
00:09:26,705 --> 00:09:30,138
let him out of my life again.

168
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:32,696
Can you guess

169
00:09:32,696 --> 00:09:34,976
who that person is?

170
00:09:41,836 --> 00:09:42,492
Yes

171
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:45,430
Now

172
00:09:46,655 --> 00:09:48,865
I have a big problem.

173
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:53,748
I think that only he can help me to solve it.

174
00:09:56,793 --> 00:09:57,603
Yoshi

175
00:09:59,248 --> 00:10:01,745
Louis has now retired.

176
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,614
Can you...

177
00:10:06,451 --> 00:10:08,163
be my personal manager?

178
00:10:12,926 --> 00:10:13,962
So

179
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:16,889
why me?

180
00:10:17,676 --> 00:10:18,309
Well

181
00:10:19,096 --> 00:10:21,034
I don't just want a personal manager.

182
00:10:21,804 --> 00:10:24,612
But I want encouragement from people I like.

183
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:28,283
I want to wake up to see you every day

184
00:10:29,455 --> 00:10:31,283
want to see your smile,

185
00:10:31,283 --> 00:10:32,706
and want to play pranks every day.

186
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,230
We must be very happy.

187
00:10:46,283 --> 00:10:47,589
Here Yoshi

188
00:10:48,376 --> 00:10:49,819
Your stuff

189
00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:51,479
I've been keeping it until this day.

190
00:10:52,721 --> 00:10:53,927
I bring it here.

191
00:10:55,283 --> 00:10:56,477
I hope that

192
00:10:57,614 --> 00:10:58,394
You

193
00:10:59,601 --> 00:11:01,067
will always be by my side.

194
00:11:06,877 --> 00:11:07,557
Yoshi

195
00:11:09,814 --> 00:11:11,378
Can you be my manager?

196
00:12:12,046 --> 00:12:12,546
Uhh

197
00:12:12,546 --> 00:12:13,759
Putter

198
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:15,759
You forgot your luggage.

199
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,820
Koreans people believe that

200
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,786
If we go somewhere and arrange the stones like this

201
00:13:22,486 --> 00:13:24,319
We will return there one more time.

202
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:25,377
Want to try?
