1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,895
This series is just a fictitious story. It’s not related to actual people, places, organizations, or real happening.

2
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:52,950
I'm going to wash for you

3
00:00:53,705 --> 00:00:55,776
you take off the clothes

4
00:00:56,605 --> 00:00:58,050
Uh You don't have to

5
00:00:58,556 --> 00:00:59,320
I'll wipe myself

6
00:01:01,306 --> 00:01:02,444
Where are you going?

7
00:01:03,175 --> 00:01:05,565
Both of us will sleep together in the bed

8
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,166
no one has to sleep on the sofa.

9
00:01:11,248 --> 00:01:12,464
Keep smiling

10
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:15,687
Be joyful

11
00:01:16,395 --> 00:01:17,640
Please wipe it for me

12
00:01:18,051 --> 00:01:19,269
It's hot.

13
00:01:21,356 --> 00:01:22,690
My word!

14
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,670
What is going on

15
00:01:26,305 --> 00:01:27,643
What Amphere?

16
00:01:27,643 --> 00:01:28,205
Hey

17
00:01:28,342 --> 00:01:28,842
Huh?

18
00:01:28,842 --> 00:01:30,689
I think Lip is weird

19
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,520
we're in trouble

20
00:01:32,703 --> 00:01:34,505
Vivi has to stack the ATV with Putter

21
00:01:34,505 --> 00:01:36,505
The one you cut the brake lines

22
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,916
be careful Putter!

23
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,729
Putter!

24
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:43,679
Wait

25
00:01:47,309 --> 00:01:48,281
STOP!

26
00:01:48,806 --> 00:01:50,623
Hey! What's going on?

27
00:01:50,623 --> 00:01:52,235
Don't go in. They started filming

28
00:01:53,365 --> 00:01:55,568
Do not drive, Putter.
The brake is broken

29
00:01:56,527 --> 00:01:57,137
What?

30
00:01:57,594 --> 00:01:59,230
The brake is broken!

31
00:02:00,143 --> 00:02:01,036
What's that?

32
00:02:01,972 --> 00:02:04,448
Nothing. Everything's okay

33
00:02:05,372 --> 00:02:06,296
Ready?

34
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,104
Let's go

35
00:02:27,985 --> 00:02:28,521
Ohhh

36
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,292
Brakes can be used normally, Yoshi.

37
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:41,520
What’s the problem?

38
00:02:42,544 --> 00:02:45,881
Do you know how long it takes
to block a car from passing through?

39
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,243
And now I have to waste my time
to start filming again.

40
00:02:50,594 --> 00:02:52,358
Why do you think the brakes have a problem?

41
00:02:54,093 --> 00:02:55,271
It’s a long story

42
00:02:55,705 --> 00:02:56,261
But I know

43
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:58,175
the ATV has a problem

44
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,093
You're okay now, that's fine.

45
00:03:01,326 --> 00:03:03,160
Anyway, I have to apologize to everyone

46
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,394
for wasting your time

47
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,805
If you say there’s a problem with the brakes

48
00:03:07,805 --> 00:03:08,967
It's probably possible.

49
00:03:08,967 --> 00:03:10,967
But probably not this one.

50
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:12,114
Because

51
00:03:12,274 --> 00:03:14,167
this morning the team brought an ATV for me to test drive.

52
00:03:14,715 --> 00:03:15,697
Its brakes are broken.

53
00:03:16,415 --> 00:03:19,233
But I drove it at the beach
so it was stopped by the sand.

54
00:03:19,735 --> 00:03:20,760
The team changed it for me

55
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,282
Thank God.

56
00:03:25,113 --> 00:03:25,944
Uhh

57
00:03:26,378 --> 00:03:28,643
I have to apologize to everyone one more time

58
00:03:28,734 --> 00:03:29,394
Very sorry

59
00:03:30,924 --> 00:03:32,075
Ok Every body

60
00:03:32,075 --> 00:03:32,915
Reset

61
00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:44,402
I don't think it's possible

62
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:46,897
What would Lip do that for?

63
00:03:48,091 --> 00:03:51,545
But I can really confirm that I saw and heard it.

64
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:56,334
But I never did anything to him

65
00:03:56,928 --> 00:03:59,564
He doesn't have any reason to do this

66
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:02,045
Uh

67
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:02,842
Or

68
00:04:03,495 --> 00:04:06,294
because Lip thinks you took someone's work
in his agency?

69
00:04:07,002 --> 00:04:08,767
I thought it was probably a man

70
00:04:08,767 --> 00:04:11,160
Amphere said that he was always following you.

71
00:04:13,643 --> 00:04:15,111
I'm sure.

72
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:17,986
He might be angry because Putter

73
00:04:17,986 --> 00:04:19,742
will go for filming in Taiwan, China

74
00:04:20,495 --> 00:04:22,200
if Putter is injured

75
00:04:22,314 --> 00:04:24,435
They have to choose other man to perform instead

76
00:04:26,056 --> 00:04:27,829
Or should we call the police right now?

77
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:29,560
I think it's better not

78
00:04:30,793 --> 00:04:32,233
There isn't enough evidence

79
00:04:32,553 --> 00:04:34,758
that Lip is the one who broke the brake cable.

80
00:04:35,587 --> 00:04:37,946
And I'm not a big deal either

81
00:04:39,549 --> 00:04:41,015
it can't be proof

82
00:04:41,768 --> 00:04:43,621
It's like what we just talked about

83
00:04:46,338 --> 00:04:47,396
I think so

84
00:04:47,601 --> 00:04:49,379
If the bad news came up

85
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,898
that's exactly what they want.

86
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:52,240
We will be in trouble

87
00:04:57,993 --> 00:04:58,930
Can we do like this better?

88
00:04:59,797 --> 00:05:00,797
I’ll call Louis

89
00:05:01,505 --> 00:05:03,494
and ask if I had actually taken his job or not

90
00:05:03,768 --> 00:05:04,617
to make it clear.

91
00:05:13,497 --> 00:05:15,000
but I'm sure it must be.

92
00:05:16,803 --> 00:05:17,958
And will he do that?

93
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,328
It's too dangerous.

94
00:05:20,515 --> 00:05:23,138
I saw and heard it

95
00:05:23,138 --> 00:05:25,412
with my own eyes and ears

96
00:05:26,028 --> 00:05:27,024
believe me

97
00:05:27,024 --> 00:05:28,339
My senses don't make a mistake.

98
00:05:30,188 --> 00:05:30,834
Really?

99
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:31,647
Yes

100
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,027
I've talked to Louis

101
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:42,836
He spoke

102
00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:43,912
At that time

103
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,931
No contract was signed

104
00:05:46,857 --> 00:05:47,452
So

105
00:05:47,863 --> 00:05:49,462
he sends my profile to Taiwan, China

106
00:05:50,627 --> 00:05:51,678
and in there

107
00:05:52,249 --> 00:05:54,171
They liked the last series I performed

108
00:05:54,171 --> 00:05:55,675
because there are many people
in Taiwan, China that have watched it.

109
00:05:56,154 --> 00:05:57,378
So, they called me to cast

110
00:05:58,245 --> 00:05:59,217
which means

111
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:03,423
I actually took his job.

112
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:08,247
If Louis had told me first

113
00:06:08,749 --> 00:06:10,114
I probably wouldn't have taken this job.

114
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:14,679
Hey

115
00:06:15,136 --> 00:06:17,136
you didn't take someone's job

116
00:06:17,912 --> 00:06:20,401
They have to choose the best one for their job

117
00:06:20,962 --> 00:06:23,281
And you're the best person for this job

118
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,856
You weren't going to steal someone else's job

119
00:06:26,746 --> 00:06:29,659
You got this job because of your own abilities.

120
00:06:34,453 --> 00:06:35,364
Do you know

121
00:06:37,326 --> 00:06:39,522
You are the one who encourages me the most

122
00:06:40,116 --> 00:06:41,020
thank you

123
00:06:49,238 --> 00:06:50,371
Hello?

124
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:53,063
Have you forgotten that I'm sitting here?

125
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,607
What I gonna do?

126
00:06:54,607 --> 00:06:55,854
Should I go out?

127
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:05,981
So, what will we do next?

128
00:07:07,122 --> 00:07:09,087
Or should we go talk to Lip?

129
00:07:10,252 --> 00:07:11,417
No, I don’t think so

130
00:07:12,121 --> 00:07:13,487
We just wait and keep eyes on Lip

131
00:07:13,784 --> 00:07:16,430
If he does something more, we will collect evidence

132
00:07:16,955 --> 00:07:19,297
now, just be careful.

133
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:23,921
Hi everyone

134
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:25,325
How do you do?

135
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,990
Vivi told me about the ATV problem

136
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:31,995
When I heard, I was really shocked.

137
00:07:31,995 --> 00:07:33,401
I'm very worried about everyone.

138
00:07:34,064 --> 00:07:35,526
Are you alright?

139
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,017
It’s fine

140
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:42,859
They heard that the ATV had a problem,
so they hurried to warn me.

141
00:07:45,276 --> 00:07:45,890
Oh

142
00:07:47,657 --> 00:07:51,775
But how did both of you know that the ATV had a problem?

143
00:07:52,515 --> 00:07:53,643
Oh Because

144
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,685
I was driving an ATV this morning

145
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,627
the brake is broken

146
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:01,835
But luckily, I drove it on the sandy beach

147
00:08:01,835 --> 00:08:03,440
So it can break.

148
00:08:04,165 --> 00:08:08,487
Amphere heard the team talk about the brake problem

149
00:08:08,807 --> 00:08:11,247
She hurried to warn me.

150
00:08:11,987 --> 00:08:13,092
So that’s how it is

151
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:13,843
OMG

152
00:08:15,087 --> 00:08:16,331
Thank God

153
00:08:16,742 --> 00:08:18,514
You're okay, It’s fine

154
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:21,045
I'm very worried about everyone.

155
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:25,200
Then, I'll take my leave now.

156
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:29,652
you can go back to your accommodation

157
00:08:29,652 --> 00:08:31,719
I want to stay for a while.

158
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:32,902
OK

159
00:08:38,198 --> 00:08:41,575
There's still several hours before the evening.

160
00:08:41,986 --> 00:08:45,739
I want to do something fun to save you from boredom.

161
00:08:47,057 --> 00:08:47,850
What is it?

162
00:08:48,786 --> 00:08:49,731
Paddle the Kayak

163
00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:51,704
I saw them over there

164
00:08:51,704 --> 00:08:53,133
that's fun

165
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:54,830
I want some.

166
00:08:55,104 --> 00:08:56,768
Can we go together Putter?

167
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,556
Please

168
00:08:58,761 --> 00:08:59,740
Please Putter

169
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,324
Please

170
00:09:01,324 --> 00:09:02,007
Let’s go

171
00:09:03,057 --> 00:09:03,984
Alright

172
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:08,547
But if it's just us two rowing,
it probably won't be fun.

173
00:09:09,608 --> 00:09:15,280
If you can find two people to paddle with us.

174
00:09:15,851 --> 00:09:16,884
I will go

175
00:09:17,652 --> 00:09:18,420
You two

176
00:09:18,968 --> 00:09:20,342
I can't swim, Vivi.

177
00:09:20,342 --> 00:09:22,662
My feet hurt too, so I shouldn't be able to go in the water.

178
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,874
Even if you can't swim, it's okay.

179
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:26,658
because we have life jackets

180
00:09:26,772 --> 00:09:27,774
Absolutely safe

181
00:09:28,654 --> 00:09:29,534
And you

182
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,963
I saw you walking normally

183
00:09:33,812 --> 00:09:35,962
you told me that you're fine.

184
00:09:37,396 --> 00:09:39,127
Your wound will be alright in water.

185
00:09:39,492 --> 00:09:41,588
Don't be afraid

186
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,371
Uh, but I don't want to go.

187
00:09:44,576 --> 00:09:45,800
Can you go together?

188
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,680
- Yes, two of you are more fun.
- Fine!

189
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:52,483
Have you guys started looking for a new job yet?

190
00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:05,554
Are you sure my wound will be alright?

191
00:10:07,494 --> 00:10:12,471
I'm sure that not a single drop of water will hit your wound.

192
00:10:20,826 --> 00:10:21,725
Seriously?

193
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:25,914
I wrapped it up neatly.

194
00:10:26,211 --> 00:10:29,238
the water will not get into your feet for sure.

195
00:10:30,978 --> 00:10:33,540
Are you sure about that? My wound will be alright?

196
00:10:34,886 --> 00:10:35,753
Sure!

197
00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:38,492
Are you ready?

198
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:40,453
Can I go with Putter?

199
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,094
uh Vivi

200
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,386
I think

201
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,711
If my boat has one with a foot injury

202
00:10:47,097 --> 00:10:49,264
and the other one who can't swim

203
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:51,362
and if the kayak capsizes

204
00:10:51,876 --> 00:10:53,235
we're all going to die, right?

205
00:10:53,935 --> 00:10:55,662
So I think it'd better if you would come with me.

206
00:10:56,004 --> 00:10:56,504
Oh

207
00:10:57,052 --> 00:10:57,705
Ok

208
00:10:58,344 --> 00:10:59,109
Let’s go

209
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,857
It's fun. I want to play it again Amphere.

210
00:11:41,857 --> 00:11:43,544
The kayak is capsized but I want to do it again

211
00:11:43,544 --> 00:11:44,288
Let’s play again

212
00:11:44,516 --> 00:11:45,016
Umm

213
00:11:45,244 --> 00:11:45,874
Vivi

214
00:11:46,103 --> 00:11:48,035
I’m very thirsty.

215
00:11:48,469 --> 00:11:49,827
Go buy some water with me

216
00:11:49,827 --> 00:11:50,868
But can we just play first?

217
00:11:50,868 --> 00:11:52,229
Come on!

218
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:55,550
The kayak!

219
00:11:55,801 --> 00:11:57,105
Putter,  park the kayak.

220
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:00,000
Dang it!

221
00:12:04,611 --> 00:12:05,886
where are the pants

222
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:08,097
help me find it bro

223
00:12:08,211 --> 00:12:08,960
Wait a minute

224
00:12:10,216 --> 00:12:11,480
Oops!! Did I touch your…?

225
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,133
No!!!

226
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:18,115
Why are you still laughing, help me find it first.

227
00:12:20,793 --> 00:12:21,873
Go buy it for me

228
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:24,672
Find it first

229
00:13:06,941 --> 00:13:08,016
That was close.

230
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,060
Don't do it again Pete.

231
00:13:10,434 --> 00:13:12,825
Fortunately, no one was in a very serious accident.

232
00:13:14,301 --> 00:13:15,671
So what do you want me to do?

233
00:13:16,376 --> 00:13:17,858
I've been taking pictures of him all day.

234
00:13:18,276 --> 00:13:19,649
nothing works

235
00:13:21,477 --> 00:13:22,376
Come on

236
00:13:22,596 --> 00:13:24,848
I'll call Vivi to make plans again.

237
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,930
We have to make Putter on news.

238
00:13:31,388 --> 00:13:33,049
I wish it to be successful.

239
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,065
If this time is unsuccessful

240
00:13:39,704 --> 00:13:41,360
Next time there won't be another chance.

241
00:13:42,704 --> 00:13:44,175
Don't do anything harsh.

242
00:13:44,848 --> 00:13:46,165
It will make you in trouble.

243
00:13:51,716 --> 00:13:53,403
He stole my first work.

244
00:13:54,936 --> 00:13:55,436
Just do this

245
00:13:55,845 --> 00:13:56,964
I can't permit it.

246
00:13:58,308 --> 00:13:59,591
Either way is okay.

247
00:14:01,111 --> 00:14:02,525
Even if I have to go to jail

248
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,939
I don't care anymore.

249
00:14:05,616 --> 00:14:07,381
No, Pete, no

250
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,296
I will never let you do that.

251
00:14:13,781 --> 00:14:14,848
You know

252
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:17,398
I can't lose you.

253
00:14:19,549 --> 00:14:20,555
be more patient

254
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,145
Since you already know it,

255
00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:29,353
you have to do whatever I want.

256
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:33,411
Oops!!

257
00:14:34,534 --> 00:14:35,411
Sorry

258
00:14:37,217 --> 00:14:40,216
I'd better get out of here.

259
00:14:40,216 --> 00:14:40,850
No need

260
00:14:41,746 --> 00:14:42,466
come in

261
00:14:50,638 --> 00:14:51,791
both of you

262
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,791
What are you planning?

263
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,857
Hurry up and do it

264
00:14:57,857 --> 00:15:01,421
before I run out of patience

265
00:15:20,067 --> 00:15:21,980
Wow! so beautiful

266
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,967
Ofcourse

267
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,298
You know, I've been wanting a beach party for a long time.

268
00:15:29,298 --> 00:15:31,672
party like this is not easy.

269
00:15:31,672 --> 00:15:32,172
Aha

270
00:15:32,172 --> 00:15:35,294
I’ve been headache
during the past hecking days.

271
00:15:37,497 --> 00:15:38,330
beautiful, I like it

272
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:38,898
Uh

273
00:15:38,898 --> 00:15:40,213
I'm sorry, Amphere.

274
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:42,318
Yes?

275
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:43,041
Well

276
00:15:43,988 --> 00:15:44,590
Um...

277
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,147
I brought you some water.

278
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:47,975
Oh

279
00:15:48,944 --> 00:15:50,468
actually you don't have to.

280
00:15:50,468 --> 00:15:51,565
I'm flattered.

281
00:15:53,305 --> 00:15:54,546
You don’t have to.

282
00:15:54,546 --> 00:15:55,621
I’m so willing

283
00:15:57,031 --> 00:15:57,884
Actually

284
00:15:57,884 --> 00:15:59,661
I want to say hi for a long time.

285
00:15:59,661 --> 00:16:00,161
But

286
00:16:00,315 --> 00:16:01,938
I was working

287
00:16:02,643 --> 00:16:03,746
now I’m free

288
00:16:04,407 --> 00:16:06,693
Did I disturb you?

289
00:16:07,001 --> 00:16:10,565
Oh, no no you didn’t disturb me.
I'm very free right now.

290
00:16:10,565 --> 00:16:11,706
A long free time

291
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:12,338
Ok

292
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:16,599
Uh

293
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:17,606
Oh

294
00:16:17,804 --> 00:16:20,242
there's still half an hour left until the next set.

295
00:16:20,572 --> 00:16:21,101
So...

296
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:23,005
I’ll go find some snacks for you to eat.

297
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:24,364
Hey, it's okay

298
00:16:24,694 --> 00:16:26,030
I'll go pick it up myself.

299
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,775
I'm flattered.

300
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,037
So...

301
00:16:33,504 --> 00:16:34,532
would you like to take a walk together?

302
00:16:37,483 --> 00:16:38,071
Let's go

303
00:16:39,848 --> 00:16:40,350
Hey!

304
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:43,882
What?

305
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,744
What are you doing Amphere?

306
00:16:46,096 --> 00:16:48,360
You gonna leave me and go with that guy?

307
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:49,854
Dude

308
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:52,008
Cut me some slacks.

309
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,156
In the last 2 days, I really had a headache.

310
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,667
So you won't work?

311
00:16:58,667 --> 00:16:59,167
Hey

312
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,153
See how many film crew are there?

313
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,900
It will not make a difference whithout me.
They won't ask for me.

314
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:04,708
And

315
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:08,344
I won't be in excess of you with Putter.

316
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:09,528
Isn't that good?

317
00:17:10,828 --> 00:17:11,815
Ok bye.

318
00:17:12,035 --> 00:17:13,680
He has been waiting for a long time.

319
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:20,085
I think Amphere is right.

320
00:17:21,891 --> 00:17:22,399
What?

321
00:17:23,104 --> 00:17:23,604
Well...

322
00:17:24,655 --> 00:17:26,301
It doesn't need too many people

323
00:17:26,852 --> 00:17:27,774
Just me and you

324
00:17:28,545 --> 00:17:29,434
is enough.

325
00:17:31,262 --> 00:17:31,762
Let’s go

326
00:17:34,848 --> 00:17:36,119
Where are you going?

327
00:17:37,308 --> 00:17:38,409
come on

328
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:39,239
You'll know

329
00:18:11,711 --> 00:18:12,484
Come on

330
00:18:12,726 --> 00:18:13,603
let's paint.

331
00:18:15,237 --> 00:18:15,814
No

332
00:18:16,343 --> 00:18:17,326
you paint alone.

333
00:18:17,656 --> 00:18:18,949
Ohhhhh

334
00:18:19,367 --> 00:18:20,087
Well…

335
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:21,667
You paint for me

336
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,210
I'll paint it for you.

337
00:18:23,756 --> 00:18:24,698
I assure it

338
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,287
will be beautiful.

339
00:18:27,829 --> 00:18:28,529
But

340
00:18:28,815 --> 00:18:29,848
I can't draw.

341
00:18:30,753 --> 00:18:31,900
That's not a problem.

342
00:18:32,318 --> 00:18:33,120
Let's draw it.

343
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,293
Cute

344
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:35,390
I don't mind

345
00:18:36,161 --> 00:18:37,941
But you have to draw well.

346
00:18:37,941 --> 00:18:39,848
I have to use my face for the photoshoot.

347
00:18:42,183 --> 00:18:42,760
All right

348
00:18:44,126 --> 00:18:45,484
But don’t shush me!

349
00:18:54,848 --> 00:18:55,381
Come

350
00:19:48,018 --> 00:19:48,962
Is it hot?

351
00:19:50,966 --> 00:19:51,466
Huh?

352
00:19:54,131 --> 00:19:55,651
Your face turns red.

353
00:19:56,818 --> 00:19:58,205
I thought the weather is hot

354
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,676
Oh

355
00:20:01,337 --> 00:20:01,837
Yeah...

356
00:20:02,013 --> 00:20:02,689
it's hot.

357
00:20:04,011 --> 00:20:05,851
I'm at the beach, but don’t know why I feel hot

358
00:20:05,851 --> 00:20:07,452
even though there's a sea breeze.

359
00:20:11,152 --> 00:20:12,039
I finished drawing

360
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,297
Are you sure you

361
00:20:16,297 --> 00:20:18,297
didn't draw anything weird on my face.

362
00:20:18,804 --> 00:20:19,446
Oh

363
00:20:20,173 --> 00:20:21,732
How come?

364
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:25,301
You drew something weird on my face?

365
00:20:26,336 --> 00:20:27,842
So let's look in the mirror together.

366
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,005
Ok

367
00:20:31,802 --> 00:20:33,107
1 2 3

368
00:20:33,724 --> 00:20:34,314
Ohhhhhhh

369
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,116
You're teasing me

370
00:20:38,724 --> 00:20:39,535
Well…

371
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:44,134
Why did you draw stars, moon

372
00:20:45,522 --> 00:20:46,795
and sun?

373
00:20:49,174 --> 00:20:50,453
you're a famous star.

374
00:20:51,004 --> 00:20:51,644
So

375
00:20:52,146 --> 00:20:53,683
it is the sun

376
00:20:54,848 --> 00:20:56,499
with the moon and stars.

377
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,221
It gives out great power

378
00:20:59,848 --> 00:21:02,232
when encountering problems.

379
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,285
Hmmm

380
00:21:05,034 --> 00:21:07,651
you're profound too.

381
00:21:13,093 --> 00:21:15,093
What is this round?

382
00:21:16,118 --> 00:21:16,945
Pineapple?

383
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,229
It's a turtle

384
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,531
not a pineapple.

385
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:22,530
Turtle

386
00:21:24,848 --> 00:21:25,683
And...

387
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,317
the oval

388
00:21:28,317 --> 00:21:29,280
is...?

389
00:21:30,403 --> 00:21:31,079
rice?

390
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:36,592
Fish. How do you see it as rice?

391
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:38,150
Fish!

392
00:21:43,106 --> 00:21:45,128
where it was scratched was a snake

393
00:21:45,414 --> 00:21:46,137
Right?

394
00:21:46,637 --> 00:21:47,247
This is

395
00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:49,203
my Putter.

396
00:21:49,848 --> 00:21:51,989
I intend to draw with my best work.

397
00:21:52,543 --> 00:21:57,282
People will see that you are my manager.

398
00:22:05,322 --> 00:22:07,939
The last one, don't tell me it's... a cow.

399
00:22:08,908 --> 00:22:09,556
Again

400
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,699
this is a dog

401
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,502
Look carefully

402
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:14,848
It’s very cute

403
00:22:15,636 --> 00:22:17,746
I drew a face like you.

404
00:22:18,781 --> 00:22:20,294
You are saying that my face is like a dog?
