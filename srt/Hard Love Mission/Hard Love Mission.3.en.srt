1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,927
This series is just a fictitious story. It’s not related to actual people, places, organizations, or real happening.

2
00:00:52,435 --> 00:00:53,202
Never mind

3
00:00:53,202 --> 00:00:54,109
I’ll do it

4
00:00:55,725 --> 00:00:57,711
Is your wound healed yet?

5
00:00:57,711 --> 00:00:59,868
It’s good

6
00:00:59,868 --> 00:01:02,327
Maybe we can come together

7
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,455
Be free for me the popular stars

8
00:01:04,455 --> 00:01:07,921
So, are you inviting Putter to the room according to the plan we talked about yet?

9
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:09,402
Not yet

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,421
what are you doing?

11
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,757
If you’re stubborn again

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm not gonna give you an interview.

13
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,009
Are you okay?

14
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:29,145
Hmmm

15
00:01:29,145 --> 00:01:30,559
Well, it's okay

16
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:33,056
Amphere is probably thinking too much

17
00:01:33,056 --> 00:01:33,998
Sorry for that

18
00:01:37,496 --> 00:01:38,574
Oh

19
00:01:39,063 --> 00:01:40,536
you’re not okay

20
00:01:40,536 --> 00:01:41,954
hot like this

21
00:01:44,094 --> 00:01:46,469
why you covered in such a thick blanket?

22
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:47,634
Isn't it hot?

23
00:01:48,285 --> 00:01:49,299
take off

24
00:01:49,415 --> 00:01:49,915
Uhh

25
00:01:50,218 --> 00:01:51,187
don't have to

26
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:52,746
just go to rest

27
00:02:09,543 --> 00:02:10,332
It’s alright

28
00:02:10,332 --> 00:02:11,820
I'll wipe myself

29
00:02:12,448 --> 00:02:14,862
I’m the reason why you’re like this

30
00:02:14,862 --> 00:02:17,188
I should take care of you

31
00:02:21,868 --> 00:02:23,593
You are a star

32
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:26,841
Why are you doing this to your manager

33
00:02:26,841 --> 00:02:29,337
It doesn't look like a celebrity at all.

34
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,546
I'm a normal person

35
00:02:32,546 --> 00:02:33,918
why can't ?

36
00:02:36,128 --> 00:02:38,397
Hmmm, I don’t know

37
00:02:39,397 --> 00:02:42,972
Seeing someone are famous, they twirled

38
00:02:44,577 --> 00:02:45,844
doesn't do this

39
00:02:46,821 --> 00:02:48,575
It must be a manager duty

40
00:02:48,575 --> 00:02:50,575
who must take care.

41
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:53,274
Where did you get the news from

42
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:56,088
That a celebrity can't do this?

43
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,821
or maybe it because

44
00:02:58,821 --> 00:03:00,843
before I become to be an actor until today

45
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,688
I've been through a lot of bad things

46
00:03:03,688 --> 00:03:06,974
So, I didn't think I had to be arrogant or what I’m holding.

47
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:09,821
Only sometimes

48
00:03:10,449 --> 00:03:13,320
that I want to have time for myself

49
00:03:14,646 --> 00:03:16,660
it seems to be a bit arrogant to the fans

50
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:18,998
but actually, I have nothing

51
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,883
being a simple person

52
00:03:22,628 --> 00:03:23,618
So...

53
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:28,908
What a hard thing you talking about?

54
00:03:30,453 --> 00:03:31,835
for example

55
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:34,456
I had to cast more than a hundred times

56
00:03:34,456 --> 00:03:35,897
before showing for the first time.

57
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:37,887
Oh!!

58
00:03:37,887 --> 00:03:39,073
that's a lot

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,930
Yes

60
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:43,361
For many years I have been trying to follow my dreams

61
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,503
but never get any jobs

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,018
Where did you get this kind of patience from?

63
00:03:52,344 --> 00:03:53,238
If I were you

64
00:03:53,238 --> 00:03:55,706
ten times no more

65
00:03:57,055 --> 00:03:57,923
That's it

66
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:00,038
I doubted myself too

67
00:04:00,596 --> 00:04:02,645
Why is it willing to try so hard?

68
00:04:03,692 --> 00:04:05,418
maybe because I like

69
00:04:05,418 --> 00:04:07,720
and I've always dreamed of becoming an actor.

70
00:04:09,512 --> 00:04:10,322
But

71
00:04:11,253 --> 00:04:13,141
today you have succeeded

72
00:04:13,327 --> 00:04:14,454
very good

73
00:04:15,687 --> 00:04:18,003
I actually decided to give up

74
00:04:19,096 --> 00:04:20,179
but

75
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:24,201
I decided I'd try the last casting

76
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,986
and think if not

77
00:04:25,986 --> 00:04:27,040
would have quit

78
00:04:27,854 --> 00:04:30,283
But by chance that day I got a job

79
00:04:30,516 --> 00:04:32,144
like a miracle

80
00:04:32,377 --> 00:04:35,301
It's good that I decided to go to the casting that day

81
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:39,555
Otherwise, you won't be a celebrity like today.

82
00:04:40,765 --> 00:04:42,665
Even that day I will be unlucky

83
00:04:43,642 --> 00:04:45,296
but there are people to support

84
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:48,186
and told me to fight one more time

85
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,147
So, I got through it.

86
00:04:54,195 --> 00:04:56,197
I'm going to wash for you

87
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,925
you will take off a clothe

88
00:04:57,925 --> 00:04:59,277
or wipe it like this?

89
00:05:00,836 --> 00:05:02,101
Uhhhh

90
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,977
You don't have to

91
00:05:04,326 --> 00:05:05,293
I'll wipe myself

92
00:05:05,293 --> 00:05:06,334
I'm getting better

93
00:05:06,334 --> 00:05:07,729
go to rest

94
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:16,914
It's not really hot anymore

95
00:05:17,147 --> 00:05:18,235
Fine

96
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,767
I’ll go brush my teeth

97
00:05:22,116 --> 00:05:22,963
I'm sleepy

98
00:05:22,963 --> 00:05:24,588
I'll be able to sleep for a while.

99
00:05:51,111 --> 00:05:52,297
I think

100
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:54,232
you come to bed

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,641
I'll go down and sleep on the sofa.

102
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:00,377
But we've talked about this already

103
00:06:03,285 --> 00:06:04,924
I feel dissatisfied

104
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:07,860
If you let me sleep like this

105
00:06:08,256 --> 00:06:09,591
I won't be able to sleep at all.

106
00:06:15,803 --> 00:06:16,726
Well then

107
00:06:40,176 --> 00:06:41,264
Where are you going?

108
00:06:41,962 --> 00:06:44,546
Both of us will sleep together in the bed

109
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,373
no one has to sleep on the sofa

110
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:48,843
Let's sleep

111
00:06:49,332 --> 00:06:50,482
Uh

112
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:51,796
It’s not good

113
00:06:52,238 --> 00:06:54,540
I’ll sleeping downstairs

114
00:06:57,797 --> 00:06:59,029
Why?

115
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,637
Isn't it good to sleep together?

116
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:07,122
or do you think more than?

117
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:09,160
You’re going crazy

118
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:10,705
I...

119
00:07:12,616 --> 00:07:13,903
I toss and turn in my sleep

120
00:07:13,903 --> 00:07:15,422
afraid to bother you.

121
00:07:15,608 --> 00:07:17,267
Well, if you don't think more than this

122
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:18,871
Just slept together in bed

123
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,837
If you want to interview me

124
00:07:21,837 --> 00:07:23,232
So, hurry up

125
00:07:23,732 --> 00:07:24,558
I'm sleepy

126
00:08:12,461 --> 00:08:14,357
Put it all around

127
00:08:17,963 --> 00:08:20,058
Keep a good distance

128
00:08:21,128 --> 00:08:22,199
Tan, come here

129
00:08:22,362 --> 00:08:23,060
Yes

130
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:25,240
Let’s take a look over there

131
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:26,393
Where? Is that right?

132
00:08:26,393 --> 00:08:26,893
Yes

133
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:27,911
Okay

134
00:08:28,749 --> 00:08:30,890
set this one up

135
00:08:31,262 --> 00:08:33,090
Make sure it's neat

136
00:08:33,695 --> 00:08:36,117
If the photographer and electrician are ready, you can set it up.

137
00:08:39,211 --> 00:08:40,000
Hello Joe

138
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,757
Hi

139
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,682
Putter Vivi

140
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:45,760
We will have a set of sportswear shooting

141
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,840
Today's activities will be running at the beach

142
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,864
played volleyball and drove an ATV.

143
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:52,879
Wow ATV!

144
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:55,926
It might be a little uncomfortable but ut it's definitely fun.

145
00:08:56,438 --> 00:08:59,423
At evening we will have a photoshoot as a party set

146
00:08:59,656 --> 00:09:05,883
Be fun like we wear a sportswear that can go anywhere anytime

147
00:09:05,883 --> 00:09:07,433
Don’t worry about an accommodation

148
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:10,264
I have already made a reservation

149
00:09:10,264 --> 00:09:12,230
It will be convenient when shooting at night.

150
00:09:12,556 --> 00:09:15,457
It's sounds fun Joe. Can we please go now?

151
00:09:15,457 --> 00:09:18,644
A bit tired of this job but definitely fun.

152
00:09:18,644 --> 00:09:19,196
Okay

153
00:09:19,196 --> 00:09:19,777
Okay

154
00:09:19,777 --> 00:09:20,675
Have fun

155
00:09:20,675 --> 00:09:21,175
Yeah

156
00:09:21,175 --> 00:09:22,221
Thank you

157
00:09:28,596 --> 00:09:30,000
Smile

158
00:09:31,698 --> 00:09:33,046
Be joyful

159
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,051
Summer!!

160
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:42,199
Yes, smile more

161
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:43,166
a little force

162
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:44,724
Yes

163
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:46,381
Go

164
00:09:47,637 --> 00:09:49,173
smart

165
00:09:50,964 --> 00:09:52,012
right

166
00:09:52,594 --> 00:09:53,448
like that

167
00:09:55,309 --> 00:09:58,395
A little force. It will be finished in a moment.

168
00:09:58,977 --> 00:10:02,861
Smile likes in the summer

169
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,000
Ok

170
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:13,780
come on, let the cast’s rest first. I'll call you in a new set.

171
00:10:45,165 --> 00:10:46,474
Water

172
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,527
Thanks

173
00:10:48,434 --> 00:10:50,876
Yoshi I need a compress

174
00:10:50,876 --> 00:10:51,783
Really hot

175
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:54,109
OK stay here

176
00:10:54,109 --> 00:10:54,905
Ofcourse

177
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:02,371
your wet nap

178
00:11:03,185 --> 00:11:04,778
Please wipe it for me

179
00:11:04,778 --> 00:11:06,057
I'm tired

180
00:11:06,964 --> 00:11:07,814
No

181
00:11:07,814 --> 00:11:09,418
you wipe by yourself

182
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,162
Please wipe it for me

183
00:11:11,162 --> 00:11:12,720
It's hot

184
00:11:13,232 --> 00:11:14,697
And when it’s hot

185
00:11:15,302 --> 00:11:17,031
my memory is not good

186
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,837
I can't remember anything

187
00:11:19,535 --> 00:11:20,485
and

188
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:23,279
if someone will interview me at that time

189
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,431
I probably won't be able to answer at all

190
00:11:26,897 --> 00:11:31,530
I think someone will lose their jobs for sure, don't you think so?

191
00:11:31,902 --> 00:11:34,808
But it's up to you whether to wipe it or not

192
00:11:48,581 --> 00:11:49,527
over here

193
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,566
you wipe by yourself

194
00:12:42,015 --> 00:12:43,317
Please wipe it for me

195
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:45,024
It's hot

196
00:12:45,715 --> 00:12:47,198
And when it’s hot

197
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:49,501
my memory is not good

198
00:12:49,863 --> 00:12:51,454
I can't remember anything

199
00:12:52,058 --> 00:12:54,163
and if someone will interview me at that time

200
00:12:54,664 --> 00:12:56,327
I probably won't be able to answer at all

201
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:00,528
I think someone will lose their jobs for sure

202
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:01,866
don't you think so?

203
00:13:20,485 --> 00:13:21,681
over here

204
00:13:47,331 --> 00:13:48,259
like this

205
00:13:48,621 --> 00:13:49,697
all over my body

206
00:13:50,853 --> 00:13:52,663
you just wipe my face

207
00:13:53,215 --> 00:13:54,783
It has been scratch

208
00:14:01,704 --> 00:14:02,898
how about...

209
00:14:03,536 --> 00:14:04,923
Has your wound healed yet?

210
00:14:05,354 --> 00:14:06,454
Are you still hurting?

211
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,599
Oh

212
00:14:09,134 --> 00:14:10,254
It doesn't hurt anymore

213
00:14:10,426 --> 00:14:12,098
It's probably not a big wound

214
00:14:13,306 --> 00:14:14,479
be better is good

215
00:14:15,169 --> 00:14:16,841
I'm afraid that you will get hurt badly because of me.

216
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:18,544
sorry for that

217
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:22,342
Putter

218
00:14:22,342 --> 00:14:24,273
Joe called to take the next set

219
00:14:24,635 --> 00:14:25,792
Okay

220
00:14:37,446 --> 00:14:38,578
My word!

221
00:14:39,184 --> 00:14:40,680
How it's going on

222
00:14:42,043 --> 00:14:43,692
What Amphere?

223
00:14:44,123 --> 00:14:45,726
when did you come?

224
00:14:46,002 --> 00:14:46,606
Oh

225
00:14:47,831 --> 00:14:51,280
I come before you both start talking until the end

226
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,060
what happened last night

227
00:14:56,527 --> 00:14:57,336
what?

228
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,230
just sleep

229
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,022
why?

230
00:15:00,022 --> 00:15:01,108
you think a lot

231
00:15:01,713 --> 00:15:03,239
No i didn't

232
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,679
I saw you both talking

233
00:15:08,317 --> 00:15:11,888
I think there must have been something good last night

234
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,829
Where did Putter sleep last night?

235
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:18,775
in bed

236
00:15:19,845 --> 00:15:20,971
and you?

237
00:15:23,444 --> 00:15:24,481
in bed

238
00:15:24,481 --> 00:15:25,412
see!

239
00:15:25,636 --> 00:15:26,756
That's it

240
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:29,626
Don't you dare!

241
00:15:31,317 --> 00:15:32,610
Just only sleep

242
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,564
Didn't do anything

243
00:15:33,564 --> 00:15:35,233
Just sleep

244
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:36,245
just now

245
00:15:36,245 --> 00:15:39,281
your hands were rubbed together until see his gut

246
00:15:40,195 --> 00:15:41,598
somethings wrong

247
00:15:43,547 --> 00:15:44,804
and both of you

248
00:15:45,063 --> 00:15:46,666
How can you go to bed together?

249
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:50,561
I didn't go up

250
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,293
He carried me up

251
00:15:55,397 --> 00:15:56,333
carried you up?

252
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:56,858
Aha

253
00:15:56,858 --> 00:15:57,858
carried you up to go to sleep?

254
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,014
So how could it be nothing?

255
00:16:03,283 --> 00:16:04,030
nothing

256
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,237
just sleep

257
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,123
really

258
00:16:06,123 --> 00:16:07,177
really

259
00:16:09,126 --> 00:16:09,793
Buddy

260
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:13,227
look to the right

261
00:16:13,503 --> 00:16:14,675
slowly

262
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:16,761
see that guy

263
00:16:16,761 --> 00:16:19,037
standing under the coconut tree?

264
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,011
and?

265
00:16:20,011 --> 00:16:21,454
wearing black shirt

266
00:16:21,454 --> 00:16:22,315
black glasses

267
00:16:23,523 --> 00:16:24,585
what's wrong?

268
00:16:25,103 --> 00:16:26,746
I saw him secretly following us

269
00:16:26,746 --> 00:16:28,165
since the shooting start

270
00:16:30,132 --> 00:16:30,919
see?

271
00:16:31,592 --> 00:16:33,954
Always pick up the phone and shoot putters with Vivi

272
00:16:40,804 --> 00:16:42,440
or he must be

273
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,491
paparazzi

274
00:16:43,491 --> 00:16:44,784
taking pictures of celebrities

275
00:16:45,611 --> 00:16:46,658
another one

276
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:49,162
He might be a tourist

277
00:16:49,162 --> 00:16:51,086
Or the fans

278
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:54,107
But if he still follows us today

279
00:16:54,107 --> 00:16:56,277
I'll be the one who walks in and asks him

280
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,673
OK

281
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,454
Keep watching

282
00:17:01,627 --> 00:17:03,023
I have to take care Putter

283
00:17:03,592 --> 00:17:04,522
Right

284
00:17:05,898 --> 00:17:07,012
finish

285
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:07,992
Let's go

286
00:17:10,356 --> 00:17:12,063
Both of you are really good

287
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:13,856
It will be finished in a moment

288
00:17:13,856 --> 00:17:14,717
Cheer up!

289
00:17:14,717 --> 00:17:15,319
Okay

290
00:17:15,561 --> 00:17:17,780
You can change the next set right now

291
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:18,491
Wowww

292
00:17:18,491 --> 00:17:19,447
look very comfortable

293
00:17:19,447 --> 00:17:20,774
very flexible

294
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:23,297
When finished, can i take back one?

295
00:17:23,297 --> 00:17:27,875
Now, you can change the dress this way

296
00:17:28,341 --> 00:17:29,144
Okay

297
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,097
So, see you in 15 minutes here

298
00:17:31,454 --> 00:17:32,729
Check the neatness as well

299
00:17:32,936 --> 00:17:33,686
Ok?

300
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:34,202
alright

301
00:17:34,202 --> 00:17:35,512
Thank you very much

302
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,488
Tan, please take a look

303
00:17:37,643 --> 00:17:38,799
Make-up and hair

304
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,472
Yes

305
00:17:39,472 --> 00:17:40,134
Ok

306
00:17:48,697 --> 00:17:49,795
How's going on?

307
00:17:53,143 --> 00:17:54,139
look

308
00:17:54,846 --> 00:17:56,082
normal pictures

309
00:17:58,248 --> 00:18:00,248
There's no evidence to bind it at all

310
00:18:02,933 --> 00:18:06,681
Last night, Putter agreed to follow Vivi into the room

311
00:18:06,923 --> 00:18:08,267
but unfortunately

312
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:10,888
his manager's friend take Putter back first

313
00:18:12,285 --> 00:18:15,059
Otherwise our plan has been accomplished

314
00:18:16,057 --> 00:18:18,057
It's not going to be this good all the time

315
00:18:18,902 --> 00:18:21,693
because soon He's in for it!

316
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:24,055
What are you going to do?

317
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:28,505
I went to the ATV set's last night

318
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:31,088
I cut the brake lines

319
00:18:31,347 --> 00:18:32,347
almost broken

320
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:36,998
WTF?

321
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:40,948
I told you not to do anything that is too harsh

322
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:43,725
So what if something happened to Putter?

323
00:18:45,554 --> 00:18:47,433
Probably nothing

324
00:18:48,054 --> 00:18:49,881
They don't drive fast

325
00:18:50,036 --> 00:18:51,990
just a broken arm

326
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:53,891
or broken leg

327
00:18:54,512 --> 00:18:55,581
Not even dead

328
00:18:56,289 --> 00:18:57,697
when you going to cut the brake lines

329
00:18:57,697 --> 00:18:58,943
Has anyone seen it?

330
00:18:59,685 --> 00:19:00,366
No one

331
00:19:00,366 --> 00:19:01,625
I checked

332
00:19:02,177 --> 00:19:04,281
And I've checked the cctv as well

333
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:07,083
take it easy

334
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:08,221
don't worry

335
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:09,635
relax

336
00:19:09,963 --> 00:19:12,330
I told you not to do anything that was too harsh

337
00:19:12,657 --> 00:19:14,276
You're going to be in troble

338
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,108
I'll go check first

339
00:19:16,246 --> 00:19:18,218
I don't want to go to jail because of you

340
00:19:25,406 --> 00:19:26,077
costume department

341
00:19:26,077 --> 00:19:27,421
Check the neatness for them

342
00:19:27,421 --> 00:19:28,042
Ok

343
00:19:29,077 --> 00:19:29,984
Well

344
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,173
is it comfortable?

345
00:19:32,293 --> 00:19:33,207
Joe

346
00:19:34,052 --> 00:19:35,580
Can I ask you something?

347
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,460
When shooting an ATV

348
00:19:38,564 --> 00:19:40,478
Does it have to drive fast?

349
00:19:40,857 --> 00:19:41,960
not fast

350
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:43,415
Any problem?

351
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:44,503
Oh

352
00:19:44,503 --> 00:19:46,401
I worried

353
00:19:46,401 --> 00:19:48,297
Afraid driving too fast and it will be dangerous

354
00:19:49,315 --> 00:19:50,769
worried about Putter

355
00:19:50,993 --> 00:19:52,514
But not worried about Vivi?

356
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:57,252
Does Vivi have to drive?

357
00:19:57,718 --> 00:19:58,938
No

358
00:19:59,076 --> 00:20:00,063
Putter drive

359
00:20:00,184 --> 00:20:01,306
Vivi ride on a pillion

360
00:20:02,691 --> 00:20:04,001
Cannot!

361
00:20:04,001 --> 00:20:05,950
Vivi can't stack the ATV

362
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:06,924
Why?

363
00:20:06,924 --> 00:20:08,458
what's the problem?

364
00:20:10,683 --> 00:20:11,614
I think...

365
00:20:11,614 --> 00:20:14,583
ATVs are more suitable for men

366
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:15,776
And it's too dangerous

367
00:20:16,454 --> 00:20:19,093
It would be better to let Putter drive alone

368
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,403
rest of that

369
00:20:20,403 --> 00:20:22,617
Let Vivi stand and take a photo with

370
00:20:22,617 --> 00:20:23,583
Is it better, Joe?

371
00:20:26,188 --> 00:20:27,561
I'm fine, Lip.

372
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:28,579
I can stack the ATV

373
00:20:28,579 --> 00:20:29,252
that's all

374
00:20:29,804 --> 00:20:32,463
Besides, Joe said that it wasn't able to drive fast, right?

375
00:20:32,687 --> 00:20:34,342
It's fine

376
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,564
Yes

377
00:20:37,428 --> 00:20:39,441
So, Let's do it

378
00:20:39,441 --> 00:20:41,063
But drive it slowly

379
00:20:41,063 --> 00:20:42,175
Both will be safe

380
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:43,037
Okay everyone

381
00:20:43,037 --> 00:20:44,756
get ready

382
00:20:44,998 --> 00:20:47,845
finishing this scene. Let's have lunch together

383
00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:48,922
Alright

384
00:20:48,922 --> 00:20:50,601
Thanks

385
00:20:53,976 --> 00:20:55,174
(mumble sound)

386
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:03,219
Hey

387
00:21:03,219 --> 00:21:03,719
Huh?

388
00:21:04,011 --> 00:21:05,821
I think Lip is weird

389
00:21:06,718 --> 00:21:07,769
like strange? How?

390
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,524
Well, Vivi will be able to ride an ATV

391
00:21:10,524 --> 00:21:12,307
People will see a cool, beautiful look

392
00:21:12,393 --> 00:21:13,701
don't want she to stack the ATV

393
00:21:13,701 --> 00:21:14,809
let Putter shoot alone

394
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:15,739
drive alone

395
00:21:15,739 --> 00:21:16,966
WTF is that?

396
00:21:18,018 --> 00:21:19,523
uh it's true

397
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,644
What do you think?

398
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:24,373
I had a strange intuition

399
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,589
stay here

400
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,692
I'll come back

401
00:21:36,454 --> 00:21:37,036
What we gonna do?

402
00:21:37,036 --> 00:21:37,709
we're in trouble

403
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:39,863
Vivi has to stack the ATV with Putter

404
00:21:39,863 --> 00:21:41,120
The one you cut the brake lines

405
00:21:41,772 --> 00:21:43,383
You just told Vivi to come down

406
00:21:43,538 --> 00:21:44,457
already told

407
00:21:44,457 --> 00:21:46,264
But Vivi insisted that she would continue

408
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:48,007
I don't know what to do

409
00:21:48,197 --> 00:21:49,901
And if i say that the brake cable has a problem

410
00:21:50,074 --> 00:21:51,139
Wouldn't they be suspicious

411
00:21:51,139 --> 00:21:52,196
how do i know?

412
00:21:55,923 --> 00:21:57,923
It's up to the luck

413
00:21:59,476 --> 00:22:00,510
Good luck to Vivi

414
00:22:02,377 --> 00:22:03,906
Holy Sh*t!!!

415
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:06,025
That's it. Just come with me

416
00:22:07,401 --> 00:22:09,053
Why don't you go with Putter?

417
00:22:09,543 --> 00:22:10,477
I can't drive

418
00:22:10,477 --> 00:22:11,454
How can i follow him?

419
00:22:11,454 --> 00:22:12,170
mehhh

420
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:13,133
If you go back to Bangkok

421
00:22:13,133 --> 00:22:15,378
I'll take you to a driving lesson first

422
00:22:15,529 --> 00:22:16,587
Hurry up!

423
00:22:16,587 --> 00:22:17,511
before it happened

424
00:22:17,511 --> 00:22:18,474
Ok

425
00:22:38,972 --> 00:22:39,977
Here's Ampere

426
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:41,411
Ohhhhhh!!!

427
00:22:41,454 --> 00:22:42,268
Amphere it's not admittance

428
00:22:42,513 --> 00:22:43,196
What the h*ll?

429
00:22:43,837 --> 00:22:45,446
Wait a minute

430
00:22:48,991 --> 00:22:49,711
Putter

431
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:52,359
Ohhhh!!!

432
00:22:53,878 --> 00:22:57,334
[Dangerous roads, motorcycles do not pass]

433
00:22:59,824 --> 00:23:01,322
let have a look over there

434
00:23:01,322 --> 00:23:02,499
He will drive down

435
00:23:02,499 --> 00:23:03,882
collect it all

436
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:04,665
Don't miss it

437
00:23:04,665 --> 00:23:05,429
Yes

438
00:23:11,066 --> 00:23:11,932
Ok

439
00:23:12,045 --> 00:23:13,347
Are the cast's ready?

440
00:23:13,705 --> 00:23:14,733
ready

441
00:23:15,921 --> 00:23:16,454
be careful Putter!

442
00:23:16,454 --> 00:23:17,417
it's dangerous!

443
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:18,346
Putter!

444
00:23:18,346 --> 00:23:19,234
Wait

445
00:23:22,741 --> 00:23:23,551
STOP!

446
00:23:24,249 --> 00:23:25,331
Hey!

447
00:23:25,331 --> 00:23:25,915
What's going on?

448
00:23:25,915 --> 00:23:27,331
Don't go in. They started filming

449
00:23:28,368 --> 00:23:29,571
Do not drive, Putter

450
00:23:29,571 --> 00:23:30,683
The brake is broke

451
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,501
What?

452
00:23:32,841 --> 00:23:34,432
The brake is broke!

453
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,560
What's that?

454
00:23:37,276 --> 00:23:38,317
Nothing

455
00:23:38,562 --> 00:23:39,524
Everthings okay

456
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:42,231
Ready?

457
00:23:42,326 --> 00:23:43,096
Let's go
