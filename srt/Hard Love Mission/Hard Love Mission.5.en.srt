1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,907
This series is just a fictitious story. It’s not related to actual people, places, organizations, or real happening.

2
00:00:51,627 --> 00:00:53,366
Why do you think the brakes have a problem?

3
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:56,005
It’s a long story.

4
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:57,121
But I know

5
00:00:57,121 --> 00:00:58,642
the ATV has a problem

6
00:00:58,987 --> 00:01:01,101
What would Lip do that for?

7
00:01:01,892 --> 00:01:05,382
But I'm pretty sure
cuz I saw and heard it myself.

8
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:09,213
I want to do something fun
to save you from boredom.

9
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:14,923
Come on, let's paint.

10
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,944
That was great!

11
00:01:51,842 --> 00:01:53,512
Louis called.

12
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,802
Hi Louis

13
00:02:02,292 --> 00:02:03,210
Really?

14
00:02:03,738 --> 00:02:05,028
Congratulations

15
00:02:07,077 --> 00:02:07,577
Oh

16
00:02:08,023 --> 00:02:10,006
don't worry

17
00:02:11,224 --> 00:02:13,224
Let's talk again later

18
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,926
Bye

19
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:20,370
What did Louis say?

20
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,370
He said

21
00:02:23,303 --> 00:02:25,000
His foreign boyfriend

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,432
proposed to him

23
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,221
and invited him to live in Sweden together

24
00:02:29,276 --> 00:02:30,430
Oh

25
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,190
He will go or not?

26
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,056
I  think he will

27
00:02:34,482 --> 00:02:37,092
About next month.

28
00:02:37,254 --> 00:02:38,700
He called to tell me first.

29
00:02:40,688 --> 00:02:41,432
But...

30
00:02:41,736 --> 00:02:44,571
You have filming in Taiwan, China
next month,right?

31
00:02:45,281 --> 00:02:46,976
Will you be busy?

32
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:50,395
What's wrong with him?

33
00:02:50,395 --> 00:02:51,996
He comes and goes as he wishes

34
00:02:51,996 --> 00:02:53,468
and doesn't take care of you.

35
00:02:53,468 --> 00:02:55,265
Don't judge him

36
00:02:55,853 --> 00:02:57,502
I understand him.

37
00:02:57,502 --> 00:03:00,252
This opportunity doesn't come often.

38
00:03:01,043 --> 00:03:02,171
Maybe..

39
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:04,171
If you keep thinking doing it later

40
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,856
it never gonna happen.

41
00:03:07,363 --> 00:03:08,738
If i were him

42
00:03:09,286 --> 00:03:11,008
I will go too

43
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,418
You are a famous actor

44
00:03:15,392 --> 00:03:17,590
If you post for finding of a manager

45
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,590
Everyone of the whole country
will apply for it

46
00:03:19,874 --> 00:03:21,506
Are you kidding me?

47
00:03:21,506 --> 00:03:23,855
Managers are not easy to find.

48
00:03:24,017 --> 00:03:26,017
I need to look carefully.

49
00:03:26,687 --> 00:03:30,247
Finding a good and sincere manager

50
00:03:30,856 --> 00:03:32,473
is not really easy.

51
00:03:34,786 --> 00:03:35,789
Putter

52
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:37,607
Time for filming party scene.

53
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,493
Ohhhh!!!

54
00:03:39,493 --> 00:03:42,068
secretly made body paint together right here.

55
00:03:42,677 --> 00:03:44,301
It was so cute!

56
00:03:44,301 --> 00:03:45,348
Can I paint too?

57
00:03:45,348 --> 00:03:46,537
Putter

58
00:03:46,537 --> 00:03:48,424
Can you paint it for me?

59
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,962
Yes but...

60
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,000
Look at Yoshi's face first.

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If you're okay with that

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,127
I'll paint it for you.

63
00:03:58,533 --> 00:03:59,631
Haha

64
00:03:59,631 --> 00:04:00,936
Maybe later

65
00:04:00,936 --> 00:04:03,072
the director calls

66
00:04:03,072 --> 00:04:05,072
Let's hurry.

67
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:11,514
That's it!

68
00:04:12,792 --> 00:04:13,865
be cheerful

69
00:04:13,865 --> 00:04:15,865
Smile Vivi smile

70
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:17,996
Yoshi my bestie!!

71
00:04:17,996 --> 00:04:19,692
may I have the keys?

72
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,464
What?

73
00:04:21,464 --> 00:04:22,304
Putter will start filming

74
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,756
Why do you go back to the room?

75
00:04:23,756 --> 00:04:24,786
Ohh

76
00:04:24,786 --> 00:04:27,180
You can watch him alone.

77
00:04:27,586 --> 00:04:29,337
Give me the keys.

78
00:04:31,264 --> 00:04:33,125
or you mean???

79
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:33,891
shut up boy!

80
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,425
quickly

81
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,284
That's it!!

82
00:04:40,284 --> 00:04:43,040
I'm gone. Go on errands with him first.

83
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,737
Take care of him!

84
00:04:44,737 --> 00:04:45,914
Go on errands with that guy?

85
00:04:46,908 --> 00:04:48,442
Don't do anythings in the kitchen room

86
00:04:52,581 --> 00:04:55,000
Close up for me right here.

87
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,206
Smile

88
00:04:58,206 --> 00:04:59,455
Cheerful

89
00:04:59,455 --> 00:05:00,968
in the party

90
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,016
all right

91
00:05:07,926 --> 00:05:08,858
Okay

92
00:05:08,858 --> 00:05:10,858
Finished!

93
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:15,000
Finished shooting photo
but continue the party every body.

94
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:20,252
Hey!

95
00:05:20,982 --> 00:05:22,456
Why are you still staying here?

96
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:24,352
Why don't you go out?

97
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:29,106
Why are you talking like nothing happened?

98
00:05:30,952 --> 00:05:32,242
What the heck was that?

99
00:05:33,338 --> 00:05:35,559
are you crying huh?

100
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,536
Let me see

101
00:05:45,527 --> 00:05:46,914
stop indulge yourself

102
00:05:47,178 --> 00:05:48,028
Let's go back

103
00:05:48,028 --> 00:05:50,459
If Putter and Yoshi come back now,
I'll be jinxed.

104
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:53,311
No

105
00:05:54,345 --> 00:05:55,247
If I go

106
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:58,132
you will forget me.

107
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:02,186
Give me your phone

108
00:06:17,383 --> 00:06:18,356
There

109
00:06:19,614 --> 00:06:21,168
My phone number.

110
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:23,693
I don't usually give it to anyone.

111
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:26,907
go back to Bangkok and then call me.

112
00:06:26,907 --> 00:06:28,002
But you must go now.

113
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,691
Really?

114
00:06:29,914 --> 00:06:30,959
promise me.

115
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:33,780
promise

116
00:06:36,194 --> 00:06:37,376
OK

117
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,449
Let's go

118
00:06:48,732 --> 00:06:50,030
you already promised me.

119
00:07:24,157 --> 00:07:25,000
Hey

120
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,544
How did you get the spare key of this house?

121
00:07:27,544 --> 00:07:29,081
I took it from staff

122
00:07:29,223 --> 00:07:31,481
At first he refused.

123
00:07:31,846 --> 00:07:32,417
But

124
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:33,721
They remember Vivi.

125
00:07:33,985 --> 00:07:35,149
So I said

126
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:37,134
I'm Putter's manager

127
00:07:37,134 --> 00:07:40,000
and I lost the key, so they gave me the key.

128
00:07:41,136 --> 00:07:42,410
You are good.

129
00:07:42,775 --> 00:07:44,025
this

130
00:07:44,025 --> 00:07:46,381
Immediately put the pills in every bottle.

131
00:07:46,381 --> 00:07:48,381
then refrigerate

132
00:07:50,126 --> 00:07:50,944
then

133
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,799
Will they know?

134
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:55,529
Why is the bottle cap open?

135
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:57,367
They don't know

136
00:07:57,367 --> 00:07:59,137
Many people live in this house.

137
00:07:59,137 --> 00:08:01,363
They probably thought someone had opened it

138
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,847
and

139
00:08:02,847 --> 00:08:04,353
he probably got drunk

140
00:08:04,353 --> 00:08:05,774
and was thirsty

141
00:08:05,774 --> 00:08:07,508
so he drank it.

142
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:09,568
They wouldn't think a lot.

143
00:08:10,643 --> 00:08:11,836
Let's hurry!

144
00:08:28,295 --> 00:08:29,892
That's it

145
00:08:29,892 --> 00:08:32,017
if they come back to drink

146
00:08:32,017 --> 00:08:34,017
They're dead to the world.

147
00:08:34,605 --> 00:08:35,518
Sounds great!

148
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:36,697
Sure!

149
00:08:37,306 --> 00:08:39,331
They'll be back in an hour.

150
00:08:39,331 --> 00:08:40,680
We'll come back and look again.

151
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,743
At that time they're dead to the world.

152
00:08:44,413 --> 00:08:47,183
And then we'll let Vivi go into Putter room

153
00:08:47,487 --> 00:08:49,823
take off all Putter's clothes

154
00:08:49,823 --> 00:08:51,476
and take pictures of him.

155
00:08:51,476 --> 00:08:53,994
then when they wake up.

156
00:08:53,994 --> 00:08:56,492
They don't even know what happened.

157
00:08:57,648 --> 00:08:58,850
before knowing

158
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,770
All the pictures will have already been
published on social media.

159
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:02,670
right!

160
00:09:02,913 --> 00:09:03,776
Let's go

161
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:06,097
If someone comes, we will be in trouble.

162
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:06,880
Go!

163
00:09:11,526 --> 00:09:12,986
What the hell is that?

164
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:14,378
Me again?

165
00:09:14,378 --> 00:09:15,901
I know it first again.

166
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,742
Natasha!

167
00:09:19,574 --> 00:09:20,884
What can I do?

168
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,206
Putter

169
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,436
I think...

170
00:10:25,436 --> 00:10:27,436
I will go to bed.

171
00:10:27,698 --> 00:10:28,499
Oh

172
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:29,507
Why so early?

173
00:10:29,507 --> 00:10:32,048
Yesterday you still wanted to be together
for a long time.

174
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:33,705
Ummm...

175
00:10:33,705 --> 00:10:34,911
Well

176
00:10:34,911 --> 00:10:38,997
I've been tired for 2 whole days.

177
00:10:39,477 --> 00:10:40,683
and

178
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:45,280
I drank so I felt numb.

179
00:10:46,568 --> 00:10:49,484
You should probably go to sleep too.

180
00:10:49,484 --> 00:10:50,895
It's late.

181
00:10:51,113 --> 00:10:51,709
Ok

182
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:52,814
But

183
00:10:52,814 --> 00:10:54,163
You can go first.

184
00:10:54,163 --> 00:10:56,708
Me and Yoshi will stay for a while.

185
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:57,616
I'll be back soon.

186
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:59,158
Oh

187
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,446
Hurry

188
00:11:01,865 --> 00:11:03,045
get rest

189
00:11:03,045 --> 00:11:04,783
I'll go now

190
00:11:04,783 --> 00:11:05,369
See you soon

191
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:05,990
Bye

192
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,990
Bye bye

193
00:11:11,352 --> 00:11:12,805
What's that?

194
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:13,890
Why did she hurry to go back?

195
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,429
I wonder too.

196
00:11:16,538 --> 00:11:18,413
Yesterday she still wanted to be together with us.

197
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:19,681
Confused

198
00:11:23,653 --> 00:11:24,591
Well

199
00:11:25,224 --> 00:11:26,449
Are you sleepy?

200
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:29,169
If you feel sleepy, we can go back to sleep.

201
00:11:29,562 --> 00:11:31,779
No, not really.

202
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,818
so

203
00:11:33,866 --> 00:11:35,879
Shall we go for a walk?

204
00:11:36,206 --> 00:11:37,296
Yes

205
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,619
But can I wash my face first?

206
00:11:39,946 --> 00:11:41,144
Ok

207
00:11:41,144 --> 00:11:42,401
Let's go

208
00:12:12,048 --> 00:12:14,211
Yoshi, are you seeing anyone?

209
00:12:18,817 --> 00:12:20,899
Why are you asking like that?

210
00:12:21,961 --> 00:12:23,383
I want to know

211
00:12:23,383 --> 00:12:25,383
You just answer me.

212
00:12:27,544 --> 00:12:29,283
What if I don't tell you?

213
00:12:31,575 --> 00:12:33,014
If you don't

214
00:12:33,472 --> 00:12:35,191
I won't let you interview too

215
00:12:35,191 --> 00:12:36,526
when you ask me to.

216
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,165
No one.

217
00:12:44,283 --> 00:12:45,131
Really?

218
00:12:46,288 --> 00:12:47,176
Yes

219
00:12:48,988 --> 00:12:50,587
How about you?

220
00:12:51,853 --> 00:12:53,126
Are you seeing anyone?

221
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:56,466
Are you gonna start interviewing?

222
00:12:58,627 --> 00:12:59,508
Not yet.

223
00:12:59,508 --> 00:13:01,006
I want to know.

224
00:13:04,892 --> 00:13:06,392
Yes, I have one

225
00:13:11,413 --> 00:13:12,352
so

226
00:13:13,705 --> 00:13:14,842
who is he?

227
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,817
How long have you known or just acquainted?

228
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,971
I really like him for a very long time.

229
00:13:23,648 --> 00:13:26,055
I was very grateful to him.

230
00:13:27,048 --> 00:13:28,892
If it weren't for him.

231
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,756
Probably I wouldn't become a star today.

232
00:13:34,795 --> 00:13:38,756
You must really like him.

233
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,728
Yes, I really like him.

234
00:13:42,754 --> 00:13:44,458
He was a kind person

235
00:13:44,982 --> 00:13:46,468
who likes to help each others

236
00:13:47,048 --> 00:13:49,146
and thinks of others all the time.

237
00:13:49,735 --> 00:13:51,523
if possible

238
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:54,184
I want to be with him all the time.

239
00:13:57,481 --> 00:14:00,946
I wish you the best of luck!

240
00:14:06,535 --> 00:14:08,750
Can we go back?

241
00:14:10,191 --> 00:14:13,422
But we just sat for a moment.

242
00:14:14,492 --> 00:14:16,879
I still have a lot of my story to tell.

243
00:14:19,564 --> 00:14:21,736
I'm getting sleepy

244
00:14:22,048 --> 00:14:25,339
I drank a lot just now. I feel numb.

245
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:26,433
I want to go back.

246
00:14:27,677 --> 00:14:31,022
You can tell about it
when I'm actually interviewing.

247
00:14:32,157 --> 00:14:33,781
When will you interview me?

248
00:14:36,794 --> 00:14:38,198
Can it be tomorrow

249
00:14:38,198 --> 00:14:39,243
before going back to Bangkok?

250
00:14:39,942 --> 00:14:41,770
Will you have free time?

251
00:14:44,346 --> 00:14:45,169
All right

252
00:14:46,173 --> 00:14:48,285
I see that you took good care of me

253
00:14:48,285 --> 00:14:50,285
So I agree to give an interview.

254
00:14:51,573 --> 00:14:52,962
Thank you so much!

255
00:15:15,252 --> 00:15:16,730
Ohhh

256
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,880
Amphere!

257
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,418
why are you sitting here?

258
00:15:23,248 --> 00:15:24,580
Is there anything wrong?

259
00:15:25,235 --> 00:15:27,255
Yes, it's a big deal.

260
00:15:39,086 --> 00:15:40,776
Where have you been Vivi?

261
00:15:40,776 --> 00:15:41,864
You're always late

262
00:15:42,322 --> 00:15:43,960
I went to wash my face.

263
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:50,444
So how can you be sure

264
00:15:50,444 --> 00:15:53,471
that they will drink all the water in the refrigerator.

265
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:55,840
It's midnight.

266
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,840
They still need to drink some water.

267
00:15:58,588 --> 00:15:59,336
If

268
00:16:00,253 --> 00:16:02,995
What if they are still awake?

269
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,405
Then don't do anything

270
00:16:04,405 --> 00:16:05,532
You will just make a confused face

271
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:07,532
and say you entered the wrong room.

272
00:16:08,122 --> 00:16:08,754
That's it?

273
00:16:08,754 --> 00:16:09,641
Right! That's it!

274
00:16:09,641 --> 00:16:11,183
I'll go check it out

275
00:16:11,183 --> 00:16:12,790
whether they drink it or not.

276
00:16:22,354 --> 00:16:22,945
See?

277
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,746
They ran out

278
00:16:26,187 --> 00:16:29,142
Dead to the world!

279
00:16:29,884 --> 00:16:32,594
Not only one but 3 bottles.

280
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:33,822
Oh

281
00:16:33,822 --> 00:16:35,190
You silly girl

282
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,517
Who would drink 3 bottles of water alone

283
00:16:37,517 --> 00:16:39,517
and leave half of each?

284
00:16:41,176 --> 00:16:42,919
So how can you be sure

285
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,157
where is Putter's room?

286
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,285
Should be on the 3rd floor

287
00:16:49,285 --> 00:16:51,889
I remember his shoes.

288
00:16:54,421 --> 00:16:57,048
Let's go. What are you waiting for?

289
00:16:57,048 --> 00:16:57,548
Let's go

290
00:17:33,849 --> 00:17:35,208
Putter

291
00:17:35,448 --> 00:17:36,769
Putter

292
00:17:37,358 --> 00:17:38,638
Putter

293
00:18:14,974 --> 00:18:16,045
Vivi

294
00:18:16,853 --> 00:18:17,863
It's your time.

295
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:21,221
go get a towel

296
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:25,022
then take off your clothes.

297
00:18:27,402 --> 00:18:28,948
I don't want to do it.

298
00:18:29,385 --> 00:18:31,465
I pity him, Lip.

299
00:18:31,465 --> 00:18:32,861
Hey

300
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,759
Don't be such a baby right now.

301
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:36,836
Do what he said

302
00:18:36,836 --> 00:18:38,006
hurry up.

303
00:18:39,403 --> 00:18:40,915
If not, the pity person

304
00:18:40,915 --> 00:18:42,446
will be you.

305
00:18:42,446 --> 00:18:44,946
Cause I'll beat you.

306
00:18:54,835 --> 00:18:57,251
If we succeed

307
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,042
Your future will be fine.

308
00:19:01,003 --> 00:19:03,436
wish it success

309
00:19:04,986 --> 00:19:06,314
be patient

310
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,505
a little

311
00:19:19,922 --> 00:19:21,254
I'm really sorry Putter

312
00:19:21,254 --> 00:19:22,752
I don't want to do it.

313
00:19:22,752 --> 00:19:24,752
Really sorry.

314
00:19:31,061 --> 00:19:32,211
Oops!!!

315
00:19:33,281 --> 00:19:36,066
What's wrong with you Vivi?

316
00:19:37,463 --> 00:19:39,467
Putter

317
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:40,891
What's wrong with Putter?

318
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:42,501
He's awake

319
00:19:42,501 --> 00:19:43,171
Huh?

320
00:19:47,668 --> 00:19:49,436
I already knew all of your plan.

321
00:19:49,436 --> 00:19:51,523
Since putting the medicine in the water

322
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:52,737
I heard it all.

323
00:19:53,152 --> 00:19:53,950
Right

324
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,451
I've taken a clip

325
00:19:55,451 --> 00:19:57,649
of what are 3 of you doing with Putter.

326
00:19:57,649 --> 00:20:00,259
If I bring this evidence to the police

327
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:02,238
All of you will be in prison.

328
00:20:05,906 --> 00:20:06,621
Putter

329
00:20:07,385 --> 00:20:09,104
I'm sorry

330
00:20:09,104 --> 00:20:11,160
Don't make it a big deal.

331
00:20:11,684 --> 00:20:14,604
I didn't mean for it to happen. I'm sorry.

332
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,841
I'm really sorry Putter.

333
00:20:17,168 --> 00:20:18,753
I don't want to do this.

334
00:20:18,949 --> 00:20:19,967
Sorry

335
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:21,356
I'm so sorry.

336
00:20:21,618 --> 00:20:23,426
Why are you afraid now?

337
00:20:24,081 --> 00:20:26,014
When you did it, why weren't you afraid?

338
00:20:26,014 --> 00:20:28,005
You guys should go to jail.

339
00:20:28,704 --> 00:20:31,494
Then you'll remember it
and not to do it with other people again.

340
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,625
I'm sorry

341
00:20:33,974 --> 00:20:37,902
I feel guilty. It will not happen again.

342
00:20:37,902 --> 00:20:39,223
Please

343
00:20:40,249 --> 00:20:42,296
I can do anything for you.

344
00:20:42,296 --> 00:20:43,545
Please

345
00:20:43,545 --> 00:20:45,349
Don't tell the police.

346
00:20:45,349 --> 00:20:45,849
Oh!!!

347
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,970
Stop crying.

348
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,228
annoying

349
00:20:49,997 --> 00:20:50,766
Oh no!
