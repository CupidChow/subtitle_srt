00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,927
This series is just a fictitious story. It’s not related to actual people, places, organizations, or real happening.

2
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:52,905
Yoshi my bestie!!

3
00:00:52,905 --> 00:00:54,079
may I have the keys?

4
00:00:54,366 --> 00:00:55,701
stop indulging yourself

5
00:00:55,971 --> 00:00:56,805
Let's go back

6
00:00:56,805 --> 00:00:59,176
Putter and Yoshi will come soon
and I'd be jinxed if I were found out.

7
00:00:59,446 --> 00:01:03,116
Immediately put the pills in every bottle.

8
00:01:03,116 --> 00:01:04,375
then refrigerate them

9
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:05,845
Vivi

10
00:01:06,907 --> 00:01:07,966
It's your time.

11
00:01:08,539 --> 00:01:10,320
go get a towel

12
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:14,025
then take off your clothes.

13
00:01:15,306 --> 00:01:16,282
Oops!!!

14
00:01:17,395 --> 00:01:18,422
What's wrong with you Vivi?

15
00:01:18,675 --> 00:01:20,202
He's awake

16
00:01:20,202 --> 00:01:20,702
Huh?

17
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,079
I already know all of your plan.

18
00:01:27,264 --> 00:01:29,135
Since putting the medicine in the water

19
00:01:29,354 --> 00:01:30,570
I heard it all.

20
00:01:30,755 --> 00:01:31,465
Right

21
00:01:31,684 --> 00:01:33,261
I've taken a clip

22
00:01:33,261 --> 00:01:35,470
of what 3 of you are doing with Putter.

23
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:37,966
If I bring this evidence to the police

24
00:01:37,966 --> 00:01:40,011
All of you would be in prison.

25
00:01:42,844 --> 00:01:43,481
Putter

26
00:01:44,155 --> 00:01:46,159
I'm sorry

27
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,639
Don't make it a big deal.

28
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,248
I didn't mean for it to happen.

29
00:01:50,248 --> 00:01:51,506
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:53,680
I'm really sorry Putter.

31
00:01:54,203 --> 00:01:55,881
I don't want to do this.

32
00:01:55,881 --> 00:01:56,722
Sorry

33
00:01:56,722 --> 00:01:57,790
I'm so sorry.

34
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,000
Why are you afraid now?

35
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:02,866
When you did it, why weren't you afraid?

36
00:02:02,866 --> 00:02:05,085
You guys should go to jail.

37
00:02:05,523 --> 00:02:08,181
Then you will remember it
and not to do it with other people again.

38
00:02:08,501 --> 00:02:10,370
I'm sorry

39
00:02:10,657 --> 00:02:14,866
I feel guilty. It will not happen again.

40
00:02:14,866 --> 00:02:16,247
Please

41
00:02:17,174 --> 00:02:19,174
I can do anything for you.

42
00:02:19,174 --> 00:02:20,069
Please

43
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:22,074
Don't tell the police.

44
00:02:22,074 --> 00:02:22,961
Oh!!!

45
00:02:23,467 --> 00:02:24,877
Stop crying.

46
00:02:24,877 --> 00:02:25,967
annoying

47
00:02:26,827 --> 00:02:27,590
Oh no!

48
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:29,730
Three of you

49
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,466
Go away

50
00:02:32,793 --> 00:02:33,995
I will shoot you dead.

51
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:36,304
Pete

52
00:02:37,147 --> 00:02:38,827
Calm down please, Pete.

53
00:02:38,827 --> 00:02:39,798
trust me

54
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,623
Don't do like a storm in a teacup.

55
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,251
If I stop.

56
00:02:46,128 --> 00:02:47,726
I'm going to jail anyway.

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,346
Take it easy

58
00:02:52,346 --> 00:02:53,412
Relax and put it down.

59
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:56,157
Three of us

60
00:02:56,258 --> 00:02:57,613
No one will report this to the police.

61
00:02:58,287 --> 00:02:59,522
Relax

62
00:02:59,691 --> 00:03:00,895
Shut up!

63
00:03:01,232 --> 00:03:02,754
Three of you

64
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:03,995
back off

65
00:03:06,238 --> 00:03:06,904
Lip

66
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:09,378
tie their arms.

67
00:03:10,154 --> 00:03:11,579
Go get the phone

68
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:13,375
delete the clip.

69
00:03:13,544 --> 00:03:14,417
Hurry up!

70
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,579
OK

71
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:18,000
But don't shoot.

72
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,559
Hurry!

73
00:03:20,065 --> 00:03:20,910
Otherwise

74
00:03:21,197 --> 00:03:22,847
you will not be safe.

75
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:25,787
Ouch!!!

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,054
fake gun

77
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,203
Pete, hang in there.

78
00:03:39,496 --> 00:03:41,016
I'm sorry to all of you.

79
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,989
Don't report to the police.

80
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,989
I'm really repenting.

81
00:03:45,107 --> 00:03:46,011
We won't.

82
00:03:46,483 --> 00:03:48,361
But we will not delete the clip.

83
00:03:48,766 --> 00:03:50,026
We will keep this evidence

84
00:03:50,346 --> 00:03:52,728
so that you won't do this again

85
00:03:53,908 --> 00:03:55,176
As for Vivi

86
00:03:55,564 --> 00:03:56,339
I know

87
00:03:56,491 --> 00:03:58,491
you were forced.

88
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,254
don't be afraid

89
00:04:01,406 --> 00:04:03,909
Absolutely no bad news will be about you.

90
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:05,117
Relax

91
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:06,625
Thank you so much Putter.

92
00:04:06,929 --> 00:04:07,817
I promise

93
00:04:07,817 --> 00:04:09,817
I won't do this again.

94
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:12,758
I'm really sorry for all of it.

95
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,348
I will not anymore.

96
00:04:15,748 --> 00:04:16,656
I think

97
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,275
you better go get dressed Vivi.

98
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,393
I'm really sorry too.

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,273
It won't happen again.

100
00:04:26,273 --> 00:04:28,003
I apologize for all.

101
00:04:28,307 --> 00:04:30,915
But now can I take Pete to the hospital.

102
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,500
Pete

103
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:46,280
You're too kind

104
00:04:46,803 --> 00:04:48,805
You should put them in jail.

105
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:51,631
forget about it

106
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:55,225
All three of them must have learned this lesson.

107
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,041
Besides, we have already taken the clip.

108
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,796
If they do this again, we can report them.

109
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,000
Wowwwwwww!

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So pretty decent guy!

111
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:06,031
But

112
00:05:06,385 --> 00:05:08,011
You did the right thing

113
00:05:08,264 --> 00:05:10,532
I'm glad you didn't report them

114
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:12,694
especially Vivi.

115
00:05:13,284 --> 00:05:14,814
She's very pitiful.

116
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,910
She was forced to do things she didn't want to do.

117
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,769
Awwwwww

118
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:21,469
What the kind-hearted people.

119
00:05:21,891 --> 00:05:23,688
Up to you

120
00:05:23,688 --> 00:05:25,688
I go to sleep now

121
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:29,090
Watch out Putter!

122
00:05:33,386 --> 00:05:34,057
Oops!

123
00:05:34,462 --> 00:05:35,821
I forgot

124
00:05:38,334 --> 00:05:39,871
Didn't you pour out the water?

125
00:05:40,815 --> 00:05:42,251
No

126
00:05:42,251 --> 00:05:43,509
I'm afraid it would not look real

127
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,831
so I left the water in a half.

128
00:05:46,248 --> 00:05:47,614
Never mind

129
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,274
It's good

130
00:05:49,274 --> 00:05:50,888
now I can go to sleep well.

131
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:53,739
Dead to the world right?

132
00:05:54,177 --> 00:05:55,527
Nothing gonna happen

133
00:05:55,527 --> 00:05:57,089
Don't be serious.

134
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,133
Go for sleep

135
00:06:00,347 --> 00:06:01,101
Bye

136
00:06:01,489 --> 00:06:01,989
And then

137
00:06:01,989 --> 00:06:03,989
Huh???

138
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:05,095
Buddy

139
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:06,363
Amphere

140
00:06:07,442 --> 00:06:08,238
He just fell asleep

141
00:06:08,238 --> 00:06:08,899
Don't worry.

142
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:09,399
See you soon

143
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:09,899
I'm sleppy.

144
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:10,399
Hey?

145
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:12,000
Don't you help me first Amphere?

146
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:13,251
Amphere!

147
00:06:19,052 --> 00:06:19,724
Putter

148
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:22,100
Putter

149
00:06:28,575 --> 00:06:29,661
What can I do.

150
00:06:30,337 --> 00:06:31,509
3rd floor...

151
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:34,479
Can you sleep here?

152
00:10:15,597 --> 00:10:16,486
Yoshi.

153
00:10:25,137 --> 00:10:26,808
Why are you arranging stones like this?

154
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:29,502
Well,

155
00:10:30,253 --> 00:10:32,499
Koreans people believe that

156
00:10:32,634 --> 00:10:36,406
if we go somewhere and arrange the stones like this,

157
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,530
we will return there one more time.

158
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:40,602
Ahhh.

159
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:43,509
Want to try?

160
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:45,479
Um.

161
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:46,613
Nah.

162
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,588
I don't believe this.

163
00:10:55,502 --> 00:10:56,679
Today's weather is good

164
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,536
Do you want to do the interview?

165
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:00,442
Alright.

166
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:01,760
You're ready?

167
00:11:02,316 --> 00:11:03,730
I go get my stuff first.

168
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,363
Sure.

169
00:11:04,513 --> 00:11:05,642
I'll wait here.
