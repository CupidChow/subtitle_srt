00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,020
Episode 35

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,160
Your Highness.

4
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,180
Gu Qishao has been

5
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,330
in his valley these days.

6
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,390
He hasn’t gone out.

7
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,400
What about

8
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,740
Yunxi?

9
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,100
Her Highness has been developing

10
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,050
the antidote for poisonous Gu

11
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:16,820
with Poison Master

12
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,860
round the clock.

13
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,480
She has fallen ill.

14
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:21,920
Your Highness.

15
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,490
I know I shouldn’t

16
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,320
ask this,

17
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,410
but I heard that Her Highness

18
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,030
visited you a few days ago.

19
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,400
Why did you drive her away?

20
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,340
I really don’t get it.

21
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,660
Poison Master is sinful,

22
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,030
but Her Highness isn’t.

23
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,010
Your Highness, you’ve always

24
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,180
drawn a clear line between right and wrong.

25
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,360
But why can’t you

26
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,530
forgive Her Highness?

27
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,450
Hatred or love,

28
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,650
I know exactly how I feel.

29
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,570
That’s to say,

30
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:51,780
Your Highness still

31
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,240
cares about Her Highness.

32
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,190
If so,

33
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,700
why not get her back here,

34
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,880
instead of torturing each other?

35
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,030
Poisonous Gu has no cure.

36
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,650
Life is long.

37
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,370
Since I can’t give her

38
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,490
a happy life,

39
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,230
I may as well just stop this relationship.

40
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,110
Xifeng,

41
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,200
I can’t.

42
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,700
Perhaps

43
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,870
the best choice is to let her go.

44
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:33,860
So,

45
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,910
Poison Master is really in Yaogui Valley.

46
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,400
Yunxi,

47
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,530
you are awake.

48
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,450
Here,

49
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,190
take this medicine first.

50
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,950
It’ll help you recover quicker.

51
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,060
You don’t need to keep me company.

52
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,520
You should take some rest.

53
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,740
You know what?

54
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,020
I feel happy even just

55
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,540
looking at you like this.

56
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,070
It’s a pity

57
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,900
that I wasn’t around watching you growing up.

58
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,780
I even failed

59
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,030
in protecting your mother.

60
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,130
I just dreamed

61
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,579
that I developed the cure successfully,

62
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:48,910
and you also made peace with His Highness.

63
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,900
Yunxi,

64
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,079
you really love Long Feiye that much?

65
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:55,780
I gotta

66
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,700
cure him,

67
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,050
even if it may

68
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:58,990
cost my life.

69
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,740
Okay.

70
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,990
I still have a solution.

71
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,490
I’ll tell you

72
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,720
after you recover.

73
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,280
Really?

74
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,200
There’s hope,

75
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,560
but I can’t promise you anything.

76
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,990
I also need to think about

77
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,990
how to confect it.

78
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,950
I’ll give it a try.

79
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,360
But,

80
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,079
you’ve got to take good care of yourself.

81
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:27,070
Dad, don’t lie to me.

82
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:29,990
Yunxi,

83
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,280
you called me dad.

84
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,490
I’m so happy.

85
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,200
Dad,

86
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,450
go get some rest.

87
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,370
I’ll count on you to make the antidote.

88
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,240
Okay.

89
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,970
I’ll help you

90
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,070
cure Long Feiye.

91
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,190
Daughter,

92
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:29,820
in exchange

93
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,150
for your happiness,

94
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:34,790
I’m willing to sacrifice everything,

95
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,650
even if…

96
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,820
What secret is hidden

97
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,240
in the Poisoning Manual exactly?

98
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,280
No.

99
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,980
I need to go to Yaogui Valley.

100
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,110
I gotta find Poison Master

101
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,620
before Han Yunxi does

102
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,390
to develop the antidote

103
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,320
and save Feiye’s life.

104
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,360
Miss.

105
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,650
Go gather all the people.

106
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,420
We’ll go to Yaogui Valley

107
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,660
to catch Poison Master.

108
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,650
It’s said

109
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,370
that the valley

110
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,570
is protected by poison shield.

111
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,500
Outsiders can hardly get in there.

112
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,990
We just need to wait

113
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,190
outside of the valley.

114
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,150
Yes.

115
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,610
Han Yunxi.

116
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,990
You won’t defeat me.

117
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,890
If Beili and Xiqiu

118
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,020
really have allied,

119
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,320
and if they

120
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,920
work together with Tianning,

121
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,840
we’ll be attacked front and rear.

122
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,820
Minister Sun,

123
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,880
it’s not a good timing.

124
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,940
Let the old troops in the Southern Regions
stay put first.

125
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,860
Between Beili and Xiqiu,

126
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,620
we’ve got to take out one first.

127
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,360
Yes.

128
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,820
I’ll go back to the Southern Regions tomorrow

129
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,300
and continue to train soldiers.

130
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,700
I’ll wait for your order.

131
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,480
Enjoying yourself, adviser?

132
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,010
Mr. Chu, thank you for coming.

133
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:21,810
It’s alright.

134
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,970
I’m here to deliver

135
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,370
His Highness’s message.

136
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,910
Adviser, you may as well

137
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,190
speak out your mind.

138
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,990
To be honest,

139
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,040
after second prince died,

140
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,460
His Majesty assigned all the people

141
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,120
who used to serve second prince to Crown Prince.

142
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,750
But everybody knows

143
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,650
how Crown Prince

144
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:42,780
treats us.

145
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,140
We’ve also been looking for a chance

146
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,070
to take revenge.

147
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,830
So I visited His Highness last time

148
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,760
and expressed our intention.

149
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,010
If His Highness

150
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,070
can take us in,

151
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:53,990
we’ll

152
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,070
disregard our safety

153
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,690
to serve His Highness

154
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,110
until we die.

155
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,570
I know what you mean.

156
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,560
His Highness also said

157
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,900
that Noble Consort Xiao risked her life at last,

158
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,780
which proves

159
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,780
what you said is true.

160
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,950
So, His Highness will…

161
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,450
At this point,

162
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,700
you still don’t get it?

163
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,360
Thanks His Highness.

164
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,990
And, thank you.

165
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:26,930
You are welcome.

166
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:27,700
By the way,

167
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,090
second prince

168
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,490
once caught Jun Yizheng,

169
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,420
who is stuck in Tianning right now.

170
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,950
The troops are still there.

171
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,110
Please help to ask His Highness

172
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,150
how we should handle it.

173
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,450
Okay.

174
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,409
I will report it to His Highness.

175
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:42,240
Don’t worry.

176
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,030
Thank you so much.

177
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:45,450
See you.

178
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,110
Uncle.

179
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,140
Thanks to your advice before death,

180
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,700
only using the spies

181
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,290
planted beside them

182
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,150
as a last resort.

183
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,700
And now,

184
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,650
I’ve finally avenged you.

185
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,110
You and my mother

186
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,860
can finally rest in peace.

187
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,150
Greetings, Your Highness.

188
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,360
Here’s my order.

189
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,130
The spies planted

190
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,820
beside Noble Consort Xiao and second prince

191
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,280
can be pulled back now.

192
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:28,780
Yes.

193
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,400
Your Highness,

194
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,380
most of Long Tianqing’s people

195
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,780
have submitted to us now.

196
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,299
According to his men,

197
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,700
Long Tianqing once imprisoned

198
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,900
Jun Yizheng, the Crown Prince of Beili.

199
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:43,030
Now that Long Tianqing is dead,

200
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:43,990
how will you

201
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,820
deal with Jun Yizheng?

202
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,610
Jun Yizheng.

203
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,240
I’d like to meet him.

204
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,400
Feiye.

205
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,380
Brother, we are back.

206
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,820
Everything went well?

207
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,530
Yes.

208
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,570
Ningjing and I disguised as locals

209
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,570
in the Southern Regions.

210
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,490
We got lots of useful information

211
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,650
in the tavern.

212
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,240
Hey, that was my idea.

213
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,200
We found

214
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,410
that Xiqiu and Beili

215
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,650
have been very close lately.

216
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,770
Especially Xiqiu,

217
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,620
it often sends envoys to visit Beili.

218
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,250
I think

219
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:15,890
your judgment

220
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:16,810
is right, brother.

221
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:17,650
They must have

222
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,740
allied in secret.

223
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,660
But according to our observations,

224
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,810
though they’ve allied,

225
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,530
they still guard against each other.

226
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,130
It’s hardly a mutual exchange

227
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,330
between the two.

228
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,130
I think

229
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,330
we can find a chance

230
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,990
to sabotage their relations.

231
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,450
Beili borders

232
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,640
the Southern Regions.

233
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,100
If Tianning sees a civil war,

234
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,660
even if they hold different hidden agenda,

235
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,780
they’d still join hands

236
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,310
to fish in troubled waters.

237
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,220
If we want to succeed,

238
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,360
we must appease Beili first,

239
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,530
then contain Xiqiu.

240
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,110
Tang Li.

241
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,620
Here’s a chance for you to contribute.

242
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,420
Do you want it?

243
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,370
To contribute?

244
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,570
Of course.

245
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,650
You said yes

246
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,020
before knowing what it was?

247
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,090
What if you mess it up?

248
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:05,730
Can’t you just

249
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,930
have some faith in me?

250
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,190
Jun Yizheng, the Crown Prince of Beili,

251
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,640
is imprisoned in the capital.

252
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,110
I want you to go save him.

253
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,950
Just me by myself?

254
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,680
Brother, you and Xifeng won’t go with me?

255
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,420
You are not a kid anymore.

256
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,320
You need to learn to think

257
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,680
and deal with things independently.

258
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,030
Tang Li.

259
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,650
What?

260
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,240
To be honest,

261
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,190
I don’t believe you can make it.

262
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,810
Compared with Feiye,

263
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,130
you are so much less experienced.

264
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,330
You are the one who does far more harm than good.

265
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:39,820
Feiye,

266
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,530
let me do it.

267
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,200
Don’t look down on me.

268
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,410
I’ll do it,

269
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,290
and I’ll show you

270
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,030
I can make it.

271
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,570
I’m looking forward to your success.

272
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,570
I’ll go right now.

273
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,950
Feiye,

274
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,570
will he get hurt?

275
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,630
Whether he’ll make it or not

276
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,670
doesn’t matter.

277
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,220
What matters is the process.

278
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:07,990
Feiye,

279
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,650
you are indeed an old fox…

280
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:12,950
No.

281
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,740
I mean you are so thoughtful.

282
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,740
Very thoughtful.

283
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,760
Hope Tang Li can grow as soon as possible.

284
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,200
Your Highness!

285
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,140
Why are you so panic?

286
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:27,990
My fault.

287
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,460
Your Highness,

288
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,410
the guards at the gate

289
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,610
suddenly retreated.

290
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,700
All of them?

291
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,150
I don’t know why.

292
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,490
Whatever the reason is,

293
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,450
we better go now.

294
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:43,950
Let’s go.

295
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:44,650
Yes.

296
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,080
Why does the Crown Prince of Beili

297
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,530
look so pathetic?

298
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:04,950
Who are you?

299
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,030
Relax.

300
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,320
I’m Long Tianmo,

301
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,200
the Crown Prince of Tianning.

302
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,010
My second brother

303
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,610
had known you for a long time.

304
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,190
I’m here

305
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,190
to fulfill his last wish.

306
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,570
So you are

307
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,020
the Crown Prince of Tianning.

308
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,950
Sorry that I didn’t recognize you.

309
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,390
Second prince imprisoned me here.

310
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,740
I felt so angry about it all the time.

311
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,190
Why did I hear

312
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,950
that you’ve long colluded

313
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,900
with my second brother?

314
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,070
Your Highness,

315
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,200
enemies don’t last,

316
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,110
only interests do.

317
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,950
Now that second prince has died,

318
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,320
I’m willing to work with you.

319
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,150
What

320
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,780
do you say?

321
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,360
It depends on your sincerity.

322
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,610
If you let me return to Beili,

323
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,650
I’ll pay you back

324
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,700
by telling you a big secret

325
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,240
that relates to your safety.

326
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,150
I never like to wait.

327
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,030
Say it,

328
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,820
or I’ll bury your secret

329
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,900
with you in the coffin!

330
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:30,650
This is how you deal with things

331
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,380
as the Crown Prince of Tianning?

332
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,610
You are in Tianning,

333
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,320
so I’m the boss.

334
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,210
I have other

335
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,270
highhanded means.

336
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,620
Would you like to try?

337
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,360
Now!

338
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,570
Wait!

339
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,400
Say it!

340
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,690
Do you know the chief culprit

341
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:49,900
who poisoned you?

342
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,820
It’s your father’s

343
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,280
favorite concubine,

344
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,070
Chu Qingge.

345
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,490
You’ll be dead meat soon,

346
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,380
yet you are still trying to sow discord.

347
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,090
You are trying

348
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,100
to sabotage my relationship with Concubine Qing,

349
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,150
and put Tianning in chaos.

350
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,610
But you don’t know

351
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,330
that Concubine Qing actually

352
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,650
saved my life.

353
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,570
Now your plan

354
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:13,610
is failed, isn’t it?

355
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,400
Guards!

356
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,010
Behead this bastard

357
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,820
from Beili!

358
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,050
Think twice, Your Highness!

359
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:19,740
Shut up!

360
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,320
Do it!

361
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,620
Your Highness, come with me!

362
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:58,740
Stop them!

363
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,760
Protect His Highness!

364
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,760
Get in the room.

365
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,110
May I ask who you are?

366
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,490
How shall I

367
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,550
return your favor?

368
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,530
I’m Tang Li, a subordinate

369
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,300
of Prince Qin of Tianning.

370
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,570
I’m commanded to escort Your Highness

371
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,030
to return to Beili safely.

372
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,240
Prince Qin?

373
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,700
Yes.

374
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:39,970
Prince Qin

375
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,380
always wants to ally with Beili.

376
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,840
But there wasn’t a chance.

377
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,210
This time, the Crown Prince tried to kill you.

378
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:45,930
Prince Qin didn’t want to ruin

379
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,220
the friendship between our two countries.

380
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,650
So he asked me to save you

381
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,250
and escort you back to Beili.

382
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,570
Don’t bother,

383
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,740
brother Tang Li.

384
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,020
Since I’ve gotten out of the danger,

385
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,180
and I also have something important to do,

386
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,320
with these guards

387
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,650
and extra cautiousness,

388
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,070
I think I’ll be fine.

389
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,650
Please

390
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,530
say thanks

391
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,780
to Prince Qin for me.

392
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,240
Fine.

393
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,410
But,

394
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,610
I’m afraid Crown Prince won’t let you go
so easily.

395
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,540
He’ll search everywhere in the city.

396
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,340
How about this?

397
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,130
I’ll spread the news

398
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,540
that you’ve returned to Beili,

399
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,620
then you can go deal with your business.

400
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,490
That’s very thoughtful of you.

401
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:26,810
Your Highness, don’t worry.

402
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,090
Thought this house is old,

403
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,090
it’s a safe place.

404
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,950
You can spend the night here.

405
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,530
Okay.

406
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,360
Why did he save me?

407
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,450
I think

408
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,550
Prince Qin does this to contain Crown Prince.

409
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,450
Go back

410
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,450
to tell Prince Qin

411
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,850
that the mission is done.

412
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,970
I’ll stay here to keep an eye

413
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,570
on Jun Yizheng’s moves.

414
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:01,820
Yes.

415
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,240
Gu Qishao!

416
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,030
You son of a bitch!

417
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,330
What I’ve suffered today

418
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,190
is all because of you!

419
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,610
You made me suffer,

420
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,030
so I won’t let you off!

421
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,280
I will

422
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,610
make you suffer

423
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,190
thousands of times more!

424
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,640
Your Highness,

425
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,260
second prince is in Yaogui Valley.

426
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,820
Shall we go find him?

427
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,010
Second prince?

428
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,670
How can he deserve that title?

429
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:55,970
His mother was a lowlife maid!

430
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,610
So he’s a lowlife, too!

431
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,530
Got it?

432
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,610
Gu Qishao.

433
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,910
You want to bury your mother in the imperial tomb?

434
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,530
Dream on!

435
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,610
Stay here to ambush.

436
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,030
I’ll go check it.

437
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,070
Don’t, Miss.

438
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,570
I’m concerned about your safety.

439
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,610
If anything happens,

440
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:53,990
I’ll call you loudly.

441
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:04,700
Leader.

442
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,690
You summoned me all of a sudden.

443
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,140
There must be something important.

444
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,780
I only want you to do me a favor.

445
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,030
After I die,

446
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,430
please take good care of Yunxi.

447
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,780
Don’t let

448
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,780
anybody bully her.

449
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,280
Leader, why do you…

450
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,450
So he is Poison Master.

451
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,740
I once said

452
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,030
there was no cure for poisonous Gu,

453
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,440
I meant there was no effective medicine.

454
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,570
But, there actually is an antidote for it.

455
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,190
What is it?

456
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:40,700
The antidote for poisonous Gu is right here.

457
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,100
The heart blood of Poison Master’s family

458
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,570
is the only antidote.

459
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,490
The antidote can only be made

460
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,400
by taking out of my heart.

461
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,160
Leader, please don’t!

462
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,030
I’ve made up my mind.

463
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,370
I only hope you can

464
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,900
do me the favor I just asked.

465
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,930
Take this message to Prince Qin.

466
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:05,740
I will tell him

467
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,450
the details tomorrow in Xuanyuan Temple.

468
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,060
The heart blood of Poison Master’s family

469
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,360
is the only antidote.

470
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,990
While Han Yunxi is his daughter.

471
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,990
So if I kill Poison Master…

472
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,200
Han Yunxi,

473
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,240
you’ll be dead for sure.

474
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:54,780
Your Highness,

475
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,990
everything is ready.

476
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,490
Crown Prince has stopped the search.

477
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,750
You can go take care of your business now.

478
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,460
Thank you, brother Tang Li.

479
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,650
Without your help,

480
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,770
I might have

481
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,240
been dead here.

482
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:06,970
I just

483
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,410
fulfilled my duty

484
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,330
according to

485
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,610
Prince Qin’s order.

486
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,090
Please say thanks

487
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,320
to Prince Qin for me.

488
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,160
I will return the favor in the future.

489
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,530
So, brother Tang Li,

490
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,700
I’ll leave, then.

491
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,790
With so many guards,

492
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,930
yet Jun Yizheng still managed

493
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:38,990
to return to Beili?

494
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,610
A bunch of rubbish!

495
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,330
What’s the use of you people?

496
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,200
Your Highness, don’t be mad.

497
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,310
After all, he’s the Crown Prince of Beili.

498
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,200
If you killed him,

499
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,410
the two countries

500
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,240
would be at war.

501
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,250
The relationship between His Majesty and you

502
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,610
are getting closer.

503
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,540
If the two countries had a war

504
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,490
because of you,

505
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,130
it wouldn’t

506
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,900
do you any good.

507
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,760
So I should just let him go?

508
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,070
I can’t stand it.

509
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,440
Your Highness,

510
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,610
it’ll never be too late to take revenge.

511
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:18,650
But…

512
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,030
Just say it.

513
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,400
But the Crown Prince of Beili said

514
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,750
that Concubine Qing

515
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,130
is the one who poisoned you.

516
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:31,930
So, you’ve got

517
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,450
to be careful in the future.

518
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,360
Are you getting old and confused?

519
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,700
You think I’m the same

520
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,820
as those rubbish

521
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,670
who can’t tell what’s right and wrong?

522
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,070
Concubine Qing arrives.

523
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,530
Your Highness.

524
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,140
Your Highness. What brought you here?

525
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:58,820
What?

526
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,650
You don’t want to see me?

527
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:01,710
I didn’t mean that.

528
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,280
Do you feel better today?

529
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,450
Much better.

530
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,370
I think I’ll be

531
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:07,140
fully recovered

532
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,110
in a few days.

533
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,360
That’s good.

534
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,610
I brought you

535
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,780
a rare millennium ginseng.

536
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,490
It works well

537
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:16,820
in one’s recuperation.

538
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,200
You are recovering right now.

539
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,190
So you’ve got to take good care.

540
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,120
Thank you, Your Highness.

541
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,290
Okay.

542
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:27,070
Now that it’s been delivered,

543
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,700
I’ll go visit His Majesty.

544
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,950
His Majesty has been feeling blue recently.

545
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,010
I’ll try to find a chance

546
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,110
to recommend you in a few days.

547
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,060
Thank you, Your Highness.

548
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,740
I’ll never forget the big favor

549
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,450
you’ve done for me.

550
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,570
Madam.

551
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,860
Yes.

552
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,450
See that?

553
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,030
She’s so good to me.

554
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,110
How would she try to kill me?

555
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,930
His Majesty is in his heyday.

556
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:06,890
There will probably be decades

557
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,620
before you can take the throne.

558
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,840
During which time,

559
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:15,320
if another prince is born,

560
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,070
and of a favored concubine,

561
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,320
I’m afraid you’ll lose your chance.

562
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,580
Your Highness, you’ve got

563
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,030
to be prepared.

564
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,740
We may take this chance

565
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,150
to crack down

566
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,700
on Prince Qin as a matter of course.

567
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,530
Even if

568
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,700
we can’t kill him,

569
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,320
but Crown Prince is the future emperor.

570
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,700
Since he hurts Crown Prince,

571
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,990
we can demote him

572
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,610
to a civilian, right?

573
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,130
The death of Han Cong’an alone

574
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,200
is not enough.

575
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,710
The lives of his entire family…

576
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,030
Maybe when I die,

577
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,450
he’s still sitting

578
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,740
on the throne.

579
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:43,570
No.

580
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,740
I can’t wait anymore.

581
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,130
Brother,

582
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,010
I’m sure

583
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:49,970
the Crown Prince of Beili

584
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:50,450
fully trusts

585
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,530
me now.

586
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:54,730
It’s true.

587
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:55,770
When they left,

588
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:56,450
he expressed

589
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:57,290
his gratitude

590
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,210
over and over again.

591
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:00,100
He also said he’d return the favor.

592
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,010
Can’t believe

593
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,470
that you are that capable.

594
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,350
Brother,

595
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,890
Jun Yizheng went to Yaogui Valley.

596
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:06,740
I also eavesdropped

597
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,980
that Gu Qishao is his brother,

598
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,170
the second prince of Beili.

599
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,430
He has been on bad terms with Jun Yizheng.

600
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,900
As a prince of Beili,

601
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,800
he came to Tianning to be a spy.

602
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,150
I think he approaches Han Yunxi

603
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,330
to get information

604
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,700
on our side.

605
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,440
Your Highness,

606
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,820
Her Highness is still in the valley.

607
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,220
Get our men and horses ready.

608
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,020
Let’s set out for Yaogui Valley.

609
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:38,650
Dad.

610
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,540
You are looking for me?

611
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,000
How’s the antidote going?

612
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,150
I’m still trying

613
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,870
to figure out what to do.

614
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,320
Is there a problem?

615
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,030
Not a big one.

616
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,490
It’s missing one herb.

617
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,280
It’s okay.

618
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,170
Yaogui Valley has all kinds of herbs.

619
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:57,890
What is that?

620
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:58,750
I’ll go find it.

621
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,110
The herb is called

622
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,110
poisonous Zhenboye.

623
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,570
It takes 30 years to blossom

624
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:05,340
and another 30 years to yield fruits.

625
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,940
I’ve searched the Herb Land,

626
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,360
but I didn’t find it.

627
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,150
Then what shall we do?

628
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,780
But, as far as I can remember,

629
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,610
there are a few on the cliff of the back hill.

630
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:18,900
Okay,

631
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,770
I’ll go get some.

632
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:20,700
See you, dad.

633
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,930
Your Highness,

634
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,620
Physician Gu Beiyue is here to see you.

635
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,460
Your Highness.

636
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:41,930
Yes.

637
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,730
This is a message from my leader.

638
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,530
“The antidote for poisonous Gu is ready.

639
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,570
Let’s meet at noon today.

640
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:55,860
I’ll cure you.

641
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,600
It’s an urgent matter.

642
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,320
Your Highness, please

643
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,860
meet me on time.”

644
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,180
My leader asked me to tell you

645
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,940
he’ll wait for you in Xuanyuan Temple today.

646
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,320
Please be there on time.

647
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,780
Physician Gu, do you know

648
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,180
Gu Qishao is the second prince of Beili?

649
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,820
Yunxi is in Yaogui Valley right now.

650
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,940
I’m quite concerned about her safety.

651
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,470
The second prince of Beili?

652
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,820
Your Highness, don’t worry.

653
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,700
Since Her Highness is my leader’s daughter,

654
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,230
she’s also my young master.

655
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,990
I will keep her safe.

656
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,620
Thank you in advance, Physician Gu.

657
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,250
Xifeng, Ningjing and Tang Li

658
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,510
will go there with you.

659
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:35,900
Okay.

660
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,610
You’ll wake up

661
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,860
in a few days.

662
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,380
Poison girl.

663
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,290
Where are you going?

664
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,410
I’ll go to the back hill

665
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,180
to collect a poisonous herb called Zhenboye.

666
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,780
There’s no such herb in here.

667
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,450
No way.

668
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,420
My dad said he saw it in person.

669
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,810
I’m the owner of this place.

670
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:25,690
I know exactly what herbs

671
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:26,570
we have here.

672
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,250
Besides,

673
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,570
Zhenboye is a rare herb,

674
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,570
if there was any,

675
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:32,770
I’d of course know it.

676
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:37,820
Dad…

677
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,450
Dad!

678
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,530
Dad!

679
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,530
Where is he?

680
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,110
“Yunxi,

681
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,190
my precious daughter.

682
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,540
I’ve left to meet Long Feiye.

683
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:31,990
I knew

684
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,030
you’d stop me,

685
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,970
so I had to lie

686
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,630
to distract you and then left.

687
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,450
Hope you can forgive me.

688
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,950
Also, hope when you come back,

689
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,780
I’ve made up for all my sins.

690
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,700
Last words from your useless father.”

691
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:49,950
Poison girl!

692
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:46,860
Dad.

693
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,650
What is going on?

694
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,240
Why did you leave such a note?

695
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,770
You said

696
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,860
you’d stay by my side forever.

697
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,530
Why did you

698
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:01,820
come and go like this?

699
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,490
Why?

700
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,360
Dad.

701
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,450
Where are you?

702
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,700
Please come out.

703
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,680
Why are you crying?

704
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:18,780
♫ Lovesickness and heartbroken ♫

705
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,740
♫ Put some fleece-flower root on the paper ♫

706
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,610
Your dad…

707
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,030
Does my dad

708
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,360
want to abandon me?

709
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,030
What does “last words” mean?

710
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,830
Why would he want to meet His Highness?

711
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,720
I think I won’t be able to see him again

712
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,030
after he left this time.

713
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,110
Don’t be sad.

714
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,700
I’ll help you find him.

715
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,290
Your Highness.

716
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:53,420
They are over there.

717
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,990
What are you doing here?

718
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,320
Who is this woman?

719
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,410
Zhuyu?

720
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:10,210
Qishao,

721
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,090
just wake up and forget

722
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,180
your obsession with her.

723
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,130
You know clearly

724
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,200
it won’t work out.

725
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,010
Don’t forget your mission.

726
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:16,650
Don’t forget

727
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:17,940
sister Baisu’s expectations.

728
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,340
Qishao, I’m begging you.

729
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,240
Stop talking.

730
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,420
Your Highness.

731
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,530
She is Han Yunxi,

732
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,330
Poison Master’s daughter,

733
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:24,590
and Prince Qin’s wife.

734
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,400
Zhuyu!

735
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,900
Seems I’ll harvest a lot this time.

736
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:34,650
Guards,

737
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,210
catch

738
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:37,320
these two.

739
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,240
Yes!

740
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,210
Who are they?

741
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,540
Why would they catch us?

742
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,740
Jun Yizheng,

743
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,490
she’s innocent.

744
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,230
Who gives you the right to order me around?

745
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,970
Looks like she

746
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,170
still has no idea

747
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,650
who Gu Qishao really is.

748
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,570
Watch carefully.

749
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,360
This man

750
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,810
is a spy sent to Tianning

751
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:02,570
by our Beili.

752
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,450
You think he approaches you

753
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,650
because he likes you?

754
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,110
What he likes

755
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,330
is just your identity

756
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:10,110
as Princess Qin.

757
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,989
Because he can only

758
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,330
get information about Prince Qin

759
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:16,130
through you.

760
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,130
It’s impossible.

761
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,710
I don’t believe you.

762
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:21,820
Gu Qishao.

763
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,150
Look at me

764
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:25,610
and tell me

765
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,199
he’s lying.

766
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,530
I’ll believe you.

767
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,699
Tell me!

768
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,030
Poison girl, trust me,

769
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:37,900
it’s all my fault.

770
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,100
But it has nothing to do with you.

771
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,699
Gu Qishao.

772
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,239
I see you as my real friend.

773
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,889
Why did you use me?

774
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:47,360
Why did you lie to me?

775
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,570
That’s enough.

776
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:50,860
Stop the acting.

777
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:51,989
Now, tell me,

778
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,350
where’s Poison Master?

779
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,610
He’s left.

780
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,650
Left?

781
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,360
How useless you are.

782
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,170
You just let him slip away under your watch?

783
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:02,570
You are so worthless!

784
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,740
But with this girl in my hands,

785
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,450
not only Poison Master,

786
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:11,820
but also the Ares Prince Qin

787
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,930
can be used by me.

788
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:14,860
Don’t you dare!

789
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,400
Why not?

790
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,570
Gu Qishao,

791
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,990
don’t forget

792
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,130
that your mother’s ashes

793
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:21,610
are still in Beili.

794
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,440
You don’t want to clear her name anymore?

795
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,070
Guards.

796
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,210
Catch Han Yunxi.

797
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:28,990
Yes.

798
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:54,780
Guards.

799
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,820
Catch them both.

800
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:43,730
Brother Tang Li.

801
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:44,590
Your Highness.

802
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,190
Are you going back to Beili?

803
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,320
Yes.

804
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,440
I’ll welcome you in person

805
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,740
if you go to Beili one day.

806
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,450
Thank you.

807
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,110
Your Highness.

808
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,180
What kind of treasure

809
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,900
do you have in here?

810
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,490
Just some

811
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:15,740
common herbs.

812
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,400
Herbs?

813
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,520
It’s Her Highness!

814
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:28,700
Stop!

815
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,700
Let them put down the weapons

816
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,200
if you wanna live.

817
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,530
Put it down.

818
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,780
Miss!

819
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:00,650
Miss!

820
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,260
Physician Gu!

821
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,210
Where’s my father?

822
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:05,100
Please take me to him.

823
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,490
Okay. Let’s go.

824
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:07,110
Come on.

825
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,280
I’ll leave first with her.

826
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,280
Go.

827
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,030
From now on,

828
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,740
Beili and Prince Qin are enemies!

829
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,700
You requite kindness with enmity!

830
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,980
The Prince Qin’s Mansion

831
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,100
will no longer have any contact with

832
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,300
a wicked man like you!

833
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,610
It’s you.

834
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,870
Mister, you know me?

835
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,930
You are the girl

836
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:49,260
who keeps Beauty Blood.

837
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,400
Days ago,

838
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,540
you got Poison Sha in Heaven Pit.

839
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,150
I cured you.

840
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,900
Thought I was in a comma,

841
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,610
I can still recall

842
00:39:58,610 --> 00:39:59,700
how you cured me.

843
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,190
Thank you, Minster.

844
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,450
Miss, why are you here?

845
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,080
I guess you are Poison Master, right?

846
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,860
To be honest,

847
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,340
I’m Prince Qin Long Feiye’s sister.

848
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,250
My brother told me

849
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,950
he’d meet you here today.

850
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,160
I’m really worried about my brother,

851
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,650
so I have a few questions

852
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,150
to ask you.

853
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,030
Since you are Prince Qin’s sister,

854
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,730
I have nothing

855
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:30,700
to hide from you.

856
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,400
I didn’t know

857
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,820
why you got poisoned by Beauty Blood.

858
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,360
If I’m not mistaken,

859
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,370
you did that

860
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:44,170
for Prince Qin, didn’t you?

861
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,320
You are right.

862
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,170
I made Beauty Blood

863
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,700
to save my brother for sure.

864
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,030
So you want to ask me

865
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:56,130
if Beauty Blood

866
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:59,570
can detoxify poisonous Gu.

867
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,150
Please tell me, Mister.

868
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,150
You all

869
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,280
choose

870
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,740
to sacrifice yourselves

871
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,320
for Prince Qin.

872
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:15,400
It’s all my fault.

873
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:16,900
Mister,

874
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,300
no matter what the result is,

875
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,030
please tell me the truth.

876
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,700
Beauty Blood

877
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,940
can’t cure poisonous Gu.

878
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:32,950
I knew it.

879
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,410
Every time I drank poison

880
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:38,610
to make Beauty Blood,

881
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,110
though I was in immense pain,

882
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,330
thinking that Beauty Blood

883
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:45,200
can save Feiye,

884
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,680
I managed to tough it through.

885
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,200
But…

886
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,650
But you told me

887
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:53,580
Beauty Blood wouldn’t help at all.

888
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,130
So all my sufferings

889
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,360
are in vain.
