[Tianning

5
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:46,850
Oh, no!

6
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,470
We’re going the wrong way.

7
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,680
I'm afraid this will delay the wedding.

8
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,600
Let’s go the other way.

9
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:10,470
Mom,

10
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,900
with your bracelet as an accompany to get married,

11
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,930
I have no regrets now.

12
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,140
Red.

13
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:37,259
It’s auspicious.

14
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,100
Where is it?

15
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,600
Why am I here?

16
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,700
Is this caused by the bracelet?

17
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,470
What

18
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,720
are these books?

19
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,510
The Mythical Herb can really

20
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,840
cure the scar on my face.

21
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,140
Mom,

22
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,090
my prescription is right!

23
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:05,970
It will work!

24
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,110
It must be father who changed my herb.

25
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,430
Poison

26
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:38,710
can be medical.

27
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,680
The sect of poison was set up years ago,

28
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,230
which used poisons as medicine.

29
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,140
Poison Book?

30
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,420
The Poison Book written by the Poison Master?

31
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,390

and Guanmen acupoint at the same time

35
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,230
can cure the poisonous ulcer on the face.

00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,600
Acupuncturing the Baihui acupoint,

37

You should change your clothes now.

Please rest assured.

00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,600
I have given it to Ms. Baili.

49

I’m not your mother.

81

00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,010
The groom not only didn’t go to pick me up,

83
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,010
but also is not seen in the hall here.

84
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,930
Can I say that

85
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,300
Prince Qin is against the Imperial Order?

86
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,220
How dare you!

87
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,260
How could you

88
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,850
slander Prince Qin?

89
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,140
I think

90
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,890
I should enter the wedding room now

91
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,390

Mother, you get me wrong.

96

We can’t afford to suffer the loss she said.

Let’s take her in first.

you offended me first this time.

Long Feiye, where did you go?

110
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,670
Why haven’t you been back yet?

111
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,220
Mom,

112
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,650
I finally got married.

113
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,200
It’s a step closer to the day we can be reunited.

114
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,930
Please wait for me.

115
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,010
I’ll go to see you soon.

116
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,220
Who is that?

117
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,090
Who is there?

118
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,600
-It’s you?
-I’ll kill you if you say anything.

119
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,180
Did he

120
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,390
come after me all the way here?

121
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,770
It would be terrible if he recognizes me.

122
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,850
Luckily, my scar disappeared.

123
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,180
And I was wearing a veil.

124
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,800
He can’t recognize me.

125
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:16,640
You…

126
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,010
Don’t you know that this is Prince Qin’s Mansion?

127
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,220
I’m Princess Qin.

128
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,180
Prince Qin is the most authoritative person

129
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,310
except His Majesty.

130
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,470
If you kill me,

131
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,970
he will never let you go.

132
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,300
You’re so heavy.

133
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,830
You’re going to crush me.

134
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,600
Don’t move.

135
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,800
You’re poisoned.

136
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,400
Your heart is beating slowly

137
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,930
and breath is heavy.

138
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,550
You must have got more than one kind.

139
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,800
The most serious one is snake venom.

140
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,800
According to the damage of your clothes,

141
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,100
it started from four inches from your heart

142
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,830
above your stomach an hour ago.

143
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,930
And…

144
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,100
You can’t die now!

145
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,800
It’s the first day of my marriage!

146
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,350
Wake up! Wake up!

147
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,470
He passed out.

148
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,050
Poison him to die?

149
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,050
No, no.

150
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,260
If I killed someone right after I married in here,

151
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,460
Consort Yi will definitely kick me out.

152
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,550
For my mother,

153
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,390
I have to stay here,

154
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,730
take Prince Qin down

155
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,100
and find the mark

156
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,520
Empress Dowager said.

157
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,550
Don’t move.

158
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,890
If you move, the venom will travel through

159
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,010
the blood to the heart.

160
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,090
Then you will be in more danger

161
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,090
You have to listen to the physician.

162
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,820
What are you doing?

163
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,550
Take off your clothes of course.

164
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,090
Or how can I detoxify you?

165
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,300
I can do it myself.

166
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,100
Why bother to be shy?

167
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,140
I’m a physician.

168
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,100
There is no gender difference in

169
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,230
medical treatment.

170
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:45,800
What’s more,

171
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,500
you are a male, I’m a female.

172
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,010
I’m the one who loses.

173
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,010
God bless.

174
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,830
Please don’t recognize me.

White Ear?

349
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,510
The name made by my son

350
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,550
is so great.

351
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:29,510
Girl,

352
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,470
you look caring.

353
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,550
You are the master of here?

354
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,520
How do you know that?

355
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,870
That miasma is so strong.

356
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,970
But you are safe and sound.

357
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,800
And this cave seems to have

358
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,860
formed naturally.

359
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:52,680
No one can enter this deep valley.

360
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,890
I won’t believe it if you say

361
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,150
you are not the master.

362
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,090
You are really smart.

363
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,220
Thanks for saving me just now.

364
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:03,390
But I wonder if that man

365
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,700
is still out there.

366
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,390
I saw

367
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:08,920
that man on my way back here.

368
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,350
He was still out there.

369
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:13,180
I’m afraid he is still waiting for you.

370
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,760
What a stubborn guy.

371
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,220
Sir,

372
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,720
please do me another favor

373
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,470
to let me stay here longer.

374
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,010
I can keep you here.

375
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,380
But you should tell me

376
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,680
why is that guy

377
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,010
after you.

378
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,930
That is a long story.

379
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,640
In a dark and windy night,

380
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,850
a diligent girl climbed up

381
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,720
the cliff to collect herbs.

382
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,220
And then…

383
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,640
The man after her,

384
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,140
with a Beili Sword

385
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,510
and a noble face,

386
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,940
is definitely not an ordinary one.

387
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,390
But I have

388
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:50,790
never seen a man like him in Beili.

389
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:53,050
If he is from Tianning, pretending to be a Beili…

390
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,550
Unfortunately I know less

391
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:55,780
about Tianning…

392
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,010
Isn’t this guy weird?

393
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:00,850
Trust me.

394
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,140
I didn’t lie a word.

395
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,010
I’m not the person

396
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,950
who believes in right or wrong.

397
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,300
I only judge people from their abilities.

398
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,720
I just saw that

399
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,680
you are good at extracting the poison.

400
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,390
And

401
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,760
even the poisonous miasma can’t hurt you.

402
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,390
Here it is.

403
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,510
Come with me.

404
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,510
This place of mine is called Yaogui Valley.

405
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,510
There are many herbs in the medicinal garden.

406
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,760
If you can find the three kinds of herbs I want,

407
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,090
I will not only trust you

408
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,910
but also promise you one thing.

409
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,680
-Really?
-Yes.

410
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:38,850
Deal.

411
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:46,510
Our deal is that

412
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,550
you should find

413
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,550
White Yimi,

414
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,800
Hallucii

415
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,100
and Mythical Herb

416
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,780
within four hours.

417
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:59,180
What a coincidence.

418
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,890
I have been finding Mythical Herb for two year.

419
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:03,760
Of course I know how it looks like

420
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,090
and its growth habit.

421
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,470
But the other two…

422
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,220
How is it?

423
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,600
You can give up if you want.

424
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:11,890
And you can be

425
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,180
a little cleaner

426
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,510
in my Yaogui Valley in the future,

427
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,550
What do you say?

428
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,140
Don’t look down upon me.

429
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,550
I don’t need four hours.

430
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:23,150
The duration of a burning joss stick is enough.

431
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,470
The time is almost up.

432
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,870
And you only found Mythical Herb.

433
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:34,970
Lass,

434
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,850
you really disappointed me.

435
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,220
I still got time, right?

436
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,390
And this is really a good place.

437
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,090
I only saw these rare and precious

438
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,260
herbs on the book.

439
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:45,950
But you have all of them here.

440
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,420
But you are just like me.

441
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:48,140
Between the poisonous herbs and medicine herbs,

442
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,870
you like poisonous herbs more.

443
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:50,890
Do you like it?

444
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,680
You can stay here

445
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,510
and be one of my cleaners if you like.

446
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,890
I don’t want to.

447
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,100
What’s more,

448
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,550
you intended to let me finish the challenge, right?

449
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,410
How do you know?

450
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:04,560
According to the herbs in your valley,

451
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,010
you’re good at using poison.

452
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,220
And you saw my scar.

453
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,120
You know I’m finding the herbs.

454
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,090
So you must know that

455
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,680
I’m finding the Mythical Herb.

456
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,010
Although it is extremely poisonous,

457
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,050
it’s a great medicine for scars

458
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:15,470
after being refined.

459
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,660
You have a good eye.

460
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,820
But it’s not completely right.

461
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,930
White Yimi and Hallucii

462
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,800
are what I want to test you.

463
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,880
That can’t baffle me.

464
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,380
There are two kinds of poisonous herbs,

465
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:31,510
one is dominant

466
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,640
and the other is recessive.

467
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,550
White Yimi,

468
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,710
the king of anhydrous poisonous herbs.

469
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,800
Although it is a dominant medicine,

470
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:46,140
it is highly poisonous only when

471
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,090
it blooms.

472
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:48,890
Most herbs bloom

473
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,640
in this season,

474
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,460
but White Yimi doesn't bloom,

475
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,720
because

476
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,090
when it leaves the sand,

477
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:59,970
it will absorb the last drop of water

478
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,620
in their roots and bloom.

479
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,800
Then it will become extremely poisonous.

480
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:18,800
Then,

481
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,500
what about Hallucii?

482
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,180
That’s easier.

483
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,090
You grow all kinds of useful

484
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,050
herbs here.

485
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,800
How can you let weeds grow?

486
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:28,730
You must want to hide something.

487
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,890
Hallucii looks the same like setaria viridis.

488
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,290
That’s why it’s so named.

489
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:50,350
You don’t know these two kinds of herbs.

490
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,280
But you are smart

491
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:52,720
with high understanding.

492
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,640
I lose.

493
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:56,410
So you can do what you promised me?

494
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,800
I want Mythical Herbs.

495
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,550
The more, the better.

496
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,140
Go ahead.

497
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:03,970
When can I leave?

498
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,190
The man after you

499
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,260
has already left.

500
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:08,550
Why don’t you tell me earlier?

501
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,850
Finally I can go home.

502
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:14,650
Here is it.

503
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:16,760
I’ll let Bai Su and Zhu Yu escort you.

504
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,010
I know my way home.

505
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,220
But.

506
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,880
I can’t take the bunny back.

507
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:22,030
I’ll give it to you.

508
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,720
Take good care of it for me.

509
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:24,930
OK.

510
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:27,210
Thanks for saving me.

511
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:29,390
And thanks for your Mythical Herbs!

512
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,390
Qishao.

513
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,890
Now she knew our Valley.

514
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:37,390
Will she send other people here?

515
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:38,320
I’ll go kill her.

516
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,310
Don’t bother.

517
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,460
Just take care of White Ear.

518
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:43,430
Just let her in

519
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,720
if she wants to come again later.

520
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,010
But it’s not White Ear.

521
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,010
Qishao.

522
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,140
We can’t give away

523
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,430
our position in Tianning.

524
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:50,760
Too much involvement with her

525
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,360
will only get her in trouble.

526
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,260
I know.

527
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:04,510
Yunxi, finally you come back.

528
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,300
I've been waiting for you all night.

529
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,760
Nobody noticed, did they?

530
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,650
Don’t worry. No one found it.

531
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:09,300
Let’s go.
