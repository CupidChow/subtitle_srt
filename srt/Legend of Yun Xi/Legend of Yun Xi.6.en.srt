Whoa!

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:19,950
Your Highness!

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,120
Your Highness!

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:33,710
Your Highness!

10
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,330
Your Highness!

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:45,550
Hurry!

12
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,330
Carry His Highness away!

00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,100
Yah!

15
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,870
Yah!

16
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,090
Great.

17
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,460
With these 10,000 war horses,

18
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,720
our troops will be unstoppable.

19
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,320
Feiye.

20
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,340
You did a great job.

21
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,440
I’m flattered, Your Majesty.

22
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,320
I just did my duty

23
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,150
to welcome the bride outside the capital.

24
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,150
However, the food supply for 10,000 horses

25
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,410
will be a huge expense.

26
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,090
I’ve given my order

27
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,320
to take the northern grassland

28
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,150
as a pasture

29
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,320
specially for these horses.

30
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,820
If so, the local residents

31
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,990
will have to move.

32
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,270
Think twice, Your Majesty.

33
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,920
With these horses,

34
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,630
the locals can be protected.

35
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,570
They can make a living by other ways.

36
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,110
No more talking about this.

37
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,540
It’s your big day, Your Majesty.

38
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,030
I’ll take my leave.

39
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,190
No hurry.

40
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,800
We rarely have free time.

41
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,070
Let’s take a hot spring bath and play go.

42
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:01,610
Yes.

[Grand Commandant’s Mansion]

44
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,830
Thanks for your hospitality, my lord.

45
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,700
Do you know

46
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,820
why I summoned you here?

47
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,030
You want me to kill someone

48
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,070
for you, right?

49
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,110
Given that

50
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,060
you asked me

51
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,329
to look into that case,

52
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,030
I presume

53
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,400
the one you want me to kill

54
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,490
could be Prince Qin.

55
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,990
You’re indeed insightful.

56
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,490
So, on the day of Prince Qin’s wedding,

57
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,570
I sent Yuze

58
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,380
to lure him

59
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,450
to Chief Justice

60
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,320
and assassinated the Chief Justice’s family.

61
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,030
In the end,

62
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,070
I passed the buck

63
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,360
to him.

64
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,510
Why did you assassinate my men?

65
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,350
When my mother was alive,

66
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,360
the Chief Justice’s family

67
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,220
were all loyal and faithful to me.

68
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,180
Why did you slaughter his family?

69
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,740
Tianmo.

70
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:10,990
You are

71
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,500
indeed competent to achieve big things.

72
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:14,990
Tianmo.

73
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,640
To do big things, you shouldn’t mind trifles.

74
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,779
I think what you did was reasonable.

75
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:23,700
That’s so-called resolution.

76
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,400
Thank you for your praise.

77
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,110
Prince Qin gets more and more

78
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,450
powerful.

79
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,820
The death of Chief Justice

80
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,950
won’t draw

81
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,740
too much attention

82
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,820
from His Majesty.

83
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,320
If you really

84
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,530
want to kill Prince Qin,

85
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:39,700
we can do it

86
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,320
without any trace.

87
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,110
You can get Prince Qin killed

88
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,820
by someone who is more powerful

89
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,780
than him,

90
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,490
in a fair and square way.

91
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,150
You mean

92
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,260
His Majesty?

93
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:52,990
Yes.

94
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,570
Have someone else to do the dirty work.

95
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,200
You will be well-protected.

96
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,570
No one will find it out.

97
00:04:59,320 --> 00:04:59,990
So,

98
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,400
apparently,

99
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,280
it must be

100
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,820
someone around you.

101
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:04,990
But...

102
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,400
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

103
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,110
Do it as you said.

104
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,150
Uncle!

105
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,090
Thank you, my lord.

106
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,820
I will surely get it done.

107
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:04,990
Feiye.

108
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,360
To win the war,

109
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,710
you got badly injured.

110
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,700
All your injures

111
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,240
are incurred by guarding Tianning.

112
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,570
I feel sorry to you.

113
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,450
It’s my duty.

114
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,100
I’m a commander of Tianning

115
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,900
and succeeded the title of Prince Qin.

116
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,230
That’s what I should do.

117
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,150
I feel ashamed of myself

118
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,700
to make you

119
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,450
worry about me in the court.

120
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,240
It’s not fault at all.

121
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,320
You won the war.

122
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,280
But you’re already a lord,

123
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,090
with no higher title for you.

124
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,490
I know

125
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,900
you don’t like

126
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,110
gold or treasures.

127
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,070
How about

128
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,600
I offer you the land you conquered

129
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,950
and confer you as a duke?

130
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,200
I dare not.

131
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,470
I still remember the chaos of Zhou Dynasty.

132
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,700
I dare not to be a sinner

133
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,570
in the history.

134
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:36,190
Feiye.

135
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,450
It’s been a while

136
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,590
since we played go together.

137
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,159
Would you like to play go with me?

138
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,450
Yes,

139
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,320
I’d like to, Your Majesty.

140
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,250
When two armies fight,

141
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,050
the many winning the few,

142
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,400
or the strong

143
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,030
winning the weak are supposed to be normal.

144
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,700
The weak defeating the strong,
or the few defeating the many

145
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,320
are just tales.

146
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:14,450
Plus, other conditions

147
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,110
like timing, location and relations shall be met.

148
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,740
An occasional win

149
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,070
is but a fluke.

150
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,190
It isn’t good.

151
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:24,900
Feiye.

152
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,490
Do you agree?

153
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,860
You have a point.

154
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,520
Using the many against the few

155
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,350
is indeed advantageous.

156
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,299
But if you are adept at tricks

157
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,030
and attack

158
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,450
surprisingly,

159
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,720
leveraging the advantage,

160
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,950
it will be much effective.

161
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,570
If your power is absolutely overwhelming

162
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,740
to destroy

163
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,320
any enemy,

164
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,700
who dares not concede defeat?

165
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,830
Take Xiqiu as an example.

166
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,360
If my guess is right,

167
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,780
the letter to surrender and pay tribute

168
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,400
is supposed to

169
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,610
be on the way here.

170
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,070
Feiye.

171
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,900
That was a tough battle.

172
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,070
You may rest at home in the future.

173
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,320
There are strong enemies outside

174
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,190
and treacherous officials inside.

175
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,280
I dare not slack.

176
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:33,780
Xiqiu is defeated.

177
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,110
Beili must have concerns,

178
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,110
and is unable to

179
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,740
wage a war in a short term.

180
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,490
As for other issues,

181
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,530
six ministries and nine ministers will take care.

182
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,740
You may take a break.

183
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,650
People need to rest, anyway.

184
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,260
You have a point, Your Majesty.

185
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,150
I’m not good at the game.

186
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,110
Sorry, Your Majesty.

187
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,820
Never mind.

188
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:39,850
Your Highness.

189
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,610
It's your first day in the palace.

190
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,110
How come Tianhui

191
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,740
hasn’t come yet?

192
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,070
Will he not come?

193
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,120
Don’t worry, Madam.

194
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,690
Even if he’s suspicious of me,

195
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,650
it’s my first day here.

196
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,900
I’m sure

197
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,610
he’ll show me respect.

198
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,190
His Majesty comes.

199
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,030
-Greetings, Your Majesty.
-My respects, Your Majesty.

200
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,610
Long live, Your Majesty.

201
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,320
Rise.

202
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,470
Thank you, Your Majesty.

203
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,280
I’ve long heard you’re gorgeous.

204
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,650
You do

205
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,280
live up to your fame.

206
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,050
Thank you, Your Majesty.

207
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,150
I’m just a woman.

208
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,260
To get along with Your Majesty,

209
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,820
beautiful face is unreliable.

210
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,070
I’d like to be an understanding wife

211
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,670
who can relieve your worries

212
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,030
when you’re troubled.

213
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,030
Good.

214
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,030
You are kindhearted.

215
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,070
I’m contented.

216
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,160
Your Majesty.

217
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,450
You come late.

218
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,530
You must be busy with work.

219
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,780
I was idle

220
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,700
and made a pot of tea.

221
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,320
This is the tea Xianhao from Xiqiu.

222
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,190
Try it, Your Majesty.

223
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,150
The aroma is intoxicating.

224
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,530
It’s indeed good tea.

225
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,380
I’m glad you like it, Your Majesty.

226
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,200
It’s your first day in the palace.

227
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,150
I was busy with work

228
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,780
and came to you late.

229
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,490
Are you angry with me?

230
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,570
Of course not, Your Majesty.

231
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,070
How could I be angry?

232
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,860
You are the king

233
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,650
occupied with state affairs,

234
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,200
yet you still come to see me.

235
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,320
I’m overjoyed.

236
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,900
How could I be angry with you?

237
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,300
You’re understanding indeed.

238
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,820
With you by my side,

239
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,220
what else shall I desire?

240
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:33,950
As your concubine, it’s my duty

241
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,530
to relieve your worries.

242
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,490
As long as you have me in your heart,

243
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,280
I

244
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,950
will be contented.

245
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,370
Your Majesty.

246
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,740
It’s 11 p.m.

247
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:55,650
Is it so late?

248
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,650
I’ve got state affairs to attend to.

249
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,320
You may go to sleep early.

250
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,950
I’ll come to see you tomorrow.

251
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,610
Good night, Your Majesty.

252
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,150
Princess.

253
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,650
Will your behavior

254
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,450
piss off King Tianhui?

255
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,280
Madam.

256
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,030
Take it out and throw away.

257
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,000
He won’t be pissed off.

258
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,320
Although

259
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,820
he didn’t kill my father

260
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,820
directly,

261
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,400
he is my enemy.

262
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,400
How could I not bear a grudge?

263
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,070
I'm sure he knows that.

264
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,950
Well,

265
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,030
when the eunuch said it’s 11 p.m.,

266
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,490
His Majesty stared at you for a long while.

267
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,030
Why didn’t you keep him?

268
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,440
More haste, less speed.

269
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,600
Tianhui is suspicious by nature.

270
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,650
The more impatient we are,

271
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,380
the more suspicious he will be.

272
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,920
More doings, more mistakes.

273
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,860
The top priority now

274
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,810
is to eliminate his doubts first.

275
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,700
Then it will be much easier.

276
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,700
But, in my opinion,

277
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,490
Tianhui

278
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,280
was captivated

279
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,400
by your beauty.

280
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,410
Serving him by beauty won’t last long.

281
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,990
Also, you saw it, too.

282
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:39,740
Even though

283
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,680
he was captivated with my beauty,

284
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,030
he still chose to leave.

285
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,110
That is King Tianhui.

286
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,570
Thus,

287
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,360
we should be more careful.

288
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:10,620
[Gorgeous Chamber]

289
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,030
Let me toast you.

290
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,190
I feel sorry for you, Your Highness.

291
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,400
Chief Justice

292
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,190
was your man,

293
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:35,150
and had a long-standing grudge against Prince Qin.

294
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,450
When all his family were killed,

295
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,860
Prince Qin was there, too.

296
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,120
The evidence is solid.

297
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,360
Why doesn’t His Majesty punish him?

298
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,030
It’s because he’s powerful

299
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,690
and just returned in triumph.

300
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,950
People support him.

301
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,190
Even His Majesty showed respect to him.

302
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,720
Your Highness.

303
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,030
You officially

304
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,780
declare a war against Prince Qin.

305
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,900
You must be

306
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,200
very careful.

307
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:57,820
What can I do?

308
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,530
He is always arbitrary.

309
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,070
Even my father

310
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:02,750
considers

311
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,180
his feelings sometimes.

312
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,240
My men were killed.

313
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,780
This case is closed

314
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,859
because there’s no solid evidence.

315
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:11,910
Even my father didn’t say a word.

316
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,150
How dare I say anything?

317
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,400
Forget the unhappy things

318
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,400
today.

319
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,569
I got some superior tribute tea

320
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:21,950
the other day.

321
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:23,650
I’ll give you two.

322
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,000
This tribute tea

323
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,770
is only enjoyed by my father and grandmother.

324
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,110
The tea is good.

325
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,360
Don’t leak it out.

326
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:32,810
-Yes.
-Yes.

327
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:36,090
-Thank you, Your Highness.
-Thank you, Your Highness.

328
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,030
Master. Master.

329
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,070
Master.

330
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:13,570
Master. Master.

331
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:14,780
Master.

332
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,150
Chancellor

333
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,740
and Chief Guard

334
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,370
perished suddenly one after another.

335
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,320
The case of Chief Justice

336
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,320
isn’t closed yet.

337
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,400
Another two officials of mine died.

338
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,500
They dared to murder imperial officials

339
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,360
under my nose.

340
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,610
How bold!

341
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,820
They’re looking down on me.

342
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,190
Whoever did this,

343
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,490
get it

344
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,400
to the bottom!

345
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,410
Show no mercy!

346
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,260
Yes, Your Majesty.

347
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,950
He leaves early and returns late.

348
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,880
I haven’t seen any trace of him.

349
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,900
Not to mention the birthmark.

350
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,360
It’s been ten days.

351
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,990
What should I do?

352
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,950
Your Highness.

353
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,070
Madam Zhao.

354
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,450
Are you unhappy?

355
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:13,650
I’m fine.

356
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,280
Don't worry about me.

357
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,050
His Highness is a good man, actually.

358
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,280
Her Highness

359
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,900
is easygoing as well.

360
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:24,030
It’s just that he’s annoyed lately

361
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,530
and in a bad mood.

362
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,400
He will be fine

363
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,070
after some time.

364
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,190
I heard that

365
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,610
His Highness is framed.

366
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,190
Then some officials perished.

367
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,630
Has His Highness been exonerated?

368
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,650
Her Highness is upset

369
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,110
about this case.

370
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,530
It’s said His Majesty

371
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,580
ordered General Mu to look into it.

372
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:45,450
But until now

373
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,060
there’s still no progress.

374
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,110
I think His Highness

375
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,610
is also busy with looking into it.

376
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,250
The family were wiped out overnight.

377
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,860
Not too many people in the capital

378
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,820
could do that.

379
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,450
His Highness was caught red-handed.

380
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,190
It’s reasonable

381
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,590
that others suspect him.

382
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,240
Also,

383
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,950
two officials perished.

384
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,490
It’s too hard

385
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,030
for His Highness to justify himself.

386
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,030
Right.

387
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,490
I heard that

388
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,780
they were poisoned

389
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,900
to death by some

390
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:15,960
unknown poison.

391
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,080
It’s impossible

392
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:17,900
for His Highness

393
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,560
to use dirty tricks like that.

394
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,570
Poisoned to death?

395
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:22,530
Yeah.

396
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,920
Now that they were poisoned,

397
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,400
the poison can be figured out.

398
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,800
Then find out the source.

399
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,030
How come there’s no

400
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:30,910
any progress?

401
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:34,030
I don’t know about that.

402
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,740
You said poison masters are everywhere

403
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,780
and I am useless.

404
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,740
I’ll prove myself to you.

405
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,900
Make an excuse

406
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,150
and go to Cold Stone

407
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,280
to check things out.

408
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,930
His Highness works so hard.

409
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,200
Please make some chicken soup.

410
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,650
I will take it to him myself.

411
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,400
You should do it earlier.

412
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,330
His Highness will be delighted.

413
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,240
I’m going to cook now.

414
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,990
The coroner only found they were poisoned,

415
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:10,860
but couldn’t find out

416
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,030
what the poison was.

417
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,320
His Majesty also ordered

418
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,120
imperial physicians to assist.

419
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,820
But even the physicians

420
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,610
couldn’t find out

421
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:19,740
what the poison was.

422
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,920
Come in, princess.

423
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:36,860
Your Highness.

424
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,190
You’ve been working hard for days.

425
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,240
I bring you some chicken soup

426
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,170
for your health.

427
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,570
Give the soup to Xifeng.

428
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:43,820
Your Highness.

429
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,900
Let me serve you.

430
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,400
I’m off, Your Highness.

431
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,690
You may leave if nothing else.

432
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,680
Your Highness.

433
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:23,320
I have something to say.

434
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:24,820
Say it.

435
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,930
Xiqiu’s Princess makes peace by marriage.

436
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,390
She is no ordinary woman.

437
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,900
Xiqiu’s little prince just ascended the throne.

438
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,760
In a short time,

439
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:35,700
those powerful officials

440
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,490
were killed.

441
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,070
And that lord.

442
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,860
We have to be alert of him.

443
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:45,950
Right.

444
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,440
Besides, General Baili’s investigation

445
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:49,530
goes well.

446
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,030
He’s got a clue on the corruption case.

447
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,030
What about His Majesty?

448
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,400
Until the false accusation is settled,

449
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,860
His Majesty has a reason

450
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,200
to keep you here

451
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,280
and take this chance

452
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,820
to thin out our men.

453
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,950
So,

454
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,780
the coming of Chu Qingge at this moment

455
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,610
isn’t a bad thing.

456
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,510
Tianhui is suspicious by nature.

457
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,860
He must suspect

458
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,900
that Chu Qingge is up to something

459
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,830
by the marriage.

460
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,450
While he

461
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,790
deals with Chu Qingge,

462
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,860
we will get a chance.

463
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,610
Report or dismiss.

464
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,150
I have something to report.

465
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,240
Your Majesty.

466
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,200
Chief Justice’s family

467
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,200
and two officials were killed.

468
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,860
It’s been investigated for days,

469
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,700
yet the culprit is still at large.

470
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,530
Your Majesty, please look into it

471
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,660
to console the dead.

472
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,320
Mu Qingwu is solely in charge of

473
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,360
this case.

474
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:58,150
Mu Qingwu.

475
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

476
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,610
How is the case going?

477
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,110
I’ve investigated all the pharmacies and clinics

478
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,570
in the capital with my men,

479
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,310
yet no one figured out

480
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:13,950
what poison the dead took.

481
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:16,990
The poison is indeterminable.

482
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:17,610
So,

483
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:18,840
we don’t know

484
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,430
how the poison was applied.

485
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,820
Sorry for my incompetence.

486
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,620
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

487
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:25,530
Father.

488
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,200
I think it’s not

489
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,570
all Mu’s fault.

490
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,860
Only Chief Justice's case

491
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,900
has witnesses.

492
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,180
Other cases have no clue at all.

493
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,650
General Mu

494
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,150
has done his best.

495
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,120
Your Majesty.

496
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,320
This case is quite clear.

497
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,530
Why hasn't it been closed?

498
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,190
Just because the suspect is Prince Qin?

499
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,360
The saying has that, the guilty rulers

500
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,190
shall be punished as commoners.

501
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,450
Please judge it, Your Majesty.

502
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:55,370
Your Majesty.

503
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,530
Apparently, all the evidences

504
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:58,660
point to Prince Qin.

505
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,110
But, by now,

506
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,900
no solid evidence

507
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,320
proves that Prince Qin is the murderer.

508
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,660
Your Majesty.

509
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,530
Someone witnessed

510
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:08,650
Prince Qin showed up

511
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,050
in Chief Justice’s home.

512
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,280
The two ministers perished

513
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,140
exactly like the former victims.

514
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,360
Also, they were Prince Qin's political enemies.

515
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,620
Isn’t it clear enough?

516
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,610
General Mu

517
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,150
deliberately conceals the evidence

518
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,400
and covers up for Prince Qin.

519
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,330
What do you mean?

520
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,990
I’m just telling the truth.

521
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,860
It’s the court.

522
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,550
Mind your manners.

523
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:30,700
Uncle.

524
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,610
In your opinion,

525
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,920
how to deal with it?

526
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:35,950
Your Majesty.

527
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,150
I think

528
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:40,820
both of them have a point.

529
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:43,990
Prince Qin

530
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,650
is the prime suspect now.

531
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:47,360
If you

532
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,990
don’t do anything to Prince Qin,

533
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,940
it’s hard to convince others.

534
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,070
But there is no solid evidence.

535
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,780
In your view,

536
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,900
how to handle it?

537
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,070
I think

538
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,780
you may

539
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,990
demote Prince Qin

540
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,360
and deprive his military power.

541
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,070
And determine it

542
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,780
when everything

543
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,110
is clear.

544
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,400
Feiye.

545
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,030
What do you think?

546
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,820
I follow your orders, Your Majesty.

547
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:35,990
Uncle.

548
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,450
I didn’t think it’d be so easy

549
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:39,710
to deprive Prince Qin’s military power.

550
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,320
He doesn’t seem to

551
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,850
be so capable as we thought.

552
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,990
Don’t be careless.

553
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,190
This time it went well,

554
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:50,820
but Prince Qin

555
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,240
may turn the tide anytime.

556
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:56,490
We shall bide our time for now,

557
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:00,410
in case it attracts Prince Qin’s attention.

558
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:02,570
If he finds out

559
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,400
any trace,

560
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,950
we’ll lose everything.

561
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:10,530
Got it.

562
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,160
Don't worry, uncle.

563
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,530
We should thank

564
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,070
your man, Mr. Gu.

565
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,200
This man is extremely intelligent.

566
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,240
He looks kind,

567
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,860
but ruthless in heart.

568
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:26,570
You need more men now.

569
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,530
Try to get more people like him

570
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:30,950
to be your advisor.

571
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:33,400
But remember.

572
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,150
Once you find out he is treacherous,

573
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,990
be sure to kill him.

574
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:44,570
By the way, uncle,

575
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:46,110
I went to escort Concubine Qing

576
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,190
with Qin days ago.

577
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,960
I found Concubine Qing

578
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,870
was quite hostile to Prince Qin.

579
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,480
Prince Qin defeated Xiqiu by a landslide.

580
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,150
Of course she's hostile.

581
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:01,610
If Concubine Qing can gain the favor

582
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,600
and give a blow to Concubine Xiao,

583
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,700
maybe

584
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,640
the second prince will be implicated, too.

585
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,610
Let’s wait and see what happens.

586
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,150
Feiye.

587
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:23,180
Don’t mind what happened today

588
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,900
on the court .

589
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,030
I had no choice.

590
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,260
When Mu Qingwu figures out the truth,

591
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,320
I’ll uphold justice for you.

592
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,510
Thank you, Your Majesty.

593
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,110
I also hope

594
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,320
we can figure it out as soon as possible

595
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,240
to clear my name.

596
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,600
Now that you think this way,

597
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,820
I’m relieved.

598
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,280
I’m no longer an official.

599
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,110
I don’t have to go to court.

600
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,820
I’ll relax at home for a few days.

601
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,820
No, I don't agree.

602
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,660
I am no longer an official.

603
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,780
If I still go to court for state affairs,

604
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,950
I might be accused.

605
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,130
Please grant it, Your Majesty.

606
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,070
Since you insist,

607
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,700
I won’t force you.

608
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:16,610
You just got married days ago.

609
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,030
Are you contented

610
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,950
with the marriage ordered by me?

611
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,050
I’ve been away on war for years.

612
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,360
No one takes care of my mother.

613
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,530
Thanks to Your Majesty,

614
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,900
my wife can help me look after her.

615
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,360
She is

616
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,260
from a family of imperial physicians

617
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,030
and knows some medical expertise.

618
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,190
When we have ailments,

619
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:42,770
she can also treat us.

620
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,860
Thank Your Majesty and Dowager.

621
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,160
I’m glad that you’re contented.

622
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,740
My mother said

623
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,790
Princess Qin is a beautiful woman.

624
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,770
She is a good match with you.

625
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,330
Thank Her Highness for her praise.

626
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,180
Princess of Xiqiu is already in the palace.

627
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:04,650
Xiqiu dares not to do anything for now.

628
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,610
But Beili is still there.

629
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,530
Beili is good at using scouts and spies

630
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,950
to infiltrate in the state

631
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,900
and get it fall apart in silence.

632
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,320
It really worries me.

633
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,420
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

634
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,800
As long as I’m here,

635
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,530
I will ensure the safety of the state.

636
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,570
The Crown Prince is weak-minded.

637
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,030
Other princes

638
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,770
have no matriarchal support.

639
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,120
They are incompetent.

640
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,400
Brother, I only have you

641
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,280
to rely on.

642
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:45,070
Yes.

643
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,900
[Pavilion of Leisure]

644
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,900
I’m adept at poison testing.

645
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,030
I’ll go out as a maid

646
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,650
and find out the poison

647
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,700
that killed Chief Justice

648
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,100
and other two officials.

649
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,780
Then find out the culprit

650
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,190
based on the clues.

651
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,070
That way,

652
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,650
I will be proved qualified

653
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,530
to be with

654
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:11,610
Prince Qin.

655
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,240
Once he lets his guard down against me,

656
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,700
I can take actions easily.

657
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,320
Wait for me to come back.

658
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,320
How come

659
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,960
they look like being asleep?

660
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,570
Your Highness.

661
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:41,100
Do you feel anything fishy?

662
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,110
Have you smelled

663
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,150
anything weird?

664
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,070
Smell?

665
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,030
It’s like...

666
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,860
It smells like sandalwood.

667
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,960
The corpses got into Yi Manor

668
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,780
and became material evidences.

669
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,030
Burning sandalwood is likely

670
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,760
to ruin the clues on the bodies.

671
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,430
No way could they do this.

672
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,360
Well.

673
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,860
Since they didn’t get the smell in Yi Manor,

674
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,820
they must have gotten it

675
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,020
when they were alive.

676
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:21,820
What kind of incense is it?

677
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,620
It’s strange.

678
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,780
They’ve been stored here for over ten days.

679
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,180
The smell is still there.

680
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,420
Go to check all the mansions,

681
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:33,150
especially about spices, incense and the like.

682
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:34,240
Yes.

683
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:49,610
Their bodies

684
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,340
have the similar smell as well.

685
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,760
And the death state

686
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:55,120
is the same as Chief Justice’s family.

687
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,360
But Chief Justice’s family

688
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,450
died together.

689
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,370
They died separately.

690
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,230
Chief Justice’s family

691
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:07,090
were supposed to be poisoned

692
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,239
in a confined space.

693
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,190
These two officials

694
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,929
were poisoned separately.

695
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:17,820
I see.

696
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:18,989
Go to check

697
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,610
what they ate and used before they died.

698
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,380
Excuse me.

699
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:29,699
Where is Yi Manor?

Thanks for your Mythical Herb.

The poison girl?

You’re beautiful now.

How will you repay me?

I have some business

715
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:12,740
to do.

716
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:13,990
When it’s done,

I’ll go to visit you at Yaogui Valley.

I’ve never had any apprentice.

Prince Qin would've been imprisoned.

I think

My uncle is there.

I’m going to recognize him
