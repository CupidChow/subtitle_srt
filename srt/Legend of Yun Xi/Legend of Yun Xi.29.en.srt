Xifeng.

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,220
Send someone to get her.

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,300
If she doesn’t want to go back,

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,230
don’t force her.

9
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,010
Follow her and protect her.

10
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:23,760
Got it.

11
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,350
Is that going to work?

12
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:27,970
If she wanted to stay,

13
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,300
she wouldn’t sneak off.

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,550
Your Highness.

15
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,010
Concubine Qing is here to see you.

16
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:38,940
Concubine Qing?

17
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:39,300
Yes.

18
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,190
Invite her in.

19
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:40,930
Yes.

20
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,180
You two,

21
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,390
get this place cleaned up.

22
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,050
Yes.

23
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,140
Concubine Qing presents!

24
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,930
Your Highness.

25
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,470
Your Highness.

26
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,050
Since I was grounded,

27
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,520
few people have come to Sun Hall.

28
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,890
You saved my life.

29
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,010
I cannot repay you.

30
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,030
You're welcome.

31
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,720
The world is short-sighted.

32
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,780
You don't have to take it personally.

33
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,180
His Majesty is

34
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,350
still mad.

35
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:19,930
After a while,

36
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,890
when His Majesty's anger has subsided,

37
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,390
he will release you.

38
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,300
Did father tell you

39
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,430
to tell me this?

40
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,850
You know

41
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,140
how His Majesty is.

42
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,640
Even if he did,

43
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:35,009
it wouldn't be

44
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,509
on the surface.

45
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,009
But.

46
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,850
His Majesty values rules.

47
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,509
Yet he just grounded

48
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:44,680
you here.

49
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:46,680
That means

50
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:49,009
there’s still a way out of this.

51
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:52,680
I know

52
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:53,509
you're just trying to

53
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:54,640
make me feel better.

54
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,180
How can that be?

55
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,470
The other day,

56
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,680
my brother sent some

57
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,320
special products from home.

58
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,090
Some of the bottles

59
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,680
are sweet

60
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,680
and refreshing.

61
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,230
When I present them to His Majesty,

62
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,680
His Majesty said

63
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,389
you know wine.

64
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:11,970
So,

65
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,100
I brought some here

66
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,360
for you to have a taste.

67
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,090
These wine are good

68
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,090
but can’t be kept for too long.

69
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,600
You may drink it while it’s fresh.

70
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,930
Thank you.

71
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,200
Fine wine.

72
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,480
It is indeed sweet and refreshing.

73
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,600
I’m glad you like it.

74
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,740
Then please drink the rest as soon as possible.

75
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,800
I have some bottles left.

76
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,390
These are for

77
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,800
other people.

78
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,470
You’re very considerate.

79
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,800
Being kind to everyone.

80
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,260
Well then,

81
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,930
I will leave you alone.

82
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,140
Goodbye.

83
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,180
Please wait.

84
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,470
I have something

85
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,800
to ask you.

86
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,600
Please do tell.

87
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:08,790
Your Highness.

88
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,430
I would like to ask you to

89
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,220
say something nice about me in front of father.

90
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:12,720
So that

91
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,930
I can be free again.

92
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,850
I will never

93
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,390
forget your kindness.

94
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,450
Even if you didn’t tell me this,

95
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,180
I would do exactly the same.

96
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,510
I was just worried

97
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,010
about how to pay you back.

98
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,260
My only wish is that after you take the crown,

99
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,079
please treat Xiqiu kindly.

100
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,720
That’s all I want.

101
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:34,850
Don’t worry.

102
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,880
Tianning and Xiqiu will be in good term forever.

103
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,010
Thank you.

104
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,220
Well then,

105
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,180
excuse me.

00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,180
Your…

108
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,890
Your Majesty.

109
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,149
What are you doing?

110
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,260
My brother

111
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,970
sent some eaglewood.

112
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,970
I thought Your Majesty

113
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,830
was not sleeping well these days.

114
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,300
So I lit it to calm nerves.

115
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,510
Smell it.

116
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,220
It has a nice smell.

117
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,390
You’re very considerate.

118
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,760
What’s wrong?

119
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,220
Could be an old wound.

120
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,280
Are you alright?

121
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,890
Shall I

122
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,100
summon a physician?

123
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,270
It’s not necessary.

124
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,930
I’ll be fine in a few days.

125
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,890
Sit down.

126
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,510
Thank you.

127
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,180
Honey.

128
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,680
What did the envoy say to you?

129
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,550
Nothing.

130
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,970
It’s just that my brother missed me.

131
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:12,800
So he sent the envoy

132
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,430
to check on me.

133
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,640
That’s good to know.

134
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,350
Now I think about it.

135
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,930
My brother

136
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,260
is about Crown Prince’s

137
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,260
age.

138
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,550
He is too young to

139
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,800
be mature.

140
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,180
So sometimes, he could be like a child.

141
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,510
Not nearly as majestic as Your Majesty.

142
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,070
He need his master and others

143
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,600
to teach him.

144
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,760
You’ve seen Tianmo?

145
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,890
My brother gave me some wine.

146
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,470
These bottles cannot be kept for long.

147
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,090
So I brought some to

148
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:47,970
Crown Prince.

149
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,130
I don’t mean anything else.

150
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,460
If Your Majesty doesn’t want to hear it,

151
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,260
then I’ll never bring that up.

152
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,510
I’m not blaming you.

153
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,310
Don’t overthink about it.

154
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,720
Empress died young.

155
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,430
It has certain effect on Crown Prince.

156
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,010
So he is grumpy

157
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,550
and reckless.

158
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,800
This time, he made a mistake that

159
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,850
cannot be forgiven easily.

160
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,050
You’re right.

161
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,430
It’s just that

162
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,470
I don’t think

163
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,140
he is not loyal.

164
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,030
All you have to do is to be persuasive.

165
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,050
Or it might be overcorrecting.

166
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,150

167
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,090
In a few days,

168

it’s the day of a memorial ceremony for Empress.

169
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,100
Why don’t you

170
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,510
go check on him?

171
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,930
After all, he

172
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,010

00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,640
We don’t have a way

180
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,600
to get in.

181
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,220
Heaven Pit is Poison Master’s nest.

182
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,180
It is said there is a little beast

183
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,510
which is super venomous

184
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,890
yet can cure all poisons.

185
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,620
The dangers are unimaginable.

186
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:20,980
Don’t send men there

187
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:22,930
for nothing.

188
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,500
Your Highness.

189
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,050
Poison Master and my mother

190
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,140
seem to have a history.

191
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,890
I can go to the Heaven Pit for a shot.

192
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,090
Poison Master has gain consciousness.

193
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,620
Your skills can’t beat his.

194
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,100
Not only there is the beast,

195
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,180
but also many other traps.

196
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,930
It’s too dangerous.

197
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,990
We must proceed cautiously.

198
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,640
What should we do?

199
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,260
Only he can cure you.

200
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:46,890
I can have a try.

201
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,480
If there’s any danger,

202
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,220
I’ll come back.

203
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,220
Brother.

204
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,680
Let sister-in-law try it.

205
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
I can protect her.

206
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,010
Did you hear that?

207
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,390
Brother Tang Li will protect me.

208
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,190
You can relax.

209
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:57,930
Wait.

210
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,310
Who is your brother?

211
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,100
What?

212
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,970
You just called her sister-in-law.

213
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,180
Are you denying it?

214
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,550
I was just saying.

215
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,010
I feel unfair calling

216
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,140
her sister-in-law.

217
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,660
Your Highness.

218
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,100
I can go check in the Heaven Pit.

219
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,100
See what kind of poisons it has.

220
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,350
Then I can make cure

221
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,430
for us to proceed.

222
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:17,610
All right.

223
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,270
I’m coming with you.

224
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,370
Your Highness.

225
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,220
You can’t come with her.

226
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,090
Now,

227
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,550
Spies of Crown Prince, Second Prince

228
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,470
and His Majesty

229
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,080
are outside of our mansion.

230
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,480
If you come with her,

231
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,150
they surely will follow you.

232
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,640
What should we do?

233
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,510
Let me think.

234
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:44,640
Master.

235
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,300
Who is this?

236
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,300
Master.

237
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,550
This woman

238
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,740
took some men here and tried to get in.

239
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,760
Why did you bring her back?

240
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,720
Master.

241
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,660
She was poisoned by Poison Sha,

242
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,050
but she’s alive.

243
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,960
How is that possible?

244
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,640
Well, whatever it is,

245
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,890
you have to promise both of us

246
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,300
that we must go.

247
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,100
Yunxi and I have to go.

248
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,260
No, no.

249
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:32,970
I can’t betray

250
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:33,890
my brother.

251
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,090
What do you mean betray him?

252
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,930
Yunxi and I are looking for Poison Master

253
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:38,470
to cure

254
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,680
his poison.

255
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,390
No.

256
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,540
Let’s just wait

257
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,330
till my brother figures it out.

258
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,970
His Highness

259
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,090
is under enough pressure.

260
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,680
We are the people closest to him.

261
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,180
If we don’t take the initiative to share burden,

262
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,350
a man like him

263
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,350
would shoulder everything,

264
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,220
and it would kill him.

265
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:53,890
But…but …

266
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,470
But what?

267
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,850
Yunxi and I will

268
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,760
pretend to have a trip.

269
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:00,680
No one will

270
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,640
suspect us.

271
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,930
Then I’m coming with you.

272
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:05,640
No.

273
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,350
If His Highness knows,

274
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,280
he will suspect.

275
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,750
By then, no one can leave.

276
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,360
But you two girls going alone

277
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,390
is too dangerous.

278
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,640
You're scared.

279
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,970
But we are not.

280
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,930
It’s not about that.

281
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:19,550
Well,

282
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,430
I’m sending guards to protect you secretly.

283
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,550
Alright, alright.

284
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,390
Qishao.

285
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:40,550
Spies report that

286
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,150
Han Yunxi is no longer in Prince Qin’s Mansion.

287
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,580
She is looking for Poison Master?

288
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,930
Did you deliver the medicine?

289
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:47,990
Yes, to the palace.

290
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,390
Mother.

291
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,220
I’m sorry.

292
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,850
I made a huge mistake

293
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,650
and was grounded here by father.

294
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,200
So I can’t go to the Imperial Ancestral Temple.

295
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,390
Please forgive me.

296
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:53,760
Father!

297
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,550
Father!

298
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,680
You've finally come to see me, Father.

299
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,550
You remember the anniversary.

300
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,350
It’s not bad.

301
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,680
My mother gave birth to me.

302
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,260
She was so kind to me.

303
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,430
I will never forget that.

304
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,930
I made you the crown prince

305
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,760
since you’re little.

306
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,640
I find you the best teacher

307
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,230
and put a lot of responsibility on you.

308
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,740
And you're holding out on me.

309
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,640
Have you forgotten

310
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,020
all my kindness to you?

311
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:31,890
Father.

312
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,930
It was a moment of confusion

313
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,410
and I made a huge mistake.

314
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,300
And because of my uncle's death,

315
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,510
I did what I had to.

316
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,760
I'm sorry.

317
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,890
I won't do it again.

318
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,590
You are Crown Prince.

319
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,510
My state

320
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,100
will be yours.

321
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,600
You must do as you're told.

322
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,180
I understand.

323
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,640
Don't let me down again.

324
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,690
I'll do my best for the state.

325
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,080
I will never let you down again.

326
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,540
I’ve asked Royal Kitchen

327
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,680
to make you some vegetarian food.

328
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,640
When you're done,

329
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,150
come with me to

330
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,930
the Imperial Ancestral Temple after three pm

331
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,590
to pay respect to your mother.

332
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,660
Thank you, Father.

333
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,680
Although Crown Prince

334
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,360
drank the poison in the wine,

335
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,220
without the poison on His Majesty’s clothes

336
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,430
to trigger the poison inside his body,

337
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,680
it wouldn’t work.

338
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,100
There's always

339
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,390
next time.

340
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,730
Crown Prince is in low position.

341
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:12,990
Even if His Majesty

342
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,970
does not care for his son,

343
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,390
he will care for Empress.

344
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,680
Today is

345
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,980
the anniversary of the death of Empress.

346
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:45,960
Your Highness!

347
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,220
Your Highness! What’s wrong? Your Highness!

348
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,550
Hurry! Call physicians!

349
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,970
Your Highness is vomiting blood!

350
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:51,720
Father.

351
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,640
You're so cruel!

352
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,530
Your Highness! Your Highness!

353
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,140
Physician! Call physicians!

354
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:03,260
Your Highness! Your Highness!

355
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,390
What is your manner?

356
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,640
Oh, no, Your Majesty!

357
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,440
Crown Prince has been poisoned!

358
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,540
Your Highness.

359
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,220
As you expected,

360
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,220
Crown Prince has been poisoned.

361
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,430
It's a newly developed poison.

362
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,260
There is no cure yet.

363
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,430
One bottle to be taken orally.

364
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,090
Another one

365
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,710
needs to spread through igniting eaglewood.

366
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:40,680
It can be passed

367
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,940
from person to person.

368
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,350
Separate tests don't show any toxicity.

369
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,100
It's only when mixed together

370
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,760
that it becomes highly toxic.

371
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,010
Within ten days,

372
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,450
death comes.

373
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:08,760
Physician Han.

374
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:10,800
How is he?

375
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,880
Your Royal Highness.

376
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,140
Your Majesty presents!

377
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,090
Your Majesty.

378
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:24,640
Mother.

379
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,090
How is he?

380
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:29,680
Father.

381
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,330
You must save Crown Prince.

382
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,010
Tell me,

383
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,060
is Crown Prince in danger?

384
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,050
Did you find out

385
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,220
when he was poisoned?

386
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,680
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

387
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,720
I've never seen this poison before.

388
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,260
So I don't know how toxic it is.

389
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,390
I can only approximate the time

390
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,090
of his poisoning.

391
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,300
When was that?

392
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,810
Crown Prince was poisoned

393
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,640
about four hours ago.

394
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,420
Listen up, all of you.

395
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,540
You must save Crown Prince.

396
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,849
I’ll do my best.

397
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:10,550
What?

398
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:12,349
Do your best?

399
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,510
If you can’t save him,

400
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,970
die with him.

401
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:17,720
Go!

402
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,260
Yes.

403
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,180
Your Majesty.

404
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,140
Everyone in Sun Hall

405
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,600
has been captured.

406
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:47,950
Bring them to

407
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,050
Qinzheng Hall.

408
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,890
I’m interrogating them myself.

409
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,220
Yes, Your Majesty.

410
00:17:58,970 --> 00:17:59,640
Say it.

411
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,100
Who went to Sun Hall today?

412
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,430
How dare you

413
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,800
poison Crown Prince

414
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,050
on my watch?

415
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,600
Take them down

416
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,390
and beat twenty hits each!

417
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,640
I am going

418
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,010
to get you talk.

419
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:24,100
Mercy, Your Majesty!

420
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,100
Your Majesty!

421
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,950
The only person came to the Hall

422
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,600
is you!

423
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,760
No one else?

424
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,800
The Hall was heavily guarded.

425
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,720
We didn't see

426
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,010
anyone else go in.

427
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,600
So you mean

428
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,750
I was trying to kill Crown Prince?

429
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,760
I wouldn't dare! I wouldn't dare!

430
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,720
Wouldn't dare?

431
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,090
You've got some nerve.

432
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,470
Do you think that

433
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,800
he was grounded,

434
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,770
so he was about to fall,

435
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,200
and I wouldn’t care about him dead or alive?

436
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,260
Your Majesty, injustice!

437
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,180
Injustice?

438
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:02,890
Fail to protect Crown Prince.

439
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,090
Poison Crown Prince.

440
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,260
Either way,

441
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,250
it's a crime that gets everyone you know dead.

442
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:09,850
If you tell me

443
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,100
the one behind this,

444
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,470
I will pardon you.

445
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,970
Let you join the army.

446
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,350
Looks like you are not going to talk.

447
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,680
Bring them down.

448
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,430
Beat!

449
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,430
Beat them until we get a confession!

450
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:37,720
Please, Your Majesty! Mercy!

451
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,140
Tianning sure is a nice place.

452
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,960
Good wine, good food,

453
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,890
and beauties.

454
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,930
These are for you.

455
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,180
After I leave,

456
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,390
you can

457
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,180
enjoy these beauties.

458
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,680
I guess

459
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,280
congratulations are in order.

460
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,220
Speaking of which, I was wondering,

461
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,050
the Sun Hall is impregnable,

462
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,220
how did you do it?

463
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,510
I won’t tell you.

464
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,430
I can’t tell you.

465
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,970
Otherwise, what am I

466
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,390
to Your Highness?

467
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,090
In fact, I just want to know

468
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,690
when Long Tianmo

469
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,220
will completely disappear.

470
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,140
Within ten days,

471
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,000
Your Highness will be satisfied.

472
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:49,870
Your Highness.

473
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,850
Who would be so bold

474
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,470
as to poison Crown Prince?

475
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,510
Whoever it is,

476
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,100
this matter is going to implicate Physician Han.

477
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,220
His Majesty will do whatever he can

478
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,680
to use this to restrain me.

479
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,430
-Physician Gu.
-Ms. Xu.

480
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:38,720
Darling.

481
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,760
You and Physician Gu

482
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,970
haven’t slept for two days.

483
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,800
Why don’t you have a rest

484
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,510
and have some cakes.

485
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,550
So you can regain some energy.

486
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,760
Thank you.

487
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,350
I'm afraid this time

488
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,800
we are doomed this time.

489
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,180
Darling.

490
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,970
You're not tired.

491
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,050
But Physician Gu is.

492
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,430
Thank you.

493
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,890
I’m alright.

494
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,180
Physician Gu.

495
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,220
You've worked hard today.

496
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,850
You and I are the best friends

497
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,220
in Imperial Hospital,

498
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,380
You are not like others,

499
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,350
when I’m down,

500
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,720
they just kick me.

501
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,260
Adversity brings true friendship.

502
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,090
Here,

503
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,280
I want to thank Physician Gu.

504
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,640
You made this too serious.

505
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:51,600
It’s my job.

506
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,850
But I just don't know much about poison.

507
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:57,680
This time,

508
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,180
I’m learning from you.

509
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:03,720
Good.

510
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:07,140
Please go back and have a rest.

511
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,180
And then

512
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,810
we'll continue tomorrow.

513
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:11,600
Sure.

514
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,390
I'll leave you now.

515
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,220
Darling.

516
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,390
How about

517
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,640
we ask Yunxi for help?

518
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,760
She is noble now.

519
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,260
She has Prince Qin behind her.

520
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,050
And Prince Qin

521
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,470
treats her very well.

522
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,090
If

523
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,180
Yunxi could persuade Prince Qin

524
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,600
to do mediation,

525
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,010
maybe,

526
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,760
we could survive this.

527
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,470
There's something going on in the court.

528
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,030
The situation is not yet clear.

529
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:03,050
Because Yunxi is

530
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,010
noble now,

531
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,300
she can’t make a statement easily.

532
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,140
Besides,

533
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:09,510
she is

534
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,090
probable busy hating me.

535
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:15,260
How could she plead for me?

536
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,470
Darling.

537
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,260
It’s my fault.

538
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,300
In those days,

539
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,970
because of my quarrel with

540
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,180
Lady Tianxin,

541
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,970
I treated Yunxi bad.

542
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,890
If not so,

543
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,430
things wouldn’t be like today.

544
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,890
We are already here.

545
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,900
What’s the point of saying that?

546
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:40,570
All right.

547
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,560
You go back and have a rest.

548
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:43,680
I have to

549
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,160
keep studying medicine.

550
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,100
Go.

551
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,220
Yes.

552
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,550
You don’t know poison.

553
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,100
Stay behind me and keep a distance.

554
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:10,680
Got it.

555
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,600
Be careful.

556
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,220
Yunxi! Yunxi, get out of here!

557
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,150
It’s dangerous!

558
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,470
You go!

559
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,100
Yunxi!

560
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:02,970
I’m a physician!

561
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:03,800
I know how to detoxify!

562
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,510
Go!

563
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,890
Be careful!

564
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,970
Yunxi! Yunxi!

565
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,470
Are you out?

566
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,470
Where are you, Yunxi?

567
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:22,180
Yunxi!

568
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,010
Yunxi!

569
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,680
Yunxi!

570
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,620
Is she alright?

571
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,390
Take this.

572
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,470
- Save her!
- Poison Girl.

573
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,530
Poison Girl.

574
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,390
Fortunately, Poison Girl

575
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:37,300
sealed the key acupoints with a silver needle,

576
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,960
otherwise she would’ve died.

577
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:40,990
Get her out of here.

578
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,300
Yunxi! Yunxi! Yunxi!

579
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,140
Yunxi!

580
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,400
Gu Qishao,

581
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,550
could you be faster?

582
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,640
Yunxi is dying!

583
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,470
Don't worry, I will

584
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,720
never let her die.

585
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,690
Princess Qin was poisoned by Poison Sha.

586
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,390
You mean

587
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,620
it was Princess Qin who just came?

588
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,890
And poisoned by Poison Sha?

589
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:01,510
Yes.

590
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,260
Don’t worry.

591
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,510
She sealed her key acupoints.

592
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:08,300
And

593
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,350
I gave her

594
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,370
Recovery Pill.

595
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,430
Even so,

596
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,600
it can't be completely detoxified.

597
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:15,140
The one who took away Princess Qin

598
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,760
is the Master of Yaogui Valley.

599
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,890
He is good at poison.

600
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,180
I think Princess Qin will be fine.

601
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,220
You go to Yaogui Valley

602
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,180
to check.

603
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,600
We must ensure

604
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,250
the safety of Princess Qin.

605
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,140
Yes.

606
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,890
Why hasn't it worked?

607
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,180
Well, that beats me.

608
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:51,690
Your Majesty.

609
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,720
How is Crown Prince?

610
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,510
Although the poison has abated,

611
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,010
it is not good.

612
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,970
The imperial physician said

613
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:00,970
if it's not detoxified

614
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,090
in ten days,

615
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:05,550
the poison will get into organs and kill him.

616
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:07,690
I have let people pass the order.

617
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,350
Whoever saves Crown Prince

618
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,750
will be granted ten thousand taels of gold.

619
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,140
Don’t worry, Your Majesty.

620
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,640
Crown Prince is blessed.

621
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:18,350
He will be fine.

622
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,400
Your Majesty.

623
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:31,100
Did you find out who put the poison?

624
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,090
I tried.

625
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,970
But nothing came up.

626
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:37,970
These servants

627
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,100
were grounded with Crown Prince

628
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,600
in the Sun Hall.

629
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,350
Even if they did it,

630
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:43,550
they couldn’t do it

631
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,970
without leaving a trace.

632
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:47,550
Besides, in these four hours,

633
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,760
I was the only one went there.

634
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,890
In that case,

635
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,890
could it be someone with high martial arts,

636
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:00,350
sneaked into the Hall

637
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,470
and poisoned him.

638
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,510
I’ve thought about it.

639
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,140
But no one is that good

640
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,850
except Prince Qin.

641
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,350
Beauty Blood.

642
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:58,600
How is it?

643
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,550
Is it cured?

644
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:01,800
Fortunately, she sealed

645
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,060
her acupoints in time,

646
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,800
and sealed her core

647
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,140
with a special medicine.

648
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,300
Otherwise, something bad would happen.

649
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,220
Then make cure

650
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,220
for Yunxi!

651
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,290
Yell at me like that again

652
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,050
and I’ll treat you good.

653
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,760
I’ll go check other medicine.

654
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,850
I’ll be back.

655
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,780
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

656
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,160
You've been hanging around here.

657
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:50,930
Spit it out.

658
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,140
Well, just so we're clear,

659
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,500
I don't get yelled at.

660
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,720
Han Yunxi and Ningjing

661
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,770
went to the Heaven Pit.

662
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,920
When did that happen?

663
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,850
And you’re telling me now?

664
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:11,390
Brother, don’t worry.

665
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,390
They said they would dress like

666
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,260
they’re having a trip.

667
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,550
And they would be back soon.

668
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,470
I wanted to go

669
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,180
with them.

670
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,760
But they didn’t want me to.

671
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:19,010
But, don’t worry.

672
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,550
I sent people follow them.

673
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:21,970
It will be fine.

674
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:22,950
Your Highness!

675
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,910
Physician Gu is here to see you.

676
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:26,300
Brother, relax.

677
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,430
It will be fine.

678
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,390
I’m going to

679
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,640
see if they're back.

680
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:37,550
Your Highness.

681
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,930
You are here. Is it

682
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,470
because something changed with Crown Prince?

683
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,330
Your Highness.

684
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,930
The poison inside Crown Prince

685
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,090
is mixed

686
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,040
by two poisons,

687
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,470
which is hard to tell.

688
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,850
I did my best

689
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:55,180
only to suppress

690
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,100
the poison.

691
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,430
Within eight days,

692
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,550
if there is no cure,

693
00:33:58,970 --> 00:33:59,640
then

694
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,850
the Crown Prince may die.

695
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,250
Your Highness.

696
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:09,600
Time is of the essence.

697
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,000
Then I'll speak plainly.

698
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:13,639
If the Crown Prince can’t be healed this time,

699
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,850
the whole Imperial Hospital

700
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:15,850
will be punished.

701
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,350
And Princess Qin’s father,

702
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,139
Physician Han

703
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,139
is the chief physician

704
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:20,600
of the Imperial Hospital.

705
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,860
He can’t survive this.

706
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:24,219
So I came here

707
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:26,010
to ask Her Highness

708
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,010
to help me

709
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,639
develop the cure.

710
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:32,940
Unfortunately,

711
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:35,550
she and Ningjing

712
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,679
went for a trip.

713
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,600
If that's the case,

714
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,090
I'll send men

715
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:41,350
to get her back.

716
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:42,330
Your Highness.

717
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:44,090
Did Her Highness

718
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,679
go to the Yaogui Valley for the trip?

719
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,179
What makes you say that?

720
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:52,870
Your Highness.

721
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:54,719
Last night, when my medicine boy

722
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,429
was picking medicine

723
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:56,560
near Yaogui Valley,

724
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,140
he saw Gu Qishao and

725
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,350
Ms. Ningjing

726
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,680
help Princess Qin into

727
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,510
the Valley.

728
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,800
He thought he was mistaken.

729
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,320
Now think about it,

730
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,680
that must be Her Highness.

731
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,250
Your Highness.

732
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:15,550
I'm afraid this trip to the Valley

733
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,150
will not be as simple as that.

734
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,220
I would like to go with you.

735
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,470
How is she?

736
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,050
Much better.

737
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,200
But she's not fully recovered.

738
00:35:58,890 --> 00:35:59,720
Don't worry.

739
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:00,970
My poison

740
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:01,800
will control

741
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,930
the toxins in her system.

742
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:03,890
It won’t relapse.

743
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:05,300
What happens after this?

744
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,390
Qishao.

745
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,050
Prince Qin brings men here.

746
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,180
They are at the gate.

747
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,180
He found out

748
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,960
I had the princess so quickly.

749
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,320
Let him in.

750
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,010
Yes.

751
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:32,660
Poison Girl.

752
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,970
You are bold.

753
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,140
You dared come to the Pit yourself.

754
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:36,740
If I didn’t

755
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,800
get there in time,

756
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,970
you would’ve died.

757
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,640
Please, Prince Qin.

758
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,260
Physician Gu.

759
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,010
Please.

760
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,510
That's cold.

761
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,640
Someone is always late.

762
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,660
Poison Girl was almost killed.

763
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,010
I wonder where

764
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,200
Your Highness was?

765
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,160
Your Highness.

766
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,720
Her Highness still has toxins in her body.

767
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,320
If we pull the needle out now,

768
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:21,470
I’m afraid there will be sequela.

769
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:23,350
It takes some internal force

770
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,680
to flush the toxins out.

771
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:26,290
Right.

772
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,390
So,

773
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,140
you better get out of here.

774
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,100
I’ll help her.

775
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,460
It's none of your business.

776
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,680
-Get out.
-You…

777
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:34,640
Go, go, go.

778
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,090
Your Highness,  please.

779
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:02,550
♫ If this world fades ♫

780
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,300
♫ I’ll stay with you ♫

781
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:08,530

00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:26,260

I thought

793
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,390
I would never see you again.

794
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,220
Yunxi.

795
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,550
You never listen.

796
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,260
♫ It’s destiny ♫

797
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:04,470
♫ Also the most beautiful meeting ♫

798
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,100
♫ Don’t hate the destiny ♫

799
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:10,390
♫ Smile fits your face better ♫

800
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:29,850
Your Majesty.

801
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,630
Brother, you’re awake.

802
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,560
Crown Prince.

803
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:39,760
How are you feeling?

804
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,430
Tianmo.

805
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:43,300
Did you see

806
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,670
the person that poisoned you?

807
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,900
Then how come you were poisoned?

808
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,640
How come?

809
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:58,760
No.

810
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,470
Brother.

811
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,050
What is happening?

812
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:06,930
Your Majesty.

813
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:08,180
The poison is backfiring.

814
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,890
Conditions are worsening.

815
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:10,890
What?

816
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,850
You useless fraud!

817
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,100
Send him to jail!

818
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,970
Find someone else qualified to treat Crown Prince!

819
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:26,030
Yes, your majesty!

820
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:26,890
Brother!

821
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,010
Brother!

822
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:40,760
That all of you are looking for Han Yunxi

823
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,620
is sufficient.

824
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,580
If I joined you, I would be mocked.

825
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,360
I will not join you.

826
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,300
Look where we are now.

827
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,090
You’re still caring about yourself.

828
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:48,890
Let me ask you.

829
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:50,220
Your father’s life

830
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,640
or your own dignity is more important?

831
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,350
I don’t know why

832
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:53,930
you are becoming insensitive as you mature.

833
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:54,790
Now come with me

834
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,460
and apologize to your sister.

835
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,510
Mother.

836
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,180
We are both daughters of our father.

837
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,100
Even if I do not beg or apologize,

838
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,510
she will save him either way.

839
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,430
Very well.

840
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:04,430
Han Ruoxue.

841
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:05,350
From now on,

842
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,890
should you wish to degrade yourself to a harlot,

843
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:09,090
then you do not need to follow my orders.

844
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:10,010
Sister.

845
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,390
You are scaring her.

846
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,430
Ruoxue.

847
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,140
Come with us.

848
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:17,050
Trust me.

849
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:17,970
Your sister

850
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:18,930
is not the type of

851
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,260
lady that holds grudge.

852
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:21,720
She will forgive you.

853
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:23,850
Calm down, relax.

854
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,930
Are you feeling better?

855
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:43,390
Yes, I am feeling much better.

856
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:44,990
Thank you for saving my life.

857
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,100
So,

858
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:49,090
I assume you’re leaving here.

859
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,510
When I return with His Highness,

860
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,510
I have important task to finish.

861
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,710
I should not cause you any more trouble.

862
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:54,800
Go ahead.

863
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,140
I am but an outsider who cleared your poison

864
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,640
and stayed up all night,

865
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,930
no comparison to the healer

866
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:00,600
that spent just a few minutes

867
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,330
as your love.

868
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:03,600
This certainly does not

869
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,220
sound like coming from Gu Qishao.

870
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,220
You saved my life.

871
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:07,220
You shall have my gratitude.

872
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,550
And you are no outsider.

873
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:10,940
Rest assured.

874
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,720
You are my dearest friend forever.
