00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,020
Episode 41

3
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,390
Your Highness.

4
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,260
Your Majesty.

5
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:27,760
Rise.

6
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,150
Your Majesty.

7
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,330
The food is getting cold.

8
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,180
Maybe

9
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,430
you can take some porridge.

10
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,370
I don’t feel like eating.

11
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,890
You need to take care, Your Majesty.

12
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,460
Then you can have the chance to revenge.

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,850
I didn’t expect

14
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,800
I would be pushed to the corner

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,180
by Long Feiye.

16
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,220
Now Long Feiye

17
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,140
has already occupied half of Tianning.

18
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,510
Don’t lose your heart!

19
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,760
Your Majesty.

20
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,990
I heard

21
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,240
Baili Mingxiang is in Xijing now.

22
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,490
Maybe

23
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,150
we can get the soft spot

24
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,700
of Long Feiye from her.

25
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,490
Baili Mingxiang

26
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,570
loves Long Feiye very much.

27
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,570
On the way to Xijing,

28
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,320
Li Quan tried to drive a wedge

29
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,360
between the two.

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,320
Unexpectedly,

31
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,610
Baili Mingxiang didn’t show

32
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,610
her hatred for Long Feiye.

33
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,580
It seems that it’s impossible to make her

34
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,190
cooperate with us.

35
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,289
Your Majesty.

36
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,860
Could you allow me

37
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,190
to see Baili?

38
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,050
It’s easy for a woman to know another.

39
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,740
I know

40
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,200
how to persuade her.

41
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,570
Now, I only have you

42
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,990
with me.

43
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,600
Don’t worry, Your Majesty.

44
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,700
I will be with you forever.

45
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,760
Another two silly people

46
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,650
come to Beiming Mountain without preparation.

47
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,700
They’ve been staying here overnight.

48
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,490
They even don’t know they are poisoned

49
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,450
by the morning poison here.

50
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,280
It’s like a young couple.

51
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,610
What a pity!

52
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:37,900
Let’s go.

53
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,930
I can’t believe

54
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,610
there is such kind of

55
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,070
amazing herb in the world.

56
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,240
Traceless Herb

57
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,280
is too capable of absorbing

58
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,070
other herbs.

59
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:30,820
So

60
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,120
it's impossible

61
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:32,740
for other plants

62
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,740
to grow around it.

63
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,070
Now we only have two.

64
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,090
Is it enough?

65
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,990
Yeah. Enough.

66
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,400
Traceless Herb

67
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,950
can absorb the effect

68
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,780
of all other rare herbs around it.

69
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,860
So only a piece of it

70
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,400
is enough for the poisonous plague.

71
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,070
I will pick it now.

72
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:47,570
Wait.

73
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,650
It usually has many attached ones

74
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,820
growing together

75
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,100
with Traceless Herb.

76
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:52,990
But

77
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,150
only the main herb has the effect of detoxifying.

78
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,820
The attached ones are highly poisonous.

79
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,680
Don’t touch it.

80
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,650
Once it is exposed to the sun,

81
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,780
Traceless Herb will get into the soil.

82
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,490
Yuze.

83
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,410
We don’t have enough time.

84
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,210
Let’s try our fortune.

85
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,530
I will pick one first.

86
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,240
If I fail,

87
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,980
you need to give the other one to Gu Beiyue.

88
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:13,610
Please.

89
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,450
Qishao.

90
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,190
It’s not the proper way.

91
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:16,990
In case…

92
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,200
There is no time left

93
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,260
for us to hesitate.

94
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:20,990
Don’t act rashly.

95
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,490
We will surely have another way.

96
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,490
It’s too late.

97
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,450
Qishao.

98
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,570
Take the dagger,

99
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,130
so that you won’t touch them.

100
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,240
Okay.

101
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,030
Qishao.

102
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,490
You can’t die.

103
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,070
Yuze. Yuze!

104
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,360
Yuze. Yuze.

105
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,610
Yuze.

106
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,510
Don’t worry.

107
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,210
I won’t let you die.

108
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,150
Qishao. Qishao.

109
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,740
Qishao. Qishao.

110
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,040
Are you alright?

111
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,570
Qishao. Is it really worth?

112
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,260
You don’t need to do that for me.

113
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,190
What should I do if you die?

114
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,120
I’m really fine.

115
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,780
I’m such an evil person.

116
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,040
The King of the Hell may not want me.

117
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,190
That’s not the time

118
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,740
for playing a joke.

119
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,570
Are you alright?

120
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,240
Is there any problem

121
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,070
with the herb?

122
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,320
No.

123
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,360
I feel

124
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,240
it's counteracting one toxin with another.

125
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,700
Miss Baili.

126
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,900
Do you

127
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,030
get used to living here?

128
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,610
Who are you?

129
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,820
This is Concubine Qing.

130
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,200
Your Highness.

131
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,740
Don’t bother, Miss Baili.

132
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:44,780
I heard you

133
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,490
love Long Feiye very much.

134
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,280
I’ve been moved by you.

135
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:50,650
But it’s a pity

136
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,320
that Long Feiye loves

137
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,700
Han Yunxi deeply.

138
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,820
He even revealed his identity

139
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,550
of the Gu-infected man for her.

140
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,570
What?

141
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,190
You don’t know it?

142
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,150
While on the city wall,

143
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,820
Long Feiye changed into the Gu-infected man

144
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,280
in order to save Han Yunxi.

145
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,030
It’s pitiful

146
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,250
that you loved the wrong person.

147
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,280
Are you here

148
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,680
just for telling me this?

149
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,360
No.

150
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,610
There is something more important

151
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:23,900
I’d like to tell you.

152
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,980
Long Feiye made an announcement to the public

153
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,610
that he would confer Han Yunxi the title of Queen.

154
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,400
He even

155
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,179
won't confer any new concubines.

156
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,610
Han Yunxi

157
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,799
will be the only one he loves the most.

158
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:41,950
Today,

159
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:43,510
it’s the big day

160
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,500
that Long Feiye confers the Queen.

161
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,400
No,

162
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:47,740
it’s impossible.

163
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,000
Why isn’t it possible?

164
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,700
You’ve been missing for a long time.

165
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,610
But Long Feiye didn’t

166
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,940
send people to find you.

167
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,200
He is even in the vein

168
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,150
for showing his affection

169
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,570
for Han Yunxi.

170
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,260
Can’t you see

171
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,900
he really doesn’t

172
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,430
have any affection for you?

173
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,700
Miss Baili,

174
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,490
we both are women.

175
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,400
I can’t stand that

176
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,110
you were kept in the dark.

177
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,180
So I’m here to tell you that.

178
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:19,530
No.

179
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,950
I won’t believe any of your words.

180
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,280
If you don’t believe me,

181
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,190
come with me to have a look.

182
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:41,950
See?

183
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,680
That’s the capital on the other side of the river.

184
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,740
Now the fireworks are magnificent.

185
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,860
If it’s not for the ceremony
of conferring the Queen,

186
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,990
what’s for?

187
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,280
Miss Baili.

188
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:04,610
Listen,

189
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,400
you’d better let it go.

190
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,850
Long Feiye doesn’t belong to you.

191
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,270
If you go on like this,

192
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,450
the one gets hurt

193
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,570
will only be you.

194
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,360
Feiye

195
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,850
won't treat me like this.

196
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,810
He won’t do that to me.

197
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,230
Look. The capital is so busy and lively.

198
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,400
It’s completely not like here.

199
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,530
Here is so lifeless.

200
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:47,860
I heard

201
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,610
they are celebrating Queen conferring.

202
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,530
I can’t believe the useless daughter
of the Han family

203
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,110
can have the one loves her so much.

204
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,860
What nonsense are you talking about?

205
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,780
Feiye won’t marry

206
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,190
the ugly girl and confer her Queen.

207
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,720
What a crazy woman! Go away!

208
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,060
Why are you treating me like this?

209
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,450
I like you so much.

210
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,220
Don’t you really

211
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,460
care about me?

212
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,190
I’ve suffered a lot,

213
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,650
even my life, for you.

214
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:24,200
Is it really like

215
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,570
what Chu Qingge said?

216
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:27,860
You really don’t

217
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,150
care about me?

218
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,780
Feiye.

219
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,490
Why?

220
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,780
Is Han Yunxi better than me?

221
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:39,860
Why don’t you

222
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,150
care about me at all?

223
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,560
Carry her back.

224
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,200
Why are you with him?

225
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,900
Since you are together,

226
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,200
you both are my enemies.

227
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,410
I will kill both of you.

228
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,110
Why did you treat me like that?

229
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,200
Why?

230
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,530
I still remember

231
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,240
you were very smart

232
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,900
when you were young.

233
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,820
Your mother is the love of my life.

234
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,990
We loved each other very much.

235
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,920
Why are you here?

236
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,360
You are back.

237
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,450
Why haven’t you

238
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,700
been home all day?

239
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,280
Busy.

240
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,280
What are you busy with?

241
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:32,820
Feiye hasn’t felt good recently.

242
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,570
I have to

243
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,830
handle many things.

244
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,610
I’m so tired.

245
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,730
What do you want me to do?

246
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,320
They opened a new restaurant in the city.

247
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,780
It’s said that the sugar steamed curds and whey

248
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,740
there is amazing.

249
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,150
Could we go there tomorrow?

250
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,200
I will go to the barracks

251
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,450
and help Feiye to reward the troops.

252
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,740
You can go there by yourself.

253
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,780
Now let me have some sleep.

254
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,820
I didn’t realize

255
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,380
it’s really hard for Feiye until now.

256
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,530
You look tired too.

257
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,080
I won’t disturb you.

258
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,320
Just sleep.

259
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,660
[Hongfu Inn]

260
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,740
It’s nice. A lively place.

261
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:02,950
Of course.

262
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,150
This is the best restaurant

263
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,450
in the capital.

264
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,490
Many high officials and noble lords come here.

265
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,650
I have to reserve this box

266
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,190
three days in advance.

267
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:10,860
Really?

268
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,850
Then why don’t you invite Tang Li?

269
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,030
Did you quarrel

270
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,450
like you did last time,

271
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,480
so you took me here instead?

272
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,240
He is too busy.

273
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,240
I heard Feiye has been sick

274
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,240
recently.

275
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,020
So he has to help Feiye

276
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,150
to do many things.

277
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,680
Feiye actually

278
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,610
hoped us to marry early.

279
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:37,990
But he

280
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,400
is too busy to see me.

281
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,570
I really don’t know

282
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,900
when we can get married.

283
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,030
By the way, Miss Ningjing,

284
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,160
I suddenly remember

285
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:46,820
I have many things to do.

286
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,250
I have to leave now.

287
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,030
Sit down.

288
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,780
Take it easy.

289
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,400
I’m asking you here

290
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,820
to talk about

291
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,190
you and Zhuyu.

292
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,780
She is a good girl.

293
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,320
You should cherish her.

294
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,530
I…

295
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,950
You’ve kept rushing around every day.

296
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,200
Don’t you miss her?

297
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,780
Surely I miss her.

298
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,280
No.

299
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,110
I mean

300
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,560
we always spend more time apart
than we do together.

301
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,320
Anyway, we’ve been used to it.

302
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,180
It’s also good to be in this state.

303
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,460
Every time we meet,

304
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,700
we have a lot of things to talk about.

305
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,910
I’m really envious.

306
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,190
Cheers.

307
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,320
To you and Zhuyu.

308
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,310
Wish you a lifetime of happiness.

309
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,240
Okay.

310
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:38,410
Cheers.

311
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,360
Then I’m leaving now.

312
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:49,780
Hello.

313
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,400
Excuse me.

314
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,070
It’s full now.

315
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,410
To Sir Beigong’s room.

316
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,030
Sorry, sir.

317
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,860
This way, please.

318
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,320
Please.

319
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:05,780
Mind your step.

320
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,700
It’s a bit steep.

321
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,560
Let me help you.

322
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:10,569
Thank you.

323
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:17,510
Your Highness.

324
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:18,490
Please sit down.

325
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:19,609
Please.

326
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,280
Here is to you.

327
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,390
Your Highness.

328
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,150
It’s my honor

329
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,950
to have the meal with you here.

330
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,240
You’ve invited me for several times.

331
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,300
If I kept refusing,

332
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,240
I’m afraid I would be regarded

333
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,100
as insensible.

334
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,400
You must be kidding.

335
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,280
You are very busy.

336
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,450
Today, you have to go to the barracks

337
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,360
and help His Highness to reward the troops.

338
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,400
You’ve worked day and night

339
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,900
for the government affairs.

340
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,030
That’s why

341
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,440
I invited you to come out

342
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,700
for some rest.

343
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,200
Take a good rest,

344
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,130
then you can finish the things more effectively.

345
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,900
Thank you,

346
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,240
Sir Beigong.

347
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,530
My daughter had a trip with you

348
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,150
on Dry Lake.

349
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,200
How do you think

350
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,110
about the scenery of Dry Lake?

351
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,050
Miss Ningjing.

352
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,860
It’s magnificent.

353
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,860
It’s worthy of being called
the first lake in the capital.

354
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,860
Since I had such a beautiful lady with me,

355
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,260
it's really a great trip.

356
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,650
Your Highness, you think highly of my daughter.

357
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,320
It’s really our honor.

358
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,530
Take a toast. Come on.

359
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:29,490
Father.

360
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,650
What are you saying?

361
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:31,780
His Highness is not

362
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,990
an impolite person.

363
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,030
Thank you.

364
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,700
I only have one daughter.

365
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,530
So I may have spoiled her.

366
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,530
Please excuse us, Your Highness.

367
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,200
You are worrying too much.

368
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,400
She is frank

369
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,400
and lovely.

370
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,570
Since you say so,

371
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,740
I will ask her

372
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,360
to go out with you

373
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:53,360
more often.

374
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,820
How can I waste her time?

375
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,200
Your Highness,

376
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,570
I have enough time.

377
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,950
Calm down, Miss Ningjing.

378
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,900
His Highness is just acting

379
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,500
according to the situation.

380
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,110
Tang Li!

381
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,190
You said you were busy with work, didn’t you?

382
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,390
Then why are you here?

383
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,700
I’m talking about government affairs.

384
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,400
Xifeng, take Ningjing back.

385
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,280
Shut up!

386
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:21,320
Affairs?

387
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,610
It must be about the marriage, right?

388
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,360
What nonsense are you talking about?

389
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,190
Go back now.

390
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,250
What’s wrong?

391
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,240
Are you trying to kick me out

392
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,920
because I saw your good deal?

393
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:31,400
I…

394
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,820
I won’t go.

395
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:34,450
Who are you?

396
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,790
How dare you be so rude?

397
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,400
Me?

398
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,820
I’m Tang Li’s unmarried wife.

399
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,860
You’d better

400
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,190
stop thinking too much.

401
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,450
Since you are unmarried,

402
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,580
you are not his wife.

403
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,190
You…

404
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,200
-How can you be so rude?
-Sir Beigong.

405
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,820
Tang Li and I have the engagement

406
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,990
at the request of our parents.

407
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,590
It’s not what you can insult!

408
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,650
Ningjing,

409
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:58,490
you are going too far!

410
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,320
Apologize!

411
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,320
-You scold me for the sake of a stranger.
-Father.

412
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,380
I won’t apologize.

413
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:04,950
You…

414
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,980
Then get out quickly.

415
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,780
Xifeng.

416
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,240
Don’t force me.

417
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,150
I will go by myself!

418
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,150
Xifeng.

419
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:16,900
Watch her.

420
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,110
Don’t let her kick up a row.

421
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:18,650
Yes.

422
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,430
Miss Ningjing.

423
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:30,650
Miss Ningjing.

424
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,910
Why are you running?

425
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,240
Just now,

426
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,650
you didn’t eat too much.

427
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,530
How about

428
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,490
we go somewhere else to eat something?

429
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,360
No, I don’t.

430
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,780
It already made me full.

431
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:46,530
In my opinion,

432
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,610
you really went too far just now.

433
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:49,470
Think about it.

434
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,030
The girl was splashed water by you.

435
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,070
She is innocent.

436
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,360
She deserves it.

437
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:54,570
She even tried to rob my husband.

438
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,500
I surely can splash water into her.

439
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,400
I believe

440
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,990
His Highness has no interest

441
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,900
to the girl.

442
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:02,860
They have a meal together

443
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,990
just for kindness.

444
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,310
Think about it.

445
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:06,950
Her father is an official.

446
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,740
He has to save his face.

447
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:10,780
Don’t talk for him.

448
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:11,990
Look, he still hasn’t

449
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:12,850
come out for me.

450
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,530
He must be blaming me

451
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:14,730
for disturbing them.

452
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,260
I won’t listen to him no matter what he says.

453
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,530
His Highness is coming.

454
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,240
Look.

455
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,900
Since His Highness is here,

456
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,990
I’m leaving now.

457
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,190
What are you doing here?

458
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,030
Why don’t you accompany

459
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:33,820
the lady?

460
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,030
You’ve ran away.

461
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,530
How can I keep accompanying the lady?

462
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:37,610
You’ve talked

463
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,820
about marriage with her.

464
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,740
Just let me alone.

465
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,450
Moreover,

466
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,990
if you marry her,

467
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,530
how will you introduce me?

468
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,490
What are you talking about?

469
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,150
Who told you I would marry her?

470
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,610
I’ve heard it.

471
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,860
Don’t try to deny.

472
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,360
Why don’t you understand it?

473
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,700
The former officials of Tianning

474
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,610
pay allegiance to us seemingly.

475
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,540
But nobody knows

476
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,270
what their real thoughts are.

477
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:57,650
I have to take time

478
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,610
to check it out

479
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,650
one by one.

480
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,360
They are actively coming for us.

481
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,280
That’ll be better than I find an excuse

482
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,610
to go for them.

483
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,150
What’s more,

484
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,360
special attention should be paid to Beigong Heze.

485
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,190
Do you still remember

486
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:10,820
how he treated us

487
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,780
before?

488
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,650
Is it true?

489
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,990
What else?

490
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,740
If I really have the thought,

491
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:19,930
why do you think I am here?

492
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,410
I can take a rest if I have time, can’t I?

493
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:26,200
My lady,

494
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:27,510
I’m really busy

495
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,200
recently.

496
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,650
Please show some mercy.

497
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,000
Don’t let me worry about you.

498
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:38,990
Tang Li.

499
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,530
I’m hungry.

500
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:46,480
Let’s go.

501
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,600
I will take you to have something.

502
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,820
It’s been baked for a long time.

503
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,240
Why isn’t there any change at all?

504
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,400
It’s the same as the hearsay.

505
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,950
Traceless Herb really needs to be baked

506
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,070
for half a month

507
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,590
before it’s getting dry.

508
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,200
In this case,

509
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,850
it has to be baked for months

510
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,570
before it becomes completely dry.

511
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,610
Several months.

512
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,740
It’ll be too late.

513
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:28,950
How about

514
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,550
we act separately.

515
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,530
You stay here

516
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:32,590
and keep baking it.

517
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:33,900
I will take this piece

518
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,150
to Gu Beiyue.

519
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,070
Qishao,

520
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,190
I will go with you.

521
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,150
Yuze,

522
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,030
you must know

523
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,570
what the most favorable option is

524

527
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,110
And it’ll be a hard trip.

533
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:53,570

You are really clever.

Yunxi,

555
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:24,400
you should take care

I’m okay.

00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,200
Since I couldn’t sleep well,

560
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,860
it’s better to do more things.

561

Will you go to the palace?

562
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,200
I developed a new medicine,

563
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,570
and I want to take it to His Highness for a try.

564

Hope it can be effective.

565

This

is the antidote to Beauty Blood

Hold on.

570
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,480
I remember that my father said

571
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,530
there is some other way
to detoxify the poisonous Gu.

572
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,990
He really didn’t tell you?

573
00:25:58,450 --> 00:25:59,650
No, he didn’t tell me.

574
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,030
He must have told you

575
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,070
a lie

576
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,150
to make you feel relieved.

577

I’ve never heard

578
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,530
there is antidote to poisonous Gu.

579
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:09,900
Logically,

580
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:12,240
the physician should have thought about antidote

581
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,900
while developing the poison.

582
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,700
Don’t worry too much.

583
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,440
His Highness is Ares.

584
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,490
He’s body is different from the ordinary people.

585

Think about it.

There were so many Gu-infected men,

587

but His Highness is the only one alive.

588
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,150

624
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,360
all because of Han Yunxi.

625
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:10,950
I can’t feel relieved

626
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,860
if I don’t kill her with my own hands.

627

to persuade His Majesty,

634
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,320

It’s really good news.

643

It means Poison Master died

644
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,530
and Long Feiye’s poison

645
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:13,730
can't be detoxified.

647

00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,650
Please take it easy, Your Majesty.

699
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,450
They are all unique experts.

700
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,670
Only if they don’t show their slip,

701
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,070
but return to the capital with Baili

702
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,360
and go to Long Feiye,

703
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:17,320
they can take the chance to kill him.

704
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:17,990
Yes.

705
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,360
Wait.

706
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,450
In order to make sure there is no failure,

707
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:24,740
you also go with them

708
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,820
as a command.

709
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,450
Report it to me if anything happens.

710
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,950
Yes. Your Majesty.

711
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,730
Ya!

712
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,150
Ya!

713
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:25,780
Yunxi.

714
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:27,090
You are really

715
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,489
in Physician Gu’s house.

716
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:30,850
I don’t know you. Go away.

717
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:34,050
It’s really hard for me to get back.

718
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,100
Don’t you miss me?

719
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:40,050
I’m here for Physician Gu.

720
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,219
I have something very important

721
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,350
to discuss with him.

722
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:44,350
Tell me what it is.

723
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:45,330
I will tell him.

724
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:47,040
Leave here once you finish.

725
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:48,179
It’s been a long time.

726
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:50,179
Why did you become so cold-hearted?

727
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,389
I came back from Beiming Mountain.

728
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:53,719
I almost died, you know?

729
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,100
But you still treat me like this.

730
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,510
I’m really sad.

731
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,220
Didn’t you return to Beili?

732
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:58,720
Yeah.

733
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,140
I’ve returned to Beili.

734
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,470
And before going back to the Southern Regions,

735
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,260
I’ve broken off the relationship

736
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,050
with Beili.

737
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,080
Now I’m no longer Beili’s people.

738
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:07,200
That’s good.

739
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,930
You are finally free.

740
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,600
But you cheated me.

741
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:13,350
That already happened.

742
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,680
There is no trust in us.

743
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,100
We can’t be friends any longer.

744
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:16,800
Yunxi.

745
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,430
It’s my fault I lied to you.

746
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,510
But from now on,

747
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,970
I won’t cheat you anymore.

748
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:21,970
Forgive me, okay?

749
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:24,990
What’s more,

750
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:26,390
I never just

751
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,910
consider you as a friend.

752
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,100
I will continue my work. You should leave now.

753
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:30,850
I won’t go.

754
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:31,930
I’ve said

755
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,010
I will stay here

756
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,470
and wait for Physician Gu.

757
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,890
Physician Gu is busy.

758
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:37,790
It’s uncertain

759
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,470
if he can come back.

760
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,260
If you really feel anxious,

761
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,590
go to the palace for him.

762
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:42,360
The palace?

763
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,450
It’s already been

764
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:45,050
mastered by the Xuanyuan’s.

765
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:45,840
What’s more,

766
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,360
Long Feiye won’t let me in.

767
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,760
Then you may go to the inn.

768
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,200
After Physician Gu gets back,

769
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,600
I will tell him to see you.

770
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,450
Yunxi.

771
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,410
I don’t have a penny in my pocket.

772
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,930
Would you show your mercy

773
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,680
and allow me to stay here?

774
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,740
There is a bed over there.

775
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,280
I will sleep here, okay?

776
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,610
Also there is some food to eat.

777
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:07,450
I will have some and then get some rest.

778
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:08,400
Then I will wait

779
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:10,260
for Physician Gu quietly here.

780
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,150
Hey, you…

781
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,240
I will have some food

782
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,300
and get some sleep.

783
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,150
That’s great.

784
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:27,570
Yunxi,

785
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,250
I can see you every day from now on

786
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:32,060
and I can also chat with you.

787
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,450
Does it mean

788
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,190
I’ve got

789
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,280
my beloved?

790
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:49,700
[Qin]

791
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,780
Miss Baili,

792
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,570
you are back.

793
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:15,990
Physician Gu,

794
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:19,070
how’s Feiye been

795
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,070
in the period

796
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,520
I wasn’t in the capital?

797
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:23,570
After

798
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,400
the poisonous Gu attacked,

799
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,720
His Highness hasn’t been good.

800
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,060
Since he’s not good in health,

801
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,610
why did they hold the wedding?

802
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:32,400
Wedding?

803
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:33,920
What do you mean?

804
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,990
There was a ceremony

805
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,110
of conferring Queen in the palace

806
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,510
some time ago, wasn’t it?

807
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,160
I didn’t hear about it.

808
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,240
Who told you that, Miss Baili?

809
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:46,990
Chu Qingge,

810
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,870
you told a lie to let me come back.

811
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,820
Since the title of Queen hasn’t been conferred,

812
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,780
it means

813
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,360
Han Yunxi is not the only one

814
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,570
in Feiye’s mind.

815
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,400
I still have a chance.

816
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,490
That’s great.

817
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,100
By the way, Physician Gu,

818
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,610
my Beauty Blood

819
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:09,610
can save Feiye.

820
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,700
Now, I’d like you to help me

821
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,270
develop the antidote

822
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,190
to save him.

823
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,030
The…

824
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:20,740
Physician Gu,

825
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,340
you don’t want to save Feiye?

826
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,280
Nobody else

827
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,730
can save him, except me.

828
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:25,740
Fine.

829
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,110
Miss Baili,

830
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,330
please come with me.

831
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,820
Yunxi, time for dinner!

832
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:39,240
Yunxi, time for dinner!

833
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:42,950
Come on.

834
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:44,860
It’s really hard

835
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,610
for me

836
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,340
to do this.

837
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,050
So many dishes.

838
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,320
Can you finish them?

839
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:50,700
I saw you didn’t eat well

840
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,700
all these days,

841
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,060
so I bought a bit more.

842
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,610
Just have those you like,

843
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,070
and leave the rest to me.

844
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,750
You said you didn’t have a penny.

845
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,030
Yeah, that’s right.

846
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:02,530
I bought these

847
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,630
without paying.

848
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,530
Give me some money,

849
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,990
and I will pay them later.

850
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:07,740
In this case,

851
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,820
I can buy again.

852
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,740
What a cunning guy!

853
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,750
You bought me food with my money.

854
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,700
Don’t worry.

855
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,150
From now on,

856
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:17,780
I will be your servant.

857
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:19,740
You are

858
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,820
a childe who never did

859
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,610
housework.

860
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:22,740
Being my servant

861
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,450
is kind of troublesome for me.

862
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:24,190
After finishing,

863
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,150
go anywhere you should go.

864
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,080
Don’t stay here.

865
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,150
I can’t serve you.

866
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,190
Don’t say that.

867
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:29,950
I can develop the antidote.

868
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,110
You will develop the antidote

869
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:33,030
to poisonous Gu of Long Feiye, right?

870
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,190
I can help you.

871
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,780
Don’t bother.

872
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:39,320
What’s more,

873
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:40,070
I will wait

874
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,110
for Gu Beiyue.

875
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:43,740
He’s now

876
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,430
busy in Imperial Hospital.

877
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:46,490
He doesn’t have

878
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:47,700
time and energy.

879
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:49,990
Gu Beiyue

880
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,820
is a layman for detoxifying.

881
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,820
You will surely need me.

882
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,610
I am the best helper for you.

883
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,860
You hate Long Feiye, don’t you?

884
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,990
Why will you help me?

885
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:05,390
Yeah, I hate Long Feiye very much.

886
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,210
But if it will make you happy,

887
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,530
I can do anything.

888
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,360
I don’t want you to do things

889
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,780
you don’t like for me.

890
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,530
-And…
-And what?

891
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,110
Anyway, don’t waste time

892
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:18,860
on me.

893
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,320
This is my choice.

894
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,820
You have your obsession.

895
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,750
I have my option.

896
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,700
None of us

897
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,110
can persuade the other side.

898
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,240
Let the time make it.

899
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,200
Don’t you want to save him?

900
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,340
Of course I want to.

901
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,740
Since you want to save him,

902
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,610
I will help you.

903
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,580
Physician Gu.

904
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:44,900
Miss Baili,

905
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,110
you've lost a lot of blood.

906
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,770
Why don’t you take a good rest?

907
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:49,570
Don’t tell anything

908
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:51,200
about this to Feiye.

909
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,360
Since you are willing

910
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:55,990
to save His Highness by sacrificing yourself,

911
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:58,120
why don’t you want him to know about it?

912
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,950
Feiye

913
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:00,990
always

914
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,480
worries about my health

915
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:05,280
and disagrees with me on cultivating Beauty Blood.

916
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,360
If he knows it,

917
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:08,780
I’m afraid he won’t take the medicine.

918
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,990
So please.

919
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,190
Okay. I see.

920
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,990
Please take it easy.

921
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,110
Besides Beauty Blood,

922
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,780
I also put some other medicine in it.

923
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,910
It has heavy flavor.

924
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,490
His Highness won’t find it through taste.

925
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:22,890
Thank you, Physician Gu.

926
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,240
Han Yunxi.

927
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,900
Your happy life

928
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,450
will end soon.

929
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,880
How do you feel, Your Highness?

930
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:51,400
I feel

931
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,200
it is familiar.

932
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,300
It seems that I had it before.

933
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:00,800
The medicine

934
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,930
is a new one I developed recently.

935
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,650
I used a lot of rare herbs.

936
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,710
It seems that it’s effective

937
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,150
according to your complexion.
