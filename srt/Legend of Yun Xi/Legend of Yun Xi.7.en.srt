Episode 7

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:08,600
Lady!

4
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,910
Lady, I’m sorry that you were scared.

5
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:36,550
Lady.

6
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,050
I am an imperial physician,

7
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:38,680
Gu Beiyue.

8
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,100
I come for autopsy under the king’s order.

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,260
That is

10
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,430
my pet.

11
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,550
Lady, are you all right?

12
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,470
Gu Beiyue.

13
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,050
There’s no result

14
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,220
of your autopsy.

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,760
But why are you still here?

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,720
Sorry about that.

17
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,800
But I still want

18
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:53,750
to have a check.

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,550
So I didn’t leave.

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,390
I apologize that

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,970
my pet scared you.

22
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,180
What did you find?

23
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,140
I have some knowledge of medicine.

24
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,760
But I just know a few of poison.

25
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,970
These poisons are very weird.

26
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,180
Even the best poison medicals

27
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,010
can’t get a result.

28
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,760
Physician Gu, you are too modest.

29
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,850
Everyone knows that

30
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:16,450
you are the

31
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,140
youngest talented imperial physician.

32
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,720
Your medicine guidance

33
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,010
brought many benefits to people.

34
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,890
You know me?

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,890
I don’t know you,

36
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,850
but I’m familiar with your name.

37
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:33,600
I’m flattered.

38
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:35,570
By the way,

39
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,550
could you tell me why you came?

40
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:39,640
I...

41
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,180
I was

42
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,850
sent by Han Cong’an,

43
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,009
Physician Han.

44
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,180
Physician Han?

45
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,259
This morning, Physician Han told me

46
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,180
that they don’t have any clue of this case.

47
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,390
They don’t know what kind of the poison it is.

48
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,520
So they sent me here.

49
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,850
I see.

50
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,300
Physician Han recommended you.

51
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,100
So lady,

52
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,840
you must be very outstanding.

53
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,180
I am flattered.

54
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:06,760
Lady,

55
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,139
don’t underestimate yourself.

56
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:09,509
Actually poison can also save people

57
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:11,140
if you use it in a right way.

58
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,260
You really think so?

59
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,260
People beside me all say

60
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,760
that I don’t focus on the right thing.

61
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,850
They are ashamed me because I study poison.

62
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:21,640
Of course.

63
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:22,470
Lady.

64
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,220
You are

65
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,800
saving people.

66
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,390
So hope you

67
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,140
ignore those words.

68
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,300
You are really

69
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,390
knowledgeable.

70
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,630
Thanks for saying these to me.

71
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,880
I’ll test the poison.

72
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:37,970
Lady,

73
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,950
thanks for showing me your skill.

74
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,850
Mosquitoes bit him.

75
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,010
Is this

76
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,430
mosquito?

77
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,550
Poisonous mosquitoes.

78
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,600
This liquid is to test poison.

79
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
It reacts when

80
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,410
meeting something poisonous.

81
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,600
Lady, you are amazing.

82
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,610
Do you know what poison it is?

83
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:52,760
Lady.

84
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,100
What’s wrong?

85
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,470
Smell it.

86
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,050
Sandalwood?

87
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:07,970
But the odor

88
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,100
is mixed.

89
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,260
Normally,

90
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,220
the odor of sandalwood

91
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,350
can’t last so long.

92
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:14,850
Let me see.

93
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,100
I got it!

94
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,710
I read it in from ancient book.

95
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,350
A poisonous mosquito

96
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,800
is named spider mosquito.

97
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,760
It will crazily suck blood

98
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,220
after smelling some odor.

99
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,010
These people must eat or

100
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,470
use something,

101
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,760
and these things were with this odor.

102
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,010
So they were bit by spider mosquitoes

103
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,210
and died from poison.

104
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,050
What a sharp way.

105
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,300
Lady.

106
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:10,510
Which

107
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,550
ancient book did

108
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,350
you read?

109
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,430
I also want to read it.

110
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,510
Which book?

111
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,800
I don’t remember it.

112
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:24,650
Physician Gu,

113
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,210
I’ll go back to report this.

114
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,140
See you.

115
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:31,430
Lady...

116
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,600
An ancient book.

117
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:44,580
[Gorgeous Chamber]

118
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,090
You told me that
your poisonous mosquito powder was finished.

119
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,220
I made some for you.

120
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,930
Prepare some.

121
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,680
Thanks.

122
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,159
The case has not been finished.

123
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,090
Long Feiye was removed from office.

124
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,220
He will have time

125
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,810
to investigate this case.

126
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,100
So for these days,

127
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,910
it’s better that you stay home.

128
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,540
After this thing is settle,

129
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,210
I’ll ask Bai Su to contact you.

130
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,390
Can’t I contact you?

131
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,510
Unless it’s necessary.

132
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:13,970
Will you leave?

133
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,010
Do you have something else?

134
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,940
Those bodies are still in Yi Manor.

135
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:18,850
I heard that King Tianhui

136
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,430
asked the imperial physicians to investigate.

137
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,220
Do I need to

138
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,090
erase them?

139
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,850
These are stupid physicians.

140
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,760
Do you think they can make it clear?

141
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,470
We just need to

142
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,430
wait and see.

143
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,600
Taking actions

144
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,010
will expose us.

145
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,050
And then,

146
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,630
Long Feiye will suspect us.

147
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,090
How cruel the murderer is.

148
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,140
These odor is not

149
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,600
hurtful to people.

150
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,070
But it appeals spider mosquitoes.

151
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,640
As a physician,

152
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,690
of course I’ll find nothing.

153
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,300
After being bit by spider mosquitoes,

154
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,700
their veins were numbed.

155
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,970
Then the heart stopped beating.

156
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,890
No mark was left.

157
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,740
What an experienced prisoner.

158
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,680
Mercy. Mercy.

159
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,050
Please. Please.

160
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,640
Thanks, thanks.

161
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,470
Thanks, wish you a good day.

162
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,870
Thanks.

163
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,170
Nice to see you again, girl.

164
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,300
Thanks.

165
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,980
Thanks for your taels.

166
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,100
I’ll give you back

167
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,740
next time.

168
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,300
Only you can help others.

169
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,470
I can’t?

170
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,090
Thank you. Thank you.

171
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,090
What? You always thank me.

172
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,510
Do you know

173
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,340
how many times you thanked me?

174
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,970
Please be sincere.

175
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,390
Well,

176
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,680
how about treating you to meal next time?

177
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,300
No.

178
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,370
You told me this for many times.

179
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,430
I didn’t think I

180
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,970
could meet you again soon.

181
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,010
This is our destiny.

182
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,510
Yes, yes.

183
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:23,970
What do you want?

184
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,090
Mind your manner.

185
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,550
It’s like

186
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,610
I’m forcing you.

187
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,390
I’m so sad.

188
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,860
Alright. I won’t play jokes.

189
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,470
Go to have lunch with me.

190
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,720
I... don’t have money?

191
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,970
Are you serious?

192
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,510
Alright.

193
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,100
You treat me, and I pay for the bill.

194
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,160
Are you satisfied?

195
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,760
But...

196
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:51,680
What?

197
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,130
Just have lunch with me.

198
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,510
Girl.

199
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,760
Tell me the truth.

200
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,100
You said you’ll treat me to meal.

201
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,180
Did you lie?

202
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,640
No.

203
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,140
I really have something important now.

204
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,140
When I’m available,

205
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,680
I’ll go to say “thank you”.

206
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,530
You can’t go.

207
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,280
It’s not sure

208
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,640
when you have time.

209
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,350
Fine.

210
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,180
I know a very good

211
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,050
restaurant.

212
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,140
It’s deal.

213
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,220
Go.

214
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,140
That way.

215
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,350
Your highness.

216
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,430
Your highness.

217
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,050
You came back so early today.

218
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,760
Where is the princess?

219
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,800
She is still in the room.

220
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,350
Enjoy your noodles.

221
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,510
Thanks.

222
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,640
Smells so good.

223
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,960
You always come here?

224
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,760
This is my secret base.

225
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,490
When I was unhappy,

226
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,510
I would come here

227
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,550
to have noodles.

228
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,680
And then, I would be enlightened.

229
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,220
If you

230
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,160
didn’t save me,

231
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,660
I wouldn’t take you here.

232
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,850
So, I should say “thank you”.

233
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,550
No worries.

234
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,770
Taste your noodles.

235
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,180
We have a manner to eat noodles.

236
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,510
You can’t break the noodles.

237
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,800
Have them at one time.

238
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,550
Such serious?

239
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,020
What if I break them?

240
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,280
Your life will be shortened.

241
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,930
Really?

242
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,140
It’s better

243
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,800
trust this foretell.

244
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,760
♫If this world fades♫

245
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:08,430
♫I’ll stay with you♫

246
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,800
You broke your noodles.

247
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,100
You said it to me.

248
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,720
I’m worried about your life.

249
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:21,350
Eat.

250
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,140
Eat.

251
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,640
♫I’ll seam it for you♫

252
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,510
♫With my strings♫

253
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,090
The dowager

254
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,430
has suspected

255
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,300
my identity.

256
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,850
The princess Qin wants to find

257
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,180
the wind clan tattoo of the prince’s body.

258
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,160
Your highness,

259
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,800
we need to make the poison

260
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,470
out of your body with the needle now.

261
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,090
Otherwise,

262
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,490
it will hurt your health.

263
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,000
Your highness.

264
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,910
Your back also needs a treatment.

265
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,500
Your highness,

266
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,220
I serve you

267
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,390
out of my will.

268
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,720
I’ve been out for long.

269
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,650
I need to go back.

270
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:55,890
Sorry. Sorry.

271
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,180
Your bottle.

272
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:21,380
[Gorgeous Chamber]

273
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:27,350
Lady.

274
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,850
You shouldn’t go in.

275
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,600
What a pity.

276
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,470
I didn’t see her face.

277
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,350
Your highness,

278
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,850
the snacks are ready.

279
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,100
Madam.

280
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,390
Bring me

281
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,270
the Thousand Years’ Blood Jade.

282
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,560
Yes, your highness.

283
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,120
Your highness.

284
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,100
Look.

285
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,640
Father gave

286
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,260
this jade to mother

287
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,100
as her birthday gift.

288
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,760
My mother loved it most.

289
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,110
After she passed away,

290
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,430
father always

291
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,430
took it.

292
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,430
He didn’t give me

293
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,900
until the war between Xiqiu and Tianning started.

294
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:01,640
I promised

295
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,720
after he went back with victory,

296
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,220
I’ll return

297
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,600
it to him.

298
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,250
Your highness,

299
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,510
now that you love it,

300
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,050
keep it yourself.

301
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,640
Take this jade.

302
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:30,850
On your way,

303
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,100
go in all the halls of concubines

304
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,050
that you see.

305
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,850
You must let

306
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,100
the concubines know

307
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,430
that I ask you to give the dowager

308
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,300
a precious treasure.

309
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,290
Your highness,

310
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,600
we are just new here.

311
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,220
His majesty didn’t come for many days.

312
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,350
Obviously, he desolates you.

313
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:49,140
Your highness, why do

314
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,230
you make enemies in the palace now?

315
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,260
Without this way,

316
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,400
how can we draw

317
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,640
attention?

318
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,970
In the palace,

319
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,890
the king, the dowager

320
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,640
and the concubines

321
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,850
who have had power for long

322
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,600
are watching us.

323
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,810
But we can’t take actions first.

324
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,390
Waiting is the best way.

325
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,600
But

326
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,470
we don’t have much time

327
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,390
to waste here.

328
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,850
I can’t be calm

329
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,220
as long as I don’t avenge my father and my country.

330
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,760
I know.

331
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,180
I’ll go now.

332
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,430
Your highness.

333
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,220
Which hall are you in?

334
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,470
Your highness,

335
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,470
I am from Qinghui Hall.

336
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,010
I’m going to give the dowager

337
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,470
a gift for Concubine Qing.

338
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:57,970
What’s your gift?

339
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,010
Can I have a look?

340
00:16:59,090 --> 00:16:59,950
Your highness,

341
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:00,890
this is

342
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,470
a treasure

343
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,480
for the dowager.

344
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,220
Concubine Qing told

345
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:07,349
me this gift

346
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,089
must be opened by the dowager.

347
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,050
Are you threatening me

348
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:12,099
with the dowager?

349
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,599
No, your highness.

350
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,690
Now that Concubine Qing said so,

351
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:16,930
you may go.

352
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,750
I’ll leave, your highness.

353
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,430
Seems that

354
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:29,150
someone can’t bear his majesty’s desolation.

355
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,190
The barbarian is the barbarian.

356
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,930
Though she’ll

357
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,270
play up to the dowager,

358
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,970
she’s not smart.

359
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:37,950
Your highness,

360
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,760
now his majesty trusts

361
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,260
the second prince more than the dowager.

362
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,390
You were worried

363
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,260
that the honorable Xiqiu’s princess

364
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,760
would take away his majesty’s love

365
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,490
and the second prince might have no one to rely on.

366
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,140
Go to check

367
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,720
what she gives

368
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:52,470
to the dowager.

369
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,180
Yes.

370
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,840
It’s not easy for me to

371
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,300
get here.

372
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,090
I can’t let

373
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,680
a barbarian princess

374
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,640

[Palace of Benevolence and Longevity]

376
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,810
Concubine Qing is really thoughtful.

377
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,350
This kind of blood jade

378
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:24,600
is not easy to see.

379
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,350
I’m afraid

380
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,890
that she’s more thoughtful

381
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,680
than this.

382
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,350
The king is here!

383
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,600
Your majesty.

384
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,430
Mother.

385
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,220
Your highness.

386
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,350
Etiquette is no needed.

387
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,350
Have a seat.

388
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,300
I heard

389
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:59,920
that you took Lord Qin’s military power back.

390
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,760
You’ve known it?

391
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,600
Isn’t it too hurried?

392
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,890
I just wanted to

393
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,800
test his real ability.

394
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,390
But he is so calm.

395
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,230
But it’s not bad.

396
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,000
Without military power,

397
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,150
he’s like a tiger without teeth.

398
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,010
No need to be afraid of him.

399
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,430
I worry that he’s pushed into the corner

400
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,650
and does something unexpected.

401
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,350
When he had military power,

402
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,770
he didn’t take action.

403
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,910
So now, it’s impossible for it.

404
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,260
Don’t worry.

405
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,510
I know what I should do.

406
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,890
Mother, you got a new jade?

407
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:49,970
Concubine Qing

408
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,300
gave me

409
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,470
as a gift.

410
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,050
What do you think of it?

411
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,510
Concubine Qing gave you.

412
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,300
It must be fine.

413

Concubine Qing is extremely gorgeous.

414
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,680
Don’t you have affection to her?

415
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,890
Mother, you know me well.

416
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,970
I spend all my time

417
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,760
on the state’s issue.

418
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,600
How am I available

419
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,600
for these things?

420
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,640
It’s the best.

421
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,970
Beautiful women are dangerous.

422
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,890
You can’t make these mistakes.

423
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,090
The war

424
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,910
between Tianning and Xiqiu was just ended.

425
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,910
Chu Qing’ge came to make peace through marriage.

426
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:49,260
Apparently,

427
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,470
Tianning totally won,

428
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,970
but we also lost much.

429
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,260
Once Xiqiu and Beili fought against us,

430
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,800
we may not win again.

431
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,010
So,

432
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,720
now,

433
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,060
marrying a Xiqiu princess

434
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,600
is the best choice.

435
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:19,760
I know you are a good king,

436
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,050
but I need to remind you.

437
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,050
You are standing

438
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,810
on the top in this country.

439
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,680
Once there’s someone ambitious,

440
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,090
he will take action.

442

was gotten by me.

443
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,430
But it depends on you

444
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,190
whether you can keep it forever.

445
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,640
Don’t forget.

446
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,180
Lord Qin

447
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,470
is keeping his eye

448
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,930
on your throne.

449
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,510
You are right.

450
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,090
I have something to deal with.

451
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,470
I need to go.

452
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,430
You may go.

453
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,850
I can’t control him.

454
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,600
But I am his mother.

455
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,680
Who else will think for him

456
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,430
beside me?

457
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,460
His majesty knows it clearly.

458
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,300
Hopefully.

459
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:53,650
Your majesty.

460
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,430
Will I inform her highness?

461
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,180
Your majesty, I didn’t know you came.

462
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,350
Sorry for neglecting you.

463
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,510
I apologize.

464

I didn’t let them tell you.

466

Don’t apologize.

467
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,800
I knew that

468
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,010
you love reading military books.

469
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:50,090
But I didn’t know that
your painting skill is so good.

470
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:53,180
This is the scenery of Xiqiu?

471
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,180
Yes.

472
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,430
Seems that you miss your home.

473
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,100
I just came here.

were killed consecutively.

00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,390
I heard it.

00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,470
of it?

489
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,560
I don’t dare to talk about the state affairs.

490
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,090
This is related to Lord Qin.

491
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,910
So it’s also a domestic affair.

492

Show your opinions.

493
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,850
I know Lord Qin is brave

494
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,100
and knowledgeable.

495
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:02,820
If he kills

496
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:04,260
someone,

497
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,800
he won’t use

such a stupid way.

499

So you mean

500

Lord Qin is wronged?

501
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:20,410
Your majesty, you also think so, don’t you?

502
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,720
And I think

503
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:24,180
Lord Qin will prove his innocence

504
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,720
by all means.

505
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,660

I just wanted to take Mythical Herb

to cure the ulcer on the face.

515
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,600
I took the book

just to

517
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,090
study the poisonous herb.

518
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,500
I didn’t know your identity

until I married your highness.

But you tried to kill me for many times.

I don’t dare to say the truth.

522

Please check it.

00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,230
Investigate the case?

530
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,760
I’m afraid that

531
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,260
you forgot why

532
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,970
I was suspected.

533
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,140
What do you mean?

534
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,430
On our wedding,

535
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,470
it was you who

536
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:14,600
led me

537
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,520
to the mansion of Chief Justice.

538
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,100
On our wedding,

539
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,180
many people were around me.

540
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,640
How could I lead you there?

541
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,890
Even though it was not you,

542
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,470
it was your partner.

543
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,430
If it was my partner,

544
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,430
why did I

545
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,680
seduce you

546
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,970
under the risk of being exposed

547
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,390
and take chance

548
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,720
to marry you?

549
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,430
I have known

550
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,850
the clue of this case.

551
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,300
They

552
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:51,830
died from the poison of spider mosquitoes.

553
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,470
I did autopsy in Yi Manor.

554
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,970
The Murderer

555
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:56,760
put the powder

556
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,420
into the dead’s food or spice.

557
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,090
When the odor of the poison appeared,

558
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,260
the poisonous mosquitoes came.

559
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,800
They died secretly.

560
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:05,710
Your highness.

561
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,390
Your highness.

562
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,050
We...

563
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,100
Your highness.

564
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,640
We’ve gotten information
from the imperial physicians.

565
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,800
Chief Justice and his family

566
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,600
were killed by a kind of poisonous mosquitoes

567
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,090
named spider mosquitoes.

568
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,970
The murderer

569
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,140
put the powder

570
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,600
into their tea and spice

571
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,220
to appeal the mosquitoes.

572
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,200
But the odor lasted for long,

573
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,260
so

574
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:34,600
the odor we smelled today

575
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,600
is this.

576
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,140
Look.

577
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,100
Look.

578
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,100
Look, look.

579
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,790
Now, you must believe me.

580
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,090
How do you prove that

581
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,820
you didn’t expose your partner

582
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,090
to protect yourself?

583
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,180
How about

584
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,900
I find the one who framed you?

585
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,140
I met a lady

586
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,120
on my way today.

587
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,300
The powder that she took

588
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,180
is this powder.

589
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,300
Sir, you look new here.

590
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,200
It’s the first time you come?

591
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,720
Our girls

592
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,970
are good at everything.

593
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:29,760
Beautiful and talented.

594
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,630
I’m sure you’ll be satisfied.

595
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,090
What do mean?

596
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,680
Are you still a...

597
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:37,140
Madam.

598
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,220
Well...

599
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,960
Go back to your thing.

600
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,780
I’ll ask you if I have problems.

601
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:42,760
Fine.

602
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:43,890
Choose a girl.

603
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:44,890
Tell me

604
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,230
if you have something.

605
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:53,100
I ask you a question.

606
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,050
Tell me

607
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,610
and this will be yours.

608
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:02,300
Which girls do you serve?

609
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,510
I serve the most popular girl,

610
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,600
Yuze.

611
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:05,970
She’s the best advertisement

612
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,010
of Gorgeous Chamber.

613
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:07,890
So madam lets me

614
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:08,930
only serve her.

615
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:09,640
Good.

616
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:10,970
I...

617
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,760
I only love

618
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,350
Yuze.

619
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,220
Thanks, sir.

620
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,010
Sir,

621
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,890
did you choose a girl?

622
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,850
Who do you like?

623
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,260
I want Yuze.

624
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,720
Yuze?

625
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,220
I’m afraid you can’t.

626
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,300
As long as you let me

627
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:39,430
see Yuze,

628
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,890
this gold

629
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,970
is yours.

630
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,430
No.

631
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,350
Why?

632
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:52,800
Yuze

633
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,680
is our most popular girl.

634
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,470
She only

635
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:57,470
serves the top-class men.

636
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,760
You look down on me?

637
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:01,250
Your highness.

638
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:03,350
Do we go to arrest them now?

639
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,520
Only with some powder,

640
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,040
we can’t make sure it’s her.

641
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:09,970
When we fought,

642
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,350
I stabbed her shoulder with my sword.

643
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,550
The wound must be still on her shoulder.

644
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:16,290
We go to investigate now?

645
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:16,970
No.

646
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,010
There are many people in Gorgeous Chamber at night.

647
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,600
It’s not easy to take action.

648
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,220
Also.

649
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,350
You are

650
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:23,680
not convenient

651
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,640
to go to such a place.

652
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,140
But we need a way.

653
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:30,100
Your highness, why are you so hurried?

654
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,970
He’s suspecting me.

655
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,760
Only when I am proved to be innocent,

656
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,930
will he believe me.

657
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,050
Does it matter

658
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,350
that he doesn’t believe you?

659
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,890
I am his wife.

660
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:41,930
-You...
-Stop.

661

Xifeng.

662
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,720
Go to check

663
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,680
which officials

664
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,720
go there.

665
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,140
Yes.

666
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:12,930
Madam Zhao.

667
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,170
Your highness, good morning.

668
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,850
Where is the prince?

669
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,260
He went to

670
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:20,010
pick Mr. Tang Li up.

671
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,680
He picks Tang Li up?

672
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,260
Who is Tang Li?

673
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:40,060
[Prince Qin's Mansion]

674
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,180
Good.

675
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,060
You’ve made progress.

676
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,470
Of course.

677
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,550
I practice

678
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,640
every day.

679
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,850
I’ll test your knowledge later.

680
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,350
No.

681
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,140
I just arrived.

682
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,050
Go to hell, Tang Li.

683
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,340
[Tang Li]

685
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,100
[Tang Li]

686
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:01,600
Well,

687
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,430
you’ve been beating it for long.

688
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,600
Aren’t you tired?

689
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,390
No.

690
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,850
Look at the wood.

691
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,179
It’s almost like a person under your beats.

692
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:12,139
Even the wood is like person.

693
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,929
The wood can see something.

694
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,389
Tang Li is blind.

695
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,010
Yes.

696
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,389
He is blind.

697
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:20,350
Don’t worry.

698
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:22,530
I asked my men to find him everywhere.

699
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,260
He will come back.

700
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:26,179
Ask him to say it clearly

701
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:27,300
in front of you.

702
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:29,090
Calm down.

703
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:33,850
I don’t need his explanation.

704
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:34,800
I know.

705
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,719
I always bullied him,

706
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,179
which made him ashamed.

707
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,090
You know the reason.

708
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:49,800
But why did you bully him?

709
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,600
I...

710
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,550
I’m

711
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:55,100
used to it.

712
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:56,840
I thought he’s also used to it.

713
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:57,930
But he

714
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:58,760
became bold now.

715
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,490
How dare he escape the wedding?

716
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,060
[Tang Li]

717
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:09,050
Sweet heart.

718
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,140
It’s useless

719
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,720
that you are angry here.

720
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,550
Why don’t you think of an idea?

721
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,800
Change your way.

722
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,300
He may come back.

723
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,220
Change my way?

724
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:21,930
Ningjing.

725
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,090
Tang Li really escaped.

726
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,110
We can’t find him

727
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,180
in the whole

728
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,760
Yunkong Academy.

729
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,300
Where can

730
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,680
this silly guy go?

731
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,300
If he’s not in the academy,

732
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,220
he’s more likely to

733
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,010
go to Lord Qin’s mansion.

734
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,970
Lord Qin’s mansion?

735
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:46,470
He must go to find Lord Qin.

736
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,550
Maybe.

737
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:48,680
Father,

738
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:49,930
you are right.

739
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,470
I must

740
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,660
change my soft way.

741
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,550
I’ll go to seize him.

742
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:57,470
Ningjing.

743
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,720
Your highness, your highness, your highness.

744
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,800
What’s the matter?

745
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,180
His majesty is sick.

746
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,140
The dowager and the concubines

747
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,600
went to the Hall of Virtue.

748
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,600
The dowager even went there?

749
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,850
Seems that he’s severely sick.

750
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:09,970
Madam, let’s go.

751
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:10,850
Yes.

752
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,320
Concubine Xiao.

753
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,090
How’s this king now?

754
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,840
The physician is diagnosing.

755
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,460
Your highness.

756
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:34,390
Don’t worry.

757
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,890
The king

758
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,100
will be fine.

759
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:44,680
Tell me,

760
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,240
how’s the king now?

761
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,140
Your highness,

762
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,140
the king...

763
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,680
What’s the disease he gets?

764
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:59,430
It’s smallpox.

765
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,180
Your highness, don’t worry.

766
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:09,970
Mr. Han

767
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:11,350
will cure his majesty.

768
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:14,790
Your highness.

769
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,570
I’m not capable.

770
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,050
I’ll try my best.

771
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,260
But I’m not sure of the result.

772
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,100
Jerk.

773
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,510
You are the chief imperial physician.

774
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,800
I pay you every month

775
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:27,260
not to hear

776
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:28,970
your unsure words.

777
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,870
If the king can’t be well,

778
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,800
your whole family can’t live.

779
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,160
Your highness, please calm down.

780
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,180
I must

781
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,930
do my best to treat the king.

782
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,850
But this disease is very dangerous.

783
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:45,010
I have to tell you

784
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,740
the worse result in advance.

785
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,720
This is related to

786
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,550
the fate of our state after all.

787
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,550
How sure are you?

788
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:54,710
Your highness,

789
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,220
this disease is strongly infectious.

790
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,620
The most important thing

791
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,100
is that you and concubines

792
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,390
leave here.

793
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:05,430
I can’t rest assured

794
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,280
if only eunuchs serve the king.

795
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:19,050
Who want to stay here

796
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,140
to serve the king?

797
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:27,930
What?

798
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,430
Are you dumb?

799
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,580
Your highness,

800
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,100
I want to stay

801
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,260
to serve the king.

802
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,570
Concubine Qing.

803
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,680
Do you really

804
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,680
want to stay?

805
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,680
Yes.

806
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,350
Good girl.

807
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,430
Thanks.

808
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,880
After the king wakes up,

809
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:59,140
I will award you handsomely.

810
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,930
I don’t need awards.

811
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,760
I only hope the king is healthy.

812
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,470
The king is my whole world.

813
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:07,800
How can I live

814
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:10,350
without my world?

815
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,350
You used all means

816
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,470
to get close to the king.

817
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:21,600
How come you

818
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,760
don’t have a word today?

819
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,800
Concubine Xiao,

820
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,760
the king gave you

821
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,510
many favors.

822
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:36,390
You really let me down.

823
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:42,090
Don’t tell anyone

824
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,840
about his majesty’s disease.

825
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:45,450
Your whole family can’t live

826
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,140
if you say a word out.

827
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,220
Yes.

828
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,390
Listen.

829
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,800
Before you enter the palace,

830
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,510
you must

831
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,970
wash your hands and face

832
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:31,020
with the special medicine powder.

833
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:33,010
After you’re back,

834
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,220
wash your clothes

835
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,100
with this

836
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,350
kind of powder.

837
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,430
You must be careful about it.

838
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,300
Once the epidemic is spread,

839
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,550
the result is disastrous.

840
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,470
You may go in.

841
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:53,050
Yes, Mr. Han.

842
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,250
Your Highness.

843
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:07,870
Your highness.

844
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:08,970
Physician Han

845
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:10,850
told us some measures to prevent this disease.

846
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:13,260
He said it’s infectious.

847
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,140
Please be careful.

848
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,220
Madam.

849
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:18,790
Don’t you think

850
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:20,140
it’s weird?

851
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,090
There are rash

852
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:23,720
on the king’s body.

853
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:25,140
But why was there no omen

854
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,550
several days ago?

855
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,350
The dowager is angry.

856
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,800
But I didn’t see she’s sad.

857
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,550
Her son, the king,

858
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,720
is dying.

859
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,220
The prince is not capable,

860
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:40,970
and Lord Qin is watching the throne.

861
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:43,210
Though she’s calm seemingly,

862
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,220
she must be anxious now.

863
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,220
Also,

864
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:48,350
no one else

865
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:50,300
beside the king is infected.

866
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:53,390
Only he has this disease.

867
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,890
How strange it is.
