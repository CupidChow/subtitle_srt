2
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,020
Episode 9

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,100
We were so hard at that time.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,720
We can’t make any mistake

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,430
if we are not assured of our victory.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,720
Your Highness.

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,350
Crown Prince, would you mind telling me

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,680
what you are doing here?

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,930
My father heard the King of Xiqiu demised.

10
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,260
He was very sorry for it.

11
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:28,680
So he designed me

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,200
to extend the greetings on behalf of Beili.

13
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,759
Thank His Majesty.

14
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:34,710
Your Highness.

15
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,140
Xiqiu and Beili have made an alliance

16
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,430
for years.

17
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,260
The King of Xiqiu

18
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,550
passed away,

19
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,300
but the alignment

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,890
won't stop.

21
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,600
Xiqiu now has many internal and external problems.

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,470
I’m afraid

23
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,110
we have no strength to fight again.

24
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,680
Will you give up

25
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,910
avenging your father’s death?

26
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,920
It’s because Xiqiu is weak.

27
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,820
We can’t blame others for it.

28
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,640
As long as you like,

29
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,300
one person

30
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,050
may be stronger than a powerful troop.

31
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,440
What do you mean?

32
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,460
Your Highness, you are a famous talent.

33
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,510
Many people admire you very much.

34
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,970
I believe Tianhui will have a crush

35
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,510
on you

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,470
as long as you like.

37
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,900
Your Highness, please speak it frankly.

38
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,800
If you can marry into Tianning,

39
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,430
we may collaborate.

40
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,350
I’m sure we can defeat Tianning,

41
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,390
let alone

42
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,350
your revenge.

43
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,509
I know you care about me and don’t want me

44
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:52,600
to suffer a hardship in Tianning.

45
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,110
But I’m willing to do it

46
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,640
for Xiqiu

47
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,970
and my father.

48
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,550
I won’t hesitate

49
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,229
even I have to pay the price of life.

50
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,760
Your Highness. It’s really hard for you.

51
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,060
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

52
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,470
Tang Li.

53
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,890
Tang Li! Tang Li!

54
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,220
Tang Li!

55
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,180
Tang Li!

56
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,540
Go back with me.

57
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,850
Ningjing, I’ve told you many times.

58
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:34,890
I don’t like you.

59
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,470
You are the miss of Yunkong Academy.

60
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,220
So you can pick anybody

61
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:37,970
to be your husband.

62
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,170
It all depends on you.

63
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,050
You are the only one

64
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,090
I like and want to pick.

65
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:42,600
You don’t need to worry.

66
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,140
From now on,

67
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,270
I will be a good wife.

68
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,680
It’s impossible!

69
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,680
Why not?

70
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,140
Love is between the two.

71
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,050
It can only work

72
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,140
when we have emotional foundation

73
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,010
at least.

74
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,850
We do have emotional foundation.

75
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:58,890
We’ve grown up together,

76
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,930
and done all the other things together,

77
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:00,850
such as eating, taking a bath,

78
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,850
sleeping, practicing and reading.

79
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,930
Good. My dear sister.

80
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,150
Are these the emotional foundation?

81
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,120
You only take me as your sister?

82
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,850
That’s it.

83
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,030
You finally got it.

84
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:13,970
My good sister.

85
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:14,390
Now

86
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,800
I have something important to do.

87
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,510
So

88
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,680
you’d better go home quickly.

89
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,550
If Master comes

90
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,300
for you,

91
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,870
that'll be a big trouble.

92
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,640
Tang Li!

93
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,800
Would you just calm down?

94
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,650
You are a lady.

95
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,350
How can you always

96
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,180
be so unmannerly?

97
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:30,890
I’d love to.

98
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,600
Listen.

99
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:34,800
Feiye

100
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,800
is now slandered by some scoundrels.

101
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,050
I have to stay here

102
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,220
in this critical moment

103
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,260
to help him.

104
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,970
Right?

105
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,760
If I am leaving now,

106
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,890
I will be unworthy

107
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,570
of our friendship for years.

108
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:47,930
If others know this,

109
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,350
it will affect my fame.

110
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,860
What you said is reasonable.

111
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,220
It seems to be true.

112
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,600
Right?

113
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,430
Look.

114
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,850
It’s because you

115
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,180
ruined Feiye’s plan,

116
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,850
and the bad person escaped.

117
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:01,700
His princess

118
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,260
was even injured because of you.

119
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,920
Since I’m your elder brother,

120
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:05,970
I will surely stay here

121
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,550
to solve the troubles you caused.

122
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,810
It makes sense, right?

123
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:09,800
So

124
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,680
just return by yourself.

125
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:14,730
I’ve decided.

126
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,970
To go back?

127
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,220
I decided

128
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,089
to stay together with you

129
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:19,890
to help Feiye.

130
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:20,890
We will return together

131
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,550
when the troubles are solved.

132
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:25,760
It’s

133
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,800
not what I want.

134
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,510
Oh, my god!

135
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,100
Come on.

136
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:35,680
Come.

137
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,800
His Highness really cares about the princess a lot.

138
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,430
Right?

139
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,350
Why don’t you enter?

140
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,220
Is Feiye in?

141
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,010
Feiye.

142
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,800
Feiye.

143
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,100
What?

144
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,030
They are doing this in the room.

145
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,260
You are really senseless.

146
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,390
Don’t you know they need space

147
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,260
to stay alone?

148
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,680
-Don’t disturb them.
-What?

149
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,480
Feiye doesn’t

150
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,410
like her at all.

151
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,600

Your Highness,

172
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,409
I’m serving you with cleaning up.

173
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,090
Madam Zhao,

174
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,100
I’d do it myself.

175
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,930
Your Highness, are you blaming me?

176
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,680
Why?

177
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,140
I discovered

178
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,640
your veil and the Poisoning Manual

179
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,330
and gave them to Prince Qin.

180
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,970
I guessed it was you.

181
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,260
It’s okay.

182
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,890
Since you figured it out,

183
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,600
I don’t need to worry anymore.

184
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,140
And His Highness

185
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,520
won't doubt me either.

186
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,550
Princess,

187
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,510
how are you today?

188
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,010
Better now?

189
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:21,930
Not too bad.

190
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,470
All thanks to Prince Qin.

191
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,300
He was here

192
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,300
taking care of you overnight.

193
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,140
If it’s not because he had to leave

194
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,550
for something important,

195
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,970
he will be the first one

196
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,140
you see

197
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,550
after you wake up.

198
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,890
He took care of me?

199
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,720
♫ Enjoy the moon at Meihai with you ♫

200
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,300
♫ Walk on the streets in Tianning with you ♫

201
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:49,600
♫ Make the final prescription ♫

202
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,220
♫ With my missing ♫

203
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,220
So that’s not a dream?

204
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,090
I’m leaving.

205
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,720
Sister.

206
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,350
Sister.

207
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,720
Are you alright?

208
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,050
No big deal.

209
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,390
I’ll be fine with some rest.

210
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,720
Then that’ll be okay.

211
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,680
Take a good rest

212
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,730
for your health.

213
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,910
Why are you keeping looking at me?

214
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,830
Uh. Nothing.

215
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:28,680
I

216
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,600
admire you very much.

217
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,550
I think you are

218
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,890
very amazing.

219
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:33,799
You even

220
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,860
married into Prince Qin’s Mansion

221
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:37,130
after being refused.

222
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,010
If I

223
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,260
could do the same as you

224
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,640
after Tang Li escaped our marriage,

225
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,350
I would be his wife now.

226
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:43,929
Tang Li ran away

227
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:45,050
from your wedding?

228
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:45,640
Yeah.

229
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,760
He ran away

230
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,140
at the beginning of our wedding.

231
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,260
I was very pleased

232
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,180
and waiting him for marrying me.

233
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,390
But after waiting for a long time,

234
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,220
I only got

235
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,930
the news he ran away.

236
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,510
He really went too far.

237
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,630
How could he escape marriage?

238
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,050
Seeing from this, he and Long Feiye

239
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,090
are really alike.

240
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:06,930
They are

241
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,850
a pair of bad guys.

242
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,100
What’s your plan?

243
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,510
I’m here

244
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,390
to take him back

245
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,050
to marry me.

246
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,260
If he refuses,

247
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,600
I will pester him till he agrees.

248
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:27,680
Hold on.

249
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,510
What is this?

250
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,470
It’s a kind of poison

251
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,100
much stronger than laxative.

252
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,500
It’s called “non-stop”.

253
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,850
It won’t be deadly.

254
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,430
But it will make people feel ill.

255
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,260
If Tang Li doesn’t listen to you,

256
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,050
you can use it

257
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,810
at the right moment.

258
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,110
Thank you, sister.

259
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,760
Would you stop calling me “sister”?

260
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,930
It sounds weird.

261
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,640
My name is Han Yunxi.

262
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,840
You may call me Yunxi.

263
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,220
Thank you, Yunxi.

264
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,300
Come out.

265
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,090
Feiye.

266
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,790
How did you know I was there?

267
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,220
It’s my house.

268
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,850
I surely know everything.

269
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,800
The bad girl Ningjing

270
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,850
has bullied me a lot.

271
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,110
Can’t you be good to me?

272
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,720
Since you dared to escape marriage,

273
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,510
you’d better have the courage

274
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,850
in the face of Ningjing.

275
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:47,800
I don’t have.

276
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,090
You know it.

277
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,300
Once I entered Yunkong Academy,

278
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,930
I’ve been always bullied by her.

279
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:54,510
Now,

280
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,500
I finally have the chance to leave

281
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,110
and she can’t bully me again.

282
00:10:59,140 --> 00:10:59,930
But the dean

283
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,450
arranged this marriage.

284
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:02,930
I’d rather die

285
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,010
than live out my days

286
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,340
with that violent girl.

287
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,550
Have you talked it over with the dean?

288
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,720
It’s useless.

289
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,350
He never listened to me.

290
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,140
But in my opinion,

291
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:17,970
you and Ningjing

292
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,640
are a well-matched couple.

293
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,430
No. No. No.

294
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,180
We are mismatched.

295
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,390
I only want to marry a girl

296
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,260
I love.

297
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,850
I don’t care

298
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:26,850
about the resources

299
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:27,890
or background at all.

300
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:28,800
After all, Tangmen

301
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,090
is well-developed now.

302
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:30,930
What’s more,

303
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:31,930
you can root

304
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,600
for me in the future.

305
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,680
I’m gonna

306
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,970
hide in other places.

307
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:57,680
Tang Li.

308
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,890
Where are you going?

309
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,010
Ningjing.

310
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,100
Let me make it clear now.

311
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,100
I won’t marry you.

312
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,630
Just drop the idea forever.

313
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:07,640
Fine.

314
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,260
You’d better listen to me carefully.

315
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,300
I will surely insist

316
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,100
to the last moment.

317
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,800
I will try every way to have you

318
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,930
fall in love with me.

319
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,330
Unreasonable.

320
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,090
Where are you going?

321
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:16,950
I’m coming too.

322
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:17,970
Gorgeous Chamber.

323
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:18,970
Will you come too?

324
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,720
Where?

325
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,350
Gorgeous Chamber!

326
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,390
Want me to marry you?

327
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,350
I’m not crazy.

328
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,340
[Palace of Benevolence and Longevity]

329
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,430
Your Royal Highness!

330
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:41,860
Concubine Qing.

331
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,780
You’ve lost a lot of weight recently.

332
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,120
Taking care of His Majesty is really hard. Right?

333
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,560
Thank you very much.

334
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,650
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

335
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,970
His Majesty is my husband.

336
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,640
It’s my pleasure to take care of him.

337
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,800
You are really a good princess.

338
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,390
Sensible.

339
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,550
Be clear about the duty as a wife.

340
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,300
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

341
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,100
I’m really flattered.

342
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,230
Noble Consort Xiao.

343
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,850
You and all the other concubines

344
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,100
should learn the rules

345
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,550
from Concubine Qing.

346
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,640
How dare you get cold feet

347
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,990
when His Majesty was critically ill?

348
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,550
Maybe I have to punish you!

349
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,420
Your Royal Highness, please calm down.

350
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,220
I didn’t mean to get cold feet.

351
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,390
I just…

352
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,090
What?

353
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,720
Your Royal Highness, please calm down.

354
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,050
It’s because I told her

355
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,640
that I had smallpox once

356
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:47,010
and I asked her for the opportunity

357
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,630
to take care of His Majesty.

358
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,090
I’m new here.

359
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,180
She sympathized with me for this,

360
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,890
so she gave me

361
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,010
this chance.

362
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,300
Is it true?

363
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,600
Noble Consort Xiao.

364
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,930
Yeah. Yeah.

365
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,260
I misunderstood you.

366
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,100
It seems

367
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,010
you are good sisters.

368
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,300
You can be an example to all.

369
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,220
Madam Li.

370
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,100
Pass my orders.

371
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,680
All concubines

372
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,140
should follow the example

373
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,850
of Noble Consort Xiao.

374
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,090
Yes!

375
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,260
Thank you. Your Royal Highness!

376
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,090
Okay.

377
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:31,890
Rise.

378
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:38,930
Concubine Qing.

379
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,850
You did a good job

380
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,850
in taking care of His Majesty.

381
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,260
I will meet your wishes.

382
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,200
Now His Majesty has recovered.

383
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,010
Decoctions are still needed.

384
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,010
But he usually can’t bear the bitterness.

385
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,680
We got some pastries from the Western Regions.

386
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,100
Take some

387
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:09,760
to His Majesty for me.

388
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,300
Yes. Your Royal Highness.

389
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,470
Well.

390
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,260
You may leave now.

391
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,760
Yes. Your Royal Highness.

392
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,680
It seems Concubine Qing

393
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,140
is really kind.

394
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,800
Or scheming.

395
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,100
What’s wrong, Your Royal Highness?

396
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,550
Noble Consort Xiao has been the favorite
for years.

397
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,050
She’s arrogant,

398
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,390
and jealous.

399
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,010
It’s impossible for her

400
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,940
to give Concubine Qing the chance.

401
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,890
Complaints wouldn’t be heard everywhere

402
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:53,090
if she’s really that virtuous.

403
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,050
His Majesty knows her temper.

404
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,390
I guess Concubine Qing is to gain advantages

405
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,600
by interceding for her

406
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,160
so that His Majesty

407
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,390
and Noble Consort Xiao can grow apart.

408
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,720
But why did you

409
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:11,050
issue the decree, Your Royal Highness?

410
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,930
His Majesty didn’t have smallpox this time.

411
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,930
But this matter helps me

412
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,100
realize the sincerity

413
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,090
of the concubines to my son.

414
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,770
Especially Noble Consort Xiao.

415
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,280
She really makes me disappointed.

416
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,510
In this case,

417
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,140
why couldn’t I help Concubine Qing?

418
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,490
Some changes are really needed

419
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,050
among the concubines.

420
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,140
Your Royal Highness,

421
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,950
you did everything for the sake of His Majesty.

422
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,550
A son is always the dearly loved person
of a mother.

423
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,850
If I don’t think of him,

424
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,850
who else will?

425
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:52,800
Oh, right!

426
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,220
I’ve been busy

427
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,350
with affairs related to His Majesty.

428
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,100
I even forgot Prince Qin.

429
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,640
Go to Prince Qin’s Mansion later

430
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,010
and check if Han Yunxi

431
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,220
has some information.

432
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,680
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

433
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,089
Concubine Qing, stop!

434
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,760
Dear sister, is there anything

435
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,849
I can do for you?

436
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:22,800
Stop thinking

437
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,550
I don’t know

438
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,849
what you are up to

439
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,430
because you helped me

440
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,599
just now.

441
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,260
You misunderstood me.

442
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,300
I just didn’t want you

443
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,470
to be blamed by Her Royal Highness.

444
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,100
Stop playing tricks.

445
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,430
You were doing that just for competing

446
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,260
for Her Royal Highness’s favor.

447
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,260
Don’t think

448
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,050
I don’t know

449
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,390
your charade.

450
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,720
Listen carefully,

451
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:44,930
I’m

452
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,090
Tianqing’s mother.

453
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,550
Her Royal Highness

454
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,010
won't really punish me.

455
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,760
You must misunderstand me.

456
00:17:58,850 --> 00:17:59,850
If you

457
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,600
really hate me that much,

458
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,180
I won’t

459
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,390
appear in front of you

460
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,600
from now on.

461
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:07,890
Her Royal Highness

462
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:08,970
asked me to take some pastries

463
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,350
to His Majesty.

464
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,050
I have to leave now

465
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,300
if there's nothing else.

466
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,140
You…

467
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,550
Let’s wait and see!

468
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,210
Your Highness.

469
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,680
All of you may leave now.

470
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,210
Your Highness.

471
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,620
Noble Consort Xiao is really domineering.

472
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,090
No matter how,

473
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,800
you are the princess.

474
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:46,930
How can she be so rude

475
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,930
just because she gave birth to a son?

476
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,350
Madam, don’t be angry.

477
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,760
As the old saying goes,

478
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,680
disadvantage is a blessing.

479
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:58,890
But she was…

480
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:00,970
Don’t worry.

481
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,650
The more domineering she is,

482
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,930
the better it is for me.

483
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,720
Her reaction to His Majesty’s smallpox

484
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,050
already made him bitterly disappointed.

485
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,720
Temporary vulnerability

486
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,140
can help me draw Tianhui’s attention.

487
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,470
Moreover,

488
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,560
we are not in the situation

489
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,350
as good as we thought.

490
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,600
After the smallpox event,

491
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,010
His Majesty

492
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,640
already has confidence in you, right?

493
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,100
It’s only temporary.

494
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,010
His Majesty is suspicious of everything.

495
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:33,850
I’m afraid

496
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,180
he won’t

497
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,960
let his guard down so quickly.

498
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:38,970
Today,

499
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,030
Her Royal Highness

500
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,290
only called Noble Consort Xiao and I in.

501
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,390
If it’s for claiming responsibility,

502
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,640
she should have

503
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,890
called all concubines

504
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,100
together.

505
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,610
Her action today

506
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,960
is actually setting others against me.

507
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,800
Why did Her Royal Highness do so?

508
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,300
She still feels worried about me.

509
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,890
Meanwhile, she’s unsatisfied
with Noble Consort Xiao.

510
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,930
After all, it was the moment of life and death.

511
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,760
She could see the feeling

512
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,550
of the concubines to Tianhui.

513
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,430
She didn’t mind

514
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,180
helping me for her son.

515
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,100
But she worried I may have evil intentions.

516
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,260
It’s really dangerous here.

517
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,180
It’s lucky you’ve been cautious.

518
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,010
It’s due to your guidance.

519
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,550
We still have time.

520
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,050
No panic.

521
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,100
Anyhow, Tianhui

522
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,090
is really a failure.

523
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,930
Nobody

524
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:49,050
is sincere to him.

525
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,550
Your Highness.

526
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,060
Madam Li from Her Royal Highness is here.

527
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,140
Oh!

528
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,430
Tell Madam Li

529
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,680
that I’ve caught a cold

530
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,100
and need a rest.

531
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,800
So I can’t go

532
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:13,720
to see her

533
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,150
so as to not infect the disease to her.

534
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,300
Yes.

535
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,090
You got a cold

536
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,940
before your recovery.

537
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,050
May I call a physician

538
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,390
for you?

539
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,960
Your Highness.

540
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:37,720
The…

541
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,010
I...

542
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,050
Why aren’t you willing to see Her Royal Highness?

543
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:48,350
I’m afraid I may make a mistake

544
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,300
because there are too many rules.

545
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,220
That’s it?

546
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,430
She is a person who doesn’t stop

547
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,830
until achieving her aim.

548
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,800
Be careful.

549
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:05,910
Your Highness!

550
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:09,870
Your Highness!

551
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,130
Thank you for taking care of me last night.

552
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,090
The…

553
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,230
What do you want to say?

554
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:25,010
I’d ask

555
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:28,220
who took off my clothes.

556
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,180
And the medicine…

557
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,380
Who do you think it is?

558
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,180
You are thinking too much.

559
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,640
I wouldn’t do it myself.

560
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,090
Feiye.

561
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,600
I’m dying.

562
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:58,810
What’s wrong?

563
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,140
I don’t know why

564
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,890
I’ve had diarrhea starting in the morning.

565
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,350
Not a stop.

566
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,050
I feel

567
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,720
I’m dying.

568
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,850
Did you eat

569
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:11,930
something dirty?

570
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,470
No.

571
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,050
Feiye and I had the same food.

572
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,220
Let me see.

573
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,220
I ate…

574
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,430
Ouch!

575
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:30,220
How are you feeling?

576
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,510
Better or not?

577
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,550
Much better.

578
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,050
It’s really helpful.

579
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:43,780
That’ll be fine.

580
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,890
Please continue.

581
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,230
I’m leaving now.

582
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,430
Han Yunxi.

583
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,280
Take a rest since you are ill.

584
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,600
Keep in peace.

585
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,090
Okay.

586
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,140
I’m leaving too.

587
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,150
Have you finished the books?

588
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,470
Not yet.

589
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:12,470
Go read the books.

590
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,100
I’m…

591
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,760
Fine. I’m going now.

592
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,580
[Palace of Benevolence and Longevity]

593
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,100
Your Royal Highness.

594
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,180
When I went to Prince Qin’s Mansion

595
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,310
to pass your decree,

596
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,470
Consort Yi

597
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,220
let me

598
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,510
wait outside.

599
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,850
Prince Qin is only a prince.

600
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,470
How could she be so arrogant?

601
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,430
It doesn’t matter

602
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,720
how arrogant she is.

603
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,010
She always has to

604
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,640
give a salute to me.

605
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,300
It makes sense, Your Royal Highness.

606
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,970
What does matter is Han Yunxi.

607
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,000
She is much more daring now.

608
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,470
I called her in,

609
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,680
but she refused with an excuse.

610
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,250
Your Royal Highness.

611
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,850
Han Yunxi hasn’t married

612
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,930
into Prince Qin’s Mansion for too long.

613
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,680
But she has become so bold.

614
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,390
I’m afraid

615
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,430
it’ll

616
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:06,050
be harder to control her.

617
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,390
It doesn’t work

618
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,990
even Prince Qin backs her up.

619
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,510
I will have a way.

620
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,850
You said

621
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,720
Han Yunxi has a good relation

622
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,230
with her aunt in the Han Family, right?

623
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,350
Go.

624
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:32,720
Call the new Chief Justice,

625
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,890
Sir Beigong, for me.

626
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:37,350
Yes. Your Royal Highness.

627
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:49,910
Anything special?

628
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,220
I’ve watched here

629
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,220
all the time.

630
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,600
Long Feiye never

631
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,430
get out.

632
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,430
If Yuze

633
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,050
is locked in other places,

634
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,220
Long Feiye

635
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,150
would certainly go for inquest.

636
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,800
It’s probably

637
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,100
that Yuze is not in Prince Qin’s Mansion.

638
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,510
What should I do next?

639
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,050
The plan is unchanged.

640
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,450
Continue watching them.

641
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,100
Don’t let go of any clue.

642
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,140
I will report it to Qishao.

643
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:12,720
Yes.

644
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,100
Sir,

645
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,520
we’ve tried every way,

646
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,100
but she said nothing.

647
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,050
Go on.

648
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:28,970
We have to get the answer.

649
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:29,510
Sir.

650
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,680
I’m afraid

651
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:31,720
she

652
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,010
can't live longer.

653
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,220
Why?

654
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,600
She hasn’t eaten anything

655
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,050
since she was locked here.

656
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,550
She said it’s not on anybody’s instigation.

657
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,600
She would like to take

658
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,510
responsibility for all that she did.

659
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,370
She even requested us to kill her.

660
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,760
She’s just a killer

661
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:46,550
even killed women

662
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,640
and children.

663
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,630
She is not an excellent woman.

664
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,140
She can’t die so easily.

665
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,260
Tell them,

666
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,390
if she continues

667
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,550
not eating anything,

668
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,600
let her take the water

669
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,680
in which rice has been cooked.

670
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,940
Make sure she is alive.

671
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,140
Qishao,

672
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,760
Long Feiye didn’t leave

673
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,260
Prince Qin’s Mansion in these days.

674
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,050
It seems

675
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,140
Yuze is in the Prince Qin’s Mansion.

676
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,050
No.

677
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,260
Yuze is impossible

678
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,920
to be in Prince Qin’s Mansion.

679
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,930
Long Feiye has remained within doors
in these days.

680
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:17,680
It should be because his princess’s injured.

681
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,390
Qishao.

682
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,510
Are you still thinking of

683
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,350
Princess Qin?

684
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,470
She must be on Prince Qin’s side.

685
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,550
You can’t be

686
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,140
captivated by her beauty.

687
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,100
At the critical moment,

688
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,960
saving Yuze is the urgent matter.

689
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:29,760
I know it.

690
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:33,220
I will set store by overall interests.

691
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,140
Baisu,

692
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,180
keep watching

693
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,100
the whereabouts of people in Prince Qin’s Mansion.

694
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,350
Once there is something happening,

695
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,720
report it to me immediately.

696
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,890
Yes. Qishao.

697
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,260
Yunxi.

698
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,220
Yunxi.

699
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:00,870
This is

700
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,300
Nanshanhong I just made

701
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,260
especially

702
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,800
for you, Your Highness.

703
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,030
Have a try.

704
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:17,970
It’s rich.

705
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,720
This is what I like.

706
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,470
That’s for sure.

707
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,200
This is the top Nanshanhong,

708
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,080
which is Feiye’s favorite.

709
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:26,800
I just stole it

710
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,050
from the room

711
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:28,890
of Feiye.

712
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,040
What’s the matter? Tell me.

713
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,390
The smell of Nanshanhong.

714
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,510
Feiye has been out.

715
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,680
Is he back already?

716
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,300
You’re really smart.

717
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,890
You are as considerate

718
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,050
and beautiful

719
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:54,970
as a fairy.

720
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,600
Stop flattering me!

721
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,600
Can you give me some “non-stop”?

722
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:02,640
Tang Li has had loose bowels all morning.

723
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,900
It’s still not enough?

724
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,680
He even said he would go to the brothel

725
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,850
in front of me.

726
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:08,260
How can I bear it?

727
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,260
Teaching him a lesson

728
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,300
is enough.

729
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,140
“Non-stop” isn’t fatal,

730
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,390
but it’s poison after all.

731
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:16,100
It’s lucky I detoxified him in time.

732
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,090
Otherwise,

733
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,190
the amount you used may kill him.

734
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,600
But this is the only way

735
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,760
to stop him going to the brothel.

736
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,610
You must remember,

737
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:26,640
the poison

738
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,430
can only be used

739
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,140
in the most critical moment.

740
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,260
Or you may injure him accidentally.

741
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,390
Oh.

742
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,300
No wonder I had diarrhea

743
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,100
for no reason.

744
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,580
It’s you playing tricks.

745
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,600
Han Yunxi,

746
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,550
it’s you stirred her up

747
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,180
to poison me,

748
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:39,760
isn’t it?

749
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:40,930
Malicious woman.

750
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,010
-Feiye has the misfortune
-I…

751
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:42,930
to marry you.

752
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:43,850
Tang Li.

753
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,930
Don’t go too far.

754
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,050
Me?

755
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,680
You collaborated in poisoning me.

756
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,810
It’s me going too far

757
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:50,800
or you?

758
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,050
Stop there!

759
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,640
Stop!

760
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:56,970
Tang Li!

761
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:03,900
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

762
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:03,470
Stop!

763
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,260
Who are you?

764
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,800
Sir. Sir.

765
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:06,550
Excuse me.

766
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,010
Please come on tell

767
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,510
your princess

768
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,470
that her aunt

769
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,460
has something important for her.

770
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,010
Your Princess.

771
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,680
-Aunt.
-Yunxi.

772
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,050
What brings you here?

773
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,930
My family’s pharmacy

774
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,090
was sued for murder.

775
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,140
A woman from the Chen’s

776
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,330
took her mother-in-law’s body

777
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,800
to Shuntian Prefecture.

778
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,720
She insisted that my family’s pharmacy

779
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:40,100
killed her mother-in-law.

780
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:41,850
Aunt.

781
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,100
Please calm down.

782
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,050
Carefully

783
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,340
answer my questions.

784
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,800
What disease

785
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,290
did the old lady have?

786
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,430
Is it related to the medicine?

787
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,640
Not a disease.

788
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,220
She just

789
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,100
had a cold.

790
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,600
Even I can make the right prescription

791
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,260
for her.

792
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,850
Let alone Physician Li.

793
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:02,140
He wouldn’t make a mistake.

794
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,470
The weird thing is

795
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,510
Physician Li

796
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,220
died at home

797
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,550
last night.

798
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,890
Early in this morning,

799
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:10,680
the case

800
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,000
was accepted by the Highest Judiciary.

801
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,930
This is why I’m here.

802
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:15,970
You are the princess.

803
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,550
Please help me

804
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,350
if anything happens.

805
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:21,760
Aunt, don’t worry.

806
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:22,890
It is probably not

807
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,180
as worse as we thought.

808
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,550
When will they hear the case?

809
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,470
Tomorrow.

810
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:28,390
Okay.

811
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,970
I will go to the Highest Judiciary tomorrow.

812
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:30,930
Really?

813
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:32,430
It’s okay.

814
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,430
Yunxi.

815
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,930
What should we do?

816
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:41,820
[The Highest Judiciary]

817
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,510
So,

818
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,180
the evidence is certain.

819
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:48,220
Physician Li made the prescription wrongly.

820
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:51,600
It poisoned Chen’s mother-in-law to death.

821
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,600
Physician Li has killed himself.

822
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,010
In this case, he won’t be punished.

823
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:00,100
Taihe Pharmacy will bear the responsibility

824
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,390
for using the wrong person

825
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,800
and weak supervision

826
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:07,090
by paying Chen 1,000 taels for compensation.

827
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,140
In order to put an end to it

828
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,240
and strengthen supervising

829
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,410
of all pharmacies,

830
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,180
we hereby

831
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,300
close down Taihe Pharmacy,

832
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,720
and permanently disqualify it

833
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:22,350
from practicing medicine in Tianning

834
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,850
as a warning to others.

835
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:24,890
My Lord,

836
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,860
Taihe Pharmacy was wronged.

837
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,600
Li practiced as a physician for many years.

838
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,100
He never missed it.

839
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:32,930
It’s impossible for him

840
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,550
to make such kind of mistake.

841
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,510
Please be judicious!

842
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,390
He was convicted

843
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,390
of manslaughter

844
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,680
instead of intentionally killing

845
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:45,640
exactly because he practiced

846
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,300
as a skilled physician for many years.

847
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,300
Now,

848
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,200
there is convincing evidence.

849
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,720
Or do you mean

850
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,850
he was framed?

851
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,090
No.

852
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,390
It’s impossible.

853
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:00,470
Li died in suspicious circumstances.

854
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,510
He killed himself.

855
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,180
In my view,

856
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,300
he killed himself to escape punishment,

857
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,090
or to apologize

858
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,100
because he felt guilty.

859
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,180
No.

860
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,390
It’s impossible.

861
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:16,220
There must be some misunderstanding.

862
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,480
No matter if it is a misunderstanding,

863
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,550
my mother-in-law died

864
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,140
after taking the medicine you offered.

865
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,600
So you have to compensate.

866
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:25,180
My husband has been dead.

867
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,140
My son is still young.

868
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:30,710
It’s often my mother-in-law taking care of him.

869
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,720
But now,

870
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,600
my mother-in-law died.

871
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,350
What

872
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,890
should I do

873
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,140
for the rest of my days?

874
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:43,690
Well. Enough.

875
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,090
The case is settled.

876
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,290
The court adjourned.

877
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:49,930
Hold on.

878
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,760
Your Honor,

879
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:53,550
there’re still many questionable points.

880
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,090
How can the case be settled hastily?

881
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:56,220
Who are you?

882
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,930
How dare you disturb the court?

883
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:58,550
Come on!

884
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,760
Throw her out!

885
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:02,390
I’m Princess Qin.

886
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,430
You may try if anyone dares touch me!

887
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:05,890
Your Honor,

888
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:06,760
Her Royal Highness

889
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,620
ordered you to settle it quickly.

890
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,679
What should I do now?

891
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:13,550
I

892
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,800
didn't see Princess Qin before,

893
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,510
but I believe

894
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:20,219
the real Princess Qin

895
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,350
would never be

896
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:23,010
in contempt of court.

897
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,719
What an unruly people!

898
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,219
How dare you pretend to be Princess Qin?

899
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:28,760
Come on!

900
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,090
Take her out!

901
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:32,760
-Your Honor!
-Let me go!

902
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,179
Yunxi.

903
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,639
What should we do?

904
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:41,600
Aunt.

905
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,489
Don’t worry.

906
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,530
I’ll find a way to reverse the case.

907
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,219
Aunt, make yourself easy.

908
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,219
The case has been settled,

909
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,969
but we can reverse it.

910
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:52,889
Reverse?

911
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:54,679
What can we do?

912
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:56,550
There’re still many questionable points.

913
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,350
The Chief Justice

914
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,640
didn't investigate it carefully,

915
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,850
but settled it in a hurry.

916
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,600
When I showed my identity of princess,

917
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,640
he asserted groundlessly that it was a scam.

918
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,300
That means

919
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,890
someone is backing him up.

920
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,010
Aunt,

921
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,500
you may rest assured.

922
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,350
I will persuade Prince Qin to come tomorrow.

923
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,720
We’ll see if a prince

924
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:13,260
can have the Chief Justice

925
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,680
settle the case modestly.

926
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,550
Prince Qin?

927
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:17,260
Will he come?

928
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,640
We can have a try.

929
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,780
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

930
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,660
Your Highness,

931
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,010
our physicians have started

932
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:30,850
studying the Poisoning Manual

933
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,180
you gave me last time.

934
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,510
But

935
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,760
the handwriting

936
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,010
is too scratchy.

937
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,100
Also the poisonous weeds and prescriptions

938
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,510
are hard to identify.

939
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,350
Mingxiang

940
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,850
has made no progress

941
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,580
in studying the Gu-infected man.

942
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,010
How about Crown Prince and his uncle?

943
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:51,680
They are

944
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,310
not taking any action now.

945
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,140
I guess

946
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,770
they are too cautious.

947
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:56,850
So they only dare

948
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:57,930
to stay quietly.

949
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,850
Now Yuze is in our hands.

950
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,140
They are not a concern.

951
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,430
Did she

952
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:09,150
speak out who her accomplice is?

953
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,600
She accused insistently

954
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,140
that she did it

955
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,180
all by herself.

956
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,760
She would say no more.

957
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:18,600
Check out

958
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,820
what the matter is.

959
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,430
Yes.

960
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:27,640
Xifeng.

961
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,010
Your Highness.

962
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,590
Prince is inside there.

963
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,430
No.

964
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,130
I’m not for him, but for you.

965
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,180
Uh.

966
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,010
Xifeng,

967
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,140
will you help or not

968
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,430
if your princess has met some trouble?

969
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,680
Are you kidding?

970
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,640
If you are really into a trouble,

971
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,640
Prince will help you

972
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,350
undoubtedly.

973
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,720
Prince is more skillful than me

974
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,090
in martial arts.

975
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,010
No big deal.

976
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:55,550
It’s unnecessary for Prince

977
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,760
to deal with it.

978
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,090
Just let me know

979
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,140
if you will help.

980
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,050
Should I help or not?

981
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,180
Xifeng.

982
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,180
I’m Princess Qin.

983
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,680
I heard

984
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,890
that I have the responsibility

985
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:12,350
for determining the marriage

986
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,640
of guards like you,

987
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:14,970
the servants

988
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,850
or maids.

989
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,010
Anyway,

990
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,430
it's just a casual talk.

991
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:20,930
If I meet a girl

992
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:23,090
may not be a well-match for you,

993
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,220
but I bring you together

994
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,850
wrongly,

995
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,680
-it…
-Your Highness.

996
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,820
I’m willing to risk any danger.

997
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:31,970
It’s not that serious.

998
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:32,600
I mean it.

999
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,050
Just a piece of cake.

1000
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,390
There was an

1001
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,720
unimpressive guy

1002
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:38,640
who insisted

1003
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,970
I am not the real Princess Qin.

1004
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:41,180
So I went mad.

1005
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:41,890
It’s okay

1006
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:43,800
to say I don’t like a princess.

1007
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,430
But it really

1008
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,660
shamed Prince Qin.

1009
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,300
Looking down upon me

1010
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,350
is actually turning his nose

1011
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,680
up at Prince Qin, right?

1012
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:52,890
You are absolutely right.

1013
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,390
Who is the guy

1014
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,730
as blind as a bat?

1015
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,760
How dare he look down on Prince

1016
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:58,850
and Princess Qin?

1017
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,720
I will kill him.

1018
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:02,680
Good!

1019
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,470
You are really helpful.

1020
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:18,720
Qishao.

1021
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,220
How is your wound?

1022
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:23,990
I feel much better.

1023
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,680
It’s no big deal.

1024
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:28,680
Baisu.

1025
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,660
Have you heard from Yuze?

1026
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:31,640
It seems

1027
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,400
she vanished into oblivion.

1028
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,970
I’ve heard nothing of her.

1029
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,550
However, something strange

1030
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,100
happened in Prince Qin’s Mansion.

1031
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:38,800
I’m wondering

1032
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,140
if it is related to Yuze.

1033
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,050
What’s it?

1034
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,680
I saw someone

1035
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:45,300
from Princess Qin’s parental family

1036
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,900
going to the mansion for her.

1037
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,270
Later, Princess Qin

1038
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:50,010
and her people went to the Highest Judiciary.

1039
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:51,850
It seems someone from her parental family

1040
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:53,450
was sued for some tough case.

1041
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:55,530
Yunxi went to the Highest Judiciary?

1042
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,040
What would be the matter?

1043
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,800
Didn’t Long Feiye

1044
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,430
take any actions?

1045
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:04,640
Where has he gone in these days?

1046
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,100
Did he contact any people?

1047
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,260
Prince Qin has been in the house all the time.

1048
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,390
Nobody has been to the mansion either.

1049
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,100
Qishao,

1050
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,430
Princess Qin often went out recently.

1051
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,300
Maybe we can catch her

1052
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:16,970
and then

1053
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,300
we can use her as a chip

1054
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,010
to negotiate with Prince Qin.

1055
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,140
No.

1056
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,510
Why?

1057
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,850
Long Feiye is full of cunning tricks.

1058
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:26,260
He may use Yunxi

1059
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,350
to set us up.

1060
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,100
We can’t run the risk.

1061
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:36,100
[The Highest Judiciary]

1062
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,050
Who is so daring?

1063
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,140
Why are you beating

1064
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,640
the drum for grievances voicing?

1065
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,680
It’s you again.

1066
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:50,510
Your Honor.

1067
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,680
The case of Taihe Pharmacy

1068
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,510
still has a grievance.

1069
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,840
Please investigate it.

1070
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,220
The case is settled.

1071
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:55,890
Guards!

1072
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:56,350
Yes!

1073
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,180
Take them out!

1074
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,050
-Wait!
-Yes!

1075
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,220
What a tone! Sir Beigong!

1076
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:10,600
How dare you be so rude to my princess?

1077
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:15,510
Prince Qin.

1078
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,470
Sorry for not knowing you would come.

1079
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:18,510
I apologize.

1080
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:21,260
Please excuse me! Your Highness!

1081
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,260
Why are you here?

1082
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,050
I have to come

1083
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,780
since you are here.

1084
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:30,220
Your Highness,

1085
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,510
I’m sorry

1086
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,600
for not recognizing Her Highness.

1087
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,970
Prince and Princess Qin,

1088
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,390
please pardon my offence.

1089
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:39,850
I’m not caring

1090
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,010
about your offence.

1091
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,810
Go on with the trial.

1092
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,260
Go on?

1093
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,210
Since princess beat the drum,

1094
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:50,720
it means Taihe Pharmacy was wronged.

1095
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:51,720
Don’t you

1096
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:53,600
want to hear the case?

1097
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,800
I don’t dare.

1098
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:57,370
It’s a case involving human life.

1099
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,550
You don’t need to care about my feelings.

1100
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,350
Just conduct in an orthodox way.

1101
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:02,200
Rise.

1102
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,440
Thank you, Your Highness.
