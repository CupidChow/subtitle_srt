00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,020
Episode 38

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,300
Wait!

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,900
There’s probably something wrong with the water.

5
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,100
It’s really poisoned.

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:25,890
I was right.

7
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,100
Over half

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:27,850
of villagers here

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:28,890
have been infected with poisonous plague.

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:29,550
I think the source

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,150
must be related to the water.

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,550
I will take some back and check it.

13
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:34,220
Maybe

14
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,480
the water can help us

15
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,430
develop the antidote

16
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,810
that can effectively remove the plague.

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,050
Why are you trying to kill us?

18
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,260
You are behind this!

19
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,390
Plague wouldn’t break out

20
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,010
in our village if it weren’t you.

21
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:55,930
What was the matter?

22
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:56,890
Make it clear.

23
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,040
You may keep pretending.

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,330
Pretending?

25
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:01,680
Look at me!

26
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,090
And look at him.

27
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,140
We are so handsome.

28
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,300
How could a good-looking man

29
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,680
do such kind of dirty things?

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,510
One month ago,

31
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,760
a man in black like you

32
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,890
came to the village stealthily.

33
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,390
He also went to this well

34
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,740
and dropped something in it.

35
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:19,510
Now,

36
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,430
you did the same thing.

37
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,490
How dare you say you are not together?

38
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,090
I will kill you.

39
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,480
That’s wrong.

40
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,470
From my point of view,

41
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,350
you are working together with that person.

42
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,140
Bosh!

43
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,720
I was almost killed

44
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,800
by that man.

45
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,220
How could I possibly

46
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,470
work with him?

47
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,890
If you were not with him,

48
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:36,600
why do you know this

49
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,640
so clearly?

50
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,640
I saw that with my own eyes.

51
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,800
On that day, I went hunting

52
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,259
and came back at midnight.

53
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,850
When I just walked to the village entrance,

54
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,090
I found a dark shadow.

55
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,420
[Haidong Village]

56
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,490
I was badly injured

57
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,050
and took one month to recover

58
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,180
before I climbed up.

59
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,610
But when I returned to the village,

60
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,530
I found some of the villagers

61
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,930
were dead

62
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,010
and some were ill.

63
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,060
It must be the one in black.

64
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,600
After he put something

65
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
into the well,

66
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,320
the plague

67
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,800
broke out in the village.

68
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:32,890
I didn’t expect

69
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,140
you are so clever.

70
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,100
It must be you.

71
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,640
I will kill you.

72
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,350
He isn’t completely recovered.

73
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,260
Be gentle.

74
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:45,870
Don’t worry.

75
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,680
He just fainted

76
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,230
How to deal with him?

77
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,630
Take him back of course.

78
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:15,930
Yunxi.

79
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:17,510
Yunxi.

80
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,350
Yunxi.

81
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,410
How do you feel now?

82
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,210
What’s wrong with me?

83
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,050
You were infected with poisonous plague.

84
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,680
Poisonous plague?

85
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:32,970
Sorry.

86
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,260
I put you to trouble.

87
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,390
You fool.

88
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,980
It’s impossible for us

89
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,180
to control the plague

90
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,800
successfully without you.

91
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,600
All you have to do

92
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,270
is having a good rest

93
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,610
and recuperating.

94
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,930
But I’m afraid it will kill

95
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,100
more innocent people

96
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,600
if it lasts too long.

97
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,680
You still have me!

98
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,470
Yunxi.

99
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:04,550
Feiye,

100
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,150
I don’t want to see him.

101
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,390
Gu Qishao,

102
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,400
did you hear her?

103
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,000
She doesn’t want to see you.

104
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,890
I can’t comply with your wishes.

105
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,430
How dares a spy

106
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,760
come without being invited?

107
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,260
Yunxi,

108
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:24,450
I never

109
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,680
hide my identity.

110
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,680
But I have my own difficulties.

111
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:29,750
Difficulties?

112
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,390
You can use

113
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,140
and cheat Yunxi

114
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,200
just because you have difficulties?

115
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:38,590
Long Feiye.

116
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,220
Think it over.

117
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,850
I’ve always known you were the infected.

118
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:43,470
Why do you think

119
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,870
should I keep the secret?

120
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,010
When Poison Master researched the antidote

121
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,010
in Yaogui Valley,

122
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,800
why do you think didn’t I

123
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,090
report it to Beili

124
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,070
when I actually knew his identity?

125
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,430
It’s you

126
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,150
who always hurts Yunxi

127
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,510
and makes her sad.

128
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:57,970
You even didn’t

129
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,090
let her father go.

130
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:00,510
Shut up.

131
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,890
You are unqualified to blame me.

132
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:03,680
Enough.

133
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,470
I used to consider you

134
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,930
as my best friend.

135
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,120
I’ve trusted you so much.

136
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,800
But you cheated me

137
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,390
and used me.

138
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,120
You even have other intentions

139
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,990
by taking me and my father in.

140
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,970
It is more disappointing than hurting me.

141
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:29,640
Leave here.

142
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,990
I don’t want to see you anymore.

143
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:35,850
-Yunxi.
-Qishao.

144
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,970
-Both His Highness and Miss are in a fit of anger.
-Lie down.

145
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,430
You may give her some time.

146
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,090
It’ll be better for all of you.

147
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,080
Your Highness.

148
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,680
We are now in extraordinary times.

149
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,210
Even Miss

150
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,140
has been infected with poisonous plague.

151
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:04,970
We should

152
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,260
find out the way for detoxifying

153
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,390
before everything.

154
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,430
You should be clear

155
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,010
that Gu Qishao is as skilled as Miss

156
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,260
in detoxifying.

157
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,510
Now he is our

158
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,390
only hope.

159
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,140
He’s from Beili,

160
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,470
but the poisonous plague in Tianning

161
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,730
also spreads to Beili.

162
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,720
He may try his best

163
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,180
for the sake of Beili

164
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,710
even it’s not for Tianning.

165
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:28,740
What’s more,

166
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:29,800
Poison Master

167
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,930
has passed away.

168
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,390
Gu Qishao is the only one

169
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,470
who can save Miss.

170
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,080
I don’t think he would hurt Yunxi.

171
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,240
But we have to watch out for him.

172
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,230
Pay more attention.

173
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:42,850
Rest assured.

174
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:43,930
I will watch him.

175
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,159
What’s more,

176
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,800
Your Highness, you need to see one person.

177
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:55,970
Some time ago,

178
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,760
when I was struck down to the cliff,

179
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,550
I tore this from the man

180
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,350
in black.

181
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,800
Don’t tell others

182
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,260
anything you said today.

183
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,680
Otherwise, your life will be in danger.

184
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,350
Yes.

185
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,100
Yunxi.

186
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,020
How could you fail to keep faith?

187
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,390
Do you remember the first requirement

188
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,350
I put forward?

189
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:34,409
You can’t put yourself in danger.

190
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,429
But now,

191
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,390
look at you.

192
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:42,429
Well.

193
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,780
I’m forgiving you this time.

194
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,320
But don’t forget

195
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,460
I also have another four requirements.

196
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,050
Yunxi.

197
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,140
Yunxi.

198
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,050
My feud with Beili

199
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,510
has completely ended.

200
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:13,850
I finally

201
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,680
took my mother away from the

202
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,420
sad place that imprisoned her many years.

203
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,250
Speaking of it,

204
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,310
I really should thank you,

205
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,250
for the sake of my mother.

206
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,300
You helped her find

207
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,090
the peace and freedom.

208
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,510
Don’t worry.

209
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,070
I will cure you no matter how.

210
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:11,800
Guys,

211
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,970
now we have the water from the source.

212
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,010
It will be much easier for us

213
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,410
to produce the antidote.

214
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,230
Please try hard!

215
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,300
Qishao.

216
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:05,390
Qishao.

217
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:06,720
Qishao.

218
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,470
Formula of the antidote has been developed.

219
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,010
Look.

220
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:10,760
Great!

221
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,640
The plague can be cleared soon

222
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,090
with the formula.

223
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,450
But we don’t have enough medicinal materials.

224
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,680
A large number of people are infected,

225
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,810
so we have a great demand of materials.

226
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,180
We have no problem for other materials.

227
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,300
Our people can go fast

228
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,850
to Imperial Hospital to carry them.

229
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,050
But among them, purple wormwood

230
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,430
lives in an environment full of poisonous miasma.

231
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,140
Moreover, it’s hard to be preserved.

232
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,070
Those scanty in Imperial Hospital

233
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,890
were used up

234
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:35,720
in the test.

235
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,220
Yaogui Valley

236
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,350
originally has purple wormwood.

237
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,140
But the fire

238
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,050
has burned it to ashes.

239
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,560
According to the formula,

240
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:46,860
purple wormwood

241
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:47,800
is one

242
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,490
of the most important herbs.

243
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,470
Do you know

244
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,620
any other places we can find it?

245
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,280
Usually, it’s Physician Han

246
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,430
who was in charge of collecting that

247
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,760
for Imperial Hospital.

248
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,530
Only he knows

249
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,930
the specific position.

250
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,850
Anyway, I heard it from him

251
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,090
that purple wormwood

252
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,150
could be gathered only on snowy days.

253
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,600
Otherwise, it may put your life in danger.

254
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,430
Rest assured.

255
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:09,640
I’ve grown up

256
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,300
in poisonous miasma environment.

257
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,550
This is no big deal.

258
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,680
I can go to Physician Han’s and return

259
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,080
within three or four days

260
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,640
at top speed.

261
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,510
Thank you for your help.

262
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,090
But

263
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,320
it’s far from the winter now.

264
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,050
Even if you can find Physician Han,

265
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,220
he may not tell you the place

266
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,640
since it’s so dangerous.

267
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,490
In my point of view,

268
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,140
we may let the patients

269
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,090
take the present antidote temporarily.

270
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,970
Maybe I don’t need to care too much about others.

271
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,100
But it cannot happen

272
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,510
to Yunxi.

273
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,210
Don’t worry, Qishao.

274
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,790
I will take good care of her.

275
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:49,850

00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:52,740

good friend.

307
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,430
I’ve taken two days and nights

308
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,760
to come here from the Southern Regions.

309
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,360
It’s really hard to find you.

310
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,600
You came for me?

311
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,760
Anything happened to Yunxi?

00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,720
Or Prince Qin?

313

No.

314
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,800
A plague broke out in the Southern Regions.

315
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,090
Among all the herbs we have,

316
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,140
we are lack

317
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,510
of purple wormwood.

318
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,470
So I came here

319
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,390
to ask for

320
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,730
the whereabouts of it.

Oh. I see.

322
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:00,680
The places where purple wormwood

323
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,550
grows are extremely dangerous.

in this season

326
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,400
is nothing else but taking your own life.

327
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,260
No matter how,

328
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,260
I will find it out.

329

Boy!

330
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,680
I don’t think you need to try

331
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,720
at a venture.

332
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,090
It’s unnecessary.

333
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,040
Physician Han.

334
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:20,930
Han Yunxi…

335
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,080
What’s wrong with Yunxi?

00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,140
Do you mean Yunxi also…

337
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,820
She’s infected with plague.

338
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:29,350
If we

339
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,000
can’t get purple wormwood,

340
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,270
she won’t live longer.

341
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,820

00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,010
Prepare some food

354
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,390
so that we can have on the way.

355
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,510
But.

356
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,350
My Lord,

357
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,140
you said

358
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,090
purple wormwood

359
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,430
can only be gathered on snowy days.

360
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,850
Can you get it now?

361
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,760
No matter how,

362
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,930
we have to go there for it.

363
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:21,550
Yes.

364
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,470
After arriving there,

365
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,760
we will find the way.

366
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,350
Mr. Gu.

367
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,100
Please take good care

368
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,300
of My Lord.

369
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,390
He’s getting old now.

370
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,090
And he’s also the main support of our family.

371
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,220
Please don’t worry.

372
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:40,510
Father.

373
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:41,910
The herbs you need.

374
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,430
Mr. Gu, let’s go!

375
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,430
Father, I will go with you.

376
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:50,800
No.

377
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,100
My Lord.

378
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,350
Let Yunyi go with you.

379
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,930
He’s grown up now.

380
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,010
It’s time for him to support the family.

381
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,350
Yunyi has been close

382
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,220
with Yunxi since childhood.

383
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,260
Allow him to help her.

384
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,050
Yunyi.

385
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,640
It’s really dangerous,

386
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,390
you know?

387
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,260
Father.

388
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,680
You’ve said it’s dangerous.

389
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,890
Then I should go.

390
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:13,890
One more person, one more cares.

391
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:15,640
My Lord.

392
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,720
Please allow Yunyi to go with you.

393
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,430
If anything

394
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,220
happens,

395
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,930
at least we have one person

396
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,710
come home for letting us know.

397
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,220
Father.

398
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:30,950
Take it easy.

399
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,030
You have me at home.

400
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,680
It’s lucky

401
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,510
for Yunxi

402
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,490
to have a family like you.

403
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:40,800
We owed

404
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,090
Yunxi a lot before.

405
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,550
What we can do now is just making up.

406
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,550
Hope we can help Yunxi.

407
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,100
Come on.

408
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,090
Put it here.

409
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,600
Physician Gu.

410
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,760
What’s going on?

411
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,100
The patients

412
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,470
taking antidote

413
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,670
with purple wormwood

414
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,690
can insist for over ten days.

415
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,800
Those in this room

416
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,990
is the last batch of people infected.

417
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,600
According to the present situation,

418
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,140
they can only insist for six days.

419
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,600
They probably can take purple wormwood back

420
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,800
within six days.

421
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,090
If they can’t return

422
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,150
within three days,

423
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,120
I’m afraid Miss will be in danger.

424
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:47,790
Your Highness,

425
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:48,950
if you keep

426
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,600
input energy into Miss’s body,

427
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,060
the poison in you will act.

428
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,050
Her life is more important than mine.

429
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,640
It’s lucky for Miss

430
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,090
to be your wife.

431
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,140
Father.

432
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,650
Are you alright?

433
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:23,720
Maybe we can find a place

434
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,510
-to take a break.
-I’m alright.

435
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,310
We can’t stop.

436
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,430
Yunxi is on the verge of death.

437
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,400
There is not a moment to lose.

438
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,280
We will arrive after climbing over the mountain.

439
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,050
Let’s go.

440
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,000
I will carry it.

441
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,350
We are here.

442
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:43,550
Look.

443
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,300
That’s the place

444
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,960
where purple wormwood grows.

445
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:47,960
It’s great!

446
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,490
You can’t go!

447
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:50,640
No hurry.

448
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,010
Danger!

449
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,470
The purple wormwood is just in front.

450
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,400
What do you fear?

451
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,080
How did you know

452
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,360
the poisonous miasma?

453
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,450
I’ve practiced medicine for over 20 years.

454
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,050
I’m not quite sure

455
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,010
about what the poisonous miasma is.

456
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,220
I only know

457
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,390
it will go into the soil

458
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:33,050
with the snow water

459
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,850
on snowy days.

460
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,550
At that time,

461
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,880
it’s less poisonous.

462
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,760
Then people can get in

463
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,250
to pick purple wormwood.

464
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,220
We have to find some way

465
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,350
to get in now.

466
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,220
Mr. Gu.

467
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:40,970
Mr. Gu.

468
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,350
Mr. Gu. Give me your hand.

469
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,090
Hand.

470
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,600
Hold it.

471
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:19,550
Come on.

472
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:00,510
Mr. Gu!

473
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,180
Mr. Gu.

474
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,120
I heard Prince Qin is ill.

475
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:06,720
Is he infected

476
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,250
with poisonous plague too?

477
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,610
General, don’t worry.

478
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:10,930
Prince Qin

479
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,180
is just weak

480
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,360
because of working too hard for days.

481
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,910
He’s taken the medicine.

482
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,530
That’s good!

483
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:18,550
Good!

484
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:27,940
Physician Gu,

485
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,620
will the purple wormwood

486
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,630
be carried back in time?

487
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,930
Don’t we have any other way?

488
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,450
If it can’t be taken back,

489
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,210
this can only be a misfortune.

490
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:52,680
Mr. Gu.

491
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,180
Mr. Gu.

492
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,520
You are awake.

493
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:05,970
Physician Han.

494
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,220
I’ve had acupuncture on you.

495
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,140
You’ll be fine.

496
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,350
Mr. Gu.

497
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,550
Did you meet

498
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,010
poisonous miasma before?

499
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,120
I’ve grown up

500
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,070
in poisonous miasma environment.

501
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,220
But I’ve never seen

502
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,480
such strong poisonous miasma before.

503
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,100
No wonder!

504
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,640
I was thinking

505
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:37,850
it’s really hard

506
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:38,800
to stay

507
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,750
in the poisonous miasma.

508
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,220
Take one pill

509
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,470
of this medicine per day.

510
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:55,300
After finishing the bottle of the medicine,

511
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,720
you will recover.

512
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:58,930
Thank you!

513
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,640
Not a problem.

514
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,050
In fact,

515
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,640
I should thank you.

516
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,180
You’ve taken a long way

517
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,100
to pick the purple wormwood

518
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,550
for the people in the Southern Regions.

519
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,300
I should thank you

520
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,430
for the sake of them.

521
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,010
In fact,

522
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,220
I’m risking my life

523
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:21,980
only for one person.

524
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,800
One person?

525
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:25,640
Who is it?

526
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,350
Han Yunxi.

527
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,160
Physician Han,

528
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,720
I like Han Yunxi very much.

529
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,760
If Han Yunxi

530
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,850
breaks off her engagement to Long Feiye,

531
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:43,430
would you like

532
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,230
to accept me as your son-in-law?

533
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,050
Yunxi won’t

534
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,800
break off her engagement to Prince Qin.

535
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,680
Well. Fine.

536
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,550
Mr. Gu.

537
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,970
Yunxi and Prince Qin love each other

538
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:53,890
very much.

539
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,090
They won’t break up.

540
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:58,890
Mr. Gu,

541
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,470
if you are

542
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,000
in a hurry to get married,

543
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,610
my daughter Ruoxue

544
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,090
is still unmarried.

545
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,760
You may think about it.

546
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,220
Yeah.

547
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,010
In this case, you will be my second brother-in-law.

548
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:13,010
Yeah. Right.

549
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:16,680
Never mind.

550
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,480
Forget what I’ve said.

551
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,340
I have to take the herb

552
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,050
to save the people in the Southern Regions.

553
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,010
I’m leaving now.

554
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,220
Come. Be careful!

555
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,970
Mr. Gu, be careful.

556
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:30,680
Physician Han.

557
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,410
I’m leaving.

558
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,470
See you!

559
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,430
-Take care!
-Okay.

560
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,300
Be careful!

561
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:41,590
Go!

562
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,240
Go!

563
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:48,080
Go!

564
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:51,900
Go!

565
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:55,520
Go!

566
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:01,970
Yunxi.

567
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,350
Wait for me.

568
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:04,400
Go!

569
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,850
Uncle.

570
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:12,760
Uncle.

571
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,800
What’s wrong with you, uncle?

572
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,050
Uncle.

573
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,220
How’s Princess Qin?

574
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,240
If Gu Qishao still doesn’t come back,

575
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,500
I’m afraid Miss

576
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,010
can’t go through tonight.

577
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,720
Do you take the medicine back?

578
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,430
Yunxi.

579
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,390
I found it.

580
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:20,680
Miss.

581
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:22,470
Miss.

582
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:23,770
You are awake.

583
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,270
Physician Gu.

584
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,530
How long have I been in faint?

585
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,430
For six days.

586
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,680
If Prince Qin

587
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,930
didn’t input a large amount of energy

588
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,090
into your body,

589
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:38,180
I’m afraid you could not hold on until now.

590
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:43,800
Did they develop new antidote?

591
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,750
Gu Qishao found purple wormwood.

592
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,090
Now the people can be saved.

593
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,300
Gu Qishao.

594
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:53,970
I didn’t expect

595
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:55,470
I only know

596
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,800
a little bit about it.

597
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,850
I almost led it to a great trouble.

598
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,760
You were confused by the superficial phenomenon

599
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,600
of the poisonous plague

600
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,530
just because you were too anxious.

601
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,050
May I see the formula?

602
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:09,550
Miss.

603
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,070
You were just awake

604
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,690
and you need more rest.

605
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,680
I’ve assigned people

606
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,720
to record

607
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:18,310
the formula and detoxifying processes.

608
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,180
You will have it

609
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,380
after your recovery.

610
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,220
Take a good rest.

611
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,650
I’m leaving now.

612
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:39,950
Your Highness.

613
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,180
Princess is awake.

614
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,010
Don’t you go and see her?

615
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,480
Since the poison has been removed,

616
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,820
I’d better just let her rest.

617
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,510
Princess

618
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,680
is still weak.

619
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:56,590
She needs some more time to recuperate.

620
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:00,900
Physician Gu.

621
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,090
We have a lot of people

622
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,010
to save.

623
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:09,750
Your Highness.

624
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,400
Physician Gu.

625
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:46,470
Qishao.

626
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:48,050
Is Yunxi better?

627
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,220
She’s awake.

628
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,530
That’s good!

629
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,110
Since she’s awake,

630
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,540
there won’t be a problem.

631
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:56,680
She’s already known

632
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,640
you and Physician Han

633
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,760
found the purple wormwood

634
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,600
and saved them.

635
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,930
But she probably

636
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,380
doesn’t want to see you.

637
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,620
I didn’t expect

638
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:05,470
Yunxi

639
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,730
is still angry at me.

640
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:08,770
Then I won’t go

641
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,090
to see her for a while.

642
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:11,850
No matter how,

643
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,260
thanks to your help,

644
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,260
we can solve the plague successfully.

645
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,590
Don’t be so optimistic.

646
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,090
Now we just temporarily

647
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:18,820
control the poisonous plague.

648
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,170
If there is no change,

649
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,760
it may happen again within one year.

650
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,550
The weak people

651
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,170
will still die at that time.

652
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,390
Why?

653
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,090
Do we have a way to radically cure it?

654
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:32,890
There is a way.

655
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,050
We have to find Traceless Herb.

656
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,550
It’s very few in this world.

657
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,930
Anyway, I have to find it

658
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:39,850
to save Yunxi.

659
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,090
Traceless Herb?

660
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,350
If so,

661
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:45,930
the people who empoisoned

662
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,460
may have another purposes.

663
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,760
Since it’s people who empoisoned on purpose

664
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,890
and they are playing

665
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,930
with lives of so many innocent people,

666
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,590
it wouldn’t be a common trick.

667
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,500
I’m just afraid

668
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,090
it will have a bigger crisis

669
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,720
when the plague happens again.

670
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,450
In this case,

671
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,180
I’d like to go with you

672
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,140
to find the Traceless Herb.

673
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:02,640
No.

674
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,380
It’s really dangerous.

675
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,970
Also I don’t know

676
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,220
when I can come back.

677
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:08,760
Moreover,

678
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,220
we need reliable people

679
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,760
to take care of Yunxi.

680
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:13,770
Physician Gu.

681
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,090
Hope you can stay here

682
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,150
and protect Yunxi.

683
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:17,720
What’s more,

684
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,390
we have to keep it a secret.

685
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,260
Don’t cause panic

686
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,430
among the ordinary people.

687
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,350
This guy

688
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:23,430
isn’t like

689
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:24,890
a person who may hurt Miss.

690
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,970
It seems I still need

691
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,450
more time to check it out.

692
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,350
Okay.

693
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,050
Qishao.

694
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,100
Here you are.

695
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,010
Wait here.

696
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,680
You’ve been a family.

697
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,430
Why are you leaving him there?

698
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,760
No blather.

699
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:49,900
By the way,

700
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:50,720
the poisonous plague

701
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,350
has been completely under control.

702
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,050
But

703
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,200
we didn’t detoxify

704
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,220
Jun Yizheng.

705
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,390
I was afraid he might requite kindness with enmity.

706
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,260
In this case,

707
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,350
just let it go.

708
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,760
Now we have nothing to do

709
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,930
with Beili.

710
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,760
What’s your plan, Qishao?

711
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,219
What’s the plan of you two?

712
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,639
Don’t say that.

713
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:12,679
I’m your maid

714
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,760
in my lifetime.

715
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,010
I will be with you

716
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:16,340
no matter where you are.

717
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,100
Beili is no longer

718
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:19,550
a burden on us.

719
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:21,060
We both are free now.

720
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:22,100
You should do

721
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,159
the thing you like.

722
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:24,850
Moreover,

723
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,330
you have the one loving you.

724
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,670
You don’t need to follow me.

725
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:30,600
No.

726
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,469
I will be with you forever.

727
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:33,800
Zhuyu.

728
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:35,380
You’ve suffered a lot

729
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,389
while being with me

730
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:37,300
for a long time.

731
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:39,179
Now I hope

732
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,300
you can live

733
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:41,510
a normal life.

734
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:43,469
Hope you can

735
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,929
live a happy life.

736
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:49,760
Chu Xifeng.

737
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,010
Come here.

738
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:57,980
Zhuyu is a good girl.

739
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,520
Before today,

740
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,470
she has been forced

741
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,050
to do many things she didn’t want to.

742
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,140
Now she is free.

743
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,300
I trust you.

744
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,680
Be good to her from now on.

745
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,450
Qishao, please don’t worry.

746
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:11,960
I will take good care of her.

747
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,040
Go!

748
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,240
Go!

749
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,260
Prince, take a look!

750
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:38,720
Both Beili and Tianning

751
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,390
have their own charm.

752
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,180
Cut the crap.

753
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,690
The plague in Tianning

754
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:48,820
has been solved.

755
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:49,970
I believe

756
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,490
you can go back tomorrow.

757
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,350
You are actually clear

758
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:56,050
it is a man-made calamity

759
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,780
instead of a natural disaster.

760
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,970
So I’d like to know

761
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,100
what do you think

762
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,580
about the driving force.

763
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:08,110
I will investigate it.

764
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,720
You don’t need to worry.

765
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,420
Look at you.

766
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,510
You don’t need to take me

767
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,310
as a stranger.

768
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,550
This event is also related to me.

769
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,950
I also have many other things

770
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,310
I’d like to tell you.

771
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,090
I remember

772
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,580
your Crown Prince told me

773
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,090
they found the rule

774
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,780
after studying the infected

775
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,390
so many years.

776
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,500
To find out the special physique.

777
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:33,390
Only the people

778
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,300
who can recover

779
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,930
after being infected

780
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,580
can be used as the material.

781
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:43,850
I’ve told you

782
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:44,970
such a big secret.

783
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:46,890
So I hope

784
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,930
you can leave Yunxi earlier.

785
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,350
I have a big gift for you.

786
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:56,970
Jun Yizheng

787
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:59,260
has been infected with poisonous plague too.

788
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,590
He’s not cured till now.

789
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,730
It’s your business.

790
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,140
Not mine.

791
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,930
That’s Prince Qin.

792
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,350
If I weren’t

793
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,510
informed by Zhuyu

794
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,750
that he assigned Chu Xifeng

795
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,010
to Beili as a spy,

796
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:21,800
I may really trust him.

797
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:31,470
King of Beili passed away.

798
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,090
Yuze has left Beili

799
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,090
with Gu Qishao.

800
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,300
Yuze?

801
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:38,680
Yeah.

802
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:41,610
She was saved by Poison Master last time.

803
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:42,970
Xifeng.

804
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,100
Are you familiar with the environment

805
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,100
of Yaogui Valley?

806
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,350
Your Highness.

807
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,810
Why do you ask so suddenly?

808
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,540
I am not very clear about it.

809
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:54,180
But Zhuyu

810
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,130
should be familiar with it.

811
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:57,680
Take Zhuyu

812
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,800
back to Tianning.

813
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,360
Ask her to draw a map

814
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,470
of Yaogui Valley.

815
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:02,680
Yes.

816
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:06,950
Your Highness.

817
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,550
I don’t think

818
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:10,550
we can believe

819
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,280
the master of Yaogui Valley.

820
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,580
Don’t draw a conclusion in haste.

821
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:17,900
Take a look at it.

822
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:21,390
It’s…

823
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,050
Moxue satin.

824
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,220
It’s an article of tribute,

825
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,950
and only appears in the palace.

826
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,100
Is it really…

827
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,260
Yeah.

828
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:38,680
Let the reliable generals

829
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,720
make up the number

830
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,300
of people infected

831
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,010
and give it to Mu Qingwu

832
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:44,970
so that he won’t

833
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,850
suspect our men.

834
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,140
Yes, Your Highness.

835
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,890
What is our next plan?

836
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,390
It is confirmed

837
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:54,120
Jun Yizheng has been infected.

838
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,890
I will assign credible physicians

839
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:57,970
to detoxify him.

840
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,470
I’m afraid he won’t feel grateful

841
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,760
after we heal him.

842
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,220
When he is detoxified,

843
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,780
alignment or non-alignment

844
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:09,220
is no longer important.

845
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:11,970
In this case,

846
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,350
Beili won’t act rashly.

847
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,980
You are brilliant, Your Highness.

848
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:23,640
Your Highness.

849
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,680
May I ask where the prescription

850
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,940
for detoxifying made by Physician Gu is?

851
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:29,470
These are all belongings of Physician Gu.

852
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:31,050
Thank you.

853
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:45,180

[Husband - Long Feiye

856
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:38,940
Anything wrong?

857
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:42,170
I’m just taking a look

858
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,690
if you feel better now?

859
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,420
How is your recovery?

860
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,800
We will have a long way to go in the next few days.

861
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,010
Maybe it’ll be hard.

862
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,750
I’m completely recovered.

863
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,010
Good then.

864
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,870
Thank you for the sake of people

865
00:40:59,090 --> 00:40:59,820
in Tianning.

866
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,200
I’m a people of Tianning.

867
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,090
Saving the nation

868

and helping the people

869
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,550
are my duty.

870
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,100
So you are welcome.

871
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:08,950
By the way,

872
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,640
do you have any clue

873
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,290
of Haidong Village’s case?

874
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,040
It’s under investigation.

875
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,390
The person Physician Gu and I met

876
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:19,520
in the countryside around the capital

877
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,890
was also infected.

878
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,760
Think about it now,

879
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:23,970
he probably touched

880
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:25,500
something of the murderer.

881
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,000
Maybe the criminal is still in the capital.

882
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,240
Don’t worry.

883
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,170
I won’t let the criminal go.

884
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,010
♫ If this world fades ♫

885
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,850
♫ I’ll stay with you ♫

886
00:41:58,350 --> 00:41:59,970
♫ Being in silence to firmly ♫

887
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:03,890
♫ Withstand the innumerable words ♫

888
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,800
♫ If everything in the world ♫

889
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:11,550
♫ Breaks down ruthlessly ♫

890
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:14,390
♫ I’ll seam it for you ♫

891
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:17,720
♫ With my strings ♫

892
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:21,640
♫ Enjoy the sunrise and full moon with you ♫

893
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,010
I think

894
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:25,260
it should be the last time

895
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,350
we see each other.

896
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:31,920
We have nothing to do with each other later on.

897
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,760
And also call it even.

898
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:38,800
♫ Travel around the world with you ♫

899
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:42,140
♫ Just ‘cause you understand me ♫

900
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,720
♫ And you are doomed ♫
