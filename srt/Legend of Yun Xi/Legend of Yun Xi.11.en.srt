Episode 11

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,700
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,560
Your Highness.

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,780
Where are we?

6
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,990
Where is this place?

7
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,700
It’s where Yuze is detained.

8
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,900
That escort girl?

9
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,950
Why do you bring me here?

10
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,500
Has he found out my plan

11
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,540
with the Dowager?

12
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,260
Is he going

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,700
to lock me up with her?

14
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,120
Are you afraid?

15
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,400
You made a promise.

16
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,780
It’s too late to regret.

17
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,700
He must have found out.

18
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:09,900
Han Yunxi,

19
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,070
you’re so stupid.

20
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,920
Your Highness. Princess.

21
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,250
How is she?

22
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,190
Your Highness,

23
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,500
her symptom

24
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,530
is showing.

25
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,380
I didn’t see fear in your face

26
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,740
when you were dealing with poisonous mosquitoes

27
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,200
in the Mosquitoes Valley.

28
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,540
Now I ask you to treat a patient,

29
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,400
you’re scared?

30
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,780
So you want my help…

31
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,480
Your Highness,

32
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,500
you’re known for the use of poisons.

33
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,540
So we’d like you

34
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,610
to check Yuze

35
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,740
for us

36
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,500
and see what poison it is.

37
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,820
You should’ve told me.

38
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,280
I was worried about it.

39
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,740
Could she access to poisons?

40
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,960
Your Highness,

41
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,980
since she was detained here,

42
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,829
she’s been kept in single cell.

43
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,100
And the poisons and weapons

44
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,940
she carried with her

45
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,240
have been taken away.

46
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,090
She should have no other ways

47
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,070
to get poisons.

48
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,240
Is there a mole here?

49
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,740
I trained these soldiers myself.

50
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,340
They won’t betray me.

51
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,070
That’s weird.

52
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,420
Did she have any

53
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,550
unusual behaviors?

54
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,880
She refused to eat.

55
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,490
Really?

56
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,360
Yes.

57
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,110
I remember.

58
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,600
A few days ago,

59
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,220
she refused to eat anything.

60
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,820
To keep her alive,

61
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,700
we fed her rice soup.

62
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,190
Strange.

63
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,180
If she had hidden the poison,

64
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,100
she would have hidden it

65
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,700
in the innermost fake teeth.

66
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:23,930
But her teeth

67
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,070
are all genuine.

68
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,110
Where is she hiding them?

69
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,790
The rice soup isn’t poisonous.

70
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,080
Get the rice soup here.

71
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:45,960
Your Highness!

72
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,180
Your Highness, don’t.

73
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,220
We need to keep her alive.

74
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,280
You can’t kill her.

75
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,740
Hurry.

76
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,530
I was right.

77
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,420
The poison is in her blood?

78
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,190
Yes.

79
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,300
And it’s

80
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,740
one of the rarest poison,

81
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,030
called Rice Poison.

82
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,960
If she has poison in her blood,

83
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,700
how could she even survive?

84
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,020
It’s called Rice Poison

85
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,940
because rice activates the poison.

86
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,540
You’re lucky that you fed her rice soup.

87
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,610
If you fed her rice,

88
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,470
she’d be dead by now.

89
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,400
I’m confused about one thing.

90
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,590
If she wanted to kill herself,

91
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,260
she should eat as much as she can.

92
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,659
Why did she refuse to eat?

93
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,100
Rice Poison sounds painless.

94
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,460
But once it’s activated,

95
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,320
it’s more horrible than being stabbed
in the belly.

96
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,380
Is there an antidote?

97
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,070
It’s extremely rare.

98
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,300
I need a little time

99
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,110
to find a cure.

100
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,780
Give me three days.

101
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,490
Let me see what I can do.

102
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:15,780
Qishao,

103
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,530
Prince Qin is wily.

104
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,320
We can hardly track him.

105
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,630
I’m sorry

106
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,550
I can’t find out

107
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,240
where Yuze has been detained.

108
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,570
It’s my fault.

109
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,000
I should have known

110
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:27,860
Long Feiye spent so much efforts

111
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,700
to get Yuze,

112
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,980
therefore he would hold her

113
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,040
in secret custody.

114
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,150
Bai Su,

115
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,420
you must be tired

116
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,780
over the days looking for Yuze.

117
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,900
Go have some rest.

118
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,540
Shall we go to the Crown Prince and his uncle?

119
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,400
Not now.

120
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,220
The Crown Prince is a fool.

121
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,240
He panics.

122
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:45,860
And

123
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,500
they must be busy

124
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,060
with his uncle’s corruption.

125
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,260
They would make things

126
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,450
worse for us.

127
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,860
What should we do about Yuze?

128
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,150
Prince Qin.

129
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,720
Do you

130
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,740
want to start with that poison girl?

131
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,780
What are you doing here?

132
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,750
What are you doing here?

133
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,030
I’m working on a prescription.

134
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,280
Tiger bone.

135
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:49,990
Yunxi,

136
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,260
you work out so may prescriptions

137
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,860
in a blink of eye.

138
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,900
You must have read lots of books.

139
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,740
I’m short of a few medicines.

140
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,900
Guess I’ll go out and take my chance.

141
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,300
Yunxi,

142
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,180
you’re going out?

143
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,320
Take me with you.

144
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,590
You fed Tang Li laxative last time.

145
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,300
Prince Qin punished you to reflect on yourself.

146
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,590
Have you forgotten?

147
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,260
You’d better

148
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,000
stay at home.

149
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,080
Or Prince Qin would punish you again.

150
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,490
Yunxi,

151
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,530
see you.

152
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,300
What brings you here?

153
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,500
What brings you here?

154
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,660
I’m here to buy medicines.

155
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,660
You’re also here for medicines?

156
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,110
Yes.

157
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,700
You have all kinds of medicines in Yaogui Valley.

158
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,580
Why do you come out here?

159
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,110
I’m here to boast.

160
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:23,870
Poison girl,

161
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,880
you can’t do that to me.

162
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,060
You wanted medicines.

163
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,820
Why didn’t you go to Yaogui Valley?

164
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,460
You’re clearly

165
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,120
refusing to purchase from me.

166
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,140
You don’t charge for the medicines.

167
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,780
I can’t put you at a loss each time.

168
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,040
What nonsense is that?

169
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:35,900
Listen.

170
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,460
I never run short of medicines and money.

171
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,180
Welcome

172
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,820
to take whatever you want for free.

173
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,400
So,

174
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,780
don’t worry about the money.

175
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,450
All right.

176
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,060
When I need medicines in the future,

177
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,140
I’ll go to your Yaogui Valley.

178
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,140
Give me a better offer.

179
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,150
No problem.

180
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,040
What poison are you making lately

181
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,540
that requires so many precious medicines?

182
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,030
I’m just bored

183
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,140
and would like to study

184
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,740
on all kinds of rare medicines.

185
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,020
You’re busy with something

186
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,040
each time we meet.

187
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,020
And we don’t have a chance

188
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,420
to introduce ourselves.

189
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,000
I’m Gu Qishao.

190
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,930
May I know

191
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,310
your name, poison girl?

192
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,190
You called me poison girl each time.

193
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,000
I thought

194
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,750
you didn’t care to know my name.

195
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,100
I didn’t before.

196
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,200
But from now on…

197
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,140
What were you saying?

198
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,570
Nothing.

199
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,520
Your name, please.

200
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,130
I’m Yunxi,

201
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,090
Han Yunxi.

202
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,340
You may call me Yunxi.

203
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,490
Sure.

204
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,480
Your Highness,

205
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,780
I did it!

206
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,460
Take the antidote

207
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,710
and come with me.

208
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,360
What’s up?

209
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,450
Nothing.

210
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:48,980
Did you hurt your foot?

211
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,860
No.

212
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,160
Your Highness,

213
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,200
are you unhappy today?

214
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,740
Do you know

215
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,280
that you’re married?

216
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,780
I do.

217
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,550
I want you to bear in mind

218
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,860
that you’re my wife,

219
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,320
the woman of my house.

220
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,430
What do you mean by that?

221
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,630
Who is the man

222
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,550
you met

223
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,200
outside the medicine house?

224
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,320
Prince Qin has been known

225
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,110
to be aloof and proud.

226
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,450
Are you jealous now?

227
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,700
I just don’t want you to humiliate my house.

228
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,650
Really?

229
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,460
That man’s name is Gu Qishao,

230
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,990
the owner of Yaogui Valley.

231
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,350
We met

232
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,700
when you were hunting me down.

233
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,070
I ran into his valley.

234
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,540
He’s a nice man.

235
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,020
Thanks to his Mythical Herb,

236
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,680
the sores on my face are cured.

237
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,340
You’re Princess Qin now.

238
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,900
Beware of those who come to you.

239
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,150
They might hold evil purposes.

240
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,380
Don’t think too bad

241
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,500
of everyone.

242
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,460
Besides,

243
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,830
he doesn’t know who I am.

244
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:16,970
We don’t know

245
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,010
each other well.

246
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,260
Just acquaintances.

247
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,320
You’d better be right about it.

248
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,070
All right. Let’s go.

249
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,980
Are you all right?

250
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,450
Yes.

251
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,440
I’ve fed her the antidote.

252
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,500
But her channels

253
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,530
are clogged.

254
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,580
So I need to use silver needles

255
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,980
to unblock her channels.

256
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,640
She’s fine now.

257
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,650
Wait here.

258
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,610
Jerk!

259
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,400
You want to scare me with a rat?

260
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,109
I fear not even death.

261
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,109
Not to mention a rat.

262
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,190
Miss Yuze,

263
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,099
I know you’re loyal and would die

264
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:11,069
for your master.

265
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:17,030
Your life is in your hands.

266
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,069
Miss,

267
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:20,859
you’re well-known

268
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:22,740
for your beauty.

269
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,030
If the rat bites your face,

270
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,970
that would be a pity.

271
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:27,740
Monsters!

272
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,360
You’re monstrous.

273
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,020
You manipulated the poisonous mosquitoes

274
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,280
and murdered the Chief Justice’s family

275
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,200
and two high-rank officials.

276
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,780
You didn’t even spare

277
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,700
the infants.

278
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,240
Xifeng.

279
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:56,860
Let me go.

280
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,530
What do you want?

281
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,450
You monsters!

282
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,280
Monsters!

283
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,900
Jerks!

284
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,030
Ouch!

285
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,200
Stop! No!

286
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,470
Still don’t want to tell us?

287
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,280
If you don’t,

288
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,110
the rat

289
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,400
will eat your eyes next.

290
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,240
I’ll tell you.

291
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,400
I will.

292
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,620
It’s the Crown Prince.

293
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,780
The Crown Prince.

294
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,460
Your Highness,

295
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,400
Mr. Mu is here.

296
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,900
Your Highness.

297
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,560
Your Highness,

298
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,400
I have work to do.

299
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,990
I can’t stay for long.

300
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,740
I want to talk about

301
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,610
the slander.

302
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,070
Have you found out any clue?

303
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,450
Xifeng.

304
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:26,700
Mr. Mu.

305
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,030
What’s this?

306
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:38,860
[Yuze’s statement]

307
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,150
Is this Yuze

308
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,190
the leading showgirl of Gorgeous Chamber?

309
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,780
You’re right, Mr. Mu.

310
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,360
It took

311
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,540
His Highness

312
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,380
great efforts

313
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,200
to seize her.

314
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,140
How is this case related

315
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,150
to the showgirl?

316
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,570
You’re smart

317
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,360
and the King’s trusted man.

318
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,570
I believe

319
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,670
you should know

320
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,490
who

321
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,070
this woman’s regular clients are.

322
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,320
Your Highness,

323
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,270
though you have Yuze’s statement,

324
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,300
how could I know

325
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,230
it isn’t made when she’s tortured?

326
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,630
Yuze is popular

327
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:16,600
among the nobles

328
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,920
and celebrities.

329
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,700
Though she has given the Crown Prince in,

330
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,860
who knows if it’s another trap

331
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,400
someone else sets up?

332
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,280
I’ve given you her statement.

333
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,450
I will prove it.

334
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,940
Your Highness, what’s your plan?

335
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,570
Well,

336
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,830
I would like your cooperation.

337
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,900
Glad to hear.

338
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,320
Tianmo,

339
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,150
you’re too weak and timid.

340
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,090
When you take over

341
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,110
my throne,

342
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,880
you’ll have to be decisive

343
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,980
so that you can build up authority.

344
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,310
Enact heavy penalties,

345
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,630
and the subjects

346
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,860
will not commit crimes for fear of them.

347
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,870
Stop a crime with penalties

348
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,340
is the wise way to govern.

349
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,790
Thank you for your instructions, father.

350
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,750
Your Majesty,

351
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,310
Mr. Mu seeks your audience.

352
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,240
Send him in.

353
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,490
Your Majesty.

354
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,190
Your Highness.

355
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,070
Rise.

356
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,950
Are you here today

357
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,900
to report

358
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,490
on the case?

359
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

360
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,390
I’ve arrested the suspect of the case,

361
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,740
the leading showgirl of Gorgeous Chamber,

362
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,070
Yuze.

363
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,110
Mr. Mu,

364
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,700
you must have seized the wrong person.

365
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,200
She’s a showgirl.

366
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,460
How could she be able to murder

367
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,860
two high-rank officials

368
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,660
and frame it on my uncle, Prince Qin?

369
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,480
Your Highness,

370
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,140
I didn’t get the wrong person.

371
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,200
She takes on the job as an escort girl,

372
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,070
but in fact,

373
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,240
she’s good with poisons.

374
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,670
She might have been ordered

375
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,420
to murder the officials.

376
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,240
I think

377
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,540
when she gives out the person behind her,

378
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,940
the case will be cracked.

379
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,150
Mr. Mu,

380
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,090
you did live up

381
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,400
to my expectation.

382
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,860
Crack this case and find the truth

383
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,240
as soon as possible.

384
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,650
Yes.

385
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,360
Mu Qingwu,

386
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,540
stop right there.

387
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,030
Your Highness.

388
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,610
All right.

389
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:45,840
What have you

390
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,120
been doing these days?

391
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,510
Why don’t you come to me?

392
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,200
I’ve been busy with my work

393
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,060
and don’t have much time.

394
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,280
Your work?

395
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,630
Even my father isn’t as busy as you are.

396
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,570
Never mind.

397
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:01,700
I’ll give you a chance

398
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,780
to make it up to me.

399
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,660
There’s a fair on the West Avenue today.

400
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,740
Go with me.

401
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,530
But I’m occupied today.

402
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,660
Forgive me, Your Highness.

403
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,980
Why are you always occupied

404
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,110
when I make an offer?

405
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,180
All right.

406
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,700
I want to know

407
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,200
what makes you so busy.

408
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,320
I’m appointed

409
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,960
to arrest

410
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,950
the murderer of the officials.

411
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:26,990
Murderer?

412
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,360
Will it put you in danger?

413
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,420
No way.

414
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,860
I have to talk to father

415
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,780
to appoint someone else.

416
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,990
Please don’t.

417
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,640
Your Highness.

418
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,800
This is my work.

419
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,170
I can’t push it away

420
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,620
because it’s dangerous.

421
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,740
If you do it,

422
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,070
you make me an incompetent person.

423
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,700
It’s for your good.

424
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,820
Anyway, I don’t allow any danger to come to you.

425
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,070
I’ll go beg my father

426
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,100
and ask him

427
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,540
to give you a lighter position

428
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,250
so that you can have more time

429
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,140
to keep me company.

430
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,000
Your Highness,

431
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,030
it’s our family mission

432
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,820
to safeguard the Longs.

433
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,340
And I’m a trained militant.

434
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,040
I should safeguard the state.

435
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,090
How could any man

436
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,360
shirk his duty?

437
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,450
I don’t care.

438
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,460
It’s your family mission to protect the Longs.

439
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,070
I’m a Long, too.

440
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,860
According to the mission,

441
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,860
you should protect me, too.

442
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,460
But now,

443
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,080
I can’t even see you.

444
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:17,960
Your Highness,

445
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,900
if you insist,

446
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,610
I wouldn’t

447
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,030
dare to come to the palace anymore.

448
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,450
All right.

449
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,070
I will drop it, all right?

450
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,460
You make the call.

451
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,340
Thank you, Your Highness.

452
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:32,950
By the way,

453
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,070
the capital isn’t safe recently.

454
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,190
If you want to go out,

455
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,610
take more guards with you.

456
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,010
You’re not going,

457
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:42,990
neither am I.

458
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,950
I don’t trust the others.

459
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,010
When you’re available,

460
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,190
let’s go together.

461
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:49,950
I should go.

462
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,100
Your Highness, calm down.

463
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,040
Have some tea.

464
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,650
Don’t worry about Yuze.

465
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:15,920
Gu Qishao.

466
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,270
What was wrong with you?

467
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,620
How could you let Mu Qingwu take Yuze away?

468
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,260
If Yuze

469
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,180
gives them out,

470
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,340
you and I can’t get away from it, either.

471
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,940
I know I was too careless this time.

472
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,700
But trust me.

473
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,200
I will get Yuze out.

474
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,580
Don’t bother.

475
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,310
To avoid more troubles,

476
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,280
Yuze has to die.

477
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,950
If we can kill Mu Qingwu, too,

478
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,740
that will be merrier.

479
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,200
Your Highness,

480
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,180
we have to

481
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,570
be careful about this.

482
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:42,900
Because it’s possibly

483
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,030
a setup.

484
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,360
A setup?

485
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,190
I don’t think so.

486
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,320
But you need not to worry about it.

487
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,840
Your Highness!

488
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:03,650
Qishao,

489
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:04,970
wasn’t Yuze

490
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,420
arrested by Long Feiye?

491
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,100
Why

492
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,870
is she in Mu Qingwu’s hands now?

493
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,500
Long Feiye and Mu Qingwu

494
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,830
must have joined hands.

495
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,150
They want

496
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,670
to lurk the culprit out.

497
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,260
What should we do?

498
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,240
Either it’s real

499
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,360
or a setup,

500
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,190
we’ll get Yuze out.

501
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:41,860
Yunxi.

502
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,240
Yunxi.

503
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,200
What are you doing?

504
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,400
Reading.

505
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,930
Put it away.

506
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,780
The scrolls have turned you into a nerd.

507
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,500
Listen.

508
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,200
There’s a fair on West Avenue.

509
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,250
It’s fun.

510
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,000
And

511
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,260
there’s lantern show at night.

512
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,260
Let’s go to the fair.

513
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,460
I’m reading a scroll.

514
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,650
Put it down.

515
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,740
Let me tell you.

516
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,620
You need a little diversion from time to time.

517
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,900
If you keep learning with no fun,

518
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,700
your health will be crumbled.

519
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,390
You know?

520
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,450
Come on.

521
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:07,990
Let me get this.

522
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,740
Hurry. Let’s go.

523
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,510
Take a look.

524
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:38,990
Here.

525
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,700
You can take a look

526
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,400
of the others.

527
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,180
Thank you.

528
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,140
We’ll think about it. Thank you, ma’am.

529
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,020
Let’s go, Yunxi.

530
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:47,820
Goodbye.

531
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,680
The Flowery

532
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,900
is owned by my friend. Let’s take a look.

533
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,040
Welcome.

534
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,200
Take a look.

535
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,530
What is this?

536
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,210
This cleanser

537
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,680
is made of herbs

538
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,500
from Yaogui Valley.

539
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,340
There are centella asiatica, rosemary

540
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,380
and scutellaria root.

541
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,570
It’s good for skin.

542
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,820
And it’s fragrant.

543
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,080
The cleanser

544
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,350
can purify your skin

545
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,700
and keep your skin moist.

546
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,460
It sells the best

547
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,790
among all our products.

548
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,190
Nice.

549
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,750
This is also good.

550
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,530
Take a look.

551
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,110
Go.

552
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,320
Get him!

553
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,070
Yunxi.

554
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,280
Yunxi?

555
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,020
Isn’t he Yuze’s accomplice?

556
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,530
Kill them.

557
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:14,780
Stop!

558
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,780
Who are you?

559
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,280
I’m Princess Qin.

560
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,620
Prince Qin is on his way here.

561
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,020
You have nowhere to hide.

562
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:25,820
Let’s go.

563
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:33,950
Yunxi,

564
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,750
there you are.

565
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,700
Ningjing,

566
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,180
that’s Yuze’s accomplice.

567
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,070
Go get him.

568
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,110
Be careful.

569
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,150
You!

570
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,780
How dare you hurt the young general!

571
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,780
I’m not.

572
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,990
You deny it?

573
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,590
The weapon in your hand has his blood on it.

574
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,530
I said I didn’t.

575
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:27,600
Guards.

576
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,190
Yes.

577
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,210
Take her.

578
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:29,700
Yes.

579
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,490
You…

580
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,540
Do you know who we are?

581
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,910
Listen carefully. I’m…

582
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,840
We can’t tell them.

583
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,130
Take them

584
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,640
to the General’s Mansion.

585
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:49,900
Move.

586
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,200
Wake up.

587
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:01,420
[General’s Mansion]

588
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,750
That man

589
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,220
must be General Mu in charge of the investigation.

590
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,220
After we explain to him,

591
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,480
perhaps we’ll be fine.

592
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,870
It’s hard to say.

593
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:11,679
Look, they’re all

594
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:12,949
scary

595
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,949
and aloof.

596
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,380
They believe

597
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,020
what they see with their eyes.

598
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,590
And they saw you

599
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,030
cutting their master.

600
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,300
Besides,

601
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,739
that man is unconscious.

602
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,000
How could he be able to testify for us?

603
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:26,949
Silence!

604
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:30,679
Changfeng,

605
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,110
why is my son poisoned?

606
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:35,780
General,

607
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:37,699
the young general is ordered to deliver

608
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:39,900
the criminal and her statement to court.

609
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,500
They were attacked halfway.

610
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,460
The young general went after the attackers.

611
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,290
When we arrived,

612
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,540
we found the young general on the ground

613
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,070
and that woman

614
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,139
was holding a knife against him.

615
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:53,110
The other one is her accomplice.

616
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,190
Who are you?

617
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:58,110
Why did you poison my son?

618
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,740
General Mu,

619
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,380
we were just passing by

620
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,660
and intending to save him.

621
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,100
Your son is severely poisoned.

622
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,300
If he doesn’t get timely treatment,

623
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,300
he’ll be in grave danger.

624
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,290
Save him?

625
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,580
Who saves another by cutting him?

626
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,380
It’s spider mosquito’s poison.

627
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,140
If I didn’t cut him

628
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,260
and drain the poisoned blood,

629
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,240
he would be dead.

630
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,790
Nonsense!

631
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,450
Guards!

632
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,610
Chop their heads.

633
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:19,590
Wait.

634
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,420
Hold on.

635
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,670
General Mu.

636
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,000
You’re so bold.

637
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,620
I dare you kill Princess Qin.

638
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,360
Princess Qin?

639
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,880
Even though you’re the princess,

640
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,740
it’s the death penalty

641
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,470
to murder a court official.

642
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,340
General Mu, are you sure

643
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,200
you want to be Prince Qin’s enemy?

644
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,280
Fine.

645
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,530
Prince Qin’s powerful.

646
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,700
I’d rather quit my position as the general.

647
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,530
I know

648
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,990
Prince Qin hates me

649
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,540
because during the war with Xiqiu,

650
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,180
I listened to His Majesty’s order

651
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,070
and didn’t come to help in time.

652
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,650
So what?

653
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,530
Come at me.

654
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,460
Why did you have to target my son?

655
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,780
General Mu,

656
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,420
Prince Qin is a generous man.

657
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,060
You’re both His Majesty’s subjects,

658
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,280
his henchmen.

659
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,380
His Highness won’t

660
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,040
hold grudges with you on this.

661
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,280
No more words.

662
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,260
The young general is deeply poisoned.

663
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,390
Without treatment,

664
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,860
he’ll have no chance to come back to life.

665
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,450
I…

666
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,140
I cannot ask a woman

667
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,300
who tried to kill my son

668
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,360
to treat him, can I?

669
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,250
General Mu.

670
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,170
Physician Gu,

671
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,360
how is my son?

672
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,220
The young general has no wounds or pain.

673
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,460
But he’s unconscious due to the fever.

674
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,050
His face is blue and his lips purple.

675
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,630
It’s the symptom of poison.

676
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,990
Forgive my incompetence.

677
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:43,800
I can’t tell

678
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,320
what poison it is.

679
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,300
Spider mosquito poison.

680
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,110
It’s spider mosquito poison.

681
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,530
Your Highness.

682
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,780
Physician Gu.

683
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,900
Your Highness, can you elaborate

684
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,000
why it’s

685
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,420
spider mosquito poison?

686
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,100
Physician Gu, do you remember

687
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,500
those men with blue faces

688
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,590
and purple lips we saw

689
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,750
in the funeral home?

690
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,080
The young general

691
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,360
has the same symptoms.

692
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,820
Indeed.

693
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:16,780
General Mu,

694
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,300
Her Highness is good with poisons.

695
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,420
And it’s about the young general’s life.

696
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,380
Please let

697
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,420
Her Highness

698
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,860
treat the young general.

699
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,740
Physician Gu,

700
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:24,640
she’s

701
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,390
the suspect of my son’s murder.

702
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,290
No worries, General Mu.

703
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,790
A cut with such a knife

704
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,080
won’t lead to

705
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,320
such symptoms.

706
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,110
I’d like to vouch for Princess Qin.

707
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:37,990
General Mu,

708
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,710
every minute you waste now

709
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,460
will cause the young general

710
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,630
his life.

711
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,120
Don’t waste any more time.

712
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,700
All right.

713
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,540
Since Physician Gu vouches for you,

714
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,130
I…

715
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,580
I’ll trust you this time.

716
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,280
Lead the way.

717
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:55,820
How do I look?

718
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:56,990
Great.

719
00:37:59,340 --> 00:37:59,980
Your Highness,

720
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:00,980
General Mu is poisoned.

721
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,240
I was told it’s severe.

722
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,280
What?

723
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:04,700
Saddle my horse.

724
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,500
I’m going out now.

725
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,190
Yes.

726
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,210
Qingwu,

727
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,580
you have to be all right.

728
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,260
Your Highness,

729
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,320
it’s said Princess Qin poisoned him.

730
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,450
It’s that low-born girl.

731
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,950
If anything happens to Qingwu,

732
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,110
I will let her pay with her life.

733
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,960
The poisoned blood

734
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,180
hasn’t been all drained, has it?

735
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,710
Mass loss of blood

736
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,190
could cause him his life.

737
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,140
As far as I can see,

738
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,340
Her Highness is planning

739
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,580
to relieve the rest poison

740
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,110
with herbs.

741
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,140
When the fever is gone, he’ll come back to life.

742
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,450
At tonight or before tomorrow morning.

743
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,380
General Mu,

744
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,540
this is the prescription.

745
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,720
150g for a dose.

746
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,140
Boiled twice.

747
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,260
Feed him in morning and evening before meals.

748
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,140
With ten doses,

749
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,710
the poison can be relieved.

750
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,500
The young general needs peaceful rest.

751
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

752
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,540
You’re welcome.

753
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,780
If there’s nothing else I can help with,

754
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,710
I should go home.

755
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,380
Let me give you an escort.

756
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:37,950
How is he?

757
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,360
Calm down.

758
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,400
Most of the poison has been relieved.

759
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,450
What’s going on?

760
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,800
Your Highness,

761
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,940
the young general’s fever

762
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:02,980
shows no sign to improve

763
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,580
and he’s still unconscious.

764
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,700
If it weren’t spider mosquito poison,

765
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,540
could it be another

766
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,820
poison in his system?

767
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,940
The silver needle shows no sign.

768
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,260
Even if there is another poison,

769
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,990
it’s hard to find out what it is.

770
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,820
Ruling out all other possibilities,

771
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,700
there’s indeed another poison

772
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,430
in the young general’s system.

773
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,420
But we don’t know

774
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,340
what the poison is.

775
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,100
The only way

776
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,100
is to stay by his side

777
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,560
in case its symptoms show.

778
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,280
Your Highness,

779
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,570
does my son have any chance?

780
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,070
Han Yunxi!

781
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,530
How dare you!

782
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,780
You intended to kill a court official

783
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,450
and defied a royal princess.

784
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,710
Mr. Beigong,

785
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,240
-arrest her.
-No.

786
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,230
Give us a minute.

787
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:57,940
Your Highness,

788
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,570
she’s treating my son.

789
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,280
Your Highness,

790
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,920
you misunderstand.

791
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,710
Her Highness

792
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,100
is relieving the young general’s poison.

793
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,150
Really?

794
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,420
Then why is Qingwu

795
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,950
still unconscious?

796
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,500
General Mu,

797
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,880
you must be fooled.

798
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,660
How could you trust

799
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,460
your son’s life

800
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,950
to this low-born woman?

801
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,130
Who knows if she intends to help

802
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,380
or to kill?

803
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,820
If you don’t stop this fuss,

804
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:21,900
he will die.

805
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,000
Your Highness, don’t.

806
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,140
It doesn’t depend on you

807
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,420
either he dies or lives.

808
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,940
We have countless capable physicians in palace.

809
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,530
I don’t need your help.

810
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,880
You were the only

811
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,280
person there when he was found.

812
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:36,820
My son.

813
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,540
As Princess Qin…

814
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,220
-Son!
-…shouldn’t you stay at home?

815
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,610
Why were you there?

816
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,100
You said

817
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,460
you were relieving his poison.

818
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,860
Why do his symptoms go severe

819
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,060
instead of improving?

820
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,290
You fooled my uncle

821
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,700
and General Mu

822
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,900
with your honey tongue.

823
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,360
But you can’t fool me.

824
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,490
Today, I’ll slit your throat.

825
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,310
Then I’ll report to father.

826
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,320
Stop!
