00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,020
Episode 37

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,320
Ya!

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,140
Stop!

5
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,280
I shouldn’t have let him sleep.

6
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:29,180
Hey,

7
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:30,910
when can we arrive?

8
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:32,890
Your Highness,

9
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,050
in one hour, at most.

10
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,350
Good.

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,180
You are almost home now.

12
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,350
I bet you must have all sorts of feelings
right now.

13
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,090
What a pity!

14
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,050
The minute you are back,

15
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,850
I’ll put you into the death cell.

16
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,100
Because that’s where

17
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,720
you really belong.

18
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,560
I want to see father.

19
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,140
Father?

20
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,230
You are not qualified.

21
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,080
Your Highness.

22
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,680
Her Highness asked us

23
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,890
to welcome you here.

24
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:11,510
Good,

25
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,050
let’s go!

26
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,550
There are too many guards.

27
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,550
We won’t be able to save Qishao.

28
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,280
Let’s wait for a better chance.

29
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,250
You don’t have to follow me.

30
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,800
Now that I’ve promised you,

31
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,180
I won’t go to the Southern Regions.

32
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,580
Miss, please forgive me.

33
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,850
I promised master

34
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,180
that I’d keep you safe

35
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,390
as long as I’m alive.

36
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,180
But because of the plague
befalls the Southern Regions,

37
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,509
the people there are suffering right now.

38
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:42,550
Miss,

39
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,430
my duty

40
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:45,890
is to protect you.

41
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,259
I don’t care

42
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,930
about other things.

43
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,350
Other things?

44
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,180
Those are all people!

45
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,350
A plague

46
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,009
can take

47
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,090
thousands of people’s lives.

48
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:55,600
How can you…

49
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,200
Watch out!

50
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,010
Help! Help!

51
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:00,640
Don’t!

52
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,100
Help!

53
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,430
Seems that this man

54
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,030
is infected with the plague.

55
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,550
The plague?

56
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,759
Are you from the Southern Regions?

57
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,350
I…

58
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,350
I haven’t been to the Southern Regions.

59
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,890
I heard a plague broke out
in the Southern Regions

60
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,800
on my way,

61
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,180
so I came back.

62
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,180
Unfortunately,

63
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,760
I still got infected.

64
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,260
Since you haven’t been to the Southern Regions,

65
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,720
you couldn’t be infected.

66
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,180
Wait.

67
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,300
I don’t think it’s the plague.

68
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,550
It’s not?

69
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,390
It’s poison!

70
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,550
This poison

71
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,850
is infectious!

72
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,310
A poisonous plague?

73
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,180
Have you

74
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,100
eaten anything

75
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,640
or touched any medicine recently?

76
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,720
I picked up a bottle

77
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,930
days ago

78
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:09,930
and I took a sniff,

79
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,330
I felt uncomfortable instantly.

80
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,720
And the symptoms have become severer these days.

81
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:18,820
His symptoms

82
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,260
are similar to the plague report

83
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,260
received by the Imperial Hospital.

84
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,350
Since he fell ill

85
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,070
after he smelled the bottle,

86
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,140
then what’s in the bottle

87
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,200
must be the source.

88
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:30,980
Where’s the bottle?

89
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:31,850
I…

90
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,300
I threw it down the hill.

91
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,760
Where did you pick it up?

92
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,890
The border between

93
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,800
the Southern Regions and the capital.

94
00:03:59,090 --> 00:03:59,680
Darn it!

95
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,010
If I’m right,

96
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,480
the plague this time

97
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,800
is not a natural disaster,

98
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,730
but a human plot.

99
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:07,470
In this case, His Highness

100
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,850
won’t be able to address it.

101
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,100
If he fails to control it,

102
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,140
he will be in danger.

103
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,350
And the civilians will end up suffering.

104
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,150
Physician Gu,

105
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,510
the imperial physicians only know medicine

106
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,370
but not poison.

107
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,550
I’m sure I can help.

108
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,050
Okay.

109
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,220
Miss,

110
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,610
I’ll go with you.

111
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,550
I think Prince Qin

112
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,700
has arrived in the Southern Regions.

113
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,260
Your Majesty,

114
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,800
he should be there

115
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:38,890
by now.

116
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,600
I guess

117
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,430
Prince Qin is working hard

118
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,760
for the people

119
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,780
in the Southern Regions right now.

120
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,680
How concerned he is about our country!

121
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,100
But, Long Feiye,

122
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,140
it won’t take long though,

123
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,430
you’ll have to concern

124
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,850
about yourself.

125
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,550
What a pity!

126
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,300
No one will play Go

127
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,800
with me anymore.

128
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,180
Concubine Qing arrives!

129
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,180
Greetings, Your Majesty!

130
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,090
Rise.

131
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,470
Darling, what brought you here?

132
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,930
If I were not here,

133
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,100
Your Majesty would be busy with state affairs

134
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,300
and forget to take your medicine again.

135
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,870
Your Majesty, don’t work too hard

136
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,010
and harm your health.

137
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,720
In that case, I’ll never

138
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
forgive myself.

139
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,010
Got it.

140
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:37,690
Come here.

141
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,580
Your Highness.

142
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,220
According to your order,

143
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:09,800
we’ve set up

144
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,390
quarantine areas

145
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,010
in the different places of the Southern Regions.

146
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,430
Civilians who are already infected

147
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,890
have been transferred to accept treatment.

148
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,600
Civilians that we’re not sure

149
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,390
whether they have been infected with the plague

150
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,220
have also been transferred to specific

151
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,280
quarantine areas.

152
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,640
Both quarantine areas

153
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,900
and residential areas

154
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,340
have been disinfected.

155
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:35,890
Relief grains

156
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,220
are also provided

157
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,790
at specific place and time.

158
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:41,970
Remember.

159
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,850
Make sure

160
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,050
the suspected patients

161
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,010
are separated

162
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:46,800
in the quarantine areas, too.

163
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,350
Yes.

164
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:48,659
What’s more,

165
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,140
remind civilians in the city

166
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,270
to stay at home more.

167
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,350
If any family member

168
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,280
shows symptoms,

169
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,680
report it to the government right away.

170
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,680
Examine carefully at the city gate.

171
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,790
Stop any suspected patient

172
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,000
from coming in.

173
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:02,900
Remember,

174
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,680
at this critical moment,

175
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,600
the government

176
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,350
shall act

177
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,350
more orderly.

178
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,370
Don’t make any mistakes.

179
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:10,970
So the people will

180
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,220
be confident in the court.

181
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:12,800
Yes.

182
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,260
Your Highness

183
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,520
is indeed thoughtful!

184
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,650
I’ll go take care of it right now.

185
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,830
Any soldier gets infected?

186
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,050
Thank you for your care, Your Highness!

187
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,350
They are all healthy.

188
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,180
I guess King Tianhui asked General Mu

189
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,180
to come with me

190
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,180
to find out my relationship

191
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,710
with the Southern Regions.

192
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,020
Minister Sun,

193
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,350
remember to keep distance from me.

194
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,350
I got it.

195
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,500
Your Highness,

196
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,260
I think the plague this time

197
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,550
is quite odd.

198
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,220
Odd?

199
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,090
Yes.

200
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,320
What do you mean?

201
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,550
Usually when a plague breaks out

202
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,890
on a large scale like this,

203
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,390
it’s mostly triggered by flood,

204
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,220
drought, livestock epidemic,

205
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,720
or abnormal changes

206
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,180
of the weather.

207
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,800
But nothing happens

208
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,820
in the Southern Regions this year.

209
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,850
So the plague came from nowhere.

210
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,610
More importantly,

211
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,640
our therapy

212
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,600
doesn’t work at all.

213
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,260
So you mean

214
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,260
this plague

215
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,510
is a new epidemic?

216
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:38,970
Highly possible.

217
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,659
Your Highness,

218
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,929
I’ll inform the imperial physicians

219
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:45,760
and ask them to study it right away.

220
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,550
Hope they can

221
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,100
find the cure soon.

222
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,970
Make it as quickly as possible.

223
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,030
I’ll take my leave.

224
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,390
Still alive?

225
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,220
Tell the Imperial Hospital
to send more physicians

226
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,050
to keep him.

227
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:12,720
Yes.

228
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:13,800
Besides,

229
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,720
whether he’s cured or not,

230
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,150
make His Majesty stay there.

231
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,140
Yes.

232
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,470
His Highness arrives!

233
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,300
Yizheng.

234
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,680
Greetings, mother.

235
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,180
Let me look at you.

236
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,350
Is everything

237
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,800
going well?

238
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,720
It went well at first.

239
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,350
But that little bastard

240
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,220
Jun Yixie

241
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,260
held me back

242
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,970
and made me suffer a lot.

243
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,350
I knew we shouldn’t have kept

244
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,640
such a bane.

245
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,100
I was going to come back

246
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,760
after I caught Poison Master,

247
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,900
but my identity was exposed early,

248
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,430
and Tianning became such

249
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,760
a crisis-ridden place,

250
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,260
so I had to come back first

251
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,640
to make another plan.

252
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,430
As long as you are back safely,

253
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,760
the others don’t matter at all.

254
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,430
Mother,

255
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,140
I caught Jun Yixie

256
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,950
and brought him back this time.

257
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,350
He defied me and father’s order,

258
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,100
released Poison Master,

259
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,180
and colluded with our enemy.

260
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,850
It’s all capital crime!

261
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,180
I gotta ask father

262
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,440
to punish him heavily!

263
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,550
No need

264
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,760
to bother your father with such a thing.

265
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,760
You can make decisions by yourself.

266
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,920
Your father is seriously ill,

267
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,850
I’m afraid he’ll die soon.

268
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:33,970
Mother,

269
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,470
then my throne…

270
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,860
Yizheng, don’t worry.

271
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,220
I’ve arranged it for you already.

272
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,720
Guards! Guards!

273
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,890
Guards!

274
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,510
-Stay out of this!
-Guards!

275
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,680
Or, you’ll be killed!

276
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,390
I… I want some water!

277
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,180
Guards!

278
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,010
But, mother,

279
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,800
why do you

280
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,440
treat father that way?

281
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,050
You still don’t get it

282
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,470
after these many years?

283
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,930
I’ve gained a high position and power,

284
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,510
but your father

285
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,930
never favored me.

286
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,740
I actually don’t care about it.

287
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,050
As long as I’m still the Empress,

288
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,800
and he passes the throne to you

289
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,470
after he dies,

290
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,140
I can put up with everything.

291
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,390
But being ill so seriously,

292
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,440
he still hasn’t issued his will!

293
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,220
It really pushes my button!

294
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,550
Maybe

295
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,300
he wants to pass the throne to Jun Yixie?

296
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,040
Your Highness,

297
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,300
this is the latest number of infections

298
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,160
reported from different places.

299
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,050
Bazhou, 239.

300
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,010
Xuzhou, 237.

301
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,470
Bozhou, 356.

302
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,930
Huazhou, 560.

303
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,760
Xizhou, 572.

304
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,220
Dengzhou, 320.

305
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,550
Yunzhou, 437.

306
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,010
I see.

307
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,300
Go take care of the thing

308
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,430
I asked you.

309
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:54,600
Yes.

310
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,010
I’m on it.

311
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,760
The new antidote

312
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,090
still doesn’t work?

313
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,100
No.

314
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,180
Continue the study.

315
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,300
I’ll report the situation

316
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,100
to the court

317
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,750
and ask them to send more help.

318
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:13,350
Yes.

319
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:14,950
I’ll take my leave.

320
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,720
Miss, let’s go.

321
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,080
Your Highness!

322
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,720
What are you doing here?

323
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,470
Now, go back!

324
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,460
Your Highness!

325
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,510
I have something important to tell you!

326
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,180
Gu Beiyue,

327
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:40,550
is this how

328
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,010
you take care of Han Yunxi?

329
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:43,950
Your Highness,

330
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,090
Miss Yunxi is here

331
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,180
for you

332
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,240
and the civilians of Tianning.

333
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,180
We found something

334
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,350
about this plague,

335
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,140
so we are here to report it to you.

336
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,600
You guys don’t need

337
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,730
to worry about this!

338
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,530
Take her back, now!

339
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:56,930
I can leave.

340
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,440
But I need to confirm something.

341
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,010
See that?

342
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,240
It’s poison,

343
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,930
not an ordinary plague.

344
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,660
I can’t believe

345
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:25,930
that the plague in the Southern Regions
was caused by a poison!

346
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,280
Since you’ve found this out,

347
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,520
give us the antidote

348
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,460
and then leave.

349
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,220
I don’t have the antidote.

350
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,760
You don’t?

351
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,300
Then why are you here?

352
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,510
I’ve also never

353
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,300
encountered with such a poisonous plague.

354
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,090
I need to stay here

355
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,430
and observe the symptoms of the patients,

356
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,600
so that I can study the poison

357
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,760
and develop the antidote.

358
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,390
No.

359
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:46,970
I’ll ask the imperial physicians

360
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,090
to do it.

361
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:49,650
You may leave.

362
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:50,850
No?

363
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,680
Then tell me,

364
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,720
which of you

365
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,700
knows poison better than me?

366
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,550
If I don’t stay,

367
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,890
can you figure out the antidote?

368
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:02,800
If you can’t, how can you

369
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,260
save the civilians of the Southern Regions?

370
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,390
You’ve been here for a long time,

371
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,350
yet you haven’t found out the reason
of the plague,

372
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,880
so why do you ask me to leave?

373
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,300
Miss,

374
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,440
thanks to you,

375
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,090
the patients

376
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,390
are all getting better now.

377
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,650
Don’t be happy so soon.

378
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,470
Their poison is just relieved.

379
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,010
They haven’t been totally cured yet.

380
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,600
It takes time.

381
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:45,930
Luckily,

382
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:46,600
our treatment

383
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,680
is working now.

384
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:50,490
Hope we can

385
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,850
get through this successfully.

386
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,510
I’ll go decoct more medicine.

387
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,550
Her Highness arrives!

388
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:03,720
Mother.

389
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,599
Yizheng.

390
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:08,010
You are not feeling well.

391
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:08,970
You must have

392
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:10,349
overworked in Tianning.

393
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:12,010
I’ve asked them to make tonics for you.

394
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,270
Remember to have some.

395
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,050
After your father dies,

396
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,300
we’ll only

397
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,430
have each other.

398
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:20,470
You’ve got to take good care of yourself.

399
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,089
Mother,

400
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,130
I’ve visited my father.

401
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,140
He’s unconscious,

402
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,849
but keeps mumbling

403
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:27,550
Jun Yixie

404
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,900
and his mother’s name.

405
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,060
Why does he neglect us like this?

406
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,300
Back then,

407
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,180
if it hadn’t been for you

408
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,300
and my grandfather’s power,

409
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,140
how could my father

410
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,400
have taken the throne?

411
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,100
So in his eyes,

412
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,560
I can’t even compare to that little bastard?

413
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,640
When that bitch

414
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,650
was still alive,

415
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,430
she always behaved humble

416
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,130
to win your father’s favor.

417
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,100
You father thought I didn’t know

418
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,850
that he mistreated her and her son

419
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,970
to actually confuse me.

420
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,760
Unfortunately,

421
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,850
I’m not

422
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,220
a stupid woman

423
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,390
who relies on a man.

424
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,050
But I do blame myself

425
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,930
that I didn’t

426
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,510
find a chance

427
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,430
to kill that bitch’s son!

428
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,720
Jun Yixie, you little bastard!

429
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,680
You want to fight me over the throne?

430
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,140
You wish!

431
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,800
What are you doing here?

432
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,800
Qishao, let’s go!

433
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,510
You guys leave. I can’t go!

434
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,800
If I leave with you,

435
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,770
I’ll become a fugitive of Beili.

436
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,300
In that case,

437
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,630
I can never see my father

438
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:02,470
and settle my relations

439
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,510
with Beili,

440
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,390
neither can I

441
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,390
get my mother’s ashes.

442
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:07,650
Qishao, you don’t know

443
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,600
that His Majesty is seriously ill now.

444
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,550
The Empress and Crown Prince

445
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,810
have blocked the news.

446
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,300
They are going to kill you

447
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,630
after His Majesty dies.

448
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:15,550
Qishao,

449
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,470
let’s leave here first.

450
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,640
Then we can make a plan.

451
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,260
Come on!

452
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:27,550
Qishao.

453
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,880
His Majesty is dying.

454
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,470
I’m afraid changes may happen in the palace.

455
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,390
Go back to the palace

456
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,640
and get your mother’s ashes.

457
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,970
We’ll go distract them.

458
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:34,760
No.

459
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:35,350
Go!

460
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:49,800
Zhuyu!

461
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:51,850
Split up!

462
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,470
Thank you for saving me.

463
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,440
You are welcome.

464
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,260
It’s you!

465
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,750
Where’s that little bastard?

466
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,730
Someone saved him out.

467
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,850
Saved him out?

468
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,720
A bunch of rubbish!

469
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,640
Your Highness, spare us!

470
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,470
Jun Yixie,

471
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,930
don’t think you can run away from me!

472
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,550
Your Highness.

473
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,810
What brought you here?

474
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:25,890
I heard that you’ve been working hard

475
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,470
to develop the antidote,

476
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,600
so I brought you some food.

477
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,090
Thanks.

478
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,800
How is it going?

479
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,930
I’ve never seen

480
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,850
or heard of such an infectious poison.

481
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:41,910
It’s highly toxic.

482
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,140
It won’t kill

483
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,510
a healthy person right away,

484
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,370
but it’ll linger on in one’s body.

485
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,470
It’s really difficult for me to figure it out.

486
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,140
I’ve tried many methods

487
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,140
with the imperial physicians.

488
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,100
They can’t detoxify the poison

489
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,180
but can only relieve the symptoms.

490
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,640
Is there anything I can do?

491
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,140
Just take protection

492
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,550
and prevention measures to get it under control.

493
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,260
Leave the antidote

494
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,320
development to us.

495
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,890
You still have many things to do tomorrow.

496
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,150
Go back and rest early.

497
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:08,710
What about you?

498
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,500
I’ll continue to develop the antidote.

499
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,720
Let me keep you company.

500
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,930
♫ Choose a speck of redness ♫

501
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,350
♫ From so many colors ♫

502
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,300
♫ Just like ♫

503
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:47,550
♫ A rouge dream ♫

504
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,850
♫ That melts ♫

505
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:53,220
♫ In the bridal outfit ♫

506
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,050
♫ And makes people heartbroken ♫

507
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:08,300
Miss!

508
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,010
Yunxi!

509
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:10,540
Yunxi!

510
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,730
Yunxi! Are you okay?

511
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,180
How is she?

512
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,600
Miss Yunxi

513
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,180
is infected.

514
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,120
Your Highness,

515
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,640
you are in charge.

516
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,870
At this critical moment,

517
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,510
you can’t be crashed.

518
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:56,760
At this point,

519
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,100
I can’t leave her.

520
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,230
Then keep her company.

521
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,850
Son.

522
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,930
Is it really you?

523
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,100
Yes.

524
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,640
It’s me,

525
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,490
the son of the worthless maid

526
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,970
you hated the most.

527
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,800
No matter how you treated me before,

528
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:32,850
you are after all

529
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,300
my father,

530
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:36,680
so I’m here to save you.

531
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,600
I failed you

532
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,300
and your mother.

533
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,640
Son,

534
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,010
thank you

535
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:48,180
for saving me.

536
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,640
Don’t say this to me.

537
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,230
I’m saving you

538
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,700
because I pity you.

539
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,140
It’s too late

540
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,180
to say thanks to me.

541
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,850
My mother has died.

542
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,470
And I

543
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,260
end up like this.

544
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,350
You think saying thanks

545
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,050
can offset what you did?

546
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,180
Listen,

547
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,510
I will never

548
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,470
forgive you.

549
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,220
Don’t worry.

550
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,760
You are seriously ill

551
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,860
and incurable now.

552
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,020
This medicine

553
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,090
will help you die quicker.

554
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,300
That’ll be

555
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:36,430
enough for me.

556
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,550
My son.

557
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,390
Take this.

558
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,430
Back then,

559
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,970
the Empress’s family was too powerful.

560
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,720
For the sake of my throne,

561
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,390
I didn’t dare offend her family,

562
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,600
so I made you and your mother

563
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:11,300
suffer a lot.

564
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:21,850
I was too weak. It’s all my fault.

565
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,430
As the Emperor of Beili,

566
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:30,800
you couldn’t even

567
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,530
protect your wife and your son!

568
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,140
Stop making excuses for yourself.

569
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,890
Because you chose

570
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:39,740
to be the ruler of this country.

571
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,510
I’m not like you.

572
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:44,640
You totally abandoned

573
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,370
me and my mother for the throne,

574
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:49,510
which, however,

575
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,770
means nothing to me!

576
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,300
I won’t choose this

577
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,040
because I don’t give a damn!

578
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:57,090
You think giving me the throne

579
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,490
can make up for what my mom

580
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,720
and I had been going

581
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:03,180
through these years?

582
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,140
Father.

583
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,600
Good luck!

584
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:23,260
I’ll bid farewell to you now.

585
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,050
Son!

586
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:29,720
Son!

587
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,940
You… You…

588
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,800
Are you looking for this?

589
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,660
Give me back my mother’s ashes!

590
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:03,930
No rush!

591
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:06,180
Let’s play a game.

592
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,490
As we did when we were little.

593
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,010
I’m the Emperor,

594
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,650
and you are my servant.

595
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,510
Shouldn’t a servant

596
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,840
bow before the Emperor?

597
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,470
Now, kneel.

598
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,220
Okay.

599
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,600
But you need to kowtow three times.

600
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,140
Do it.

601
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,260
You are my Emperor.

602
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,470
How should you bow to me?

603
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,850
What should I do now?

604
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,350
You are infected with the plague.

605
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,010
What?

606
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:08,850
It’s impossible!

607
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,060
[Haidong Village]

608
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,430
You are an expert in medicine.

609
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,560
Give me a treatment.

610
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:27,790
Don’t go.

611
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,260
We are brothers.

612
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,650
You can’t watch me die.

613
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,300
Now you admit

614
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,600
that we are brothers?

615
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:36,970
Help me!

616
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:38,350
Help me!

617
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,300
I’m begging you!

618
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,180
Please help me!

619
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:43,760
Help me!

620
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:44,800
Please!

621
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,140
Help me!

622
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,720
Have you made a decision

623
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,890
about your successor?

624
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,260
Actually,

625
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,720
with or without your edict,

626
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,330
the result will be the same.

627
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,930
Now all the officials in the court

628
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:30,510
have served my family.

629
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,600
Even God can’t stop

630
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,260
Yizheng from becoming the Emperor.

631
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,850
I suggest you

632
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,940
understand the situation better,

633
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,760
so that you don’t have

634
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,260
to suffer as much.

635
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:53,260
Do you hear me?

636
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,660
Where’s the edict?

637
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,280
Where’s the edict?

638
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,610
Where’s the edict?

639
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,700
Where’s the edict?

640
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,180
Qishao.

641
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,350
Jun Yizheng treated you so badly before,

642
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,140
why are you

643
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,930
saving him?

644
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,170
Such a despicable and mean man

645
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,970
deserves to die.

646
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:32,640
Father’s condition

647
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,170
is getting worse and worse.

648
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,190
If he passes away

649
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,300
one day,

650
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,680
our country will

651
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,680
have no emperor.

652
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,350
Without an emperor,

653
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,140
it means

654
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:42,900
our country will

655
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,760
be put to an end soon.

656
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,140
What worries me right now is not my father,

657
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,250
but the civilians of Beili.

658
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,160
But you are also a prince, Qishao.

659
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:55,970
This is not a life

660
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:56,930
I want though.

661
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,470
I don’t care about the throne.

662
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,090
Besides,

663
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,360
the Empress has deep-rooted power

664
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:04,350
in the court,

665
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:06,800
I don’t want to bring trouble to myself.

666
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,300
But

667
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,720
as such an ungrateful person,

668
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,640
he’ll forget

669
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:10,720
how you saved his life

670
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,920
as soon as he’s cured.

671
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,720
Maybe,

672
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,650
he’ll even hurt you again later.

673
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,350
Don’t worry.

674
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,460
I have my way to control him.

675
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,100
I don’t want to own you anything.

676
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,510
Tell me what you want.

677
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,320
I’m not as selfish as you are,

678
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:43,510
taking about conditions with whatever you do.

679
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,300
Moreover,

680
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,890
you’ve never kept your word anyway.

681
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,430
Even if we had a deal,

682
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,970
so what?

683
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:50,760
Do you believe

684
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,800
I can kill you now?

685
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:52,720
I do.

686
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,050
That’s your real thought.

687
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,470
You insult me

688
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,470
and want to kill me,

689
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,800
because you are worried

690
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:01,050
that I’ll fight you over the throne.

691
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:02,470
Let me tell you, Jun Yizheng.

692
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:04,010
Listen carefully!

693
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,220
I’m not interested

694
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,430
in the throne at all!

695
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:08,469
So,

696
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,239
you can be totally relieved.

697
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,800
You are not interested?

698
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:15,360
Who wouldn’t crave for the throne?

699
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,850
I can’t be relieved

700
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,050
as long as you are in Beili.

701
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:23,010
You should say you can’t be relieved

702
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:24,350
as long as I’m alive.

703
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,469
Father didn’t leave you the edict

704
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,010
to make you his successor,

705
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:30,760
right?

706
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:32,469
That… That’s nonsense!

707
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,139
I always keep

708
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,389
my word.

709
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,889
I meant it when I said

710
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,100
I wasn’t interested.

711
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,510
Then give me the edict!

712
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,050
Although

713
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,429
I’m not interested,

714
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,600
this edict is

715
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,139
my amulet.

716
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,469
As long as I’m alive,

717
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,050
healthily and safely,

718
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:53,010
I won’t tell anybody

719
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:54,800
about the edict.

720
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:58,010
But if I die someday,

721
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,300
I’ll let the whole world

722
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,360
know that you are

723
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:04,010
unworthy of the Emperor of Beili.

724
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:05,050
So,

725
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,140
you’d better pray

726
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,890
for a long life for me.

727
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,120
What’s more,

728
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:12,070
let me warn you, Jun Yizheng.

729
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,050
In the future, don’t do those

730
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,390
evil things again.

731
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:16,800
If you want to sit tight

732
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,050
on the throne,

733
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,760
think more for our people.

734
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:21,550
The poisonous plague in Beili

735
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,760
is spreading right now.

736
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,600
Have you ever thought

737
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,260
about addressing it for them?

738
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,090
Besides,

739
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,550
stop thinking about making alliance
with Chu Qingge.

740
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,640
Because you are not

741
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:32,260
as smart as she is.

742
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:33,430
Guards!

743
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,430
Arrest him!

744
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,350
What did I just say?

745
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,050
In such a short time,

746
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,550
you already exposed your true color!

747
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,930
Wanna kill me to shut my mouth

748
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:42,930
and get the edict?

749
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,640
I’m afraid you can’t take the throne

750
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,300
even if I’m dead.

751
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,890
Because the plague you got

752
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,370
is just relieved for now.

753
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:54,910
Jun Yizheng,

754
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,830
no matter you want it or not,

755
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,720
you have to keep me alive.

756
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,300
The poisonous plague

757
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,600
is just temporarily suppressed.

758
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,860
To cure the civilians,

759
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,880
we need other prescriptions.

760
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,300
And I gotta

761
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:15,300
look for them in person.

762
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,720
-Qishao, let us go with you.
-Qishao, let us go with you.

763
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,390
No need.

764
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:22,150
The poisonous plague is still spreading in Beili.

765
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,260
You guys stay here

766
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,350
and try to keep it under control.

767
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,390
I’ll be back as soon as possible.

768
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,260
Yes, Qishao.

769
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:16,960
Your Highness.

770
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,990
Please take care of Miss Yunxi.

771
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:21,010
I’ll go check the quarantine areas.

772
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,220
Yunxi,

773
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:51,390
please get well,

774
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,970
so that you can remember

775
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:59,920
and hate me for a whole life.

776
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,770
Move him over there.

777
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:19,430
There.

778
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,430
General Mu.

779
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:40,930
I thought our medicine

780
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:41,720
has suppressed

781
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,050
the spreading of the plague.

782
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:43,510
How come

783
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,890
more people are transferred here?

784
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:46,020
I don’t know either.

785
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,670
It’s really strange.

786
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:48,350
Many

787
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,490
uninfected places

788
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,990
are attacked by the plague suddenly.

789
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:53,680
In theory,

790
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:54,850
we’ve already

791
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,300
put the plague under control.

792
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,100
Why are there so many people got infected?

793
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,010
I have no idea.

794
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:01,640
I just got the news

795
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,770
this early morning.

796
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,280
By the way,

797
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,240
do you know Haidong Village?

798
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:07,050
The people there

799
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:07,930
are so pitiful.

800
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:08,970
How so?

801
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:11,260
I heard the people there

802
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,850
got infected first,

803
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,550
and they were also hit by the plague the hardest.

804
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,080
We just went to the village,

805
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,650
where hardly have any people left.

806
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,680
There are only corpses.

807
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:36,680
Gu Qishao?

808
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:39,890
Physician Gu.

809
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,430
You also think Haidong Village

810
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,260
has a problem?

811
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,600
You think so, too?

812
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,220
The plague in your Tianning

813
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,510
has spread into our Beili.

814
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,850
How could I ignore it?

815
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,470
Besides,

816
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:50,600
this is where the plague

817
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,640
first took place.

818
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,930
The situation is getting worse and worse.

819
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:54,600
I think

820
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,010
the reason why the poisonous plague happened

821
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:57,390
must be hidden here.

822
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,600
I don’t want to have

823
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,760
any contact with Beili people.

824
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,550
Excuse me.

825
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,600
Physician Gu.

826
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,220
You’d better work with me.

827
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:07,890
We have a goal in common,

828
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:09,430
and I’m also

829
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,880
well-versed in poison,

830
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,500
you won’t lose anything.

831
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,850
I also want to ask you

832
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:16,680
a question.

833
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,910
I know what you wanna ask.

834
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:20,550
Princess Qin is infected.

835
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,050
What?

836
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,390
How could you and Long Feiye

837
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:24,520
fail to protect her?

838
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:25,550
How did she

839
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,350
get infected?

840
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:27,050
It’s not the time to ask that.

841
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:28,090
We should find the source

842
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:29,140
of the plague as soon as possible.

843
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,740
Then Miss Yunxi can be cured.

844
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:36,680
Seems that the entire village

845
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,890
has been infected.

846
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:56,970
Hold on.

847
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:58,930
There might be a problem with the water.
