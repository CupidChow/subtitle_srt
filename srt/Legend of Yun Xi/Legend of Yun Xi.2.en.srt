00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,140
I wouldn’t even

177
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,930
give it to His Majesty.

178
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,350
Thank you, Your Highness.

179
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,140
Feiye,

180
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,890
you should taste the tea,

181
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,350
not gulp it down.

182
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,550
What a waste of my tea!

183
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,050
Forgive me, Your Highness.

184
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,100
Since I came back,

185
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,010
I haven’t paid a visit to my mother.

186
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:48,930
I’m eager to go home

187
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,680
so I drank too fast.

188
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,930
I know

189
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,930
you’re eager to see your mother.

190
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:56,930
Go ahead.

191
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,050
Go home to your mother.

192
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,300
Thank you, Your Highness.

193
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:04,800
I’ll take my leave.

194
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,220
Servants!

195
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,470
Your Highness.

196
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,430
Smash the tea cup that scoundrel

197
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,470
drank from for me.

198
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,090
Yes.

199
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,430
Your Highness,

200
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,050
I don’t know

201
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,760
if it’s proper for me to say this.

202
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,430
Please do.

203
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,470
A few days ago,

204
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,510
the kitchen maid

205
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,090
drank the Morning Dew you left.

206
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,090
Unexpectedly, her body

207
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,090
was allergic to the tea.

208
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,890
She got rashes all over her

209
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,090
and fainted.

210
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:56,970
Why did you bring up

211
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,220
the low-born girl whose limbs were cut off?

212
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:00,680
Your Highness,

213
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,680
you granted Prince Qin Morning Dew just now.

214
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,760
Your point?

215
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,850
I remember

216
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,390
when Prince Qin was born,

217
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,600
the astrologer told that he was ominous

218
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,890
to the state fate

219
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,050
and was raised in palace outside the capital.

220
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,680
To appease Consort Yi,

221
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,850
you were generous with Prince Qin’s reward.

222
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:24,850
Go on.

223
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,720
Among the rewards

224
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,850
is the Morning Dew.

225
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,850
The eunuch who attended Prince Qin

226
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,220
reported back to us

227
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,300
that after Prince Qin drank the tea,

228
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,800
he got rashes and fainted.

229
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,350
The servants talked about it back then.

230
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,930
We thought Prince Qin was too humble

231
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,140
to drink even a cup of tea.

232
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,300
Consort Yi was struck ill for this.

233
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,300
She thought you poisoned her son.

234
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,010
So we seldom talk about Prince Qin since then.

235
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,010
But I followed Prince Qin out just now

236
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,850
and found he was quite natural

237
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,510
and seemed to feel nothing from his pain

238
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,010
After he went out of the palace,

239
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,470
he jumped on his horse.

240
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,430
I continued to watch for a while.

241
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,930
He didn’t fall off his horse.

242
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,090
If he’s allergic to the tea,

243
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,430
the time from he drank it here

244
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,600
to the gate is enough for his body to react.

245
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:25,930
Right.

246
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,260
Your Highness, do you remember

247
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,970
the fire that year?

248
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,350
The fire

249
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,220
burned every one into ashes.

250
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,050
Only he escaped.

251
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,600
I’m curious about it.

252
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,390
You should be.

253
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,760
I’m afraid Prince Qin’s identity

254
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,600
isn’t as simple as it seems.

255
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,550
However,

256
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,890
it was me

257
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,300
who planned the fire.

258
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,800
If we’re going to look into his identity,

259
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,090
we’ll have to

260
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:22,050
investigate in the fire.

261
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,550
My son

262
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,050
is headstrong

263
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,720
and rigid in rules.

264
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,220
If some clues are dug out,

265
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,260
I’m afraid

266
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,390
they’ll lead to me.

267
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:38,850
Your Highness,

268
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,350
why don’t we send a spy

269
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,970
to look around in Prince Qin’s Mansion?

270
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,510
Get my sedan.

271
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,600
I’m going to Qinzheng Hall.

272
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,050
Yes.

273
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:55,260
[Qinzheng Hall]

274
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,010
Your Majesty.

275
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,470
Mother.

276
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,550
I come today

277
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,260
to talk to you about Prince’s Qin’s marriage.

278
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,680
Marriage?

279
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,260
I’d like to hear it.

280
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,890
Decades ago,

281
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,090
I made a match for Prince Qin.

282
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,090
I wasn’t serious.

283
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,760
Mother,

284
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,720
why didn’t I know anything about the match?

285
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,350
It was years ago.

286
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,140
Back then,

287
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,010
I was dying of a rare poison.

288
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,760
Lady Tianxin saved my life.

289
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,350
So I made a joke

290
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:48,050
that I would make a perfect match

291
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,640
for her unborn baby.

292
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,760
Consort Yi was there, too.

293
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:55,090
I said if her baby was a girl,

294
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,890
I would marry her to Feiye.

295
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,220
Well,

296
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,090
where is the girl now?

297
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,090
With the Hans.

298
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:07,220
She’s Physician Han Cong'an’s daughter.

299
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,220
The ugly girl from the Hans

300
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,090
with sores on her face?

301
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,180
Yes.

302
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,100
Virtue comes first when choosing a wife.

303
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:17,930
Besides,

304
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,350
it was a joke.

305
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,260
But I was the Queen of the state.

306
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,760
I can’t go against my words.

307
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,300
The Hans are a physician family.

308
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,760
They have little connections in court.

309
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:36,260
I made Prince Qin a match back then.

310
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,680
I’m sure he will not disobey me.

311
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:44,100
It’s a wonderful plan.

312
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,140
Mother, you’re wise.

313
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,470
I’ll issue an edict tomorrow

314
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,100
to marry her to Feiye.

315
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:53,680
Have you found out

316
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,800
what’s behind the poisonous miasma?

317
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,220
Yes, I have.

318
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,850
It’s Yaogui Valley.

319
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,970
The owner is a mystery.

320
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,930
With the poisonous miasma as the barrier

321
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,050
and rumors about the poisonous herbs,

322
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:07,970
seldom

323
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,600
has anyone come close to the valley.

324
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,180
There are people going there for medicine.

325
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,350
But without the owner’s consent,

326
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,720
no one can go in alive.

327
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,640
What is it

328
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,140
-that makes you so worried?
-Qishao.

329
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:02,640
Qishao,

330
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,720
there are men waiting to buy our medicine.

331
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:05,849
They don’t seem

332
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,430
like good people.

333
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:11,180
They’re here already.

334
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:12,890
Come on.

335
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,510
Let’s see who they are.

336
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,510
Who is it that wants my medicine?

337
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,550
It doesn’t matter who I am.

338
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,550
I just want to enter for medicine.

339
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,640
You want to buy my medicine

340
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,470
yet you refuse to tell me who you are.

341
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,350
You’re so insincere.

342
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,220
I’m sorry.

343
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,510
I’ve never run

344
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,930
out of money.

345
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,010
Sir,

346
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,050
I don’t understand.

347
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,300
You’re the seller

348
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,710
and we’re the buyers.

349
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,430
All we need to do

350
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,600
is to pay you for your medicine.

351
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,720
There’s a reason

352
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,720
for not telling you our identities.

353
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,100
Why bother asking?

354
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,800
You’re begging me for a favor now.

355
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,390
And this is my turf.

356
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,140
I make the rules.

357
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,050
Look,

358
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,890
I’ll double the money.

359
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:21,970
Is that alright?

360
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,220
What a waste of my time!

361
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,930
Let’s go back and listen to Bai Su’s opera.

362
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,260
Come on.

363
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,470
Qishao!

364
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,550
You want in?

365
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,760
Let me see

366
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,640
how you’re going

367
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,180
to break the miasma without my permission.

368
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:17,510
My men,

369
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,260
torch it.

370
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,050
You don’t want to expose your identity

371
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,100
and you have the gut to torch my valley.

372
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:29,050
I guess you’re not afraid of the consequences.

373
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,390
So,

374
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,180
you must be someone special.

375
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,100
It seems you’re a smart man.

376
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,010
So give us your consent to pass.

377
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:37,600
It seems

378
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,350
it’s true medicine isn’t what you want.

379
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:41,850
Though

380
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,720
I just took over the valley,

381
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,180
I gain some fame.

382
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,850
What do you want

383
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,640
from my valley?

384
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,760
The thing you want

385
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,300
is in the valley.

386
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,430
If you intend to burn the valley down,

387
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:55,800
go ahead.

388
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,180
I’m just worried

389
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,510
that the thing

390
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:02,140
will be burned along with the valley.

391
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,010
I’m already satisfied

392
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,430
that I can provide

393
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,050
for myself and my two servants.

394
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,350
The valley means nothing to me.

395
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,100
If you want to burn it down, do it.

396
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,180
Sir,

397
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,140
why would you do this?

398
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,930
We just want to pick some herbs.

399
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,800
I showed you my respect.

400
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:25,800
Don’t make me regret it.

401
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,350
Don’t take advantage of your number.

402
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,930
We said we wouldn’t sell medicine to you.

403
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:29,850
You want to burn the valley.

404
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,640
Go over my body.

405
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,510
Is what you’re trying to keep

406
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,800
more valuable

407
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,510
than her life?

408
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:01,760
What do you want?

409
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:02,850
To look for the herbs in your valley.

410
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:03,760
If we don’t find any,

411
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,180
I’ll leave you no trouble.

412
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,640
You don’t come to

413
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,220
and leave my valley

414
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,890
as you wish.

415
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,180
I know the rules.

416
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:30,850
Malefic Bird’s Tail?

417
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,180
One in every six decades.

418
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,510
You’re not at a loss

419
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,140
in the trade.

420
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:40,720
To cure poison with another.

421
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,050
It relieves all poisons.

422
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,090
And it’s preserved so well.

423
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,260
The poison girl has left anyway.

424
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,090
All right.

425
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,600
You can come for what you want.

426
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,090
Are you alright?

427
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:07,850
Yes.

428
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:27,760
We’ve searched everywhere

429
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:28,600
and couldn’t find the medicine.

430
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,180
No one is there?

431
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,760
We searched each corner.

432
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:32,470
No.

433
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:37,600
Sir,

434
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,220
sorry for the intrusion.

435
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,090
We didn’t find what we want,

436
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:43,890
but

437
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,050
you can keep

438
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:47,600
the Malefic Bird’s Tail.

439
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:48,890
Thanks.

440
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:49,760
See you.

441
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,640
Keep an eye on him.

442
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,180
Yunxi,

443
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,970
don’t blame your father.

444
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,090
Your father slapped you

445
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,100
because he loves you and is worried.

446
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:13,640
Madam,

447
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,100
you don’t have to comfort me.

448
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,890
My father never likes me.

449
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:19,470
He never cares about me.

450
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,140
And Mrs. Xu

451
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,010
believes

452
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,640
my mother took her place as the Mrs. Han.

453
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,930
Even Han Ruoxue bullies me.

454
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,680
If it were not for you and Yunyi,

455
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,140
I would have left a long time ago.

456
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,390
Silly girl,

457
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,090
what nonsense is that?

458
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,050
If you leave home,

459
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,300
what are you going to live on?

460
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,850
I learned medicine.

461
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:38,970
And I’m good with poisons.

462
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,640
I can live on saving people’s life.

463
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,180
Yunxi,

464
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,800
some poisons can save people’s life, too,

465
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:45,930
but

466
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,390
nowadays

467
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,100
medicine is the most acknowledged way.

468
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,510
Yunxi,

469
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,760
you can never have this idea again.

470
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,260
Yes, Yunxi.

471
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,010
Don’t leave us.

472
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,050
You have me.

473
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,140
By the way, Madam.

474
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,050
Madam,

475
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,220
I’ve found the Mythical Herb.

476
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,510
You found the rarest herb?

477
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,430
Yes.

478
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,600
Silly girl,

479
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,140
you’ve found the herb.

480
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,300
Why didn’t you tell your father just now?

481
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,090
He wouldn’t believe

482
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,350
my prescription would work anyway.

483
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:18,800
Don’t worry, Yunxi.

484
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:19,850
It will work.

485
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,390
I’ll follow your instruction strictly

486
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,510
and make the medicine for you.

487
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,010
Thank you, Madam.

488
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:36,430
Mother,

489
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,100
this time

490
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,350
I’ll cure my face.

491
00:24:59,010 --> 00:24:59,680
Tianxin,

492
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,390
I’m so surprised that Yunxi

493
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,260
relieves my poison on her own.

00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,180
doesn’t work at all.

498
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,470
Will the sores on my face

499
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,430
never be cured?

500
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:54,640
My lady,

501
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,600
the King’s edict for you.

502
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,050
Mr. Han wants you in the main hall to take it.

503
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,760
An edict?

504
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,760
His Majesty the King’s edict.

505
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:03,760
Lady Tianxin

506
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,510
once cured the Dowager

507
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,890
with her superb medicine.

508
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,220
To repay her kindness,

509
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,470
the Dowager promised her unborn daughter

510
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,930
to Prince Qin.

511
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:14,930
What?

512
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,010
Scar Face is going to marry Prince Qin?

513
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:17,890
Sir,

514
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,140
are you sure?

515
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,220

518
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:25,680
Kneel down.

519
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:32,220
Now Prince Qin has come of age.

520
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:35,510
Han Yunxi is also at the age of marriage.

521

I’m sorry,

but I’m Princess Qin by the King’s edict.

My name will be included in the imperial pedigree.

Scar Face, don’t be smug.

567

Prince Qin wouldn’t even

Who cares?

570

You’ll kneel down before me in the future,

She’s blatantly

humiliating Prince Qin and me.

598

Everyone knows Han’s daughter.

599

She’s a loser

She doesn’t deserve Feiye.

602

Nobody deserves Prince Qin.

I fancied Miss Baili.

They’re far behind Prince Qin in status.

But,

I’ll go to the palace myself

628
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,890
you’re weak since you were a little girl

If I don’t,

694
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,100
I kept the scripture

695
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,139
because I wanted to use it to keep my position

696
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,429
as the Crown Prince.

697
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,010
His Majesty transferred the Poison Master

698
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,300
so that others couldn’t steal it.

699
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:35,100
You’re the Crown Prince.

700
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:36,969
There’ll be forces taking your side

701
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:38,260
and working for you.

702
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:40,800
As long as you don’t make big mistakes,

703
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,219
His Majesty has no excuse to depose you.

704
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:47,969
But you lied to His Majesty.

705
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,010
If he finds out,

706
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:51,690
there’ll be consequences.

707
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:52,199
Uncle,

708
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,260
what’s done is done.

709
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,139
I regret it.

710
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:55,810
You have to work out a solution for me.

711
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,550
Uncle.

712
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,930
Calm down.

713
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,090
Tell me.

714
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,470
What’s the current situation with the manor?

715
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,720
Don’t worry, uncle.

716
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:06,550
Everyone who knows about it has been killed by me.

717
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,050
Good.

718
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,140
It’s an imperial manor where you studied

719
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,930
Poison Puppet.

720
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:17,180
They wouldn’t dare to speak out.

721
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,430
As long as you and I don’t say a word,

722
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,850
His Majesty won’t find out in any time soon.

723
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,430
But we have to find out

724
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,510
the identities of those robbers

725
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,550
before the news is out.

726
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:30,050
Do you have any lead?

727
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:30,850
Uncle,

728
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,350
according to my men,

729
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,550
their leader’s

730
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:36,010
swordcraft belongs to Beili royals.

731
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,390
Beili royals?

732
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:41,290
So uncle,

733
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,640
should we follow this lead

734
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,680
and crack the case?

735
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,640
The clue is too obvious.

736
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,180
I don’t think it’s that simple.

737
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,930
Are you saying

738
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,220
that they used Beili swordcraft on purpose?

739
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:01,850
Forget it.

740
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,550
No matter what the fact is,

741
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,720
we just follow this lead.

742
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,390
I’ll send my men

743
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:12,930
to look around the manor for any clues.

744
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,550
Let’s see

745
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,510
who has the gut to kidnap in the capital.

746
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:20,720
Sure.

747
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,470
I’m counting on you, uncle.

748
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,760
Please halt, generals.

749
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:32,680
How dare you!

750
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,800
You have guts to be so rude.

751
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,430
Don’t you know who he is?

752
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,350
How dare you

753
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,390
stop Prince Qin?

754
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:39,260
Generals,

755
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,180
it’s the palace rules.

756
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:43,350
No weapons are allowed in inner palace.

757
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,600
Please hand me your armors and swords.

758
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,090
We don’t mind taking off our armors.

759
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,140
Is His Highness also required to do so?

760
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,890
Your Highness, I don’t want trouble, but yes.

761
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:55,920
Before we went to war with Xiqiu,

762
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,220
His Majesty granted His Highness
to go to court with armor.

763
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,640
His Majesty said himself

764
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:01,800
that it was the supreme military honor.

765
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,430
You’re just an imperial guard.

766
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,050
If His Highness did as you told,

767
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,350
he would be challenging

768
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,890
the King’s authority.

769
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,880
-Step back.
-Yes.

770
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,720
I humbly ask Your Highness to wait for a moment.

771
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:15,930
Wait?

772
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,850
I don’t understand.

773
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:19,980
What does His Majesty mean?

774
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:21,510
Xifeng,

775
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,010
we’re in the court.

776
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,350
Mind your tongue.

777
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,090
Your Majesty,

778
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,180
Prince Qin is waiting outside.

779
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,640
This is a proposal

780
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:02,100
from the Assistant Minister
of the Ministry of Revenue, An Zhonggu.

781
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,890
He accused that the war with Xiqiu

782
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,300
took a toll on the people

783
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,100
and led to famine

784
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,550
in the war zone

785
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:12,010
where people ate the kids to survive.

786
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,180
It grieves me so.

787
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:17,010
Your Majesty,

788
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,800
I’m in charge of the household register

789
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:22,470
and taxation of the thirteen border counties.

790
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:25,100
Due to years of war with Beili

791
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,510
and Xiqiu,

792
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,720
the headcount drops

793
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:29,260
and tax revenue plummets.

794
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,090
The people are suffering a great deal.

795
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,800
Mr. An is right.

796
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,300
Your Majesty,

797
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:40,800
I’m worried about the border war.

798
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:42,100
Days ago,

799
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,640
I couldn’t sleep at night

800
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:48,050
due to the worry about the war.

801
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:50,220
And I overheard a servant crying.

802
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,600
When I asked him,

803
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,180
he answered he was from the border.

804
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,550
To escape from the war…

805
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:00,640
Prince Qin has to wait.

806
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:01,640
Tell the guard

807
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,430
don’t let him in.

808
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,730
They’re robbed.

809
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:04,280
Go.

810
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,220
There was no salvation along the journey.

811
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:08,010
In the end, lots of people died

812
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,550
of starvation and illnesses.

813
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,220
How poor!

814
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,680
What are you whispering?

815
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,430
Why not say it out loud so we all can hear?

816
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,890
Does His Majesty refuse to receive us?

817
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,090
Xifeng!

818
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:44,680
He’s just a messenger.

819
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,890
Yes, my lord.

820
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,220
I don’t want trouble.

821
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:54,930
Your Highness,

822
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,930
the Assistant Minister of
the Ministry of Revenue accused

823
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,890
that the war took a toll on the state.

824
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,180
His Majesty is mourning.

825
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,390
I’m afraid

826
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,800
he can’t receive Your Highness today.

827
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:04,760
Absurd!

828
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:05,890
Xifeng!

829
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,010
Before the war,

830
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,720
His Highness proposed

831
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,390
to sign the peace treaty with Xiqiu
instead of going to war.

832
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,260
But the ministers opposed to it.

833
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,680
His Highness took the mission at critical time.

834
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,850
To win this war,

835
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,760
he was almost killed in the battlefield.

836
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,430
Instead of being rewarded for his feat,

837
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,300
His Majesty is about to charge us with a crime?

838
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:26,800
Xifeng!

839
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:28,090
Your Highness,

840
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,010
it’s unacceptable.

841
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,090
Stand down.

842
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,430
Bring a message to His Majesty.

843
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:39,430
I remove my armor and ask for his mercy.

844
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,220
If His Majesty doesn’t receive us,

845
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,010
I’ll kneel down in the Imperial Ancestral Temple.

846
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:47,970
Yes.

847
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,010
Your Highness,

848
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,470
you can’t remove your armor.

849
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,640
No, Your Highness.

850
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:58,050
It’s a defiance

851
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,430
to His Majesty’s honor.

852
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,350
You can’t remove your armor.

853
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,680
If I don’t,

854
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,180
I won’t be able to meet His Majesty.

855
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:09,510
But there’s something

856
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,470
I have to say to His Majesty in person.
