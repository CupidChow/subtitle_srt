00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,020
Episode 32

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:04,780
Sir.

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,450
Aren’t you afraid

5
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,140
that Poison Beast hurts Han Yunxi?

6
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,410
That depends on

7
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,280
if she’s my daughter.

8
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:14,360
Stop.

9
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,780
Now it’s too late

10
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:17,950
to save her.

11
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,860
Stay here

12
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,080
and hide yourself.

13
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:25,990
Yes.

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:39,740
This way!

15
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,180
That is Poison Beast.

16
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:13,110
Yunxi!

17
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:14,610
Your Highness.

18
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:15,940
Don’t come over for now.

19
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:17,610
Seems that

20
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,280
it won’t hurt me.

21
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,570
Catch it.

22
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,360
Yes.

23
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,070
Yunxi!

24
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,070
Yunxi!

25
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,030
Yunxi!

26
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,130
You two, guard here.

27
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:47,990
-Yes.
-Yes.

28
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,150
Stop!

29
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,450
Don’t run!

30
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,820
Stop!

31
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,910
I can’t run anymore.

32
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,110
Alright.

33
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,450
Let’s talk.

34
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,950
I need your blood.

35
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,940
Crown Prince got poisoned.

36
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,270
It concerns many lives.

37
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,020
Only your blood can save him.

38
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,250
As long as he is saved,

39
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,140
many innocent people

40
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,470
won’t lose their lives.

41
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,250
Just give me a little bit.

42
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,030
Alright?

43
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,110
You

44
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,880
liked drinking my blood just now, right?

45
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,570
Do you want more?

46
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:50,820
Come.

47
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:19,420
You...

48
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,270
Are you losing consciousness?

49
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,320
You...

50
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,820
You’re so timid, aren’t you?

51
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,530
It’s a trap!

52
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,700
All your moves are

53
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,820
under Prince Qin’s

54
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,650
control.

55
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,320
Ordered by Prince Qin,

56
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:51,980
we’ve been waiting here

57
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,110
for long.

58
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,090
We’re captured by you.

59
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:55,930
You may kill us

60
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:56,990
as you please.

61
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,780
Think about it.

62
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,380
You come for Poison Beast

63
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,650
for His Majesty.

64
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,210
Your purpose is different

65
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,670
from the Second Prince’s.

66
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,540
He took advantage of you.

67
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,400
What will he do next?

68
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,530
Silence you.

69
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:16,820
Funny.

70
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,390
-Don’t!
-Don’t!

71
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,320
Don’t!

72
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:22,900
Dian!

73
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,780
The Second Prince is

74
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,990
so vicious.

75
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,860
Rest assured.

76
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,140
Prince Qin

77
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,470
doesn’t want you to die.

78
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,500
As long as you

79
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,130
stay in this room

80
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,130
until tomorrow morning,

81
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,570
I promise you’ll be safe.

82
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:38,190
How can I trust you?

83
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,190
Believe it

84
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,490
or not.

85
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,320
It’s all up to you.

86
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,110
But

87
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,420
even if you go get

88
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,100
Poison Beast tomorrow morning,

89
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,780
it’ll still be too late to save Crown Prince.

90
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,409
Isn’t Prince Qin afraid

91
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:56,940
to be blamed by His Majesty?

92
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,800
Good question.

93
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,210
That’s why we will

94
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,280
keep you alive,

95
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,090
for you will tell His Majesty

96
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,070
the truth

97
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,590
and prove Prince Qin’s innocence.

98
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,890
Prince Qin wants to pass the buck

99
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,190
to the Second Prince?

100
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,450
Since he is unkind,

101
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,610
we don’t have to be kind to him.

102
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:16,740
OK.

103
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,520
What’s the matter?

104
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,570
Leave.

105
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,200
Yes.

106
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,760
Your Highness.

107
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,360
A man came out of the inn

108
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,670
and got killed by us.

109
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,500
The other two didn’t come out.

110
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,570
I think they’ve been killed by Prince Qin.

111
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,530
Good.

112
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,600
Watch them over more closely.

113
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,320
Yes.

114
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,780
You geezer.

115
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,190
You are really here!

116
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:11,940
Let me ask you.

117
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,660
Why did you trick your way out?

118
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,900
Those who wanted me

119
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,490
were all ambitious

120
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,410
and greedy.

121
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,490
Of course I fled.

122
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,820
Nonsense.

123
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,330
My husband wanted you

124
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,950
to cure Poison Gu in his body.

125
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,690
Poison Gu?

126
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:25,240
Yes.

127
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,650
Prince Qin was

128
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,220
turned into a Poison Puppet by you back then.

129
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,690
Only you can cure him

130
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,090
and redeem yourself now.

131
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,200
Prince Qin is a Poison Puppet?

132
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:33,950
Yes.

133
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,820
Tell me the cure now.

134
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,820
Poison Puppet is incurable.

135
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,990
How come?

136
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,530
You developed Poison Puppet.

137
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,130
You must have a way to cure it.

138
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,360
Tell me, alright?

139
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,820
As long as he can be saved,

140
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,409
we can try

141
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:54,450
any ways.

142
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,610
I’ll have a try.

143
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,150
Maybe there’s a way.

144
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,220
Since you can’t cure the poison,

145
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:03,780
we don’t have to

146
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,150
keep you alive.

147
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,530
So many of my family,

148
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,700
relatives,

149
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,070
brothers,

150
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,030
died all because of you.

151
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,890
I’ll send you to hell

152
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,530
to keep them company.

153
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,450
Prince Qin.

154
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,510
You can’t kill him.

155
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,740
You’re Poison Master’s man!

156
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,600
Your Highness.

157
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,280
Princess Qin is

158
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,110
my leader’s daughter.

159
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,320
What?

160
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,440
You’re my biological father?

161
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,820
Your mother is Lady Tianxin.

162
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,400
She was my wife.

163
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,700
You share the same bloodline

164
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,700
as mine.

165
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,190
That’s why Poison Beast

166
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,650
didn’t hurt you.

167
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,200
Only the blood of my bloodline

168
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,280
can subdue Poison Beast.

169
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,060
The devil who made His Highness a Poison Puppet

170
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,190
and suffer to now

171
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,440
due to the heavy debt of blood,

172
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,860
is my biological father!

173
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,110
No.

174
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,740
No way.

175
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,650
But...

176
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,930
If it’s true...

177
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:33,950
What’s going on?

178
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:35,820
Poison Girl.

179
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,950
Who’s bullying you?

180
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,400
Long Feiye, you again.

181
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,440
Your Highness.

182
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,620
He must have a way to save you.

183
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,240
Give me some more time.

184
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,140
I’ll take him to Yaogui Valley

185
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,800
and work on the cure together.

186
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,700
If we fail,

187
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,360
you may kill him.

188
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,140
This is the cure for Crown Prince.

189
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,190
Go save him

190
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,560
with Physician Gu now.

191
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,900
The Han family also counts on you.

192
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,700
Qishao.

193
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,810
Please take that geezer

194
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:35,810
to Yaogui Valley.

195
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,700
My pleasure.

196
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,170
Physician Gu.

197
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,240
Clock is ticking.

198
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,510
You may hit the road.

199
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,070
Sir.

200
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,320
Prince Qin.

201
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,860
Crown Prince is at stake.

202
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,580
We may go back right away.

203
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,430
If you don’t want to die,

204
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,430
go to Yaogui Valley with me.

205
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,110
Let’s go.

206
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,130
Leaving from the secret passage

207
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,030
is safer.

208
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,110
I know.

209
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,240
That’s where we came from.

210
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,450
Prince Qin.

211
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,250
Physician Gu.

212
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,050
I come to help Prince Qin

213
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,180
catch Poison Beast.

214
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,220
By the way,

215
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,900
have you seen Miss Mingxiang?

216
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,810
She got poisoned,

217
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:12,670
still in a coma.

218
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,410
We have

219
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,360
taken her out.

220
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,790
We’re gonna save Crown Prince.

221
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,130
Take Mingxiang back to my mansion

222
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,190
when she wakes up.

223
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,030
Yes.

224
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,190
I’ve been baffled

225
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,150
by something.

226
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,650
Prince Qin promised my father

227
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:34,890
to catch Poison Beast timely

228
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,240
for Long Tianmo.

229
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,050
How come he still stays

230
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,380
in the inn rather than going to Heaven Pit?

231
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,070
What is he

232
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,240
up to?

233
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:46,930
Dark Guards we deployed

234
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,490
on the only way to Heaven Pit

235
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,180
didn’t find Prince Qin’s men

236
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,380
coming to Heaven Pit.

237
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,950
Maybe Prince Qin

238
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,430
is up to something else.

239
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,140
Going to Heaven Pit from here

240
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,280
takes one day.

241
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,880
Returning to capital takes another.

242
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,320
Prince Qin.

243
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,200
I can’t believe you’re so calm.

244
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,250
Even Prince Qin is

245
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,370
almighty

246
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,650
like a God,

247
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,090
I don’t think

248
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,110
he’s faster than the Grim Reaper.

249
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,110
In this game,

250
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,030
not only Long Tianmo will die,

251
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,780
but Prince Qin will also get killed.

252
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,110
Hit the road to the capital.

253
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:29,900
Yes.

254
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,700
Finally,

255
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,050
I don’t have to stay

256
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,150
with that lass.

257
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,650
Tang Li.

258
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,130
What did you say?

259
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,110
Say it again.

260
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,260
Nothing. Nothing.

261
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,320
Hey, stop arguing.

262
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,490
We got the news

263
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,220
that His Highness’s gotten out of Heaven Pit.

264
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,020
He’ll arrive tomorrow morning.

265
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,030
Great.

266
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,600
My respects, Miss Mingxiang.

267
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,810
You’ve been

268
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,270
in a coma for ten days here.

269
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,490
Sorry, I was

270
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,950
too incapable to help you.

271
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,620
Heaven Pit is full of traps.

272
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,570
Luckily, Prince Qin

273
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,030
and Princess came timely,

274
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,450
settled the trap

275
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,070
and found you.

276
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,450
Han Yunxi?

277
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,290
Where is Feiye?

278
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,030
Miss.

279
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:22,970
His Highness ordered me

280
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,230
to look after you here.

281
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,370
He went back first

282
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,570
to save Crown Prince.

283
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,360
He went back?

284
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,400
Looks like

285
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,320
I am always

286
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,290
the least important one in his heart.

287
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,030
Miss.

288
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,290
His Highness is worried about

289
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,490
Crown Prince’s life.

290
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,010
That’s more important now.

291
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,610
You don’t have to justify it.

292
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,940
He must have been incited by that Han Yunxi.

293
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,860
Tell me the details.

294
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,200
What exactly happened

295
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,070
during this period?

296
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,570
Yunxi, I...

297
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,030
Since I learned

298
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:14,820
Han Cong’an isn’t

299
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,200
my biological father,

300
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,360
I’ve been thinking

301
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,380
who my biological father is.

302
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,900
Is he still alive?

303
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,190
If we meet again,

304
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,570
will we embrace and cry?

305
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,820
Or will I swear at him

306
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,030
for leaving mother and me cruelly?

307
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,030
I’ve never ever thought

308
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,280
we’d meet like this.

309
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,820
I’m unhappy.

310
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,040
I’m not angry, either.

311
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,360
I just wish

312
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,150
it’d be a dream.

313
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,070
When I woke up,

314
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,620
I’d still be in Pavilion of Leisure.

315
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,030
Yunxi, I’m sorry.

316
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,240
I’m not your daughter.

317
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,460
I don’t have such a cruel father.

318
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,200
Why did you leave my mother back then?

319
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,780
Why did you cruelly

320
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,690
test Poison Puppet

321
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,150
on the Qinxi royal family?

322
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,500
I don’t have such a cruel father.

323
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,700
Back then

324
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,770
Qinxi’s general, Long Zhenfei,

325
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,260
commanded massive military force,

326
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,920
collaborated with the nobles

327
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,570
to revolt.

328
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,820
It happened abruptly.

329
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,820
Qinxi resisted hastily,

330
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,650
but to no avail.

331
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,590
Qinxi was annihilated.

332
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,950
Long Zhenfei took the throne,

333
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,700
founded State Tianning.

334
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,010
By the cost of humans’ longevity,

335
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,660
Poison Gu can boost their physical power.

336
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,770
Those who are poisoned by Gu

337
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:43,890
are as fast as lightning

338
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,090
with great strength.

339
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,250
The legend has that

340
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,610
Dynasty Qinxi unified the world

341
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,290
by using the armies

342
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,570
of Poison Puppets secretly.

343
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:52,610
These armies

344
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,580
are unstoppable

345
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,770
and invincible.

346
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:55,940
The world can be unified

347
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,530
just in a few days.

348
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,400
Good.

349
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,000
The development of Poison Puppet

350
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,170
is solely on you.

351
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,569
The poisons of your sect

352
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:06,780
are well-known.

353
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,190
They are just toxins, though.

354
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:12,319
If you can develop Poison Puppet,

355
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,560
you’ll make a major breakthrough

356
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,609
in poison science.

357
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:19,200
In the poison field,

358
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,530
a new gate will be opened.

359
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,859
Why not think about it?

360
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,930
I have one condition.

361
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:35,610
Say it.

362
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,280
You will provide the materials.

363
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:39,650
Of course.

364
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,760
More than that,

365
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,950
I’ve even built the plant,

366
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,420
just waiting for you to show your stuff.

367
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,570
It smells so good.

368
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,750
You made so many goodies today.

369
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,570
Other than you,

370
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,230
I desire nothing else in this life.

371
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:58,990
But

372
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,490
those in the prison

373
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,030
face the crisis every day

374
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,750
to be made into a Poison Puppet,

375
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,740
a killing machine.

376
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,700
All of this

377
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,700
is being done

378
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,190
by my husband.

379
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,070
Tianxin.

380
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,080
The prisoners will die

381
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,280
sooner or later.

382
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,440
Rather than die worthlessly,

383
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,530
they can still live

384
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,730
under my help.

385
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,450
Death isn’t a big deal,

386
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:23,610
yet you disregard the lives,

387
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,370
making so many innocent people

388
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,860
suffer to death

389
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,610
to make breakthroughs

390
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,280
in your poison science.

391
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,400
Yanqing.

392
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,090
Stop making Poison Puppets.

393
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,070
Alright?

394
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,860
Not for others,

395
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,110
just for me,

396
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,070
for our to-be-born baby,

397
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,820
do something good, alright?

398
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,110
Enough.

399
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,450
Tianxin.

400
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,990
Don’t bring it up again.

401
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,570
Baby.

402
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,320
Rest assured.

403
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,950
I’ll never let you know

404
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,290
you have such a

405
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,820
sinful father.

406
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,240
Go away.

407
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,830
I’m leaving.

408
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,640
I will never come back.

409
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,280
I wonder

410
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,860
if you still remember

411
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,370
our encounter

412
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,280
in Lotus Town back then.

413
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,950
You settled the bubonic plague

414
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:47,490
effortlessly

415
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,150
which had baffled me for days.

416
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,290
You saved

417
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,740
all the people there.

418
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,990
You ever said

419
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,690
people all thought

420
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,900
poison was harmful,

421
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,280
yet poison could also save lives.

422
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,360
But

423
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,450
since sometime,

424
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,190
you’ve changed.

425
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,300
You become obstinate

426
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,400
and cold-hearted,

427
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,450
desperate to get what you want.

428
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,530
You’re no longer

429
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:14,700
that kind Yanqing.

430
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,690
I’m no longer that Tianxin

431
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,200
who follows you.

432
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,320
Tianxin!

433
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,190
Tianxin!

434
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,030
Tianxin!

435
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,570
Tianxin!

436
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,950
Tianxin!

437
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,700
Tianxin!

438
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,280
Tianxin!

439
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,360
Tianxin! Come back!

440
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,110
Tianxin!

441
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,890
How do you dare

442
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:15,740
to quit

443
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,670
the development of Poison Puppet?

444
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,900
Put him into dungeon.

445
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,050
Don’t let him out

446
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,310
until he sobers up and thinks it through.

447
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:25,950
Yes.

448
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,530
Since then,

449
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,140
I had been imprisoned by Long Aotian,

450
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,650
who became King Tianhui

451
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,740
later.

452
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,170
The Poison Sect

453
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,860
had no leader at that time,

454
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,690
being attacked jointly

455
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:43,690
by hostile sects.

456
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,140
Poison Sect was eliminated.

457
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:45,810
Our Shadow family

458
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:47,280
was almost wiped out.

459
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,400
What about Gu Chengze?

460
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,600
I sent him to look for your mother,

461
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,900
but she deliberately hid her identity.

462
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,530
Chengze

463
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,070
failed to find her.

464
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,650
Then the Sect got attacked.

465
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,110
Chengze had to go back to help,

466
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,400
yet it was useless.

467
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,820
Eventually,

468
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,110
he died in the attack.

469
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,780
Gu Beiyue is

470
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,360
Gu Chengze’s son.

471
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,010
He was the sole survivor

472
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:17,280
of the Shadow family.

473
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,530
Over these years,

474
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,490
he’s been looking for

475
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,110
your mother and me.

476
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,190
My mother had left.

477
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,360
How could she save Long Feiye?

478
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,780
That happened

479
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,990
four years later.

480
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,200
I thought

481
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,700
I’d live in decadence.

482
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,320
Unexpectedly,

483
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,610
your mother

484
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,570
showed up again.

485
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,030
Come. Drink.

486
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,400
Drink.

487
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,400
Bai Yanqing.

488
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,300
What’s wrong with you again?

489
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,400
Alright.

490
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,800
Stop shouting.

491
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,790
Bai Yanqing.

492
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,320
Are you sober?

493
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,400
I’m not drinking. I’m not.

494
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,860
How come you are here?

495
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,570
Luckily, he’s still breathing.

496
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,250
Why do you even

497
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,410
test on kids?

498
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,190
I...

499
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,860
Go untie him.

500
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,070
Where is the key?

501
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,600
The key is on the guard at the door.

502
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,360
What are you doing?

503
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,930
He is poisoned.

504
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,190
Where’s the antidote?

505
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,200
No.

506
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,530
My poison

507
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,530
has no cures.

508
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,320
You are so vicious.

509
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,110
I...

510
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,150
Take it easy, boy.

511
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,450
I have a pill.

512
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,290
Have it.

513
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,570
It can ease your pain.

514
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,900
Do you feel better?

515
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,350
How did you get imprisoned?

516
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,400
I treated the empress.

517
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,370
She found out

518
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,500
I’m good at poisons.

519
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,650
To fawn on His Majesty,

520
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:32,810
she told him that

521
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:35,010
and forced me to develop Poison Puppet.

522
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,320
These devils!

523
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,650
I also heard that

524
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,690
the development of Poison Puppet

525
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,370
made no progress over these years.

526
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:43,690
They meant to find

527
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:45,110
a gang of poison masters.

528
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,490
They’re indeed persistent.

529
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,640
Poison Master.

530
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,820
You really didn’t disappoint me.

531
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:15,890
Leave.

532
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:16,450
Yes.

533
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,130
You really want to

534
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,200
go on like this?

535
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,030
Yanqing.

536
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,740
You saw how powerful

537
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,000
the Poison Puppet was.

538
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,990
Moreover, this is just a kid.

539
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,190
Think about it.

540
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,570
Once you make it,

541
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,330
there will be wars constantly in the world.

542
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,460
People will suffer.

543
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,950
We’re locked up here.

544
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,160
Unless we run away,

545
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,280
they will

546
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,370
find it out

547
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,810
sooner or later.

548
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,320
If there were a way out,

549
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,530
I wouldn’t have been here

550
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:49,400
for so long.

551
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,970
Believe me.

552
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:51,820
I have an idea.

553
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,700
When we get out,

554
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:54,970
let’s get our daughter

555
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,030
from the capital.

556
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,530
Then the three of us can

557
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,330
lead a secluded life somewhere.

558
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,510
What did you say?

559
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,570
We have a daughter?

560
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,400
I have a daughter?

561
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,530
Yes.

562
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,150
I learnt that

563
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,860
I have a daughter.

564
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,730
I was

565
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,070
extremely happy.

566
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,020
I kept asking your mother

567
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,350
about the condition

568
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,820
of our daughter,

569
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,070
whether she took after her or me.

570
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,970
I couldn’t help imagining

571
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,240
how you looked like.

572
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,990
Your look

573
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,890
is exactly what I imagined

574
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,030
back then.

575
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,300
You’re quite look like your mother.

576
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,070
Later

577
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,700
your mother told me

578
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,320
she pretended to marry the physician

579
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,610
who saved her

580
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,650
so that you could enjoy

581
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,280
a normal family life.

582
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,820
At that moment,

583
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,280
I determined

584
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,740
to run away with your mother

585
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,490
and pick you up.

586
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,110
Then the three of us

587
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,110
would live a happy life.

588
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,610
Then

589
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,140
we started making a plan to run away.

590
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,860
We agreed that

591
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,210
until we got out

592
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,530
of control by Long Aotian,

593
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:11,330
we wouldn’t leak out

594
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,610
our relationship,

595
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,320
and wouldn’t let others know

596
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,780
we had a daughter.

597
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,670
Otherwise, if the plan failed,

598
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,530
you’d be in danger.

599
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,610
And then?

600
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,070
Then we decided to

601
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,060
take away all the prisoners.

602
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,570
I’m gonna save that kid.

603
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:36,780
You go to save others.

604
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,380
-Let’s gather outside.
-OK.

605
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,360
Be very careful.

606
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,530
Don’t worry.

607
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,490
Tianxin!

608
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,070
Tianxin!

609
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,200
Tianxin!

610
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,530
Your mother died.

611
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,360
I got crazy,

612
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,990
locked up by Long Aotian.

613
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,360
You know the things

614
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,950
after that.

615
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,070
It’s all my fault that I was so selfish

616
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,450
to try to

617
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:46,650
make breakthroughs in my poison skills

618
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,260
and make a terrible mistake.

619
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,720
Not only did my wife and clansmen get killed,

620
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,030
but also many innocents died.

621
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,780
What’s done is done.

622
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,800
What’s the use of regretting?

623
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,030
You are right.

624
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,400
Even

625
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,780
my death

626
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,330
cannot redeem

627
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,700
my sins.

628
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,280
Luckily,

629
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,780
heaven blesses me

630
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,130
and gives me

631
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:12,740
the chance

632
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,150
to see my daughter.

633
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,530
Yunxi.

634
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,450
I owe you so much.

635
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,070
I hope you...

636
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,650
Stop talking

637
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:22,850
these useless words.

638
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,100
If you really feel sorry,

639
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,060
make the cure for Poison Puppet

640
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,190
as soon as possible.

641
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,700
I hope you use poison to save lives,

642
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,780
not to harm people.

643
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,930
Your Majesty.

644
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,190
I just got the news

645
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,380
that Prince Qin hasn’t arrived at Heaven Pit yet.

646
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,190
I’m afraid

647
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,660
it’ll be too late to save Crown Prince.

648
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,050
Who delayed it?

649
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,070
Your Majesty.

650
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,730
The informant reported that

651
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:10,930
it’s the Second Prince’s men

652
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,950
who desperately stopped him.

653
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,450
How bold!

654
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,280
He had nerve to do that!

655
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,300
Calm down, Your Majesty.

656
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,110
Feiye!

657
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,190
Feiye!

658
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,320
Where’s Yunxi?

659
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,400
Where’s Yunxi, Feiye?

660
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:34,780
Feiye.

661
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,330
Did you

662
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,900
fall out with Yunxi again?

663
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,180
Han Yunxi is Poison Master’s daughter.

664
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,070
How come?

665
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,610
Well... Feiye.

666
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,010
Yunxi couldn’t choose

667
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,130
her own father.

668
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,490
It’s not her fault.

669
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:57,740
You should blame...

670
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,030
This thing is huge.

671
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,530
Do not leak it out.

672
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,450
Sure.

673
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,690
I’ve got Poison Beast’s

674
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:07,650
blood.

675
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,260
Hurry and go back to the mansion.

676
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:10,950
OK.

677
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,610
Got it.

678
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,240
Your Highness.

679
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,140
Since we’ve found Poison Master.

680
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,670
Why don’t you take him back?

681
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:27,860
Xifeng.

682
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,350
Poison Gu is incurable.

683
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,240
My days are numbered.

684
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,820
We have to hurry.

685
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,200
We’ll find a way.

686
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,630
We definitely will.

687
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,120
Your Highness.

688
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,240
Her Highness is adept at poisons.

689
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,570
She won’t ignore it.

690
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,600
Don’t give up on yourself.

691
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,280
I’m going to

692
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,470
catch up with Gu Beiyue.

693
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:37,889
It was so hard

694
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:38,730
for Feiye and Yunxi

695
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:40,739
to be together.

696
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,500
Why did Poison Master interfere suddenly?

697
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,650
This time

698
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:46,929
Feiye and Han Yunxi

699
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:48,030
are done.

700
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,400
I don’t think so.

701
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,100
She’s Poison Master’s daughter.

702
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,810
They have an unforgivable blood feud.

703
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:55,370
They can’t be

704
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,400
with each other.

705
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,090
The feud was made by Poison Master.

706
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,500
It has nothing to do with Yunxi.

707
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,320
Stop it.

708
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,570
It’s not time

709
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,030
for you to argue.

710
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,240
Xifeng.

711
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,710
What exactly happened?

712
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,820
It’s not about

713
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,890
whether His Highness can

714
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:12,210
can still be with Princess.

715
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,490
What’s the problem then?

716
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:14,200
It...

717
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,780
Don’t let anyone know

718
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,110
my poison is incurable.

719
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,240
What is it?

720
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,490
Behave yourselves

721
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,410
afterwards.

722
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,150
Alright?

723
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,170
Don’t worry

724
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,300
His Highness again,

725
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,110
especially you.

726
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,380
His Highness repeatedly asked you

727
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,210
to practice martial arts

728
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:35,280
and study harder.

729
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,660
You never listen.

730
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,320
What’s wrong with him?

731
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,190
I’m going back to the palace

732
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,070
before Long Tianmo dies.

733
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,070
I’d like to see

734
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,990
how my beloved brother

735
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,610
will suffer and die.

736
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,210
Well, how to deal with

737
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:09,530
Jun Yizheng?

738
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,360
Sure.

739
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,100
My respects, Your Highness.

740
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,030
Mother.

741
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,070
Tianqing.

742
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,780
I come to see you, mother.

743
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,030
Tianqing!

744
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,200
Tianqing!

745
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,570
Mother.

746
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:25,450
It’s you, Tianqing!

747
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,110
Mother.

748
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,490
You come to see me.

749
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,890
I thought I’d never

750
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:33,150
see you again.

751
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,110
Mother.

752
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,940
Your father didn’t allow

753
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,050
anyone

754
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:38,010
to see me, did he?

755
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:39,140
Rest assured, mother.

756
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,650
I’ve handled everything.

757
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,530
I have many men here.

758
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,340
Don’t worry, mother.

759
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,530
That’s good.

760
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,780
That’s good.

761
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,030
Mother.

762
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,530
I’m sorry.

763
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,280
For so many years,

764
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:56,930
you’ve done

765
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:57,990
so much for me.

766
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,710
You exonerated me of the guilt,

767
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,530
and bear it alone.

768
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:04,860
I...

769
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,000
Mother, rest assured.

770
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,280
I can definitely find a way

771
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,950
to save you out of my father.

772
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,400
Since I

773
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,320
fell from grace,

774
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,820
I’ve been worried

775
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:22,030
that you could be implicated.

776
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,280
Now I know you’re well.

777
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,900
I’m relieved.

778
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:28,820
Mother.

779
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,900
As for your father,

780
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,950
I’m afraid

781
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,780
he’ll never forgive me.

782
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:38,610
Mother.

783
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,380
Pull yourself together.

784
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,290
Father didn’t deprive

785
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,490
your title.

786
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,700
Also, Crown Prince Long Tianmo

787
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,190
may not live to tomorrow.

788
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,810
By then, father

789
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:49,010
only has me to rely on.

790
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,280
I can surely find a way

791
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,360
to save you.

792
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:57,820
Tianqing.

793
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,240
You don’t need to comfort me.

794
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,350
I dare not deceive you, mother.

795
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,420
Long Tianmo is badly poisoned.

796
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,290
Father ordered my uncle Prince Qin

797
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:07,250
to catch Poison Beast

798
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,190
for the cure.

799
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,490
I’ve stopped him.

800
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,730
He failed his mission,

801
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,330
and is pleading with father.

802
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:15,990
Mother.

803
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,620
Physician has said that

804
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,990
without the cure,

805
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,030
Long Tianmo

806
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,030
can’t live to see tomorrow.

807
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,700
Are you sure?

808
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,360
I’ve been waiting

809
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,320
and suffering for so long

810
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:35,200
for the empress’s death.

811
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,810
I tried so hard

812
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:38,900
and climbed to the top in the harem.

813
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,610
Now

814
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,700
his son is about to

815
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,030
go to hell and keep her company.

816
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,860
Even

817
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,030
the heaven

818
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,990
is helping me, isn’t it?

819
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,320
When the day comes,

820
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,570
I won’t let off

821
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,110
that shrew Qingge.

822
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:02,820
Mother.

823
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,450
I also found

824
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:05,650
a huge secret.

825
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,990
I’m afraid he can’t make it tonight.

826
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,410
Haven’t Long Feiye and Han Yunxi

827
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,650
come back?

828
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,060
Your Majesty.

829
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,990
Should we send men to receive them?

830
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,730
It doesn’t matter if they die.

831
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:25,360
But Crown Prince can’t wait.

832
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,780
Feiye is resourceful

833
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,140
and highly skilled in martial arts.

834
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,840
I’m sure he’ll arrive in time.

835
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:36,110
Prince Qin comes!

836
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,380
My respects, Prince Qin.

837
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,840
Where is Han Yunxi?

838
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,260
Why doesn’t she come?

839
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,650
She got hurt

840
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,750
by Poison Beast,

841
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,820
being treated in Yaogui Valley.

842
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,180
I specially invite Physician Gu

843
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,480
to treat Crown Prince.

844
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:52,810
Alright.

845
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:55,270
Physician Gu, please examine Crown Prince.

846
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,240
Mother.

847
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,190
I just told you

848
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,340
Feiye is brave and resourceful.

849
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,360
Nothing would go wrong.

850
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,600
I’m flattered, Your Majesty.

851
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,070
This is what I should do.

852
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,490
Feiye.

853
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,190
You are

854
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,450
indeed loyal to me.

855
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,810
You’ve been

856
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:38,320
taking care of me.

857
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:39,780
Of course

858
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,110
I should pay you back for your kindness.
