Episode 5

3
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:14,510
Come out!

4
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:31,890
Don’t hide.

5
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,470
I saw you.

6
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,080
Your Highness,

7
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,130
everyone in the mansion knows

8
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,120
I was kicked out of you chamber.

9
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,190
Mother hates my family background

10
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,180
and the servants scorn me.

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,680
It looks like I’m not your wife.

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,660
Your Highness,

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,550
I’m afraid,

14
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,260
without you protecting me,

15
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:53,920
mother will

16
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,880
throw me out of here tomorrow!

17
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,930
How dare you!

18
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:00,830
Your Highness,

19
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,470
could you be nicer to me?

20
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,850
So

21
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,300
I could survive in the mansion.

22
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,720
Your Highness.

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,100
Out!

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,760
Your Highness.

25
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,760
I made you the medicine.

26
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,600
I can make better medicine.

27
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,390
I can

28
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,090
make poisons and cures.

29
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,220
I can give advice,

30
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,360
and a helping hand.

31
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:36,720
How about

32
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,350
let’s make a deal.

33
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,759
What can you offer?

34
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:42,680
I…

35
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,550
I cure poisons.

36
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,650
I’m a physician.

37
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,600
I’ve plenty of physicians in the mansion.

38
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,420
Who do you think you are?

39
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,390
I know I’m weak.

40
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,850
I’m nobody to you.

41
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,680
But you’ll need me someday.

42
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,350
Xifeng!

43
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,320
Alright! Alright!

44
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,390
I’ll walk myself.

45
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,600
Ice cake!

46
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:25,890
So arrogant!

47
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,010
I’ve plenty of physicians!

48
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,760
You’ll know who I am.

49
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,100
He doesn’t allow me to go close.

50
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,350
How could I check the sign?

51
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:44,800
Anyway,

52
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,740
something’s sure to turn up.

53
00:02:48,260 --> 00:03:04,460
[Moral Refinement]

54
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,300
Qishao,

55
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,350
I didn’t expect Long Feiye

56
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,640
got healed in a few days.

57
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,010
In his

58
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,720
last visit to the valley,

59
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:58,890
I noticed

60
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,600
he had good curers.

61
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,010
But his curers

62
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,790
just couldn’t go through

63
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,600
my poisonous miasma.

64
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,260
Maybe

65
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:11,720
he’s got

66
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,390
a superb poisoner.

67
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,510
Whatever.

68
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,720
Your plan just hit the mark.

69
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,140
And he

70
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,220
must believe the crown prince

71
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,890
schemed the murders.

72
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,390
Your Highness,

73
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,300
did you wear this?

74
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,260
I had sores on my face,

75
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,430
so I wore veils.

76
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,800
I threw them away.

77
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,510
Perhaps I didn’t notice this one

78
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,970
and put it with my dresses.

79
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,100
May I throw it away?

80
00:03:59,260 --> 00:03:59,970
No, no.

81
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:00,890
I’ll do it.

82
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,140
Well,

83
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,100
may I clean up your stuff?

84
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,350
No, no.

85
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,470
Not many of them.

86
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,220
I’ll do it.

87
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,680
Leave me, please.

88
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:11,890
Go.

89
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:12,510
But…

90
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,680
-Go, go.
-Well…

91
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,050
Your Highness…

92
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,260
I haven’t done here.

93
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,010
I can manage.

94
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,700
You have plenty of works. Go.

95
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,850
I need to hide it.

96
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:33,540
Hah!

97
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,300
Hah!

98
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,010
Hah!

99
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:40,750
Hah!

100
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,220
Stop!

101
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,550
Take a break.

102
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,260
Nice to meet a friend from afar.

103
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:43,920
My respect.

104
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,760
You flattered me.

105
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,100
Are you

106
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,350
Beili’s spy to Tianning,

107
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,390
Gu Qishao?

108
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,390
What?

109
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,960
I don’t look like him?

110
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,220
Not very.

111
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,530
Jun Yizheng sent me a message

112
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,350
that I’d meet the spy here

113
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,260
and he’d help me in Tianning.

114
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,470
I didn’t expect he told me

115
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,720
the Princess of Xiqiu who comes to the marriage

116
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,640
would collaborate with Beili.

117
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,550
Let’s put it straight.

118
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,110
Tianning and Xiqiu had a war.

119
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,020
Prince Qin killed my father,

120
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,210
slaughtered our men.

121
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,300
Xiqiu is in political unrest.

122
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,260
The marriage is the last option.

123
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,090
I need your help.

124
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,780
How may I help you, Princess?

125
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,300
Though a princess I am,

126
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,300
I’ve no resource in Tianning.

127
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,640
I have very few informants.

128
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,220
I don’t know

129
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,510
what’s waiting for me in the palace.

130
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:45,970
So,

131
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,550
I need you to provide me with

132
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,840
useful information,

133
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,100
especially about

134
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,390
the forces in the harem.

135
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,150
That’s for sure.

136
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,220
My price is that

137
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:02,850
I need you to

138
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,530
provide me with information about the palace.

139
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,110
That’s for sure.

140
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,140
Deal.

141
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,890
Whenever you need me,

142
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,800
you’ll find me in Yaogui Valley.

143
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,890
Yaogui Valley?

144
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,640
I have a present for you.

145
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,720
What’s that?

146
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,430
Refined poison.

147
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,430
The instructions are in the box.

148
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,550
It’s your defense.

149
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,550
Thank you.

150
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:25,970
And,

151
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,970
since we share the common goal,

152
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,300
Tianning is unsettled,

153
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,760
I’d like to tell you a piece of good news.

154
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,720
Your enemy is in trouble.

155
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,970
You mean

156
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,620
the wildly noised case of

157
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,970
the Highest Judiciary?

158
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,640
You are well-informed.

159
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,800
The Highest Judiciary case

160
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,290
can’t topple Prince Qin.

161
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,930
It may topple someone,

162
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,640
not Prince Qin.

163
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:52,890
You’re right.

164
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,180
A small case

165
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,700
can’t topple Prince Qin.

166
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,360
But Prince Qin has public support.

167
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,640
Too many exploits

168
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,220
threaten King Tianhui.

169
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,970
All we need to do is to make a start,

170
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:03,800
and someone

171
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,680
will make it happen.

172
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,930
Sounds you have a plan.

173
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,390
I’ll wait for your good news.

174
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:11,720
Fine.

175
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,050
My good partner.

176
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,470
Haven’t seen you for too long.

177
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,810
Where have you been?

178
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:26,640
Mother,

179
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,600
I had a visit to

180
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:29,850
Xiqiu.

181
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:31,930
How could you!

182
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:34,510
Xiqiu has allied with us,

183
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,679
but is always

184
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,100
on guard against us.

185
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,500
[Empress of Beili State]

186
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,929
You were putting yourself

187
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,220
in great danger!

188
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,340
[Crown Prince of Beili, Jun Yizheng]

189
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,669
Mother, please be assured.

190
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,430
Many court officials of Xiqiu

191
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,050
work for Beili.

192
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,850
I am safe in Xiqiu

193
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,640
as if I were in Beili.

194
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,470
What did you want

195
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,680
from your visit to Xiqiu?

196
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,930
I had a great mission.

197
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,970
I persuaded Chu Qingge to marry Tianning

198
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,970
and unsettle Tianning court.

199
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,050
Chu Qingge is marrying King Tianhui?

200
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,900
Will she pledge allegiance to Tianning?

201
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:12,680
Mother,

202
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,260
Xiqiu is now

203
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,800
under the control of Beili.

204
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,760
Chu Qingge has to give in,

205
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,420
or the Crown Prince of Xiqiu

206
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,100
will be in danger.

207
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,930
You are right.

208
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,430
Chu Qingge is a princess.

209
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,890
She’ll soon understand that

210
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,890
love from a king

211
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,890
never overrides the bloodline.

212
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,260
Mother,

213
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,890
shall we

214
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,010
report to father?

215
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,390
You’re the next king of Beili.

216
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,640
It’s up to you.

217
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,890
Act on your discretion.

218
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,190
Who’s Chu Qingge’s contact in Tianning?

219
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,850
Jun Yixie.

220
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,260
Seems that guy

221
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,050
is having a good time in Tianning.

222
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,680
Mother,

223
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,010
he will have to move up.

224
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:29,760
Your Highness.

225
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,600
How was your talk?

226
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,220
Good.

227
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,050
He’s the owner of Yaogui Valley.

228
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:40,890
He promises

229
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,920
to deliver us information.

230
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,640
A superb poisoner.

231
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,720
He gave me a box of poison for defense.

232
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,970
That man is uninhibited,

233
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,350
and doesn’t look like an ordinary spy.

234
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,260
A spy doesn’t look like a spy.

235
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,470
As long as he works for us.

236
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,220
A spy must be composed, sober,

237
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,600
and easy to be controlled.

238
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,180
I have a bad feeling.

239
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,090
Jun Yizheng can’t control him.

240
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,100
It doesn’t matter to us, anyway.

241
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,140
The priority now

242
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,510
is our situation in the palace.

243
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,260
The palace.

244
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,680
We’ve left the last relay

245
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,260
and will see the capital soon.

246
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:27,640
Good.

247
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,680
Days ago,

248
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,090
Beili briefed me

249
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,090
on Tianning court.

250
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,720
I’ve met Gu Qishao.

251
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,430
That’s the purpose I detoured the fleet.

252
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,100
Mammy,

253
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,710
the information says

254
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,350
King Tianhui is paranoid.

255
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:46,760
I’m afraid

256
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,350
he would doubt the purpose of my marriage.

257
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,230
It’s an unknown place,

258
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,800
with harem wars,

259
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,720
and risks.

260
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,350
We must take care of every step.

261
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:04,970
May I suggest,

262
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,350
Your Highness, don’t over concern.

263
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,140
Men are prisoners of beauties.

264
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,720
King Tianhui is paranoid

265
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,350
and he is a man.

266
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,260
Your Highness’s beauty is known to the world.

267
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,430
You’ll capture his heart.

268
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,930
But the harem

269
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,050
is always a den of jaws.

270
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,220
We must use caution.

271
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,800
Caution?

272
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,090
I am the princess.

273
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,390
For the sake of revenge

274
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,370
I have to come for the marriage.

275
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,140
For the sake of revenge

276
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,390
I have to fight the stupid women

277
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,220
for the favor of a man.

278
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,300
All these

279
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,600
are because of Long Feiye.

280
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,050
Your Highness,

281
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,760
pardon me.

282
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:54,720
Mammy,

283
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,730
it’s not your fault.

284
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,760
I over reacted.

285
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,760
Your mercy.

286
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,100
Tell the spies

287
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,600
to keep an eye on the Highest Judiciary case.

288
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,430
Find out who are behind this.

289
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,680
If Long Feiye has enemies,

290
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,100
his enemies

291
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,760
are our allies.

292
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,010
And,

293
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,970
for information out of reach,

294
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,010
the spies may go to Gu Qishao

295
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,560
in Yaogui Valley in the name of herb pickers.

296
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,850
Yes.

297
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,180
Someday

298
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,540
Long Feiye will pay for this

299
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,470
with deadly expense.

300
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,810
The Poison Master is so capable!

301
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,180
I can’t believe he made the poisons!

302
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,350
He used herbs

303
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,310
not found even in medical books.

304
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,470
If I could create something,

305
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,220
would that ice cake

306
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,550
look at me with new eyes?

307
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:00,550
No,

308
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,140
he won’t look at me.

309
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,000
Your Highness,

310
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,300
Her Highness

311
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,140
locks herself

312
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,870
in Pavilion of Leisure for days

313
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,260
with her herbs and bottles.

314
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,720
How about the Crown Prince and his uncle?

315
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,800
The Crown Prince

316
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,230
spends every day in Gorgeous Chamber.

317
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,380
What about his uncle?

318
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,300
He said the Highest Judiciary case

319
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,930
broke his heart.

320
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,510
He declines all visitors.

321
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,930
The two

322
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,420
remain quiet for a time.

323
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,510
They’re indeed good partners.

324
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,640
They’ve made up their minds.

325
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,180
They know I won’t report to His Majesty

326
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,920
on the Poison Puppet.

327
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,300
Your Highness,

328
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,490
I have one more thing to report.

329
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,930
You told me to watch Yaogui Valley.

330
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,480
Here came a message.

331
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,250
At the night you got hurt,

332
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,010
the owner of Yaogui Valley

333
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,070
rushed out of the valley on his horse.

334
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,470
I suppose

335
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,010
he knew he was watched

336
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,050
and he detoured a long way.

337
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,350
Our men

338
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:11,680
lost him,

339
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,260
and,

340
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,640
the sored woman

341
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,430
never showed up in the valley.

342
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,720
Do as usual,

343
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,600
as you did

344
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:21,930
every day.

345
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,890
It’s unnecessary to watch

346
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,830
the Crown Prince and his uncle.

347
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,050
Yes.

348
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,900
[Checked]

349
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,090
No, no.

350
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,720
Dowager gave me one month.

351
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:46,680
How could I

352
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,140

367

He’d ask me for help,

368
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,930
and I’d check whether he has the sign

It’s a bottle.

does he have a personal maid?

408
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,600
Has he been to the whorehouse?

409

Yes.

rules are rules without rules.

459

That’s the manner of a princess.

469
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,740
Did I say rise?

470
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,820
It’s my due obligation to serve mother.

471

Certainly.

482

Learn to be a wife of a royal family.

493

-But, mother.
-That’s offensive.

494
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,720
Are you asking for discipline?

Yes, Your Highness.

508
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,580
I didn’t let you kneel.

509
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,820
Mother said I will wash your feet.

510

Ask Madam Gui.

511

512
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:00,700

to teach Princess the rules.

514

She’s mine.

515

I’ll teach my woman.

516

Well, Your Highness,

Please don’t embarrass her.

520
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,150
Actually,

521
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,240
I’d like to wash your feet.

522
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,900
Disgrace.

Your Highness!

526
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:05,950
Your Highness,

527
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,860
that act was never allowable.

528
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,050
Your Highness,

529
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,190
you indulge her too much.

530
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,990
Chest.

531
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:43,780
Back.

532
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,900
Arms.

533
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,030
Legs.

534
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,530
Even his feet were checked.

535
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,860
And here…

536
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,040
It’s alright.

537
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,400
I’m a physician.

538
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,830
There’s no man or woman to a physician.

539
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,190
No man or woman.

540
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,650
What the hell?

541
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,070
Sleep!

542
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:26,740
Sleep!

543
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,070
Princess of Xiqiu, Chu Qingge

544
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,320
will come in days.

545
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,940
She brings ten thousand of fine steeds.

546
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,820
That will help a lot

547
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,480
in the defense of Tianning.

548
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,210
To show Tianning’s

549
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,240
appreciation for the marriage,

550
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,320
Feiye, please

551
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,570
take Tianmo to greet her.

552
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,490
Yes, Your Majesty.

553
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,060
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

554
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,100
[A month ago, war between Tianning and Xiqiu]

555
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:11,100
[King of Xiqiu State]

556
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,050
Your Highness,

557
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,400
General Baili and Vice General Chu

558
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,070
haven’t come yet.

559
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,000
We’re besieged!

560
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,360
We’re outnumbered.

561
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,240
Don’t fight.

562
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,240
Stick to me.

563
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,190
Break it through!

564
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:50,650
Hold!

565
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,530
Your Highness,

566
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,200
you’re Tianning’s Ares and the commander.

567
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:53,900
You must be safe!

568
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,230
You’ll guard Tianning!

569
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,070
I’m the commander

570
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:58,400
that goes before his men!

571
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,320
Everyone!

572
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:00,610
Charge!

573
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,950
Charge!

574
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:27,929
Your Highness!

575
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,239
Tianning’s days are numbered.

576
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,570
Kill Prince Qin the boy.

577
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:32,340
We’ll slaughter the town and

578
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,570
spill the blood of King Tianhui.

579
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,929
I don’t want his despicable life.

580
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:40,030
I want

581
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:42,110
someone he hides.

582
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,239
A god

583
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:46,070
that turns men

584
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,650
into terrible warriors.

585
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:49,989
With his help,

586
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:52,610
the whole world

587
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,860
is in my hands.

588
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,490
Hey, you,

589
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,950
Ares.

590
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,400
Does it hurt

591
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,240
watching your men die

592
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,320
one by one?

593
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,860
Surrender,

594
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,410
and I’ll let them go.

595
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,450
Listen!

596
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,990
Tianning men fight to death,

597
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,070
never surrender!

598
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,740
Fight for the Prince!

599
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,030
It that

600
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:09,320
the infected in the rumors?

601
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,530
Interesting!

602
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,110
I’ve been after this for my life,

603
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:52,900
and

604
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,320
am killed by the infected.

605
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,860
I am right.

606
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,900
The god is out there!

607
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,190
The god is out there!

608
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,140
Your Highness!

609
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,990
Hold on!

610
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,850
Hah!

611
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:03,940
Hah!

612
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:05,020
Hah!

613
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,770
Hah!

614
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,270
Whoa!

615
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,190
Your Highness.

616
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,240
Your Highness.

617
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:28,670
Your Highness.

618
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,320
Your Highness.
