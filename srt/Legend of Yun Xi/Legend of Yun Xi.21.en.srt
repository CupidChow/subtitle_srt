Episode 21

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:12,190
No.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,860
I have to find a way out of here.

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,570
Why are you here?

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:25,990
Well…

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,530
I bring you some food.

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,410
Finish it

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,570
and find a place outside to hide for a while.

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:30,530
No,

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,280
I can’t leave.

12
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:32,740
Why?

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,610
How is Long Feiye now?

14
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,490
He is… still in a coma.

15
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,730
Where are you going?

16
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,050
I have to see him.

17
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:44,900
No!

18
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:45,780
Baili Mingxiang

19
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,090
is always by his side.

20
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,070
If you show up now,

21
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,530
you will be caught.

22
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,950
But I have to go no matter what.

23
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,130
Baili Mingxiang said

24
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,290
Long Feiye became like this

25
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,070
because of my medicine.

26
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,010
But I really don’t know

27
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:56,860
what the problem is.

28
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,240
Ningjing,

29
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,730
please help me.

30
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:02,740
Help me to see him.

31
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:03,860
I’ll know

32
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,360
what the problem is when I see him.

33
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,410
Please.

34
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,530
Alright. I’ll help you.

35
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:26,780
Mingxiang!

36
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:28,190
Come here.

37
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,490
Bad news!

38
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,740
I just…

39
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,970
I just went to the wood house to see Yunxi.

40
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:36,810
I called her for a long time

41
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:37,740
but she didn't respond.

42
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,240
Seemed that she passed out.

43
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,530
Then just let her lie down there.

44
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,170
No. Well…

45
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,890
You are the only physician here now.

46
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,009
If anything bad happens to her,

47
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:47,400
you can’t get away with that, right?

48
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,990
Just a spy.

49
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,190
It’s fine even if she dies.

50
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,740
No big deal.

51
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,130
But Yunxi is Feiye’s wife

52
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,400
granted by His Majesty.

53
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,110
It will be a trouble to

54
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,610
Feiye if His Majesty

55
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,700
asks about this.

56
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,740
Come on. Come with me.

57
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,820
His pulse condition is strange.

58
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,950
Shallow breathing.

59
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,650
Deep coma.

60
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:24,280
I found it!

61
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,400
Poisonous Gu?

62
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,190
When it breaks out,

63
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,900
people will change into a demon

64
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,860
which has strong power

65
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,280
and walks as fast as flying.

66
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,490
Then people will return to normal in a while,

67
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:42,360
becoming extremely weak

68
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,570
with an unstable

69
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,610
and disorder pulse condition,

70
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,050
which is sometimes rapid

71
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,320
and sometimes slow.

72
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,900
There is such a poison in this world?

73
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,570
It can only be suppressed, but can’t be cured.

74
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,320
Only another poison can suppress it.

75
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,740
The poisonous Beauty Blood

76
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,899
is the only thing

77
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:21,190
that can suppress it.

78
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,780
Beauty Blood?

79
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,240
Come on. Come on!

80
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,360
Where is she?

81
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,320
Wait!

82
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,280
Wait!

83
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,070
Luckily that Feiye is fine.

84
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,260
[Yujing Chamber]

85
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,280
She dares to escape?

86
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,450
She’d better not try to come back again.

87
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,650
Aunt,

88
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,280
I think

89
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,820
it’s not a bad thing

90
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,150
that she escaped.

91
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,030
Why?

92
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,970
Although she is

93
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,610
the spy assigned by Her Royal Highness,

94
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,740
their marriage is granted by His Majesty.

95
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,490
We can’t do anything to her.

96
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,360
Now she has escaped.

97
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,450
We can

98
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,140
seize this chance and

99
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,360
get rid of her, right?

100
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,950
Yes.

101
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,030
You make sense.

102
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,170
I think

103
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,650
there must be misunderstandings

104
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,950
between us.

105
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,780
I have been getting along

106
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,890
with Yunxi for long.

107
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,170
I think Yunxi

108
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,450
doesn’t look like a spy.

109
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,150
Ningjing,

110
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,320
you are so naïve.

111
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,450
Cats hide their claws.

112
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,970
Of course the “spy” is not on her face.

113
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:13,740
But

114
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,330
she helped Feiye

115
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,900
clear the false accusation

116
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,370
and cured Princess Changbing

117
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,900
and Concubine Qing’s face.

118
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,110
What’s more,

119
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,650
she also helped Your Highness

120
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:23,770
suppress Her Royal Highness.

121
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,210
I think Your Highness

122
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,460
was happy about that.

123
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,450
So what?

124
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,740
If it was not

125
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,650
for Han Yunxi,

126
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,290
how would Feiye

127
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,400
have become like this now?

128
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,740
It’s already

129
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,490
the undeniable truth

130
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,820
that she is a spy.

131
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:35,930
Even if she

132
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,030
helped Feiye before,

133
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,570
what if she did that for other reasons?

134
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,610
-I just think…
-Alright.

135
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,900
Stop talking about that.

136
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,490
I even get a headache

137
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,860
when I hear her name.

138
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,700
Madam Gui,

139
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,490
I want to go back to have some rest.

140
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,570
Stop there!

141
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,650
You! Can’t you hear me?

142
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,930
Me?

143
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,200
Is there

144
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,240
anyone else

145
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,530
in the wilderness besides you?

146
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,360
Sorry, sir.

147
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,070
What are you doing here?

148
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,990
I’m here to find herbs.

149
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,450
Herbs?

150
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,990
Are there any herbs?

151
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,950
Sir, I’m sorry.

152
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,490
But one of my relatives is seriously sick.

153
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,610
I need to get some herbs.

154
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,860
Then you can just go to the clinic.

155
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,370
I’m sorry.

156
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,330
I’m the physician.

157
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,450
Nonsense!

158
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,650
There is a criminal

159
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,570
on the run today.

160
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,890
You look like you’re in a hurry

161
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:53,780
and sneaky.

162
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,280
You must have some secret.

163
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,370
Maybe

164
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,700
you’re an accomplice to the fugitive!

165
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,030
Get her arrested!

166
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:00,900
Wait…

167
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,780
Qishao?

168
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,360
You came just in time.

169
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,530
Poison Girl,

170
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,450
aren’t you always

171
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,530
with your strong poisons?

172
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,070
Why are you in such a tight corner today?

173
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,410
I came out in a hurry

174
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,200
and forgot my bag.

175
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,250
Why are you here?

176
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,240
I also want to ask you.

177
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,450
This is the only way

178
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,250
to my valley.

179
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,320
Why are you here?

180
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,450
Are you going to see me?

181
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,650
Luckily,

182
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,950
you met me here.

183
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,780
Or

184
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,280
you would have died.

185
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,210
But…

186
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,110
Why did they want to arrest you?

187
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,700
I don’t know.

188
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,929
I’m working on

189
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:41,490
a special poison lately

190
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,490
and I need herbs.

191
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,090
So I wanted to go to your valley.

192
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,130
I didn’t expect to meet them.

193
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,130
They stopped me

194
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,400
and said I’m an escaped criminal.

195
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,860
Well then,

196
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,950
it’s late now.

197
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,860
Come with me.

198
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,740
What’s wrong?

199
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,450
You’re so quiet today.

200
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,030
Aren’t you out on business?

201
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,050
I came back to see if my brother

202
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:14,970
is fine.

203
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:15,950
I’m leaving now.

204
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,530
Wait!

205
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,330
Have a seat.

206
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,700
I have something to ask you.

207
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,900
What is it?

208
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,320
Baili Mingxiang said

209
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,530
the recurrence of Feiye’s old disease

210
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,700
was caused by Yunxi.

211
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,240
Is that true?

212
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,930
It’s said by Mingxiang.

213
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,110
I think it can’t be false.

214
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,240
Is Yunxi

215
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,400
really a spy?

216
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,250
She is in love with Feiye deeply.

217
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,740
How could she do that?

218
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,260
Sometime things

219
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,770
are not as simple as you imagined.

220
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:49,970
We should not only see things

221
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,280
with our eyes.

222
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,200
We also have to feel them with heart.

223
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,700
But my heart tells me

224
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,280
that Yunxi is a good one.

225
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,570
Actually I don’t know

226
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,070
whether Yunxi is good or not.

227
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,290
But if anyone

228
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,140
wants to do harm to my brother,

229
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,360
I will never let her go.

230
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,610
I thought you knew the truth.

231
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,400
But actually you’re more confused than me.

232
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,820
I’m always smart.

233
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,450
It’s just this time.

234
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,490
Why are you looking at me like that?

235
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,530
Tang Li,

236
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,240
you don’t dislike me, do you?

237
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,400
Yes, I dislike you.

238
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,250
You’re lying!

239
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,770
Although you usually avoid me,

240
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,010
you will appear every time

241
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:38,950
I feel sad.

242
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,280
After you said that,

243
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,610
I think I made a mistake.

244
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,530
I won’t do it again.

245
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,130
Tang Li!

246
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,190
Stop there!

247
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,490
Tang Li!

248
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,290
Are you tired of peace

249
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,740
and looking for trouble?

250
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,330
Look at you!

251
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,610
Finally you showed your true colors!

252
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,570
You know what?

253
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,180
I’m timid.

254
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:57,860
Don’t try to scare me.

255
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,610
You…

256
00:10:59,220 --> 00:10:59,900
Stop there!

257
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,110
Qishao,

258
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,530
do you know that there is a poison

259
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,610
called Beauty Blood?

260
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,570
Beauty Blood?

261
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,280
I saw that on the book before.

262
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,530
But I really don’t know

263
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:11,730
what it is.

264
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,170
It’s said that Beauty Blood

265
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,070
is the blood of a girl who takes the poison

266
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,240
for ten years.

267
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,740
It’s famous

268
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,740
but rare.

269
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,610
What’s wrong?

270
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,240
You’re curious about it?

271
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,410
Of course.

272
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,570
You call me Poison Girl.

273
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,610
Of course I’m curious about it.

274
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,150
Beauty Blood is too peculiar

275
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,740
at the cost of human life.

276
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,780
I will never make

277
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,780
such a poison,

278
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,400
because I know

279
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,360
beauty should be loved.

280
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,400
That’s right.

281
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,140
Even if someone is willing to sacrifice herself

282
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,570
to raise the Beauty Blood,

283
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,450
she has to poison herself first.

284
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,280
What if it’s not well controlled

285
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,250
and she gets herself killed

286
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,320
at the first time?

287
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,490
Poison Girl,

288
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,730
I don’t have Beauty Blood,

289
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,090
but I have something else

290
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,400
which is the same.

291
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,400
What is it?

292
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,610
Moon Vine.

293
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,070
Moon Vine?

294
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,210
The best of the poisonous herbs

295
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,900
which is famous around the world?

296
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,610
It is now in bloom.

297
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,100
Can you sell me

298
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,030
the flower of it?

299
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,740
No.

300
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,490
Why?

301
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,010
Because Moon Vine

302
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:10,900
is not for trade,

303
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:11,950
but for exchange.

304
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,360
Exchange?

305
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,570
For what?

306
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,780
As long as you promise me three things,

307
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,530
I can give you that.

308
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,650
Really?

309
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,780
I always keep my words.

310
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,780
Alright. I promise you.

311
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,360
But I have my rules.

312
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,240
Go ahead.

313
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,970
Not the things which are

314
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,170
contrary to morality.

315
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,070
Rest assured.

316
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,780
I won’t over claim.

317
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,090
Deal.

318
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,320
Go ahead. What are they?

319
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,130
I don’t know now.

320
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:37,700
I’ll tell you

321
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,450
when I decide it.

322
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,610
Alright.

323
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,280
Remember to tell me when you decide.

324
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,130
Take me to find

325
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,150
Moon Vine now.

326
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,610
Let’s go.

327
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,740
This is the cave

328
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,110
where we first met?

329
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:03,700
You still remember it?

330
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,280
Moon Vine is here?

331
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,110
Yes.

332
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,190
Come on.

333
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,320
What are you doing?

334
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,050
The pond here is poisonous.

335
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:50,860
It’s dangerous.

336
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,320
You want to risk

337
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,410
your life only for a herb.

338
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,610
I have to get Moon Vine

339
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,950
today no matter what.

In front of a beauty,

347
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,150
even the flower will be eclipsed.

348
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,280
Shall we leave now?

349
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,490

00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,130
Qishao,

362
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,780
what are you looking at?

363
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,280
The stars in the sky.

364
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,320
It’s a nice night.

365
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,150
You think I’m a fool?

366
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,130
You are

367
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,450
thinking about Ms. Han.

368
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,130
If you feel embarrassed to say that,

369
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:56,900
I can help you.

370
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:57,950
Zhuyu!

371
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,280
Don’t be so rude.

372
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,990
Maybe it’s useful that

373
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,280
Han Yunxi stays in Prince Qin’s Mansion.

374
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,780
Ms. Han will help us?

375
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:07,700
I don’t know.

376
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,490
But we can make use of her.

377
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,200
Baisu,

378
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,450
go investigate

379
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,610
the past of Prince Qin.

380
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,240
Investigate Prince Qin?

381
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,730
Do you know

382
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,820
what herb Han Yunxi

383
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,950
took away today?

384
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,320
It’s Moon Vine.

385
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,820
Moon Vine?

386
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,860
Why does she need that?

387
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,240
I don’t know.

388
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,210
But

389
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,820
I heard from the Crown Prince that

390
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,210
after the poisonous Gu breaks out,

391
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,280
the person will be weak.

392
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,770
And the best tonic for that

393
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,200
is the most poisonous thing.

394
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,090
And Beauty Blood and Moon Vine

395
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,360
are the most poisonous.

396
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,530
Now

397
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,860
the herb Han Yunxi took away

398
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,650
is the most useful thing to them.

399
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,110
Maybe this is just an accident?

400
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,700
Han Yunxi even risked her life

401
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,240
to pick up the herb.

402
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,610
She is definitely

403
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,030
not only interested in it.

404
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,819
Are you

405
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,609
suspecting that…

406
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:09,130
Prince Qin took part in

407
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,359
the hijack in person.

408
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,859
And also

409
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,650
a Gu-infected man

410
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,950
showed up there.

411
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,050
The Gu-infected man’s figure

412
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,490
was the same as that of Prince Qin.

413
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,140
And now Han Yunxi

414
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,490
is eager for that herb.

415
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:22,700
That’s why

416
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,130
you want me to investigate

417
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,359
Prince Qin’s past?

418
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,130
There are so many coincidences

419
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,200
which let me curious about it.

420
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,490
I see.

421
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,150
I will start the investigation tomorrow.

422
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,200
Poison Girl.

423
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,400
You got up.

424
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:08,990
Come here.

425
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,320
No, thanks.

426
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,650
I have been out for long.

427
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,780
I need to go back now.

428
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,900
Let me walk you home.

429
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,490
Don’t bother.

430
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,900
Qishao,

431
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,740
thanks for your Moon Vine and keeping me.

432
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:20,890
I owe you

433
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,280
a big time again.

434
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,650
I’m leaving now.

435
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:27,650
Qishao.

436
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,740
What’s up?

437
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,320
Remember your three requirements.

438
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,890
Wipe that place clean.

439
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:41,740
Cleaner!

440
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:43,900
Eunuch Li.

441
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,530
Eunuch Li.

442
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,190
You pighead.

443
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,090
How did I

444
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,190
teach you before?

445
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,330
Mindless idiot!

446
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,650
Eunuch, I’m sorry.

447
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:53,460
I’m sorry.

448
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,370
I didn’t do that on purpose.

449
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,330
I didn’t have

450
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,280
a good sleep last night.

451
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,530
I had

452
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,180
a nightmare last night.

453
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,740
So what?

454
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,360
Eunuch,

455
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,970
the nightmare I had last night

456
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:04,930
was about the thing

457
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,240
I saw yesterday.

458
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,070
What do you mean?

459
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,900
Tell me clearly!

460
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,320
Eunuch,

461
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,740
on my way to the Imperial Garden yesterday,

462
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,450
I seemed to see

463
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,280
a red light in Prince Qin’s eyes.

464
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,130
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

465
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:22,770
It was

466
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,250
the blink of an eye.

467
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,140
I thought I saw

468
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,130
it wrong.

469
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,070
Look at you!

470
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,320
I’ll deal with you later.

471
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,070
Your Majesty,

472
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,990
a servant just reported that

473
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,650
something was wrong when Prince Qin left that day.

474
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,400
There was a red light in his eyes.

475
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,860
Did he see it clearly?

476
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,900
He said it was the blink of an eye.

477
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,530
He was not so sure.

478
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,570
Poison Master.

479
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,650
Gu-infected man.

480
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,610
Long Feiye.

481
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,530
Red eyes.

482
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,320
Li Quan,

483
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,740
don’t you think

484
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,820
this is interesting?

485
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,360
Li Quan.

486
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,150
Call the Imperial Physician.

487
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,070
I have to

488
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,530
care more about

489
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,070
my brother now.

490
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,740
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

491
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,070
Miss Mingxiang.

492
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,530
What’s wrong?

493
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,570
His Majesty is

494
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,990
at the gate with the Imperial Physician.

495
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:02,890
Why is His Majesty

496
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:03,950
here now?

497
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,190
I don’t know.

498
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,290
But

499
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,650
His Highness is still in a coma.

500
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:08,820
If

501
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,860
the Gu is not suppressed now,

502
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,530
the consequences would be disastrous

503
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,110
if the physician finds it.

504
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,700
Greetings, Your Highness.

505
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,820
I didn’t know you’re coming

506
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,860
and didn’t go to greet you.

507
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,950
Please forgive me.

508
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,070
Don’t bother to do this.

509
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:50,610
Come here.

510
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,450
I heard that you are sick

511
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,240
and I don’t want to disturb you.

512
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,900
So I didn’t let them inform you.

513
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,070
Feiye,

514
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,650
you look terrible.

515
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,070
Are you suffering from some serious disease?

516
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,990
It’s just a relapse.

517
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,700
Sorry to make you worry.

518
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,360
It’s my fault.

519
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,030
This is all for Tianning.

520
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,450
Feiye,

521
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,280
you should be more careful to old disease.

522
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,570
I brought the Imperial Physician here for you.

523
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,570
Physician Sun.

524
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

525
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,770
Come and check Prince Qin now.

526
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:37,490
Yes.

527
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,360
Your Majesty,

528
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,450
the pulse condition

529
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,110
of His Highness is just a little weak.

530
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,400
There is no big problem.

531
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,250
Physician Sun.

532
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:02,820
Yes, Your Majesty.

533
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,650
Prince Qin’s health is important.

534
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,150
If there is anything wrong,

535
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,280
I’ll punish you severely.

536
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,950
I wouldn’t dare, Your Majesty.

537
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,780
Brother, don’t worry.

538
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,240
I will be fine after days

539
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,490
of rest.

540
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,280
Well then,

541
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,900
I can rest assured.

542
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,280
Feiye,

543
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,450
you

544
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,490
are the mainstay of Tianning

545
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,400
and my capable assistant.

546
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,570
Even if not for your own,

547
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:38,530
you have to

548
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,860
take good care of yourself for me.

549
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,820
Your Majesty,

550
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,570
I’m deeply grateful for your kindness.

551
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,490
I will never let you down.

552
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,610
Feiye.

553
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,150
Did you muddle through it?

554
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:16,950
Mingxiang,

555
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,570
you must not

556
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,610
take such a risk again.

557
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,780
His Majesty suddenly came here.

558
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:22,970
If I didn’t use Beauty Blood

559
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:23,990
to suppress the Gu

560
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,070
and wake you up,

561
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,240
he would have known your identity.

562
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,050
Then all the

563
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,190
efforts you made

564
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,190
would have been in vain.

565
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,070
It’s already so dangerous for you

566
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,530
to develop Beauty Blood with your life.

567
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,280
And now you lost so much blood,

568
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,360
your life will be in danger anytime.

569
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,610
Over the years,

570
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,700
I've learned how painful it is

571
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,650
when the poison breaks out.

572
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,780
I don’t want you to be like me.

573
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,740
Feiye,

574
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,250
I develop the Beauty Blood

575
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,400
only for you.

576
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,150
To me, my life

577
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,190
is not as important as yours.

578
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,700
There are still

579
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,610
many wonderful things to do

580
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:05,530
in your life.

581
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,130
I will find a way

582
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,110
to save you as soon as possible.

583
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,990
Have a good rest.

584
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,860
I will come to see you later.

585
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,700
Take good care of her.

586
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,280
-Yes.
-Yes.

587
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,150
Your Highness.

588
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,360
Where is Han Yunxi?

589
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,950
Her Highness?

590
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,610
She…

591
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,030
What’s wrong with her?

592
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,190
Her identity as a spy

593
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,240
has been found by Miss Mingxiang

594
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,280
and Her Highness.

595
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,130
She was

596
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,530
locked in the wood house.

597
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:03,860
But now she has escaped.

598
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,490
Your Highness,

599
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,690
do you need me

600
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:08,950
to find her back?

601
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,030
Physician Sun,

602
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,450
as a poison physician,

603
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,180
you really didn’t find

604
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,950
any sign of poisoning on Prince Qin?

605
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,780
Your Majesty,

606
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,890
according to his pulse,

607
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:39,030
he is just a little weak

608
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,190
but not poisoned.

609
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,450
Weak?

610
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,450
You may leave now.

611
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,610
Yes, Your Majesty.

612
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,320
What happened?

613
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,950
Your Majesty,

614
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,400
when I was outside the palace just now,

615
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,450
I overheard some gossip

616
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,200
which is now spread

617
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,900
by the foolish people.

618
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,030
I don’t…

619
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,320
I don’t know whether I should say it.

620
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,820
I’m the King.

621
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,570
I should know the opinions of both sides.

622
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:18,950
Just go ahead.

623
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:19,900
Say it.

624
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,240
I heard people say that

625
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,280
the…

626
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,820
The King worships military.

627
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,490
He not only conscripts recklessly,

628
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,900
but also levies heavy taxes for military.

629
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,400
Some even said

630
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,250
that the King is developing

631
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,810
the Gu-infected man

632
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:43,320
that appeared in Qinxi Dynasty.

633
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,890
They said it’s against ethics

634
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:48,690
and the nature

635
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:50,650
to develop the Gu-infected man.

636
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,010
Now the Gu-infected man fled.

637
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,190
He will cause trouble.

638
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,370
The people are in fear and danger.

639
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,190
Everyone feels insecure.

640
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,930
In my opinion,

641
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,030
someone is spreading the rumors on purpose.

642
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,250
I think he must be…

643
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,070
Enough.

644
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,030
Tell Lei

645
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,030
to wait for me in Qinzheng Hall.

646
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,780
Yes.

647
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,320
You go find out

648
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,810
what is going on

649
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:34,090
about the rumors

650
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,530
of the Gu-infected man among the people.

651
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:36,780
Yes.

652
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,490
And,

653
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,820
give me a thorough

654
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,730
investigation of

655
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:43,900
Long Feiye’s background,

656
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,400
especially during the period

657
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,890
before he returned to the mansion

658
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:48,900
after the fire,

659
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,900
and see what happened.

660
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,490
Don’t miss any detail.

661
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,030
Yes.

662
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,200
You may go.

663
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:02,950
Your Majesty,

664
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,570
the people are ignorant.

665
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:06,820
They are just gossiping.

666
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,150
Please don’t be too mad.

667
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,070
I think it’s not that easy.

668
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,610
The people are ignorant,

669
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,450
so someone with bad intentions

670
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,700
will control them.

671
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:21,010
Someone who was able to make that rumor

672
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,360
when the Poison Master was hijacked

673
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,410
must be either from Beili

674
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:25,860
or Long Feiye.

675
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,610
Beili is far away from here.

676
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,110
They can’t stretch their hands here.

677
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,700
The only possibility

678
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,320
could be Long Feiye.

679
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,490
Seems that he can’t wait anymore.

680
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,070
Your Majesty,

681
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,780
if it is really Prince Qin,

682
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,990
he is just an ordinary person in your kingdom.

683
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,490
You can kill him

684
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,130
as easily as you kill

685
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,070
an ant.

686
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,360
Of course.

687
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,570
He looks really

688
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,200
sick today.

689
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,140
Although there is no proof that

690
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,400
he is the Gu-infected man,

691
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,490
he still can’t get away from this.

692
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,150
After the Gu breaks out,

693
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,490
the Gu-infected man will be weak.

694
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,490
And Prince Qin is

695
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,650
in a relapse at this time.

696
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,200
Isn’t this strange?

697
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,740
That’s right, Your Majesty.

698
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,570
But

699
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,400
he is Tianning’s Prince.

700
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,610
How could he be the Gu-infected man?

701
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,820
That’s why you asked Lei

702
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,990
to investigate his background.

703
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:53,740
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

704
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,820
Han Yunxi,

705
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,150
finally you’re back.

706
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,950
As Her Royal Highness’s spy,

707
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,700
you escaped without permission,

708
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,280
how dare you to come back again?

709
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:12,810
Mother,

710
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:13,990
I have my own reason.

711
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,410
If you want to punish me,

712
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,820
please do that after I see Feiye.

713
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,110
He is in an urgent situation now.

714
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,930
I found the way to cure him.

715
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,320
I won’t let you see him.

716
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,570
Don’t try to see Feiye again.

717
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,190
Your Highness,

718
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:37,930
His Majesty has been searching

719
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,070
around for the Gu-infected man these days.

720
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,570
According to your order,

721
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,610
I have

722
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,610
spread the rumors

723
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,370
that His Majesty is developing

724
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:44,240
the Gu-infected man.

725
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,150
His Majesty imposed heavy taxes on the border,

726
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,150
and the people are already complaining.

727
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,070
Coupled with this incident,

728
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,490
the popular support became more unstable

729
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,740
and everyone feels insecure.

730
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,570
Don’t worry

731
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,110
too much about this matter.

732
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,110
His Majesty is in the light.

733
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,610
We are in the dark.

734
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:04,860
Yes.

735
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,150
What I’m worrying about

736
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,530
is the other force in the hijack that day.

737
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:43,900
Your Highness?

738
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,150
Your Highness?

739
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,780
What’s wrong?

740
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,130
Is there anything else for me to do?

741
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:53,990
If not,

742
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,190
I will leave now.

743
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,280
Wait.

744
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,190
Yes, Your Highness.

745
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,970
Send someone to find

746
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:03,730
Han Yunxi back.

747
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:04,860
Don’t bother.

748
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,990
Yunxi is already back.

749
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,240
But she is in a bad situation now.

750
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,190
You ignored the status of a Princess

751
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,860
and colluded with outsiders,

752
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,370
Prince Qin

753
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:37,070
almost died in your hands.

754
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,400
I can’t accept

755
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,740
a daughter-in-law like you.

756
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,530
Guards!

757
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,700
Take her jewelry off.

758
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,200
Change her clothes to coarse clothes

759
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,530
and lock her up in the northwest yard.

760
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:51,530
She is not allowed to step out of there.

761
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,530
Mother…

762
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,450
Don’t call me that.

763
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,530
Wait!

764
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,490
What happened?

765
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,070
You came in right time.

766
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,820
She is the spy of Her Royal Highness.

767
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,490
How will you punish her?

768
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,570
I’m not!

769
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:11,989
Mother,

770
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:14,030
you got her wrong.

771
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:15,889
On the surface,

772
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:17,190
Yunxi is a spy of Her Royal Highness,

773
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,449
but actually

774
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:19,820
she is one of my people.

775
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,400
Your people?

776
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,199
Her Royal Highness must have married Yunxi

777
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,699
here for some other purpose.

778
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,050
So Yunxi

779
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:31,400
cooperates with me

780
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,739
and pretends to be her spy.

781
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,650
In this way,

782
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,130
we could deliver false information

783
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,199
to the palace

784
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,650
to confuse them.

785
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:50,610
Are you sure about that?

786
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,650
Mother,

787
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,199
I have my own plan.

788
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,570
Fine.

789
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,820
In that case,

790
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,950
you can take her away now.

791
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,610
By the way,

792
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,240
she is a sneaky one.

793
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,030
You should be more careful.

794
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,190
Mother, rest assured.

795
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,360
Go now.

796
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,900
I hope you are right.

797
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,200
How do you feel now?

798
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,250
You’d better worry

799
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,320
about yourself now.

800
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,240
Where did you go?

801
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,900
I went to Yaogui Valley.

802
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:47,820
For what?

803
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:48,900
To make medicine for you.

804
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,740
You know my disease now?

805
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,070
You’re poisoned by Gu,

806
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,240
right?

807
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,410
Your symptoms

808
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:59,530
are exactly the same as that of

809
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:00,490
the outbreak of Gu.

810
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:01,990
And that day

811
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,950
when we left the Imperial Garden,

812
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,200
your eyes…

813
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,150
Does anyone else know

814
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,900
that I’m poisoned by Gu?

815
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,730
I won’t

816
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,110
tell anyone about your matter.

817
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,240
Keep what you said in mind.

818
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,070
Don’t worry.

819
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,110
Feiye,

820
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,240
you look well now.

821
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,990
Is the Gu suppressed now?

822
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,860
It’s fine now.

823
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,530
This is the antidote I made.

824
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,410
It may help you

825
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:38,030
suppress the Gu for a while after you take it.

826
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,150
You don’t want to ask me about that?

827
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,070
I believe you.

828
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,090
I don’t know what kind of

829
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,240
poison the Gu is.

830
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,780
And I don’t know how to cure it completely.

831
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,090
But, don’t worry.

832
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,610
I will find out the cure.

833
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:01,820
Alright.

834
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,200
I’ll wait for that.

835
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,530
Feiye,

836
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,280
you have a pretty smile.

837
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,070
Have a good rest first.

838
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,740
Why did you save me just now?

839
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,030
You’re Her Royal Highness’s spy,

840
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,490
but you didn’t tell her anything

841
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:29,700
about me.

842
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,610
You knew that from the beginning?

843
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,570
Why do you keep the secret for me?

844
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,820
Because I like you.

845
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,170
I mean

846
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:47,970
I don’t want to

847
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:49,320
help that evil Dowager.

848
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,200
You should rest

849
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,190
if you are ill.

850
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:25,030
Reading books will make you tired.

851
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,240
Aunt.

852
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,570
Don’t stand up.

853
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,190
Do you feel better now?

854
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,490
I found some

855
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,650
famous physicians in the city.

856
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,860
I’ll let them treat you later

857
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,650
and make some prescriptions for you

858
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,700
to nurse your health.

859
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,320
In the future,

860
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,450
our mansion

861
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,740
will rely on you.

862
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,280
Aunt, don’t say that.

863
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,010
There is already

864
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,530
a mistress here.

865
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,320
You don’t need to rely on me.

866
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,820
You’re the only mistress

867
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,240
in my heart.

868
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,820
I thought she was a good one.

869
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,860
But after what happened this time,

870
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:24,030
I don’t dare to believe her again.

871
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,400
Even if Feiye interceded for her…

872
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,410
Feiye

873
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:34,740
interceded for Han Yunxi?

874
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,110
Yes.

875
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,200
He said

876
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,420
he knew

877
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,240
Han Yunxi’s identity.

878
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,650
They cooperate together

879
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,740
to deceive Her Royal Highness.

880
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,280
They thought I’m easy to be fooled.

881
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,610
Anyway,

882
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,070
she tried hard

883
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,950
to cure Feiye.

884
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,650
She must have true feelings for him.

885
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,950
But Feiye only

886
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,900
has her by his side now.

887
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,780
I’m worried.

888
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,150
You don’t need to worry.

889
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,860
When it’s the right time,

890
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,190
I will

891
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,570
ask Feiye

892
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:35,320
to marry you as a concubine.

893
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,780
Thank you, aunt.

894
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,700
Good girl.

895
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,130
Then why do you

896
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:51,360
still serve Her Royal Highness?

897
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,690
Because she knows

898
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:54,820
my mother’s whereabouts.

899
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:00,090
♫ If this world fades ♫

900
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:03,820
♫ I’ll stay with you ♫

901
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,330
Isn’t

902
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:10,570
your mother already dead?

903
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,240
I thought like that before.

904
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,330
But before I married you,

905
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:16,610
Her Royal Highness called me to the palace

906
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,570
and gave me my mother’s bracelet.

907
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:19,570
She told me

908
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:20,650
that my mother is still alive.

909
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,650
As long as I could be her spy,

910
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,530
she would let us meet again.

911
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,610
She is just making use of you.

912
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,610
Maybe

913
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:35,410
your mother

914
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,570
is really gone.

915
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,570
I won’t give up

916
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:41,900
as long as there is hope.

917
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,170
♫ Just ‘cause you understand me ♫

918
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:50,730
♫ And you are doomed ♫

919
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:53,740
♫ To be my heart blood ♫
