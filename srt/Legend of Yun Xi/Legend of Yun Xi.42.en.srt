00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,020
Episode 42

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,040
Ningjing, what do you want to eat?

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,720
Anything will be okay.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,200
How about that one?

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,060
-Let’s go.
-Okay.

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,680
We’ll have something delicious.

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,070
Feiye doesn’t feel well.

9
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,060
Now he has another sickness.

10
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,450
Another?

11
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,190
Lovesickness.

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,940
You look smart at ordinary times.

13
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,470
But why are you so silly now?

14
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,950
Since Feiye misses Yunxi that much,

15
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,290
why

16
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,820
didn't he explain it to her?

17
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,650
It’s not him who killed Poison Master.

18
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:55,570
Furthermore,

19
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,450
what if Yunxi really gives up

20
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,550
and gets along with others?

21
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,480
Are you kidding me?

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,450
No kidding.

23
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:04,860
I know women the best.

24
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:06,730
Once a woman feels disappointed,

25
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,360
it’s hard to change her mind.

26
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,360
Really?

27
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,660
It’s lucky that I arranged people to watch her.

28
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,380
Han Yunxi

29
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,260
has focused on antidote developing.

30
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,280
Otherwise,

31
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,660
it may really happen.

32
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,130
Let’s stop thinking about it.

33
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,330
Have some food first.

34
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,190
Waiter.

35
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:30,970
Excuse me.

36
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,500
Your dishes. Please enjoy.

37
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,200
Your Highness,

38
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,860
Gu Qishao went for Her Highness.

39
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:37,740
What?

40
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:38,800
Where is he?

41
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,550
In Physician Gu’s mansion.

42
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,030
It’s bad.

43
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,530
Gu Qishao always

44
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,240
followed Yunxi before.

45
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,570
Will he take this opportunity and do something?

46
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:49,450
No way!

47
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,140
I won’t let him

48
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,360
get any chance.

49
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,030
Where are you going?

50
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,160
We still haven’t eaten anything.

51
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,450
What are you doing?

52
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,770
I told you

53
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:24,250
we can’t be anxious

54
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,190
about this.

55
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,450
Let me do it.

56
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,329
No. Thanks.

57
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:28,130
I will do it myself.

58
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,450
I will do it myself.

59
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,390
Long Feiye doesn’t have too much time.

60
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,500
I have to find the way

61
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,940
to detoxify the poisonous Gu.

62
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,400
Okay.

63
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,840
I will help you.

64
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,820
Han Yunxi,

65
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,740
Feiye is still in poor health

66
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,650
because of you.

67
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,490
But you are

68
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,140
seducing other man here

69
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,190
openly!

70
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,820
You are really

71
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,780
a wanton!

72
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,010
Say it again.

73
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:55,690
So what?

74
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,450
Want to fight? Come on!

75
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,660
Do you think I am afraid?

76
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,250
I will teach you a lesson!

77
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,650
Enough! Stop!

78
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:01,970
Long Feiye now

79
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,370
has nothing to do with me.

80
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,570
Don’t try to insult us.

81
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:05,360
You hear her?

82
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:06,530
I…

83
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,530
How can there be

84
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,730
such a conscienceless person like you?

85
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,450
In order to make you

86
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,490
feel better,

87
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,740
Feiye bears the charge of murder

88
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,870
without any reason.

89
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,200
How can you say this?

90
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,110
What do you mean?

91
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,280
Make it clear.

92
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,030
Fine.

93
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,140
I couldn’t stand it anymore.

94
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,900
It’s not

95
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,680
Feiye who killed your father.

96
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,070
No way.

97
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:34,810
My father died in front of him.

98
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:35,660
Dying in front of him

99
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,030
means he is the killer?

100
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,070
Who is it?

101
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,950
Baili Mingxiang.

102
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,610
Baili Mingxiang?

103
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,320
Why did she do that?

104
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,360
Okay.

105
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,450
I’m gonna

106
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,850
tell you all the details.

107
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:55,640
Are you clear about her whereabouts?

108
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,400
Yes.

109
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,700
Now go

110
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,160
and catch Han Yunxi alive.

111
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,570
She’s Long Feiye’s beloved.

112
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,280
Once we get her,

113
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,050
we can frighten

114
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,740
that traitor Long Feiye.

115
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:09,900
Yes.

116
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,530
So my father

117
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,900
died because of me.

118
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,280
Yunxi,

119
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,700
don't think too much about it.

120
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,900
How can I?

121
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:31,690
I always thought

122
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,290
Long Feiye killed my father.

123
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,170
So I

124
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,830
feel justifiable hating him.

125
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,510
The truth is I wronged him all the time.

126
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,840
But you didn’t know it.

127
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,210
There must be some misunderstanding.

128
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,700
Why did he lie to me?

129
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:44,790
I will go to find him.

130
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,360
Yunxi!

131
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:04,780
Gu Qishao.

132
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,060
Take Yunxi and go.

133
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,450
Go!

134
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:23,700
Come on!

135
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,200
Let him go.

136
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,240
Go after Han Yunxi.

137
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:58,990
Come!

138
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,900
-This way.
-Okay.

139
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:18,800
Be careful.

140
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,670
Let’s go!

141
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:44,820
Quickly!

142
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,280
Feiye.

143
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,460
Someone is trying to kill Han Yunxi!

144
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,030
This way.

145
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:40,900
Come.

146
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,570
The murderers. Catch them!

147
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,530
Sit down. How are you?

148
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,770
I’m fine.

149
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:02,700
I won’t die.

150
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,530
Qishao.

151
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,730
I’m really appreciated

152
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,730
you always risk your life to help me.

153
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,110
I’ve told you many times.

154
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,190
Don’t say “thank you” to me.

155
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,120
If you are really touched,

156
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,820
marry me.

157
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,570
How can you be so playful

158
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,030
at this dangerous moment?

159
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,470
I will treat your wound.

160
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,660
Let me lean on you for a while.

161
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,570
Yunxi.

162
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,870
It’s lucky that you are fine today.

163
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:50,990
But

164
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,780
I’m afraid

165
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,450
I can’t get through.

166
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,400
Your Highness.

167
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,140
His Highness got the trace of the murderers.

168
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,900
He’s taking the guards for hunting.

169
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,300
Have you found Han Yunxi?

170
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,610
Her trace

171
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,670
I knew the last time

172
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,450
is in this region.

173
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,340
Search from door to door.

174
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:12,860
Yes.

175
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,150
Move!

176
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,540
Luckily, your vital organs are fine.

177
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,610
But you bled a lot,

178
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,210
so you have to take some rest.

179
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,360
You are injured.

180
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,670
Are you alright?

181
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:34,690
I’m fine.

182
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:35,400
Let me look.

183
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,280
Don’t bother. I’m fine.

184
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:11,950
Feiye.

185
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,610
They are okay.

186
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,570
Let’s go.

187
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,200
Your Highness.

188
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,180
It’s not like what you saw.

189
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,290
Allow me to explain.

190
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,240
Not necessary.

191
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,150
Since we’ve been divorced,

192
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,400
you can do anything with anybody.

193
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,270
It has nothing to do with me.

194
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,840
Your Highness.

195
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,190
Yunxi.

196
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,610
Are you okay?

197
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,110
Long Feiye,

198
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,740
don’t go too far.

199
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,070
Xifeng.

200
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,780
Your Highness,

201
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,950
please come back to the palace with us.

202
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,550
Let’s go.

203
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,570
Qishao.

204
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:07,820
Leave him.

205
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,450
to me.

206
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,610
Be careful.

207
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,110
Xifeng.

208
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,310
Go back to Physician Gu’s mansion.

209
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,600
Your Highness.

210
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,260
Please don’t make it hard for me.

211
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,790
To Physician Gu’s mansion.

212
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,030
It’s unsafe there.

213
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:26,930
What if

214
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,060
the killers return?

215
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,620
All guards are searching them in the whole city.

216
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,080
They don’t dare to go back.

217
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:33,990
Moreover,

218
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:34,950
your men

219
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,120
are with us, right?

220
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,740
But…

221
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,120
Your Highness, I’m sorry.

222
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,660
Such a serious accident happened in the capital.

223
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,610
But you didn’t appear until now

224
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,650
as the leader of the guards.

225
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,050
What have you been doing?

226
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,130
It’s my fault.

227
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,990
Please punish me, Your Highness.

228
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,300
Go accept the punishment in the Censorate.

229
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,430
Yes. Your Highness.

230
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,150
Feiye.

231
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,200
Look.

232
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,440
Slowly.

233
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,990
Be careful.

234
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,390
Are you alright?

235
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,280
I said

236
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,690
I’m okay.

237
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,610
I won’t die.

238
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,200
Xifeng.

239
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,500
You may leave now.

240
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,700
No.

241
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,650
If His Highness knows

242
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,420
I sent you back to Physician Gu’s mansion,

243
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,700
he’s gonna kill me.

244
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,050
If you don’t go back to report,

245
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,360
he will kill you.

246
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,030
I won’t leave even so.

247
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,030
What’s more,

248
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,660
though there is no assassin here,

249
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,700
I can’t be assured

250
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,870
to leave you here alone.

251
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,110
Xifeng.

252
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,960
You are thinking too highly of me.

253
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,990
I’m injured now.

254
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,740
What do you think I can do?

255
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,410
Didn’t you hear what your prince said?

256
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,670
We have been divorced.

257
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,220
We have nothing to do with each other anymore.

258
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,130
No matter what I do,

259
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,530
it doesn’t matter to him.

260
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,070
Just leave here.

261
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,000
Your Highness.

262
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:13,780
You know

263
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,250
I didn’t mean that.

264
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,030
Get out!

265
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,070
Lie down.

266
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,240
Your Highness.

267
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,520
Where is Han Yunxi?

268
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,860
Her Highness went to Physician Gu’s mansion.

269
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,740
What did you do?

270
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,900
I’m sorry, Your Highness.

271
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,490
She insisted on

272
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,900
going to Physician Gu’s mansion.

273
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,190
I had no other way.

274
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,840
Your Highness.

275
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:07,770
That’s

276
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,100
the bag of Her Highness.

277
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,190
Should we

278
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,900
take it to her?

279
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,740
You are injured.

280
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,270
Are you alright?

281
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,140
I’m fine.

282
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:34,690
Let me look.

283
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,020
Don’t bother. I’m fine.

284
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,400
Since we’ve been divorced,

285
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,610
you can do anything

286
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,450
with anybody.

287
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,670
It has nothing to do with me.

288
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,120
Your Highness.

289
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,530
Yunxi.

290
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:03,990
Yunxi!

291
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:04,780
Qishao.

292
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,090
You are awake.

293
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:05,650
Yunxi!

294
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,450
Come.

295
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,200
Lie down.

296
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,140
How’s Yunxi?

297
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:09,610
Come on.

298
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,650
Lie down.

299
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,110
She is okay now.

300
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,380
I have put some medicine on her.

301
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,700
She’s sleeping now.

302
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,200
That’s good.

303
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,070
Qishao.

304
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,050
I’m sorry

305
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,310
for all that happened.

306
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,240
Today,

307
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,700
I’m really appreciated that you saved her

308
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,900
by risking your life.

309
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,220
Don’t say “thank you” to me anymore.

310
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,540
If you really feel appreciated,

311
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,200
let her

312
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,780
marry me.

313
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,130
Please don’t

314
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,050
play a joke

315
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,310
with the fame of Yunxi.

316
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,110
Don’t be so serious, okay?

317
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,530
Listen.

318
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:48,700
I’m always

319
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,930
risking my life

320
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,110
for my beloved.

321
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,780
I’m an outsider.

322
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,150
But

323
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,860
I still want to say it.

324
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,180
Nobody can force others

325
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,400
to love him.

326
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,990
Just let it go.

327
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,760
Maybe it’s good for everyone.

328
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,359
Look at you.

329
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:06,890
That’s why

330
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,109
you are still single.

331
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,109
Listen.

332
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,030
About love,

333
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,700
nobody knows who will win

334
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,990
until the last moment.

335
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,650
Gods won’t favor

336
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,900
those who give up in the face of difficulties.

337
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,630
In this case,

338
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:23,740
even I lose at last,

339
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,240
I won’t feel regret.

340
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,329
Okay.

341
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:29,460
Say no more about it.

342
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,420
Did you find Traceless Herb?

343
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,240
Here it is.

344
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,000
Your Highness.

345
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,490
The poisonous plague in the Southern Regions

346
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:51,460
has been temporarily under control.

347
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,790
But we have no way to completely remove it.

348
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,420
If we still can’t find the way

349
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,030
within one year,

350
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,290
the poisonous plague

351
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,490
will break out again.

352
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,610
I’m afraid

353
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,730
only about 10 to 20 percent people

354
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:03,990
can live at that time.

355
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,200
Now,

356
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,290
Traceless Herb is the only medicine

357
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,290
can thoroughly control the poison.

358
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,990
Tianhui hasn’t taken any actions.

359
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,700
It’s because he’s waiting for a chance.

360
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,700
But there is only

361
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,340
a small piece of Traceless Herb.

362
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,490
Is it enough to save so many people

363
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:28,890
in the Southern Regions?

364
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,960
Your Highness.

365
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,130
Don’t look down

366
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,650
on the small piece of it.

367
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,370
It grows and absorbs

368
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,320
hundreds of rare herbs,

369
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,470
so it’s very effective.

370
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,010
Dry it first,

371
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,380
and put it in the ventilated place.

372
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,890
A very large area

373
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,620
can be favored by its efficacy.

374
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,950
Then please

375
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,740
dry it as soon as possible

376
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,020
and take it to the Southern Regions.

377
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,880
Your Highness.

378
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,010
Because of

379
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,300
the unique efficacy of the herb,

380
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,060
it’s particular

381
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,250
in the way and time

382
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,490
for backing it.

383
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,980
It can’t work without baking for half a month.

384
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,610
So

385
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,280
I still need time.

386
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,660
Time and tide wait for no man.

387
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,790
It’s the key moment.

388
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,980
Thank you for your hard working.

389
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,620
I can’t claim credit for myself.

390
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,100
This herb was collected

391
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,130
by Gu Qishao

392
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,650
at the risk of his life.

393
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,570
Do you know?

394
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,060
Someone was trying to murder Princess Qin
yesterday.

395
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,810
Seriously?

396
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,210
Why did that happen?

397
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,050
It’s true.

398
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:38,780
I heard Princess Qin

399
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,030
is lightly injured.

400
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,900
I know this.

401
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,810
Princess Qin is indeed injured.

402
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:44,780
It’s no big deal.

403
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,500
Who on earth

404
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,090
were they

405
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,290
who took me back here?

406
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,990
Maybe all that happened

407
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,090
was a trick

408
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,550
of Tianhui and Chu Qingge.

409
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,090
They just used me

410
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:01,900
to go back here

411
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,270
and find a chance to take an action.

412
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,360
Idiots!

413
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,630
Good-for-nothing!

414
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,130
Eunuch Li.

415
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,570
Please give me another chance.

416
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,070
I will redeem.

417
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,570
You’ve already alerted them.

418
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,760
The Gu’s Mansion is now heavily guarded.

419
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:21,970
Do you have another way

420
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,030
to catch Han Yunxi?

421
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:23,890
Let me go

422
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,020
for Baili Mingxiang.

423
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,060
And she will help us

424
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,400
to induce Han Yunxi out.

425
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,700
Baili Mingxiang is

426
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,560
a cunning girl.

427
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,180
I’m afraid she already knew

428
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,570
we cheated her.

429
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,450
Now she’s hiding in the Chief Inspector's Mansion

430
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,620
and doesn’t come out.

431
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,900
What do you mean?

432
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,490
It seems

433
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,360
that I have to do it myself.

434
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,920
Your Highness.

435
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,360
What should we do

436
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,900
now?

437
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,020
Remember, Xifeng.

438
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:54,990
Send our men

439
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,860
to protect Gu’s Mansion.

440
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,540
The most important thing is to protect Yunxi.

441
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,900
-Yes.
-Come back to report

442
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,180
the situation to me every day.

443
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,050
Furthermore, take Madam Zhao

444
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,110
from my mansion,

445
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,810
so that she can take care of Yunxi.

446
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:07,490
Okay.

447
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,650
I will do it right now.

448
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:15,290
How is it going?

449
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:15,780
Feiye.

450
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,000
Did you catch them?

451
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:17,780
No.

452
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,630
I will keep investigating.

453
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,130
It seems

454
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,930
that they were sent from Xijing.

455
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,400
They know

456
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,650
my weak point is Yunxi.

457
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,170
Tianhui

458
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,240
is really too bad.

459
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,070
Feiye,

460
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,090
will we take Yunxi

461
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,010
back to the palace?

462
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,070
In this case, you don’t need to worry.

463
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:44,950
Xifeng.

464
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,330
You should

465
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,730
put this thing like this.

466
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,240
Keep it well

467
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,570
and let Her Highness have it.

468
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,330
This

469
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:55,180
is Her Highness’s favorite

470
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,180
swan neck washing brush of Flowery.

471
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,610
And the thing

472
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,570
in this box is…

473
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:05,530
Madam Zhao.

474
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:06,920
Your Highness,

475
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,140
His Highness let me take care of you.

476
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,490
I’m good.

477
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:11,450
And I don’t need to be taken care of.

478
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,400
You can go back.

479
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,200
Your Highness.

480
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,280
Here is your bag.

481
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:19,780
Thank you.

482
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,600
Your Highness,

483
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,920
you are at odds with His Highness.

484
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,210
So are you also angry

485
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,780
at us servants?

486
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,730
Madam, you are thinking too much.

487
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:30,790
I didn’t mean that.

488
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,260
It’s just because

489
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,920
I’m not Princess Qin anymore,

490
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,610
so I can’t keep

491
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:35,450
letting you serve me.

492
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:36,290
Since you were my master,

493
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,460
you will be my master forever.

494
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,210
You are our master.

495
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:40,180
It’s not because we are from Prince Qin’s Mansion.

496
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,070
Moreover,

497
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,700
His Highness is in bad temper recently.

498
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,380
It’s hard for us to take care of him.

499
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,200
Maybe

500
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,930
it's better for us

501
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,650
to stay here and avoid him.

502
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,970
I took you

503
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,570
your favorite

504
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,780
swan neck washing brush of Flowery

505
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,190
and some clothes.

506
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,450
Okay. Madam.

507
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,050
You can just live as you like.

508
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,820
I’m leaving for my stuff.

509
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,700
Take it.

510
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,170
Why are you up?

511
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,150
Mind your wound.

512
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,200
How do you feel?

513
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,030
Better now?

514
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,110
I’m fine.

515
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,840
Your Highness.

516
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,820
Who is she?

517
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,990
You may call me Madam Zhao.

518
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,090
I heard

519
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,410
you saved

520
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:44,450
Princess.

521
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,610
His Highness especially asked me here

522
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,020
to take care of Her Highness and you.

523
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,010
If there is anything you need,

524
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,700
don't hesitate to ask me.

525
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,530
He has no good intention.

526
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,070
Got a person to watch us.

527
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,400
Childe!

528
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,130
I’m not sure about others.

529
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,210
But I believe our prince

530
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:00,740
won’t be so rude

531
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,150
to Her Highness.

532
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,490
You are a friend

533
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:04,860
of Her Highness.

534
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,370
You really shouldn’t have

535
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,990
spoken ill of His Highness.

536
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,610
The one you called “His Highness”

537
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:10,780
is your master

538
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,990
but not mine.

539
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:12,860
So

540
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,490
I can’t speak evil of him

541
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:15,610
since he is high-powered?

542
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,190
You…

543
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,240
Madam Zhao,

544
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,450
please cook some

545
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,490
light meals.

546
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:23,900
Yes.

547
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,570
Why were you so mean?

548
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,890
Madam Zhao was very good to me

549
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,020
when I was in the Prince Qin’s Mansion.

550
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,010
You should respect her.

551
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:37,570
But she works

552
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:38,610
for Long Feiye.

553
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,410
Madam Zhao is very good,

554
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,740
so don’t make her angry.

555
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:42,990
Yunxi.

556
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,180
What’s wrong?

557
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,920
Have you forgiven Long Feiye?

558
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,180
They are two different things.

559
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,030
That’s good.

560
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,700
I thought you were soft.

561
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,690
I thought you have forgiven him

562
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,420
after he said something good to you.

563
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,620
Stop mentioning him.

564
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,340
Thank you for saving me yesterday.

565
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,740
I’ve told you many times.

566
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,530
I did all that for you

567
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,190
not for “thank you”.

568
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,190
I know

569
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,420
you saved me with sincerity.

570
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,690
Saying “thanks”

571
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,690
is underestimating your kindness.

572
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,360
But if I don’t say it,

573
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,860
I will feel upset.

574
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,570
Qishao,

575
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,420
let's forget about the past

576
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,570
and have a new start

577
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:19,650
from now on, okay?

578
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,370
You told me

579
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:22,730
you have no family

580
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,060
since your mother died.

581
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,030
From now on,

582
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,420
I will be your family,

583
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,280
okay?

584
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,240
Family?

585
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,530
May I say it’s not okay?

586
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,180
Up to now,

587
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,380
I’ve said a lot to you.

588
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,100
Didn’t you feel any about it?

589
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,240
Qishao.

590
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,320
I’m sorry.

591
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,900
But I can’t accept you.

592
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,300
I don’t have enough space

593
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,450
in my mind for you.

594
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,700
If I get along with you

595
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,610
just because I can’t be

596
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:58,020
with Long Feiye any longer,

597
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,280
it’ll be unfair to you.

598
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,380
It’s also unworthy of your sincerity.

599
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,820
I will also hate myself.

600
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,150
Yunxi.

601
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,410
By this time,

602
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:08,070
everything I have done for you

603
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,820
is according to my good will.

604
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,780
I never expect

605
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,360
you can pay me back.

606
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,710
So don’t feel stressed.

607
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,330
I’m unworthy of all your good deeds.

608
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:19,950
You deserve my good deeds.

609
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,450
After my mother died,

610
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,590
you are the first one

611
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,740
treating me

612
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,390
fairly with sincerity.

613
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,280
No disdain.

614
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,740
No attempt.

615
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,570
You

616
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,280
let me know

617
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,480
that I still have the ability to love.

618
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:38,950
So, Yunxi,

619
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,110
don't feel stressed.

620
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,360
If I really meet

621
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,990
the girl who loves me

622
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,450
and I also love her

623
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,530
on one day,

624
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,200
I will just ignore you.

625
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,900
Don’t feel sad

626
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,200
at that moment.

627
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,190
If it really happens,

628
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,090
I will sincerely

629
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,820
give the girl you love my best wishes.

630
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,730
It’s because

631
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:05,790
she is really lucky

632
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,680
to have a good person like you.

633
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,320
Qishao,

634
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,960
you will surely find the girl.

635
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,450
Yunxi.

636
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,760
No matter how good I am,

637
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,520
it’s just meaningless

638
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,650
if the girl is not you.

639
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,360
Let’s go.

640
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,020
We have stayed in the house for a long time.

641
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:30,810
Let’s walk out

642
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,470
and eat something delicious.

643
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,310
They are coming.

644
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,900
Your Highness.

645
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,400
Come and eat something.

646
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,870
-Sit down.
-Be careful.

647
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,250
Qishao, sit down.

648
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,250
It’s all your favorite food.

649
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,240
It’s light.

650
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,530
Where is Zhuyu?

651
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,610
His Highness

652
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,690
sent Zhuyu

653
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,020
to finish a secret task.

654
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,130
She will come back

655
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,260
after finishing it.

656
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,610
Remember,

657
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,420
I entrusted Zhuyu to you.

658
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,820
Don’t let her down.

659
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,380
Don’t worry, Qishao.

660
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:03,990
Yunxi.

661
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,250
Yunxi.

662
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,130
Ningjing.

663
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,130
What brings you here?

664
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,660
They said you were injured.

665
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,070
Are you okay?

666
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,450
I’m fine.

667
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:11,940
Look.

668
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,990
I’m good.

669
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,820
That’s great since you are fine.

670
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,780
Feiye really cares about you a lot.

671
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,310
He even sent Madam Zhao to take care of you.

672
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,860
Don’t let him down.

673
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:33,990
Please.

674
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,860
May I ask who you are?

675
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,200
Eunuch Li?

676
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,360
Exactly.

677
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,320
You can leave here.

678
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,190
Yes.

679
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,660
Eunuch Li, you are here just in time.

680
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,600
May I ask you about something?

681
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,290
Concubine Qing said Han Yunxi

682
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,020
and Feiye were getting married

683
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,260
and holding the ceremony of conferring Queen.

684
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,180
All those are bullshits, right?

685
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:07,790
What’s more,

686
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,570
it’s said

687
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,530
that Bai Xiaochuan’s men saved me.

688
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,990
You arranged those people, right?

689
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,990
Miss Baili, you are really clever.

690
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,200
Nothing can be hidden from you.

691
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,900
Eunuch Li, what’s your purpose

692
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,650
by telling the lies?

693
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,130
To help you

694
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,610
of course.

695
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,200
Help me?

696
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,110
I said

697
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,330
Han Yunxi

698
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:35,130
must be killed with my own hands.

699
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:35,970
Why did you

700
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:37,770
still send people to murder her?

701
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,530
Miss Baili,

702
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,960
you really misunderstood me.

703
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,530
I ordered them to catch

704
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,280
Han Yunxi alive

705
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,170
and send her

706
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,280
to you once they get her.

707
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,650
But I didn’t expect Prince Qin

708
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,320
was eager to protect her

709
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,400
and tried to kill my men.

710
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,220
In order to protect themselves,

711
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,400
they had to

712
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,570
fight back, and caused the mess.

713
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,610
Prince Qin

714
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:08,050
really loves

715
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:10,110
Han Yunxi very much.

716
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,400
He even took a powerful force

717
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,610
to save her just for this small stuff.

718
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,070
He even ordered his men

719
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,700
to surround the Gu’s Mansion for Han Yunxi.

720
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,700
I really have no idea

721
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,570
about the reason

722
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,250
why Prince Qin loves Han Yunxi so much.

723
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,050
Stop talking!

724
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,780
In this case,

725
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,070
only you

726
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,950
can find a way to get Han Yunxi out.

727
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,380
You don’t have to worry about it.

728
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,700
I will have my plan.

729
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,530
Yunxi. Look.

730
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,730
I’ve been recovered.

731
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,350
It’s all because of you.

732
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,900
You are really skillful.

733
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,930
What are you talking about?

734
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,060
You are seriously injured.

735
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:12,780
No.

736
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,140
I’ve been recovered.

737
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:17,860
Look.

738
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:18,740
I’m fine.

739
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,290
Maybe

740
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,890
Traceless Herb took effect.

741
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,820
What a profit by misfortune!

742
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,450
Oh no.

743
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,070
If I’m recovered,

744
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,370
Yunxi may

745
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:32,360
ask me to leave.

746
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,280
Let me take you to walk around.

747
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,820
Sit down.

748
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:44,860
Look.

749
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,580
Don’t show off your ability.

750
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,140
My physical wound is recovered,

751
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,250
but not the internal injury.

752
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,370
Stop thinking anything.

753
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,370
Take a rest.

754
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,030
Okay.

755
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,150
Take me back.

756
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,780
Enough.

757
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,540
They had a quarrel again.

758
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,340
What should I do to help them?

759
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,370
Chu.

760
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:09,610
Have some food.

761
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,450
You little jerk!

762
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,860
You are scaring me.

763
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:17,990
Madam.

764
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,240
Please help me.

765
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,530
His Highness asked me to report

766
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:23,260
the situation of Her Highness.

767
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,360
But

768
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,230
Her Highness and Gu Qishao,

769
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,190
they are…

770
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,030
Should I report it?

771
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,030
If I tell him,

772
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,070
I’m afraid

773
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,790
His Highness will feel sad.

774
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,450
If I don’t report it,

775
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,090
and if Her Highness really falls in love

776
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:39,990
with Gu Qishao,

777
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,900
I can hardly absolve myself from the blame.

778
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,490
From my point of view,

779
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,490
you have to report it

780
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,280
and exaggerate it.

781
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,490
Exaggerate?

782
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,940
Then their relationship will become worse.

783
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,820
Listen.

784
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,330
When you tell him,

785
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:58,530
he will be envious.

786
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,950
Then

787
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,410
he will come

788
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:03,190
and quarrel with Her Highness.

789
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,370
On quarreling,

790
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:05,570
they will make the things clear.

791
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:07,610
Then they will make it up.

792
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:10,010
Then you don’t need to pass on the messages.

793
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,070
Will it

794
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,490
work?

795
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,770
You are all

796
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:18,890
unromantic block heads.

797
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:20,450
Just do as I say.

798
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,070
Okay.

799
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,360
Xifeng.

800
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,970
What’s wrong with you?

801
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:41,370
Why do you wear a sad face?

802
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,210
His Highness asked me

803
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:47,740
to report Her Highness’s situation every day.

804
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,190
But I can’t speak it out.

805
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,410
Tell him the truth.

806
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:52,200
Truth?

807
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,570
Are you sure?

808
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,450
You should

809
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,360
exaggerate it,

810
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,010
so that Feiye can

811
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:06,010
take Yunxi back as soon as possible.

812
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,360
Did you two

813
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:09,989
talk to each other?

814
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:12,400
What do you mean?

815
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,770
I mean if you can’t speak it out,

816
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:16,810
you can write it down.

817
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:17,690
If it still doesn’t work,

818
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:18,650
you can draw it.

819
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:19,900
You know?

820
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,199
Idiot.

821
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:46,980
[About Princess Qin]

822
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,950
You should come out every day

823
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,250
for some fresh air,

824
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,370
then you will recover faster.

825
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,410
Okay.

826
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:10,950
You are like a housewife.

827
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,520
It’s all for your own good.

828
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,210
You are right.

829
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:15,340
I will listen to you.

830
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,240
Qishao,

831
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,650
please excuse us.

832
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,990
Based on our relationship,

833
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:24,650
can’t I be here

834
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,180
under such circumstances?

835
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,610
Go back first.

836
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,190
Well.

837
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,930
If he does anything bad,

838
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:33,730
tell me.

839
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:34,650
I will help you.

840
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,380
What’s wrong?

841
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:44,820
Are you okay

842
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,310
in Physician Gu’s mansion?

843
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,190
Great!

844
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:51,870
That’s fine.

845
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,070
Why did you lie to me?

846
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,240
When did I lie?

847
00:35:59,180 --> 00:35:59,990
Didn’t you?

848
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,330
Why didn’t you tell me

849
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,730
about my father’s death?

850
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:04,970
Why did you

851
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:07,500
take the blame for Baili Mingxiang’s murder?

852
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,190
Tell me!

853
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,920
I have nothing to tell you.

854
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,860
Nothing?

855
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,490
You don’t care

856
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,700
even if we become strangers?

857
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,930
Since it has nothing to do with you

858
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,940
no matter whom I’m with and what we are doing,

859
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,200
why are you here today?

860
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,570
Leave!

861
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:49,450
Feiye.

862
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,060
The forces have been assembled

863
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,860
and are waiting for your orders.

864
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,030
Feiye.

865
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,240
What’s

866
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,030
wrong with you?

867
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:05,650
I’m fine

868
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,150
but a bit tired.

869
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:15,990
Feiye.

870
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,620
How about taking Han Yunxi back?

871
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,140
She’s good living there.

872
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,200
Is she unwilling to come back?

873
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,280
Feiye.

874
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,490
In my opinion,

875
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:32,610
since you love her,

876
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:33,370
you should try hard

877
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,700
to let her stay with you.

878
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,490
Maybe

879
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:37,260
you can coax her and make her happy.

880
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:37,730
How about

881
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:38,940
preparing the surprise for her?

882
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,890
When she feels happy,

883
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,490
everything will be settled.

884
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,240
Or

885
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,180
let me think of it for you.

886
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,190
Girls like this very much.

887
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,400
Surprise?

888
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,960
I will tell Yunxi about it.

889
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,490
Not necessary.

890
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,320
Why?

891
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,990
Don’t you really want her back?

892
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,610
Maybe being with me

893
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,950
hurts her the most.

894
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,140
I can’t understand what you are thinking.

895
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,340
Don’t understand it.

896
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,410
Just focus

897
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,940
on the government affairs.

898
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,780
Leave my affairs alone.

899
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,280
Ningjing.

900
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,870
What are you doing here?

901
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,890
I have good news,

902
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:37,690
so I’m eager

903
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,490
to tell you.

904
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,530
Just now,

905
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,970
I heard Feiye and Tang Li were discussing

906
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:43,400
to give you a surprise.

907
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,810
He must

908
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,540
want to make his peace with you.

909
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,020
You must be wrong.

910
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,360
There is no relationship between us.

911
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,450
He was unwilling to explain

912
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:55,530
my father’s death.

913
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,150
I feel

914
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,700
he must hate my father

915
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,860
for hurting his family.

916
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,170
That’s angry word.

917
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,170
Look.

918
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,250
When he saw

919
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,690
you were with Gu Qishao,

920
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,050
he must be angry.

921
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:08,650
In that case,

922
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:09,890
he just spoke it out without thinking.

923
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,130
The more angry he is,

924
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:12,740
the more care he has.

925
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,180
Even if he cares about me,

926
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,170
I have no way to know him

927
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,450
if he tells me nothing.

928
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,420
I want to shoulder the burden with him,

929
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,290
but he often refuses

930
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,290
to open his heart.

931
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,900
If Feiye wants

932
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,110
to make it up,

933
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,110
are you willing or not?

934
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,460
My father seriously harmed him.

935
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,570
I don’t know how to face him.

936
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:36,740
It seems

937
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,530
that you are no longer the brave

938
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:39,570
Han Yunxi.

939
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,890
At this critical moment,

940
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:43,650
you should be with him.

941
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,600
Unless you don’t want him.

942
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,150
Does he still need me?

943
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,320
If not,

944
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,690
why will he give you a surprise

945
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,420
and ask you to change your mind?

946
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,240
Yunxi.

947
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,030
Give him a chance.

948
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,780
Don’t be angry at him.

949
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,140
You really didn’t hear wrong?

950
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,860
Of course not.

951
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,700
You are looking forward to it, right?

952
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,820
If he is willing,

953
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,360
I’d like to be with him in my lifetime.

954
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,030
Your Highness,

955
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,390
a letter for you.

956
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,320
Letter for me?

957
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,650
Who sent it?

958
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,770
I don’t know.

959
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:30,740
A child put it there and ran away.

960
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,450
See you in the evening

961
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:42,990
in Xuanyuan Temple.

962
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,040
That’s the handwriting of Feiye.

963
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:49,340
I knew

964
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,450
he will ask you out.

965
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,190
What should I do?

966
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,190
Go for it.

967
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,610
Wait.

968
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:00,900
Hold on.

969
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,200
Since it’s a date,

970
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,250
we can’t let the bad guys follow

971
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,650
to break the atmosphere.

972
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,180
I have to find a way

973
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,780
to lead the guards away.

974
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,020
Especially Gu Qishao,

975
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,220
we can’t let him know.

976
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,410
Is it okay?

977
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:16,660
Chu Xifeng is not in today.

978
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,780
I will tell them.

979
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,770
It doesn’t matter.

980
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:21,300
Since the accident happened,

981
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,340
the guards in the city

982
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,200
are doubled.

983
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,930
You even don’t need to lock the door at night.

984
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:27,570
It’s okay.

985
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,110
How can we get rid of them?

986
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,190
Old way.

987
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:06,620
[Xuanyuan Temple]

988
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:02,880
Your Highness.

989
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,320
Your Highness.

990
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,200
Your Highness?

991
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,320
Your Highness?

992
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,650
Your Highness?

993
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,650
Stop looking for him.
