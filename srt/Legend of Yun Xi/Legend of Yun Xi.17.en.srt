[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,240
Mingxiang,

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,300
your writing

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,720
looks like my brother’s.

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,320
They look almost the same.

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:19,900
Brother,

9
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,070
come have a look.

10
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,490
Not good enough.

11
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,280
It looks like the same.

12
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,320
But I can’t

13
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,820
copy Feiye’s soul.

14
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,140
Your Highness.

15
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,280
How is it going?

16
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,350
Your Highness,

17
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,070
I’ve purchased

18
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,150
all the herbs.

19
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:37,110
And

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,490
I put them in the new medicine room

21
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,900
in Pavilion of Leisure.

22
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,200
A medicine room?

23
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,610
Why

24
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,450
is there a medicine room

25
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,310
in the mansion?

26
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,190
Shut it.

27
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,740
We don’t have a physician at home.

28
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,400
Why do we need a medicine room?

29
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,610
Where did Yunxi go?

30
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,520
She seems to have gone to

31
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,610
Yaogui Valley.

32
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,070
That’s why she

33
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,200
put on the makeups.

34
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,989
She went to see a man.

35
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,740
May I ask for leave?

36
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,200
Have you done the writing?

37
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,860
I’m doing it.

38
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,110
You want to do more?

39
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,030
No, please!

40
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,650
I’m on it. I’m on it.

41

[Long Tianqing intends to harm you
through his mother Noble Consort Xiao. Please stay alert.]

Princess. What’s wrong?

44

Madam, look.

45
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,650
The Crown Prince warns me

46
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,450
that Noble Consort Xiao will set me up.

47
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,610
I shall stay alert.

48
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,740
What shall we do?

49
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,780
Shall we report it to His Majesty?

50
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,280
No.

51
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:06,860
Princess,

52
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,280
it’s serious.

53
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,650
It’s life or death.

54
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,820
Madam.

55
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,610
We can’t alert them.

56
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,070
I will think about it.

you drank too much!

111

Not much.

112
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,320
Three cups.

113

Three… three…

114

Three?

115

A terrible drinker had three cups!

Tell Madam Zhao

117

to make hangover soup.

What do you want?

129

He’s a married man.

00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:04,950
Don’t stick

131
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,400
like a glue to him.

132
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,400
They’ll doubt

133
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,200
what you’re expecting.

134
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:09,650
What…

135
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,280
What do I expect?

136

What do you mean?

137
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,340
Nothing. Nothing.

138

You haven’t done your reading.

139

Go do your reading.

140

-No, my brother…
-Go!

141
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,400
-I… You…
-Go!

142
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,590
What are you doing?

143
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,070
I wanna have your son!

144
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,200
Where did you learn

145
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,260
these nasty words?

146
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,530
It’s not nasty.

147
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,820
I will have your son,

148
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,360
and that Baili Mingxiang

149
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,280
will stay away.

150
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,510
I hate you for staying with her.

151
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,200
Why?

152
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,570
Why for what?

153
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,650
Why do you hate

154
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,530
I stay with her?

155
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,150
Because…

156
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,860
Because…

157
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,150
Stand!

158
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,570
Take her!

159
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,110
Yes!

160
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,110
-Mother!
-Go!

161
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,000
-Mother!
-Go!

162
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,730
Don’t take my mother!

163
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:03,950
Mother!

164
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,490
Mother!

165
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,950

Mother! Don’t go!

168
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,610
Don’t take my mother, please!

169
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,030
Mother!

170
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,150

Don’t go!

172

Don’t go!

173
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,280
I won’t.

174
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,549
I’m going nowhere.

175
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,530
Miss Baili, good morning.

176
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,990
Good morning.

177
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,400
Miss,

178
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,400
you got up so early.

179
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,490
Feiye doesn’t

180
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,190
look very well.

181
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,280
I’ll make some invigorator for him.

182
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,320
You’re so considerate.

183
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:15,320
You don’t

184
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,240
have to though.

185
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,450
Why is that?

186
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,070
You don’t know.

187
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,070
Her Highness is

188
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,480
a wonderful physician.

189
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,110
She will take good care of

190
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,900
His Highness.

191
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,360
That’s good.

192
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,200
Nevertheless,

193
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
I heard that in the wedding,

194
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,190
Feiye didn’t

195
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,280
kick the sedan.

196
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,070
That’s to say Yunxi

197
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,190
only gets the title of Princess Qin.

198
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,150
That’s true.

199
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,200
I thought so

200
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,070
in the beginning.

201
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,200
As the saying goes,

202
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,450
first come first served.

203
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,820
Love

204
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,780
is something that grows.

205
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,150
His Highness loves

206
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,900
Her Highness more and more.

207
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,780
Everyone sees it.

208
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,740
You know,

209
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,900
His Highness

210
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,650
accompanied Her Highness

211
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,870
in her home revisit.

212
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,740
That’s to say,

213
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,780
His Highness

214
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,200
takes her as his lawful wife.

215
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,900
Madam,

216
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,390
I’m afraid I can’t agree.

217
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,740
Feiye always

218
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,530
aims very high.

219
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,280
Yunxi’s background

220
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,110
is below his line.

221
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,570
Miss Mingxiang,

222
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,450
the men-women affair

223
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,860
is too complex

224
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,030
to comment.

225
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,190
It is about fate.

226
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,320
Their fate

227
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,150
is up to

228
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,530
my aunt’s approval.

229
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,360
The fact is,

230
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,490
my fair lady,

231
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,740
it was said last night

232
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,780
Her Highness was drunk

233
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,190
and His Highness took her

234
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,280
to his room over the night.

235
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,070
Maybe next year Prince Qin’s Mansion

236
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,990
will have a young prince.

237
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,780
Your aunt will accept

238
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,360
her baby and her as well.

239
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,650
Even if they didn’t sleep together,

240
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,360
Her Highness

241
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,820
is so smart that

242
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,190
I believe

243
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,110
she’ll honor the title

244
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,780
sooner or later.

245
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,990
Excuse me, Miss Mingxiang,

246
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,780
I’m going to work.

247
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,740
I’ll leave now.

248
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,360
Han Yunxi,

249
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,820
I did underestimate you.

250
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:36,990
Your Highness.

251
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,570
She’s sleeping.

252
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,400
Come over later.

253
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:45,820
Yes.

254
00:11:45,460 --> 00:12:07,500
[Mingyue Chamber]

255
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,280
Quiet down.

256
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,740
Her Highness is

257
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,610
sleeping in the room.

258
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,150
I’ll make invigorator soup.

259
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,990
Her Highness will need it.

260
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,110
His Highness loves her so much.

261
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,740
Yes.

262
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,550
Her Highness loves him as well.

263
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,700
So sweet!

264
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,530
Move!

265
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,320
That’s Her Highness’s stuff!

266
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,070
You!

267
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,240
Move up!

268
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,690
Make everything ready!

269
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,820
Yes.

270
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,150
That’s my stuff.

271
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,320
You’re awake?

272
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,800
You’ll live in this room,

273
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,880
so will your stuff.

274
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,650
Who told you that?

275
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,070
Last night

276
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,770
you grasped his hand and said,

277
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,700
“I wanna have your son!”

278
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,780
Didn’t you?

279
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:44,990
And

280
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,650
you were so imposing.

281
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,530
“Hey, you witch,

282
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,360
back to where you came from!

283
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,650
Tonight

284
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,030
I’ll take this man

285
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,320
to my place and

286
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,070
make him my husband!”

287
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,240
No way!

288
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,200
I couldn’t have done that.

289
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,460
That’s embarrassing.

290
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,740
I…

291
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,450
I’m not living here.

292
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,320
Are you an idiot?

293
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,070
Are you telling me

294
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,470
that you’re moving back?

295
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:10,570
It…

296
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,360
It was too embarrassing.

297
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:13,280
I just can’t

298
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,450
face Long Feiye.

299
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,740
If he comes

300
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,530
and throws me and my stuff out,

301
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,450
it’d be a shame!

302
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:21,380
He would have

303
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,030
thrown you out last night.

304
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,900
It’s a chance to prove it.

305
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,200
If he does love you,

306
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,030
you will

307
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,110
be living in this room.

308
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,530
Yunxi, you’re awake?

309
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,070
I told the kitchen

310
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,450
to make you hangover soup.

311
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,580
It’ll soon be ready.

312
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:34,740
Thank you.

313
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,030
Please,

314
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:36,900
do not get drunk

315
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,280
in the mansion again.

316
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,740
If my aunt knows,

317
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,860
you’ll be in trouble.

318
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,490
My aunt

319
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,990
hates drunkard.

320
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:43,900
I remember

321
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,280
Feiye once got drunk

322
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,740
and she punished him.

323
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,320
He got drunk?

324
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,610
Only once.

325
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,740
Since then Feiye

326
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,860
seldom drinks.

327
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,240
What did he look like?

328
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:55,740
Well,

329
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,570
I’ll tell you

330
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,450
next time.

331
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,240
Say or not say.

332
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,740
Are you showing off?

333
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,650
I’m not showing off.

334
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,030
I just mentioned it.

335
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,070
Everyone has sweet memories.

336
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,030
Yet everyone

337
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,570
has to look forward.

338
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,070
Future

339
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,360
is where your hope rests.

340
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,860
Miss Baili,

341
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,950
do you agree?

342
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:20,610
It depends on

343
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,410
whether you have a future or not.

344
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,650
Have a good rest.

345
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,570
Goodbye.

346
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,320
She is

347
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,900
indeed a killjoy.

348
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,150
That was a challenge.

349
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,900
Are you moving out?

350
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,240
I will stay!

351
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,420
Why are you here?

352
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,240
I…

353
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,950
I will live here.

354
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,700
Move your stuff

355
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,570
out of the room.

356
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,490
No!

357
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,570
Who am I?

358
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,570
Are you an idiot?

359
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,990
I’m Princess Qin.

360
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,450
All this territory belongs to the king.

361
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,610
All this mansion

362
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,150
belongs to Princess Qin.

363
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,490
So,

364
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,530
I’ll live wherever I want to.

365
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,190
So

366
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,350
where will you sleep?

367
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,200
I’ll sleep where

368
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,400
I slept last night.

369
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,630
Where will I sleep?

370
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,190
There.

371
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,150
Do you

372
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,240
mean you want

373
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,700
to sleep with me?

374
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,410
I’ll take the couch.

375
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,110
Anyway,

376
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,150
I will not leave this room.

377
00:15:59,150 --> 00:15:59,740
This is about

378
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,140
Princess Qin’s dignity.

379
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,360
I will not leave,

380
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:04,490
unless

381
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,240
I give up the title.

382
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,280
How was it?

383
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,530
Did he say yes?

384
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:33,740
I thought

385
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,990
he’d kick you out.

386
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,490
But I was wrong.

387
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,530
And you moved me in?

388
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,570
I gave you a push.

389
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,530
Prove whether he

390
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:42,740
loves you or not.

391
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,240
I threatened him,

392
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,860
or he’d have kicked me out.

393
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,570
Nothing.

394
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,610
Anyway,

395
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,950
you’re awesome.

396
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,320
In just few months,

397
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,740
you conquered a man

398
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,820
who was an ice cake

399
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,400
and had no interest in woman.

400
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,450
How did you do that?

401
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,240
Teach me!

402
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,070
So far I haven’t

403
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,490
got Tang Li yet.

404
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,190
I’m a legend.

405
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,530
You’re not.

406
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,280
As for how,

407
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,190
it can be sensed,

408
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,349
not explained.

409
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,569
To have his son.

410
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,070
What brings you to my Qinghui Hall,

411
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:33,950
sister?

412
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:35,990
Why?

413
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:36,990
Do I have to

414
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,320
have an excuse?

415
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,650
Am I not welcomed?

416
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,110
You always are.

417
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,150
I’m alone in the palace.

418
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,600
Princess Changbing

419
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,900
sometimes comes to me.

420
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,260
Nobody else.

421
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,970
It’s nice to have you

422
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,610
and help me kill time.

423
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,860
Good.

424
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,320
I’d like to

425
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
come from time to time.

426
00:17:59,070 --> 00:17:59,820
Right,

427
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,600
the chef in my kitchen

428
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,320
makes good desserts.

429
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,400
I always

430
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:05,200
share with

431
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,860
the concubines in the palace.

432
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,950
You’ve been here for long

433
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,360
and I haven’t

434
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,740
given you a gift.

435
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,610
I brought you some.

436
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,610
Hope you like it.

437
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:19,150
It is a

438
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,900
small gift though.

439
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,820
It’s your warm heart.

440
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,190
My sincere

441
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,410
gratitude, sister.

442
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,400
We’re sisters.

443
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,860
Save the proprieties.

444
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:47,990
Please,

445
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,400
have some tea.

446
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,400
Bitch!

447
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,580
His Majesty goes to her everyday

448
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,150
and she said she’s alone.

449
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,030
Damn it!

450
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,110
I have to take this.

451
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,150
Your bluff won’t last long.

452
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,190
Yunxi’s hangover

453
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,950
pays off well.

454
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,150
Miss Ningjing,

455
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,450
that’s true.

456
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,570
Because

457
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,990
His Highness loves her.

458
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,740
How do you know?

459
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,070
You’re still young.

460
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,990
When you get to my age,

461
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,240
you’ll know.

462
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,950
Men

463
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,650
do not cherish their women.

464
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,530
Make them feel the threat

465
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,650
and they’ll cherish you.

466
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,490
Threat?

467
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,650
Yes.

468
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,650
When they notice

469
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,570
they have challengers,

470
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,320
they’ll feel the threat.

471
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,610
Challengers?

472
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,990
Feiye doesn’t have a challenger.

473
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,200
Look,

474
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:47,650
Her Highness

475
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,740
drank with a man

476
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,320
and got terribly drunk.

477
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:51,780
That means

478
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,700
she trusts that man.

479
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,740
She and that man

480
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,320
at least

481
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,070
are bosom friends.

482
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,400
His Highness must have felt the threat.

483
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:06,240
You mean he was jealous?

484
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,150
He didn’t show his jealousy.

485
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,650
If he didn’t feel the threat,

486
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,820
His Highness

487
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,860
does not care about her at all.

488
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,970
Think about it,

489
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:18,900
no man can

490
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,150
put up with this.

491
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,360
Sounds reasonable.

492
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,500
[Hongfu Inn]

493
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,150
Waiter,

494
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,570
one more, please.

495
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,320
Yes.

496
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:37,280
Yes,

497
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,570
upstairs.

498
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,570
Miss Ningjing,

499
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,110
I’m at work.

500
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,200
I can’t drink.

501
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,580
Do you want to tell me something?

502
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:46,700
No.

503
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,720
-I just wanna have a drink with you.
-Waiter!

504
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,980
-My wine.
-Coming.

505
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,490
You may drink with Tang Li.

506
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,150
I’ll leave now.

507
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:54,990
No.

508
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,030
Sit down.

509
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,740
Tell me,

510
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,700
are we friends?

511
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:01,700
We…

512
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,950
-I’m afraid not.
-You…

513
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,530
You’d better go to Tang Li.

514
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:09,820
Why shall I go to him?

515
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,400
He’s hiding from me.

516
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,200
He won’t take me for shopping.

517
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:15,900
Anyway,

518
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:16,890
I unilaterally

519
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,820
take you as my friend.

520
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,200
You have to stay here with me.

521
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,530
I may get drunk.

522
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,190
You’ll take me home.

523
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,190
Get drunk?

524
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,070
My fair lady.

525
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,320
You’d better stop now

526
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,520
before you get drunk.

527
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:29,900
We have an agreement that

528
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,830
we’ll have a meal

529
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,450
and then

530
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:32,630
I’ll take you back.

531
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,900
If anything bad happens,

532
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:36,780
Prince Qin will punish me.

533
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,400
I can’t take the responsibility.

534
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,030
A coward.

535
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:42,450
Physician Gu.

536
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,030
We’ve got new dishes.

537
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,640
Would you like to have some?

538
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:46,240
Please,

539
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,360
this way.

540
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,620
Physician Gu.

541
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:51,830
Physician Gu.

542
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,050
Physician Gu, join us, please.

543
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,610
Mr. Chu,

544
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,530
this is…

545
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,070
-She’s…
-I’m Prince Qin’s schoolmate.

546
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,240
My name is Ouyang Ningjing.

547
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,780
Last time when you went to Prince Qin’s Mansion

548
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,990
to diagnose Yunxi,

549
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:09,990
we’ve met.

550
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,570
Miss Ouyang.

551
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:13,860
Nice to meet you.

552
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,110
Call me Ningjing, please.

553
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,570
Waiter,

554
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,570
one more cup.

555
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,450
Take a seat.

556
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:23,780
Xifeng,

557
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:25,990
you may leave now.

558
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,360
Are you kidding me?

559
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,650
If I leave now,

560
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,400
how could I explain to Tang Li?

561
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,450
Do not explain.

562
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:36,570
If I get drunk,

563
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,180
Physician Gu will take care of me.

564
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,150
Well…

565
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,190
I haven’t eaten yet.

566
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,390
Let’s finish the meal

567
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:47,950
and then

568
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,860
I’ll take you back.

569
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,450
Yes. Yes.

570
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,450
You’ve got too many excuses!

571
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,280
I said you are not supposed

572
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,200
to be here now!

573
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,240
Go, now!

574
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:00,910
Physician Gu.

575
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,490
Mr. Chu!

576
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:12,610
Physician Gu.

577
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,570
I feel like we are old friends.

578
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,360
Cheers!

579
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:19,030
Cheers!

580
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,150
Physician Gu,

581
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,610
do you have a family?

582
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,150
I’m single.

583
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,860
You’re a smart man

584
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,150
with grace

585
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,490
and purity.

586
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,360
Actually,

587
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,360
I’m just too busy

588
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,150
to meet a good girl.

589
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,190
You

590
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,700
don’t look like a playboy.

591
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,280
To you!

592
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,360
Thanks.

593
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:47,570
Cheers.

594
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,030
Miss Ningjing,

595
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,150
is there anything

596
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,150
annoying you?

597
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:01,280
Annoying me?

598
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,700
Not at all.

599
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,240
We’re good friends.

600
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,190
I’m happy.

601
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,490
So why do you hide here

602
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,040
and indulge yourself?

603
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,240
I’m not hiding.

604
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,950
I fear nothing, alright?

605
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,190
You know,

606
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,360
I’ll tell you a story.

607
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:19,700
When I was little,

608
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,450
I had a fight with a bastard.

609
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,030
He found a mouse

610
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,320
and put it in my bed.

611
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,450
A mouse, so cute.

612
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,190
How could it scare me?

613
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,150
But

614
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,450
I couldn’t look into his expecting eyes.

615
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:33,030
I pretended to be scared.

616
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:34,360
And,

617
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,530
in a few days,

618
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,740
I found a snake

619
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,060
and put it on his neck.

620
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,650
He was deadly scared.

621
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,700
Since then,

622
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,650
he never dares to scare me.

623
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,280
You

624
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,650
and that bastard…

625
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,990
Only I can call him bastard.

626
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,170
His name is Tang Li.

627
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,980
You can’t call him bastard.

628
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,190
Yes, yes.

629
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:00,540
You two have a great relationship.

630
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,030
Yes, we are.

631
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:04,030
But he's grown up

632
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,890
and doesn’t listen to me.

633
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,070
I saw her hand

634
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,320
on Gu Beiyue’s thigh,

635
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,200
touching.

636
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,410
Ningjing flirts with Gu Beiyue?

637
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,240
No.

638
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,280
I didn’t say that.

639
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,240
She’s just

640
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,070
being warm.

641
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,860
Why does she do that?

642
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,610
I’ve never been in love.

643
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,650
I don’t know.

644
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,190
So I came to tell you.

645
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,240
Did she…

646
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,900
did she send you here?

647
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,860
She told me not to tell you.

648
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,700
She knew you would come to tell me.

649
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,400
She must be

650
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,700
making a frame on me.

651
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,210
Is it possible that

652
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,070
Ningjing

653
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,190
has a crush on Gu Beiyue?

654
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,200
So she invited him,

655
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,780
trying to express her feelings

656
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,320
after drinking?

657
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,530
Not possible.

658
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,740
They just know

659
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,650
each other.

660
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,570
Express her feelings?

661
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,650
It is possible.

662
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,040
Haven’t you heard that

663
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,570
love

664
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:13,190
sometimes

665
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,530
comes in a moment?

666
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,480
Haven’t you ever been in love?

667
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:18,650
It’s none of your…

668
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,650
Anyhow, I advise you

669
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,950
to go and take a look.

670
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,990
The fact is that they’re drinking.

671
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:24,780
If Miss Ningjing

672
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,490
gets hurt,

673
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:26,780
you’ll be sorry.

674
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:39,860
Miss Ningjing,

675
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,200
don’t drink anymore.

676
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,320
I’m fine.

677
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,530
Ouyang Ningjing!

678
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,570
A lady is

679
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,610
drinking in public.

680
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,490
That’s ridiculous!

681
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,530
I’m fine.

682
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:57,860
I’m with a good friend, Gu Beiyue.

683
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,600
I’m fine.

684
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,860
He’s brilliant and brave.

685
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,490
I’m fine.

686
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,320
Miss Ningjing, you flattered me.

687
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:04,200
Well,

688
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,610
the Imperial Hospital needs me.

689
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:06,610
Nice to meet you.

690
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,320
No, no! No!

691
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,610
Don’t go!

692
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:12,240
We’re good friends.

693
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:13,320
Let’s drink.

694
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,280
Enough!

695
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:15,450
Why?

696
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:17,450
I have many friends.

697
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:18,150
Alright?

698
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:18,900
Friends?

699
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:19,950
Friends that

700
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,350
hold each other’s hands?

701
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,740
I just like to!

702
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,240
You bastard leave us alone!

703
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:25,860
You…

704
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:30,360
Well,

705
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,150
Miss Ningjing,

706
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,210
you’ve had enough.

707
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,200
Nice to meet you.

708
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,240
You…

709
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:42,950
Do you know that was dangerous?

710
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,410
Do you know that Gu Beiyue?

711
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,700
Tang Li,

712
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:50,570
are you jealous?

713
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,200
I’m not!

714
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,280
You’re not? Fine.

715
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:55,820
Beiyue

716
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,200
is a good man.

717
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,240
I’ll ask for another date.

718
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,990
Up to you!

719
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,030
Are you drunk or not?

720
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,030
I wanna more.

721
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:08,820
You wanna more?

722
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,030
Come on!

723
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,110
Drink more!

724
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,570
Drink! Drink! Drink!

725
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,390
Alright.

726
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,540
Shall we cease the war?

727
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,360
What do you mean?

728
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:45,990
My brother has a big plan.

729
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,650
He’s in need of hands.

730
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,150
When his dream comes true,

731
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,200
I’ll go to Yunkong Academy

732
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,460
and give you an answer.

733
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,820
You promise?

734
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,860
I promise.

735
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:01,740
What?

736
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:03,820
Pinky swears.

737
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,980
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

738
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,990
Ancient sages who must rule his nation well

739
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,860
wanted to disseminate virtue

740
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,790
must first rule his nation well.

741
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,400
To rule his nation well,

742
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,330
he must first rule his feud well.

743
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,860
To rule his feud well,

744
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:33,080
he must first cultivate his morality.

745
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,610
To cultivate his morality,

746
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,110
he must first set his ideas to rights.

747
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:47,070
To set his ideas to rights.

748
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:49,940
It seems that your ideas

749
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,450
are not here.

750
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,520
Brother.

751
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,490
This book

752
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:55,610
is all about

753
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,520
morality, governance and ruling.

754
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,030
I can even recite it backwards fluently.

755
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,190
I don’t have to read it any more.

756
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,390
Recite it backwards?

757
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,450
You are

758
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:03,780
strong enough to govern

759
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,440
and to rule?

760
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,150
You are, brother.

761
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,530
Right, brother.

762
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,990
It’s the lantern festival tomorrow evening.

763
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:11,070
There will be a good view and foods.

764
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,240
Are we going?

765
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:13,890
Your Highness.

766
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,500
Are you free tomorrow night?

767
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:17,860
Why?

768
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,520
It’s the lantern festival.

769
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,030
I wanna go to it with you.

770
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,030
Will you be free?

771
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,780
He’s too busy every day

772
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,360
to take you to the lanterns.

773
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,900
He needs a break.

774
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,360
Your Highness, take a one-night break.

775
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,160
Get new energy

776
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,190
for more works.

777
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,610
Han Yunxi.

778
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,780
He is very busy.

779
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:39,900
Please go away.

780
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:40,990
I am reading.

781
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,310
Your Highness.

782
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,030
Since I had

783
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,400
the carbuncle on my face,

784
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,730
I haven't been out much,

785
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:47,650
especially to bustling place.

786
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:48,490
For more than ten years,

787
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,090
I haven’t seen the lanterns.

788
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,450
Your Highness,

789
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,820
if it’s not urgent,

790
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,610
could you go with me?

791
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,530
What time?

792
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:00,990
8 p.m.

793
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:01,610
8 p.m.,

794
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,600
I’ll be waiting on Zhuque Bridge.

795
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,200
Thank you, Your Highness.

796
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,190
See you there.

797
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:26,680
Brother!

798
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:27,960
Are you alright?

799
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,490
Yes.

800
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:35,510
That was close.

801
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,210
You are now

802
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,740
in high poison crisis.

803
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,780
You’d better

804
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,160
not go out at this time.

805
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,130
Tomorrow I’ll meet Mr. Situ.

806
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,400
I need to win him over.

807
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,320
I must go to him.

808
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:51,610
So skip the lanterns

809
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:52,540
tomorrow night.

810
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:53,630
If you transformed

811
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,530
in the festival,

812
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:56,130
you’d shock the entire city.

813
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:57,900
Don’t worry.

814
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,070
I can manage.

815
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,450
I’ll go to Mingxiang.

816
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:06,740
Hope she has made ready

817
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,780
the suppressor.

818
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,820
It’s ready.

819
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:37,860
The drug in my blood

820
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,590
reaches the required density.

821
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,740
Two days later,

822
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,700
His Highness will have the cure.

823
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,190
That’s great.

824
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,400
Right,

825
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:46,570
Xifeng told me

826
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,740
that brother has got Poison Master’s

827
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,240
Poisoning Manual.

828
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,220
Did you read it?

829
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,570
I did.

830
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,150
It’s just a manual.

831
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:54,550
Poison Master must

832
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:55,400
be a madman.

833
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:56,950
It’s graffiti.

834
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,670
I don’t understand it at all.

835
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,780
I’m sure

836
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,490
we’ll make it this time.

837
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,030
My Beauty Blood

838
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,610
will heal Feiye.

839
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:08,400
Thank you.

840
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:10,990
I’m leaving.

841
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,110
Your Majesty!

842
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,200
Rise.

843
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,620
Thanks, Your Majesty!

844
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:42,490
Now

845
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,900
Poison Master’s location

846
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:46,450
is exposed.

847
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,190
Our spies to Beili sent message.

848
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,140
They’ve got information

849
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,780
about Poison Master.

850
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:55,950
The dungeon structure

851
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,490
was also exposed.

852
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,780
Too many eyes are on

853
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,780
Poison Master.

854
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,570
It’s dangerous.

855
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,780
I am using Tianqing

856
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,150
as a detour.

857
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,239
Nevertheless it’s makeshift.

858
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,739
To stay a step ahead,

859
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,610
I will take the action.

860
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,850
You’re my men of sacrifice.

861
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:19,489
This action

862
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,280
cannot be failed!

863
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,699
We pledge our lives! Your majesty

864
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,190
I am having

865
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,900
three dungeons built

866
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,330
to move Poison Master.

867
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,610
Your mission is

868
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,989
to detour

869
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,780
the eyes on Poison Master.

870
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:39,989
You will not only

871
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:42,780
move Poison Master,

872
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,199
but also neutralize

873
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,280
all enemies

874
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:49,449
hiding in the dark!

875
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:51,570
Yes, Your Majesty!

876
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,070
Go!

877
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,070
Yes!

878
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,490
Long Feiye.

879
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:08,200
I will check out

880
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,650
whether

881
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,240
you’re interested in

882
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:13,280
Poison Master or not.

883
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,540
Your Majesty,

884
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,650
Concubine Qing is poisoned.

885
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,360
What?

886
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:47,220
The poison is hard to detoxify.

887
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,610
His Majesty arrives!

888
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,660
Your Majesty.

889
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,150
-Your Majesty. Thanks, Your Majesty.
-Rise.

890
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:00,990
Did you

891
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,710
figure out what poison it is?

892
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:03,750
Your Majesty.

893
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,360
We found a mixture

894
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:06,740
of various poisons

895
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,780
in her blood.

896
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,200
I’ve let out

897
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,760
the contaminated blood.

898
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,070
Her Highness is safe for now.

899
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,450
But there are poison residuals in her.

900
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,400
I can’t find the cure yet.

901
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,150
You mean

902
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,580
you don’t know what the poison is

903
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:23,740
and there is no cure?

904
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,190
None of the imperial physicians

905
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,240
know what it is?

906
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,900
Where’s Han Cong’an?

907
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,320
He’s the Chief Physician.

908
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,610
How come my beloved woman is poisoned

909
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:38,610
and he is not here?

910
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:39,410
Your Majesty.

911
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:41,280
Mr. Han is sick.

912
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,360
He asked for a sick leave.

913
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:44,950
He’s at home.

914
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:46,700
Li Quan!

915
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,200
Your Majesty.

916
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,400
Go bring him

917
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:50,990
as long as he’s breathing!

918
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:51,700
Yes.

919
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:53,410
Your Majesty,

920
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:55,570
Princess Qin is Mr. Han’s daughter.

921
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:56,990
It seems

922
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,610
that she’s good at poison.

923
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,650
General Mu was poisoned

924
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,190
and she healed him.

925
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:03,320
I suppose,

926
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:05,150
since Mr. Han is sick,

927
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,450
maybe Princess Qin

928
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:07,610
could help.

929
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:09,900
My order!

930
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,450
Summon Princess Qin

931
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,280
to heal Concubine Qing.

932
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:15,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

933
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,820
Leave, all of you.

934
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,200
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

935
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:28,990
Darling.

936
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:30,950
Your Majesty.

937
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:33,070
What happened to you?

938
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:43,570
Your Majesty…

939
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:44,780
Why?

940
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,780
Untold pains?

941
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:51,830
Your Majesty,

942
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:53,970
today Noble Consort Xiao

943
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,330
visited Qinghui Hall.

944
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,130
After Noble Consort Xiao left,

945
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,740
Her Highness was poisoned.

946
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,650
Fortunately I noticed her in time

947
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:01,740
and called physicians,

948
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,450
or…

949
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,190
Madam, shut up!

950
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:06,780
Darling.

951
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:09,410
Your Majesty.

952
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,820
Sister Xiao

953
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,320
brought me dessert

954
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,030
and we had a cup of tea.

955
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,200
There is no proof.

956
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,720
Don’t accuse her, Madam.

957
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,700
There is no proof.

958
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,070
I will find the proof.

959
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,030
Servant!

960
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,990
Dig it out

961
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,190
who have been to Qinghui Hall.

962
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,320
I’ll find out

963
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:32,200
who dares to murder my woman.

964
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,240
Yes.

965
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,610
I’m on it.

966
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,220
Darling, how do you feel?

967
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,950
Are you alright?

968
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,950
I will do you justice.

969
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,030
Don’t worry.

970
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,740
I have some pains.

971
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,990
It’s alright.

972
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:54,530
I can take it.

973
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,390
Darling, take it for now.

974
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,820
I promise you’ll be safe.

975
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,900
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

976
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:19,970
How about this one?

977
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:22,240
It’s beautiful,

978
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,700
but not eye-catching.

979
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,110
Yunxi,

980
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,450
today is your first

981
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:27,990
date with Feiye.

982
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,190
You must make yourself

983
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,820
look special.

984
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,530
Pretty lanterns and a pretty girl.

985
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:34,360
You must make him

986
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,150
remember tonight for all his life.

987
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,740
I don’t expect all his life.

988
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,900
I expect tonight.

989
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:45,860
Yunxi,

990
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:46,950
what’s that?

991
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,400
It looks delicate.

992
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,310
This is Flowery’s

993
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,310
new facial brush.

994
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,450
In shape of a swan.

995
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:53,650
It is delicate.

996
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,030
White jade with gold.

997
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,030
Is it

998
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,570
exclusive to beautiful girls?

999
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,320
Yes.

1000
00:39:58,450 --> 00:39:59,820
It’s yours if you like it.

1001
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,150
So I’m a pretty girl.

1002
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,390
Your Highness.

1003
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,360
His Majesty’s order.

1004
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,240
You’ll receive the order in the hall.

1005
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,490
An order?

1006
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:11,240
An order at this moment?

1007
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,990
His Majesty’s order

1008
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,780
to Princess Qin.

1009
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:23,240
Princess Qin is summoned to the palace

1010
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,280
to diagnose Concubine Qing.

1011
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:28,900
Yes.

1012
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,000
Your Highness, please rise.

1013
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:37,700
Your Highness,

1014
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,900
Princess Qin

1015
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,990
will go to the palace now.

1016
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:46,900
She’s a little girl.

1017
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:48,710
She’s not a physician.

1018
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,900
Is it a mistake, Eunuch Li?

1019
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:52,950
Your Highness,

1020
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:55,280
how dare I make

1021
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:56,820
such a mistake?

1022
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:58,360
Concubine Qing

1023
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,190
is poisoned.

1024
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:06,990
Poisoned?

1025
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:08,780
Mother,

1026
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:09,450
I’m sure

1027
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:10,700
I can heal her.

1028
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:17,950
You’re too young.

1029
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,740
Concubine Qing is noble

1030
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:22,280
and is Xiqiu’s Princess.

1031
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,610
If you fail and cause war

1032
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,820
between two states,

1033
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,530
even Feiye can’t protect you.

1034
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:27,650
I’ll heal her.

1035
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:28,400
I won’t bring trouble

1036
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,930
to mother and His Highness.

1037
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,780
You…

1038
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:33,240
Mother,

1039
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,190
trust me.

1040
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,320
I’ll be back soon.

1041
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:36,320
I’ll go to the lanterns

1042
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,380
with His Highness.

1043
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:42,240
Alright.

1044
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:43,530
Take care.

1045
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:44,900
Take good care.

1046
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,150
Thank you, Your Highness.
