3
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,820
You owe nothing

4
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,700
to this world.

5
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:25,780
I know

6
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,300
you won’t be so cruel to me.

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,220
Forgive me

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,320
for making this decision.

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,500
Because this is the best

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,580
for both of us.

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,740
Don’t be afraid.

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,580
I won’t let you die.

13
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,020
I know you want me to live.

14
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,860
But you’re the only man

15
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,060
I love.

16
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:48,860
If you die,

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,700
I will have no one

18
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,660
to love anymore in this world.

19
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:54,740
I will spend every day

20
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,380
in the pain of losing you.

21
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,860
You can’t be so cruel to me.

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,380
I’m going to Qishao now.

23
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,460
Don’t know if he will

24
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,239
help draw blood from my heart.

25
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,620
If he doesn’t help,

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,900
I’ll do it myself.

27
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,260
I will save you

28
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,340
either way.

29
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,500
Wait for me.

30
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,140
What are you doing?

31
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,220
If you promise me to save His Highness,

32
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,539
I’ll promise you anything.

33
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:26,800
What do I need a dead woman’s promise for?

34
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,229
What are you doing? Put the knife down.

35
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,630
Gu Qishao, listen to me.

36
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:40,420
If His Highness dies,

37
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,479
I will kill myself.

38
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,020
You’re crazy!

39
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,020
This is a potion I made.

40
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,740
I count the rest on you.

41
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,340
After I die,

42
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,860
draw blood from my heart.

43
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,140
I beg you. No!

44
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,780
No!

45
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,420
No!

46
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,780
No!

Poison girl! Poison girl! Poison girl!

48
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,860
Are you stupid?

49
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,980
Why did you do that?

50
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,060
Why did you do that to me?

51
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,140
Qishao,

52
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,580
I made a wish once

53
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,510
that in my next life,

54
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,860
I will be your servant

55
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,020
to pay the debts I owe you in this life.

56
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,300
Good.

57
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,579
Good.

58
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,480
Handsome man and his pretty servant.

59
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,470
In the next life,

00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,500

69
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,880

00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,899

Where is Han Yunxi?

89
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,659
She passed away.

90
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,420
She died for you.

91
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,140
Didn’t you promise me

92
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,000
not to help her?

93
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,220
You think I wanted to?

94
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,120
I never wanted to save you.

95
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,580
How could I possibly let her die?

96
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,740
She took the Noxious Herb

97
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,760
and stabbed herself in the chest.

98
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,150
If I didn’t save you,

99
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,320
that would make

100
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,380
her death meaningless.

101
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,020
Then tell me

102
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,900
where her body is.

103
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,760
I want to see her for the last time.

104
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,940
She told me before she died

105
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,020
that she didn’t want you

106
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,310
Poison girl,

107
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:02,940
I’ve realized

108
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,060
your wishes.

109
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,540
Are you happy?

110
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:08,660
In our next life,

111
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,260
make sure you keep your words

112
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,860
and be my servant.

113
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,980
Yunxi, this is your favorite place.

114
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,940
I’m back.

115
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:43,340
Yunxi, I buried the blood from your heart in the Plum Sea.

116
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,500
There are too many memories here.

117

I can’t bear to stay far from you.

118
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,620
I’ll plant lots of your favorite wisterias.

119
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,620
In winter, I’ll plant plums

120
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,060
and plantains

121
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,980

173
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,180
♫ But for you to forge ahead ♫

174
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,860
♫ Wearing the smile that I give you ♫
