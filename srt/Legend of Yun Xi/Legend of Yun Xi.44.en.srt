Episode 44

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,010
My lady,

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:07,820
what’s up?

5
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:09,490
Brother Gu,

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,070
can I ask you something?

7
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,740
Don’t lie to me

8
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,190
and don’t hide it from me.

9
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,110
All right.

10
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,740
Baili Mingxiang told me

11
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,070
the blood from my heart

12
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,820
is crucial for the poisonous Gu

13
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,610
in His Highness’s body.

14
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,280
Is it true?

15
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,240
Tell me the truth.

16
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:42,950
I see.

17
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:44,650
Thank you.

18
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,110
No one

19
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,210
can know

20
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,240
about this.

21
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:44,780
Your Highness,

22
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,240
you get out of bed.

23
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,780
You cried?

24
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,150
I’m fine.

25
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:57,450
I’m just happy

26
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,950
that I can stay by your side.

27
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,820
Silly.

28
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,740
I’m afraid

29
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,240
the good days are transient.

30
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,030
Good memories of the past

31
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,700
sting my heart.

32
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,990
In fact,

33
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,030
I’m afraid, too.

34
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,110
You’re afraid?

35
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,780
Do you know?

36
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,240
The first time I met you,

37
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,320
you looked fearsome.

38
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,280
You were cold.

39
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,990
You were mean to me

40
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,610
in the mansion.

41
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,280
And you shouldered up all the burden.

42
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,400
To me,

43
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,650
you were so far away from me.

44
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,400
Even so,

45
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,950
you’re also afraid?

46
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,650
I am.

47
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,820
I’m afraid to lose my love,

48
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,330
to be unable

49
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,030
to grow old together with my love,

50
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,530
and to lose everything

51
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,450
in the end.

52
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,240
Don’t be afraid.

53
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,360
I’m here by your side.

54
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,030
Whatever happens in the future,

55
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,320
we’ll face it together.

56
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,820
However…

57
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,280
What?

58
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,450
Do not ever shut me

59
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,450
outside of your heart.

60
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:47,990
Don’t give up.

61
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,190
You’re the source of my power.

62
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,820
For my sake,

63
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,900
you can’t give up.

64
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,700
Yunxi,

65
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,740
it’s the luck of my life

66
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,280
to have met you.

67
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,130
Is what you said to her

68
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,070
real?

69
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,450
I hope it’s not.

70
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,360
Can’t you tell a lie?

71
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,990
You know her.

72
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,950
She’ll sacrifice herself

73
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,100
to save Long Feiye.

74
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,110
Even if I cheated her,

75
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,650
without other solutions,

76
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,780
she would do the same

77
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,070
once His Highness’s life is at risk.

78
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,860
What then?

79
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,740
How did we come to this?

80
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,360
Your Majesty,

81
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,570
the assassins to kill Han Yunxi

82
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,950
failed.

83
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,990
Failed?

84
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,010
Didn’t you guarantee

85
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,190
that nothing would go wrong?

86
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,070
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

87
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,050
It was unexpected

88
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,140
that Baili Mingxiang

89
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,780
saved Han Yunxi.

90
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,320
Didn’t Baili Mingxiang

91
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,650
want to kill

92
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,700
Han Yunxi?

93
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,860
She does.

94
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,740
But Baili Mingxiang knows

95
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,820
that only the blood from Han Yunxi’s heart

96
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,360
can save Long Feiye.

97
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,450
For the man she loves,

98
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,490
she betrayed us

99
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,400
and risked her own life

100
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,690
for the life of her foe.

101
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,110
Oh, women!

102
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,490
Foolish!

103
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,010
Now Long Feiye knows the way

104
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,030
to cure the poison.

105
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,030
Given his love to Han Yunxi,

106
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,450
I’m sure

107
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,740
he won’t sacrifice her life.

108
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,450
A man with ambition

109
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,320
cannot be dragged behind by love.

110
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,900
Even if he doesn’t want to,

111
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,490
others will do it on his behalf.

112
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,420
We have to get rid

113
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,740
of the traitor from Qinxi.

114
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,570
Step up on the plan

115
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,090
to build an army

116
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,070
of Gu-infected men.

117
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

118
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,610
Your Highness.

119
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,400
Your Majesty.

120
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,820
Rise.

121
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,780
Your Majesty,

122
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,110
I made millet porridge for you.

123
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,610
Have some.

124
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,360
I have no appetite.

125
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,030
Your Majesty,

126
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,400
what’s troubling you?

127
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,650
Is there anything wrong

128
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,070
with the study of Gu-infected man?

129
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,860
Everything is fine with the study.

130
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,370
Since we found

131
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,530
Poison Master’s Poisoning Manual,

132
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,110
it has been instrumental to the study.

133
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,330
I believe

134
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,110
we can make Gu-infected men soon.

135
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,450
Why are you

136
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,700
frowning?

137
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,360
Li Quan has confirmed

138
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,450
that blood from Han Yunxi’s heart

139
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,650
can cure

140
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,360
poisonous Gu in Long Feiye’s system.

141
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,240
I’m worried that she will save Long Feiye

142
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,400
with her blood.

143
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,280
How could I

144
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,530
have peace in mind?

145
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,030
It’s so close to revenge my father’s death.

146
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,130
I can’t allow Long Feiye

147
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,450
to survive it.

148
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,200
Your Majesty,

149
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,250
the poisonous Gu in Long Feiye’s body

150
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,360
is almost incurable.

151
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,410
If Han Yunxi

152
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,900
is the only cure,

153
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,280
why don’t we kill her

154
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,860
and the cure?

155
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,740
I also want to.

156
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,240
After we missed the target this time,

157
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,900
it’ll be harder

158
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,110
to kill her next time.

159
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:44,950
Your Majesty,

160
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,570
think about it.

161
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,990
If Han Yunxi has to die

162
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,740
to keep Long Feiye alive,

163
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,740
why is she

164
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,030
still alive?

165
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,030
And she’s under the protection of Long Feiye.

166
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:00,450
Your Majesty,

167
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,860
I have another question.

168
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,650
How do Long Feiye and Han Yunxi

169
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,190
get along?

170
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,030
Your Majesty,

171
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,780
we’ve been out for long.

172
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,490
We have to go back for lunch.

173
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,289
Judging by Baili Mingxiang’s

174
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:40,780
hatred to Han Yunxi,

175
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,700
I guess

176
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:44,980
Han Yunxi and Long Feiye

177
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,280
are deeply in love.

178
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,900
Your Majesty, do you know that a woman

179
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,530
will die for her love?

180
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,150
In the days

181
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,450
when you were ill, I was worried, too.

182
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,370
And I would rather risk my life

183
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,820
than to leave you.

184
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,190
So,

185
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,530
in my humble opinion,

186
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,570
Han Yunxi

187
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,650
will give up her life

188
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,820
for Long Feiye’s.

189
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,240
When she does, we’ll have no return.

190
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,150
You’re right, my dear.

191
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,530
So,

192
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,610
all we need to do is to track her.

193
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,370
As is known to all,

194
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,650
every plan has a flaw.

195
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,570
I don’t believe

196
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,010
we can’t catch

197
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,240
Han Yunxi alone.

198
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,280
We’ll follow your plan.

199
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,070
But this time,

200
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,700
I have to work out

201
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,280
a flawless plan.

202
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:51,820
How long

203
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,890
will it take for poisonous Gu

204
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:53,740
to be cooked?

205
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,190
At least three more months.

206
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,110
Three months?

207
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,740
Mercy. Please spare me.

208
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,030
You have half a month.

209
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,780
We’ll try our best

210
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,190
to make poisonous Gu.

211
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,200
We swear

212
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,190
we will meet the deadline.

213
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,730
This is the prescription

214
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:29,610
of the cure for poisonous Gu

215
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,780
with blood from heart as the guide.

216
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,580
[Noxious Herb]

217
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,490
Noxious Herb?

218
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,950
It takes

219
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,990
another half a month for it to ripe.

220
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,050
When it’s ripe,

221
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,450
it has to be picked immediately

222
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,700
and used in half a month.

223
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,990
His Highness can’t wait for any longer.

224
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,240
Which means

225
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,030
I have a month live.

226
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,320
My lady,

227
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,360
you’re the last descendent of the master.

228
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:05,990
I beg you

229
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,690
to think it twice.

230
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:08,340
Maybe,

231
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,490
we can find another solution.

232
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,490
Brother Gu,

233
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,780
I know you don’t want me to die.

234
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,070
I don’t want to leave you, either.

235
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,030
But,

236
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,990
it’s the consequence

237
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,950
I have to bear for my father.

238
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,950
Even if not for him,

239
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,210
His Highness

240
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,570
is my husband.

241
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,650
Saving him

242
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,280
is what I have to do.

243
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,190
Brother Gu,

244
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,820
can I ask you one last favor?

245
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,650
After I draw blood from my heart,

246
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,900
help me make the cure

247
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,570
for His Highness.

248
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,320
What if His Highness asks about it?

249
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,900
Keep it from him

250
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,400
as long as you can.

251
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,650
Qishao,

252
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,650
where are you going?

253
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,990
The King planted a poisonous plague
in Southern Regions

254
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,250
for the experiments

255
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,200
to make Gu-infected men.

256
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,360
He’s eager to make Gu-infected men.

257
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,730
If we get

258
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,030
the prescription to make Gu-infected men,

259
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,170
we can

260
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,320
find a way to save Long Feiye.

261
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,650
Right.

262
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,110
I’d like to go with you.

263
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,570
-All right.
-Let’s go.

264
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,190
Your Majesty,

265
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,410
the poisonous Gu has been made.

266
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,170
We’re all set,

267
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,700
except for one thing.

268
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,860
Counting the days,

269
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,010
it’s almost time for another outburst

270
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,450
of poisonous plague in the Southern Regions.

271
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,190
According to the spies,

272
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,110
everything is fine in the Southern Regions.

273
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,900
The second outburst didn’t happen.

274
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,740
As far as I can gather,

275
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,370
Long Feiye must have

276
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,740
eradicated the plague

277
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,190
in the Southern Regions.

278
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,860
Long Feiye

279
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,150
ruined my plan again.

280
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,700
Calm down, Your Majesty.

281
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,030
In regardless,

282
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,990
an army of Gu-infected men

283
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,400
has to be built as soon as possible.

284
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,810
We have to seize the capital

285
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,190
by surprise.

286
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,930
But Your Majesty,

287
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,090
where do we

288
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,740
gather the materials?

289
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,240
I know a place.

290
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,070
On the border of the capital and Xijing,

291
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,320
Qingshan Town.

292
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:47,180
[Qingshan Town]

293
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,030
Wake up.

294
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,530
-Move.
-Help!

295
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,480
-Let me go!
-Go!

296
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,240
Help me!

297
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,030
-Let me go!
-Move!

298
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,030
Help! Let me go!

299
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,950
Qingshan Town is in trouble.

300
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,110
Crap!

301
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,150
Is Yuze all right?

302
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,200
Yuze.

303
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,360
Yuze.

304
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,090
Who is it?

305
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,200
It’s me, Qishao.

306
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,450
Qishao, it’s you.

307
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,450
-Come in.
-Come.

308
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,030
Are you alright?

309
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,280
I’m fine.

310
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,110
What is going on here?

311
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,570
Hello, Physician Gu.

312
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,810
I have no idea, either.

313
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,150
Everything was fine a few days ago.

314
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,210
The plague broke out

315
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,360
all of sudden yesterday.

316
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,730
The soldiers claimed

317
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,820
to quarantine all people

318
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,700
to keep the plague

319
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,280
from spreading out.

320
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,900
I doubt about it.

321
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,010
So I hid myself

322
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,030
from their sight.

323
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,400
Another poisonous plague.

324
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,050
It seems King Tianhui

325
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:08,970
has made a major breakthrough

326
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,070
in the study of poisonous Gu.

327
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,740
They have started to test on human.

328
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:16,820
Mr. Li.

329
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,030
Yes.

330
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,700
Twenty more died.

331
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,780
Due to the complexity to make Gu,

332
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,740
it’s scarce.

333
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,110
No more waste.

334
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,570
From now on,

335
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,370
choose the best materials

336
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,400
to do the test.

337
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,610
Kill those

338
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,820
who are old, weak

339
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,740
or ill

340
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,200
and cremate them.

341
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,150
Yes.

342
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,900
These two look strong.

343
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,320
-Sir.
-Well done.

344
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,190
Thank you, Sir.

345
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,130
Qishao,

346
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,210
Traceless Herb is tenaciously

347
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,070
tough.

348
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,770
It hasn’t totally been dried yet.

349
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,050
I tried so many ways.

350
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:29,860
None of them works.

351
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,130
You’re toasting it in the wrong way.

352
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,240
I heard once from the master

353
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,250
Traceless Herb

354
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,250
has to be cut into slices

355
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,190
to be dried.

356
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,250
Qishao gave me one last time.

357
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,320
I sliced it up

358
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,050
and toasted it for half a month to dry it.

359
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,070
If so,

360
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,020
we don’t

361
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,090
have enough time.

362
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:46,820
Yes.

363
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,200
It’s been too long.

364
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,690
It won’t function

365
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,740
as it used to.

366
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,650
Nevertheless,

367
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,570
we have to try.

368
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,290
Perhaps

369
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,130
we can save those

370
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,400
infected villagers.

371
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,610
Yuze,

372
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,860
keep toasting the Traceless Herb

373
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,130
in Physician Gu’s way.

374
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:01,860
All right.

375
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,319
I’m thinking,

376
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,650
the only way

377
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,740
for us

378
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,069
to get poisonous Gu

379
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:20,030
is to dress up

380
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,150
in those infected villagers’ clothes

381
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,780
and sneak in.

382
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,490
I know

383
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,140
you’ve been looking forward

384
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,360
to a life where men farm and women weave.

385
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,150
When the war is over,

386
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,360
I’ll give my position to Tang Li.

387
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,740
Then

388
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,810
we will find

389
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,030
a tranquil place.

390
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,280
What do you say?

391
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,400
We’ll live your dreamed life.

392
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,450
All right?

393
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,450
What?

394
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,070
Don’t want to?

395
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,320
Of course I do.

396
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,030
You know?

397
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,450
I have a plan

398
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,780
about the gardening.

399
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,610
I will plant

400
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,030
lots of wisteria over there,

401
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,450
and hydrangeas

402
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,320
and peonies over there.

403
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,610
Then some lilies in the lake.

404
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,950
In winters, we will have

405
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,050
plum blossoms to pick

406
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:15,820
and snowball fight.

407
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,650
In summers,

408
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,650
there’ll be humming insects.

409
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,360
We’ll grow some plantains

410
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,070
so that we can enjoy the pitter-patter of rains

411
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,280
drop on their leaves.

412
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,400
All right.

413
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,150
Whatever you say.

414
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,490
Are you going back to process state affairs?

415
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,320
No.

416
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,110
It’s time Tang Li deals with them independently.

417
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,650
Xifeng said he had talent

418
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,990
in governing.

419
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:49,820
By the way,

420
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,570
a few days ago,

421
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,400
with Principal Ouyang’s support,

422
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,490
Tang Li and Ningjing got married.

423
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,820
Already?

424
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,780
They didn’t even let us know.

425
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,240
I suppose the principal

426
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,820
made it happen.

427
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:06,990
Don’t worry.

428
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,890
I’ll ask Tang Li

429
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,200
give Ningjing a grand wedding

430
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,950
in the future.

431
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,690
The quarrelsome lovers

432
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,410
finally become lifelong partners.

433
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,190
Great.

434
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,030
It’s better for them

435
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,860
to quarrel with each other

436
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,400
than with others.

437
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,400
Well,

438
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,150
what about you?

439
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,150
I’m satisfied with you.

440
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,900
You’re mine.

441
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,260
[Bucket list]

442
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,450
Things have to be done

443
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,950
before blood from my heart is taken.

444
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,190
Live a secluded life with His Highness.

445
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,110
Kiss him.

446
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,320
Consummate.

447
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,360
If we don’t consummate,

448
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,610
he will forget about me soon.

449
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,820
Make him give up his love to me.

450
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:10,220
[Make him give up his love to me]

451
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,700
I dreamed before

452
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,450
to build a house in mountains by a river

453
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,780
which is home to me and my lover,

454
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,450
no one else.

455
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,700
We get up at sunrise

456
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,150
and rest at sundown.

457
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,400
At sleepless nights,

458
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,780
we can watch stars together.

459
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,900
In summers,

460
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,070
it would be perfect

461
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,320
with iced watermelons.

462
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,700
What about now?

463
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,190
Is it perfect now?

464
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,320
It’s always perfect

465
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,110
when you’re by my side.

466
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:58,820
Your Highness,

467
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,400

468

will you miss me?

469
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,360
I won’t let you disappear.

470
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,900
Even if you do,

471
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,860
I’ll search every corner of the world

472
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,030
until I find you.

473
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,900
Will you

474
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,950
fall in love with other women?

475
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,360
Out of all the women,

476
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,990
my love is only to you.

477
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,320
That’s what you say.

00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,400
If I disappear,

479
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,110
you’ll remember me for a few years.

480

Then you’ll forget me.

481

No, I won’t.

makes them stronger as we predicted.

are indeed powerful,

518

but they can’t be controlled.

00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,450
I’m afraid they can’t be put into use.

520

It’s alright.

521

00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,250

524

00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,820
His Majesty.

527
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,700
They remain alive

528
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,280
as Gu-infected men

529
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,050
to take cities down for His Majesty.

530
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:59,650
Once the infection is completed,

531
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,860
His Majesty can unite the world.

532
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,570
For years to come,

533
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,900
His Majesty will be the king of the world.

534
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,320
Please keep the good work.

535
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,860
I’ll report this good news

536
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,990
to His Majesty.

537
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:18,150
You’ll be rewarded.

538
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,490
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you, sir.

539
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,360
Hold on.

540
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,650
Physician Gu.

541
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:45,900
Come on.

542
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,570
Get them!

543
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:09,820
Go!

544
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,360
Hurry.

545
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,810
Physician Gu?

546
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:24,740
General Mu.

547
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,570
What brings you in Xijing?

548
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,740
General Mu,

549
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,890
you must know

550
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,490
King Tianhui is making poisonous Gu.

551
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,280
I humbly ask you

552
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,530
to stop His Majesty for the sake of the people.

553
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:35,900
Physician Gu,

554
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,200
the Mus won’t

555
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,280
betray the Longs.

556
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,610
You may leave, Physician Gu.

557
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,170
Let’s pretend

558
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,820
we never meet today.

559
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,450
General Mu.

560
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,400
Go while you still can.

561
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:56,860
Take care.

562
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,070
Come on.

563
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,370
I vouched for you

564
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:13,950
in front of His Majesty.

565
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,990
But now,

566
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,490
you achieved

567
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:18,700
none of the objectives.

568
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,690
I suppose you know

569
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:23,900
His Majesty’s temperament.

570
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:24,820
Sir,

571
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,530
we were too careless.

572
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,290
We promise

573
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:29,030
it won’t happen again.

574
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,650
Then

575
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,900
I’ll trust you one more time.

576
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,360
Get up.

577
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,320
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you, sir.

578
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,780
Sit.

579
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:05,970
You two

580
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,900
are both my right-hand men.

581
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,130
At present, His Majesty needs capable help.

582
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,290
Thus, I recommend you two

583
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,130
at this juncture.

584
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,610
It’s for your good.

585
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,130
No one would like

586
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,610
to listen to other’s orders forever.

587
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,900
As long as you listen to my command,

588
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,730
soon enough

589
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,280
you’ll be promoted for your feats.

590
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,890
You’re so forgiving, sir.

591
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:27,650
We will

592
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:29,370
do our best to work for you

593
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,330
and to make amends

594
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,400
for our mistakes.

595
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,530
Good.

596
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,820
To become Gu-infected men

597
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,450
is the best opportunity for you

598
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,070
to make amends.

599
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,660
[Xixiang Hall]

600
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,860
The envoy’s wife seeks your audience.

601
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,820
Why is she coming again?

602
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,730
Send her in.

603
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,530
Yes.

604
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,280
Your Highness.

605
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,730
To what do I

606
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:43,860
owe this honor?

607
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:46,900
Your Highness,

608
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,610
is it appropriate to talk here?

609
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:49,450
Rest assured.

610
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,690
I have

611
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:51,890
won His Majesty’s

612
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:52,700
complete trust.

613
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,320
They’re all my trusted servants.

614
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,740
You can speak freely.

615
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:58,650
Good.

616
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,900
It’s great.

617
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,530
Though Beili

618
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:02,700
has a different king now,

619
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,530
our agreement with Xiqiu

620
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:05,700
still stands.

621
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,210
I heard King Tianhui

622
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,290
has the complete volume

623
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:10,190
of Poisoning Manual

624
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,110
and the infection will be completed soon.

625
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,610
It’s high time, Your Highness,

626
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,280
for you to make a move.

627
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,400
Where did you get the news?

628
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,150
It doesn’t really matter.

629
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,450
King Tianhui lost in the war.

630
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,090
He didn’t ask you and Xiqiu

631
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,860
for military support.

632
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,740
Thus, he must have a backup plan.

633
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,610
Your Highness, you have to

634
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:32,030
draw King Tianhui’s henchmen in

635
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,410
and feed him

636
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:34,400
slow-acting poison.

637
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,110
When Gu-infected men are made,

638
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,530
or when you’re capable

639
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:39,990
of taking over his authority,

640
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,900
you can…

641
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,530
Poison him?

642
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,990
Your Highness,

643
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,770
you don’t

644
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,860
fall in love with King Tianhui, do you?

645
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,070
No.

646
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,200
I’m just thinking

647
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,900
State Tianning is split into two.

648
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,150
State Xiqiu is stabilized.

649
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,360
His Majesty loves me.

650
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,150
Even if the infection of Gu is completed,

651
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,190
he won’t attack Xiqiu.

652
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,990
I’m tired

653
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,990
of power struggle.

654
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,280
After I die,

655
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,280
the bilateral relationship is no longer my concern.

656
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:38,740
Your Highness,

657
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,130
you really think

658
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,820
Xiqiu is stabilized now?

659
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,370
That’s fake news

660
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,200
we fed you.

661
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,030
Your brother

662
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,030
is in our hands.

663
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:51,990
What?

664
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,610
Do you recognize

665
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,900
your brother’s writing?

666
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,780
How could you?

667
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,150
Aren’t you afraid to be despised

668
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,990
for your dishonesty?

669
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,240
Your Highness,

670
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,200
you’re so naïve.

671
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:31,740
Victory

672
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,530
is the only thing that matters.

673
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,240
Honesty is nothing to us.

674
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,450
Your Highness,

675
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,930
do you accept

676
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,360
the plan we made?

677
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,570
No wonder Beili

678
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:47,570
didn’t invade

679
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,150
when Prince Qin attacked Tianning’s palace.

680
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,200
Have you

681
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,130
formed an alliance

682
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,150
with Long Feiye?

683
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,320
No.

684
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,170
But

685
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,370
if you refuse

686
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:01,860
to carry out our plan,

687
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,360
we possibly will.

688
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,490
You…

689
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,650
Give me the poison.

690
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,610
See you, Your Highness.

691
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,360
Sister,

692
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,240
are you really going to marry King Tianhui?

693
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,990
Don’t go.

694
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,490
I don’t allow it.

695
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,360
Tianyin,

696
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,570
listen to me.

697
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,780
Since our father died in the war,

698
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,030
many officials in court,

699
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,290
our uncle’s clique in particular,

700
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:08,320
harbor evil intentions.

701
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,530
And now Beili

702
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:11,239
sets their greedy eyes on us.

703
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:12,739
I…

704
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,699
have no other options

705
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:20,110
but to marry King Tianhui.

706
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,130
It’s said

707
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,780
King Tianhui is skeptical and brutal.

708
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:25,949
And Prince Qin, Long Feiye, is wily.

709
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:27,199
If you marry him,

710
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:29,110
you’ll have endless troubles.

711
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,330
I don’t want you

712
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:32,320
to take the risk.

713
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,070
No risk,

714
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,360
no gain.

715
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,400
We have to win King Tianhui’s trust.

716
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,290
By then,

717
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:43,239
with Tianning as our support,

718
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,030
Tianyin,

719
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,699
you can keep your throne.

720
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:47,900
Sister,

721
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,900
take good care of yourself.

722
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,820
The revenge can wait.

723
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:55,489
You’re the only family I have now.

724
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,570
Be very careful.

725
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,190
When I grow stronger,

726
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,410
I’ll go to Tianning

727
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:01,280
and take you back.

728
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,320
In the end,

729
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,110
the ally I trusted

730
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,490
is nothing but another foe.

731
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,320
Now,

732
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,030
for Xiqiu,

733
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,280
I have to take over His Majesty’s power.

734
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:20,810
Your Majesty,

735
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,410
are you going to hand the power

736
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:23,530
to Beili?

737
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,320
To them?

738
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,110
In their dreams.

739
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,410
If His Majesty

740
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:31,650
succeeds in making Gu-infected men,

741
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,780
I’ll take them under control.

742
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,950
Then I can save my brother

743
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,320
and save Xiqiu.

744
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:44,780
Ma’am,

745
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,490
go to the Royal Kitchen

746
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:47,490
and tell them to make

747
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:49,200
His Majesty’s favorite, lotus-seed soup.

748
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,490
Your Highness,

749
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,530
maybe

750
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,030
you can be honest with His Majesty.

751
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,090
I can see

752
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,610
that His Majesty’s love is true.

753
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,030
Perhaps, he’ll forgive you.

754
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,530
Do as I told you.

755
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,450
Yes.

756
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,190
Will you tolerate

757
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,610
that the woman you love

758
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,570
has been lying to you ?

759
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,190
Ningjing.

760
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,990
What is it that makes you so nervous?

761
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,570
Urgent news from the border.

762
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:36,810
Poisonous plague broke out

763
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:37,700
in the border town Qingshan with Xijing.

764
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,730
The plague has spread

765
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,990
to our territory.

766
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:41,990
What?

767
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,530
The officials say

768
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,200
the cause of the plague isn’t that simple.

769
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,900
In the last plague in the Southern Regions,

770
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,130
my brother brought light

771
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,450
on King Tianhui’s plot of Gu-infected men.

772
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,650
I guess

773
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,290
it’s same old trick

774
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,240
to plant the plague

775
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,490
in Qingshan Town.

776
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,990
The king is a lunatic.

777
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,990
He has no return

778
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,400
and is ready to fight the last war.

779
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,820
We can’t sit and await our doom.

780
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:05,950
Right.

781
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,130
Now we’re not

782
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,280
prepared in every aspect.

783
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,900
Though the army

784
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,210
has been training and mobilizing

785
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:11,900
in rigid procedures

786
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,450
and the provisions for the army allocated,

787
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,810
it takes two more months

788
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:16,950
before the harvest of crops.

789
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,010
Before that,

790
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:19,400
we can’t attack Xijing.

791
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,210
Does Feiye know

792
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,320
the plague in Qingshan Town?

793
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,490
He and Han Yunxi

794
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,030
just restored their love.

795
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,400
I didn’t tell him.

796
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:30,690
I intend

797
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:31,930
to go to Qingshan Town

798
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:32,700
and check the situation.

799
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,610
I’ve called up

800
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:34,820
the physicians to go with me.

801
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,110
Sadly,

802
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,820
Physician Gu asked for a leave days ago.

803
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,130
However,

804
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,330
I have the cure he made

805
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:42,240
and the prescription.

806
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,320
You know to save against a rainy day.

807
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,200
Good for you.

808
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,570
Thank you for the compliment.

809
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,070
I’ve decided

810
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,330
to go with you.

811
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:49,990
No.

812
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,610
We don’t know the situation yet.

813
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:52,770
I can’t let you take the risk.

814
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,990
Tang Li,

815
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,730
You’re married.

816
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,170
I’m your husband.

817
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,110
You should listen to me.

818
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,400
Then take good care of yourself.

819
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,210
Don’t worry.

820
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,360
I’ll come back as soon as possible.

821
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,070
I can’t imagine

822
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,890
I can’t tell any

823
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:57,810
of the herbs in it.

824
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:58,610
It seems

825
00:38:58,610 --> 00:38:59,970
the essence of the herbs

826
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,370
is modified in the process

827
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:02,450
of refining.

828
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,210
It’s hard to tell

829
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:05,200
their functions.

830
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:08,990
Qishao,

831
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,700
if this leads us to nothing,

832
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,610
let’s try make the cure directly.

833
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:13,990
Sure.

834
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,530
I witnessed Poison Master’s

835
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:17,570
experiment

836
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,400
to make the cure.

837
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,570
Give me some time.

838
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,490
Take your time.

839
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:23,530
We’ll try step by step.

840
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:24,990
But Yunxi doesn’t have much time.

841
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,290
All the time I spent on medicine

842
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:30,320
has wasted.

843
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:41,900
Your Highness,

844
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,360
here is the lotus-seed soup you asked for.

845
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,490
Put it down.

846
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:48,970
You may leave.

847
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:49,700
Yes.

848
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,930
Your Majesty.

849
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:19,780
Rise.

850
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,110
Your Majesty,

851
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,010
I found men with strong inner power

852
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,250
could be infected

853
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,070
with Gu faster than the commoners.

854
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,770
I’m trying to find

855
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:30,450
more suitable men.

856
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,400
How long can their ability retain?

857
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,530
Your Majesty,

858
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,490
judging by those we have now,

859
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:38,320
they can retain their ability for three hours.

860
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,190
I believe it won’t be long

861
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,370
before we make it possible

862
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:44,700
that they remain Gu-infected men forever.

863
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,110
Good.

864
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,400
If you make it happen,

865
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,400
you’ll be the savior of Tianning.

866
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,450
And

867
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,740
your feat will be rewarded.

868
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,110
Thank you, Your Majesty.

869
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,190
His Majesty the King.

870
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,290
Your Highness.

871
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:15,330
Your Majesty.

872
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:16,150
Rise.

873
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,450
Qing,

874
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,770
I apologize

875
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:28,150
for putting you here.

876
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:29,900
But rest assured.

877
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,410
I will defeat Long Feiye

878
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,700
and take my throne back soon.

879
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,400
I always have faith

880
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:38,190
that you’ll reclaim the throne.

881
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,400
Your Majesty,

882
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:44,490
I

883
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:45,990
made the lotus-seed soup for you.

884
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,610
It helps calm your mind.

885
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,150
The physicians’ order.

886
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,700
Mental stress is harmful to health.

887
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:54,900
Your Majesty,

888
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,400
you have to take care of your health.

889
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:57,950
Here.

890
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,360
Drink it.

891
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,610
You’re good at cooking.

892
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,110
I’m happy you like it.
