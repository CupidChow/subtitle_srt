Episode 48

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,080
You owe nothing

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,960
to this world.

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,040
I know

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,520
you won’t be so cruel to me.

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,440
Forgive me

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,480
for making this decision.

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,620
Because this is the best

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,840
for both of us.

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,000
Don’t be afraid.

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,840
I won’t let you die.

13
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,280
I know you want me to live.

14
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,020
But you’re the only man

15
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,320
I love.

16
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,120
If you die,

17
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,050
I will have no one

18
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,920
to love anymore in this world.

19
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,860
I will spend every day

20
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,640
in the pain of losing you.

21
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,120
You can’t be so cruel to me.

22
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,640
I’m going to Qishao now.

23
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,700
I don’t know if he will help me

24
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,100
draw blood from my heart.

25
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,880
If he doesn’t help,

26
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,120
I’ll do it myself.

27
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,459
I will save you

28
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:05,690
either way.

29
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,760
Wait for me.

30
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,360
What are you doing?

31
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,350
Shouldn’t you go to Gu Beiyue for help?

32
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,280
He refuses,

33
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,600
so you come to me?

34
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,000
Gu passed away.

35
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,500
Qishao, if you promise me to save His Highness,

36
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,820
I’ll promise you anything.

37
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,080
What do I need a dead woman’s promise for?

38
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,509
What are you doing? Put the knife down!

39
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,000
Gu Qishao, listen to me.

40
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,700
If His Highness dies,

41
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,840
I will kill myself.

42
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,400
You’re crazy!

43
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,400
This is a potion I made.

44
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,160
I’ll count the rest on you.

45
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,760
After I die,

46
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,280
draw blood from my heart.

47
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,520
I beg you. No!

48
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,200
No!

49
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,840
No!

50
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,200
No!

51
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,860
Poison girl! Poison girl! Poison girl!

52
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,280
Are you stupid?

53
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,360
Why did you do that?

54
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,440
Why did you do that to me?

55
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,800
I love you so much.

56
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,900
I wish so much I could be with you.

57
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,079
Yet for the man you love,

58
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,500
you kill yourself in front of me.

59
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,840
Did I owe you in the previous life?

60
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,520
Why are you so cruel to me?

61
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,320
Qishao,

62
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,079
it’s my pleasure

63
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,400
to have met you in this life.

64
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,520
Just this life?

65
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,760
You met Long Feiye first in this life

66
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,060
and fell in love with him.

67
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,100
So I didn’t lose

68
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,320
to Long Feiye,

69
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,600
but time.

70
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,760
Therefore,

71
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,220
in our next life, you have to

72
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,320
meet me first

73
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,230
and fall in love with me, all right?

74
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,000
Qishao,

75
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,400
I made a wish once

76
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,279
that in my next life,

77
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,720
I will be your servant

78
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,880
to pay the debts I owe you in this life.

79
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,160
Good.

80
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,400
Good.

81
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,240
Handsome man and his pretty servant.

82
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,240
In the next life,

83
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,320
you’ll be mine.

84
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,159
Qishao,

85
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,000
when Traceless Herb is burned,

86
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,600
the smoke kills Gu-infected men.

87
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,280
Please help His Highness.

88
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:06,200
♫ They meet with sunset glow behind ♫

89
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,320
I’d like

90
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,200
to give you my bracelet.

91
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,320
Qishao,

92
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,440
thank you.

93
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,320
What do I need

94
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,240
a bracelet for?

95
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,720
Your Highness,

96
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,600
in the next life,

97
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,880
I’ll marry you again.

98
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,640
♫ Happiness and laughter flash in my head ♫

99
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,080
Poison girl!

100
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,240
No!

101
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,480
No!

102
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,480
No!

103
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,320
Yunxi! Yunxi! Yunxi! Yunxi!

104
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,780
♫ It’s poisonous to meet and be happy with you ♫

105
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,520
♫ Even so ♫

106
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:27,240
♫ I feel no pain in it ♫

107
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:41,720
♫ Cover thawing snow with blusher ♫

108
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:48,480
♫ Sow love and we’ll get love ♫

109
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:53,600
♫ Autumn moon set and it’s spring again ♫

110
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:59,600
♫ Flowers once withered are blooming again ♫

111
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,400
♫ Is the love in your heart blooming, too ♫

112
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,160
♫ Somehow ♫

113
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:15,680
♫ We both learn what it’s like to love ♫

114
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,360
All right. Dry your tears.

115
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,080
Feiye.

116
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,120
Why am I in the palace?

117
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,120
Where is Han Yunxi?

118
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,440
Gu Qishao!

119
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,240
Where is Han Yunxi?

120
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,920
She passed away.

121
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,680
She died for you.

122
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,260
Didn’t you promise me

123
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,180
not to help her?

124
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,400
You think I wanted to?

125
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,240
I never wanted to save you.

126
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,700
How could I possibly let her die?

127
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,860
She took the Noxious Herb

128
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,920
and stabbed herself in the chest.

129
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,320
If I didn’t save you,

130
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,480
that would make

131
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,640
her death meaningless.

132
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,680
Then tell me

133
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,920
where her body is.

134
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,640
I want to see her for the last time.

135
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,919
She told me before she died

136
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,179
that she didn’t want you

137
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,580
to see her after she died.

138
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,320
She’s passed away.

139
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,240
So please

140
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,080
honor her last will.

141
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,880
Han Yunxi.

142
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,680
Why?

143
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,520
Why did you do that to me?

144
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,800
You know I’d rather die

145
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,170
than lose you.

146
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,040
Long Feiye,

147
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,820
pull yourself together.

148
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:15,900
Han Yunxi

149
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,300
didn’t die for you alone,

150
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,630
but for all the people in the world.

151
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,640
I hope

152
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,820
you can live up to her expectations.

153
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,680
Your Highness!

154
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,600
Your Highness,

155
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,720
the Gu-infected men have reached the city gate.

156
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,620
Do you want to see Han Yunxi

157
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,680
die for nothing?

158
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,420
Your Highness,

159
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,220
Tianhui’s troops

160
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,180
have reached outside the city wall.

161
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,110
They’re planning the formations.

162
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,040
I ordered the South Subduing General

163
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,920
to dig up two tunnels

164
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,160
on the east and west sides of the gate.

165
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,590
Once King Tianhui attacks,

166
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,320
we feign our retreat

167
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,070
and lure King Tianhui’s troops in,

168
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,240
so that

169
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,540
we can catch them from the east and the west

170
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,920
and form a triangle box

171
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,830
with palace guards in the city.

172
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,920
By then, King Tianhui

173
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,480
will have only one way to go.

174
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,880
General Baili.

175
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,060
You and General Sun lead your men

176
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,200
to the tunnels

177
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,710
and wait for orders.

178
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,320
Yes.

179
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,720
Your Highness,

180
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,660
one Gu-infected man can fight ten men.

181
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,300
And they’re extremely brutal.

182
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,700
If they break out the encirclement,

183
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,920
they’ll lead chaos to our formation.

184
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,400
If they break out,

185
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,960
the Mu’s troop

186
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,470
will cut their backup from their back.

187
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,970
Whatever the price is,

188
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,440
we’re going to win the war.

189
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,120
Who are you?

190
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,860
Someone who also wants to kill Tianhui.

191
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,040
I have something

192
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,140
that may help you

193
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,400
kill Gu-infected men.

194
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,080
Your Highness,

195
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,460
it’s Traceless Herb.

196
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,540
When you light up

197
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,740
the Traceless Herbs,

198
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,180
the poisonous smoke

199
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:23,980
will help you

200
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,640
kill lots of Gu-infected men.

201
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:30,920
Thank you.

202
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,200
Don’t thank me.

203
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,720
Thank poison girl.

204
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,580
South Subduing General,

205
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,870
when the attack starts,

206
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,420
lead your men

207
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,680
to meet with General Mu

208
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,700
and cut King Tianhui’s backup.

209
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,920
Yes, Your Highness.

210
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,220
I’ll help you achieve the final goal.

211
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,040
Leave the backups to me.

212
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,360
Make sure

213
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,940
you kill all the invaders outside the city.

214
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,180
[Xuanwu Gate]

215
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,230
Victory for Qinxi! Victory for Qinxi!

216
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,440
Victory for Qinxi! Victory for Qinxi!

217
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,700
Victory for Qinxi! Victory for Qinxi!

218
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,320
Your Majesty.

219
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,880
It’s Long Feiye.

220
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,280
Long Feiye.

221
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,520
Why isn’t he dead?

222
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,160
Soon he’ll be.

223
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,400
Brave men,

224
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,020
prepare to attack!

225
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,720
Yes!

226
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:52,720
Li Quan.

227
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

228
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,640
Long Feiye is wily.

229
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,560
I’m afraid he may set up traps.

230
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,380
Go move the backups up front.

231
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,020
If we’re surrounded,

232
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,460
we can launch counterattack with the backups

233
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,660
and take him down.

234
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

235
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,200
Get ready!

236
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,700
The sooner the better. Move out!

237
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,000
What’s going on?

238
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,080
Who found the cure?

239
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,800
Who?

240
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,660
This is what you got

241
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,920
for helping the tyrant do evil.

242
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,130
Your Majesty,

243
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,260
the enemy caught us by surprise.

244
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,340
Totally unprepared,

245
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,370
we suffered heavy casualties.

246
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,620
We’re surrounded!

247
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,360
Calm down.

248
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,460
My backup troops

249
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,340
are coming!

250
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,100
Your Majesty,

251
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:54,900
our backup troops

252
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,060
have been wiped out.

253
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,920
Eunuch Li was killed!

254
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,880
What?

255
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,350
How did that happen?

256
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,440
How!

257
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,060
Your Majesty,

258
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,770
we’re in critically danger.

259
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,000
We should fall back.

260
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,079
Your Majesty! Fall back!

261
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,920
Poison girl.

262
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:51,880
Tianhui.

263
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,460
Let’s put an end

264
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,860
to the things between us.

265
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,400
Though I lost my troops,

266
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,620
you may not be able to defeat

267
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,040
my Gu-infected men.

268
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,860
Go!

269
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,120
Kill Long Feiye!

270
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,880
This

271
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,120
is for Han Yunxi.

272
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,360
Looks like she’s dead.

273
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,320
She died for you!

274
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,160
Tianhui.

275
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,000
Surrender.

276
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,320
Long Feiye.

277
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,960
You think you win?

278
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,680
No.

279
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,460
When you mount

280
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,580
on the king’s throne,

281
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,760
you’ll know…

282
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,640
you’ll know

283
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,440
what it’s like to be the loner in power.

284
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,160
The woman you love died for you.

285
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,880
You’ll be tortured

286
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,440
by remorse for the rest of your life.

287
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,240
To solidify your governance,

288
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,360
your family and friends

289
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,160
will alienate you.

290
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,700
You’ll spend the rest of your life

291
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,130
in suspicions.

292
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,540
You have to be on guard for the officials’ lies,

293
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,320
challenges and disloyalty.

294
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,530
Perhaps those

295
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,900
who bow humbly to you

296
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,980
will serve you a cup of liquor

297
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,360
with poisons.

298
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:21,080
I did everything

299
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:26,320
to protect myself

300
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,120
and this state!

301
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,960
I’m not you.

302
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,880
Surrender your sword.

303
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,420
You have no way to escape.

304
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,200
No.

305
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,760
You can’t defeat me.

306
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,040
No one can.

307
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,960
Unless it’s Heaven’s will,

308
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,200
even you

309
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,040
can’t defeat me.

310
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,880
This world

311
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,000
is mine.

312
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,040
I don’t care

313
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,820
anything that you cared.

314
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,440
Your Highness!

315
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,220
Your Highness, I’m late.

316
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,150
Are you alright?

317
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,740
Bury him as a king.

318
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,520
Follow me.

319
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,260
Has His Majesty forgiven me?

320
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,240
Let’s go!

321
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,740
Qingge.

322
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,880
Tianyin.

323
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,020
Tianyin.

324
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:38,960
Qingge.

325
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,220
Haven’t you been turned into Gu-infected man?

326
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,160
No.

327
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,060
After King Tianhui got me out,

328
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,740
he gave me reliever

329
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,090
to the poison Beili people fed me.

330
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,620
However, he asked me

331
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,220
to dress up like a Gu-infected man

332
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,900
and stand in his Glory Hall for all day.

333
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,500
At last, I’m sent here

334
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,820
to meet with you.

335
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,680
He promised me we would be united.

336
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:00,900
Your Majesty.

337
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:01,980
Qingge.

338
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,260
Here’s a letter from Tianhui

339
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,320
to you.

340
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,360
Qingge,

341
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,080
if you read this letter,

342
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,860
that means

343
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,320
I’m already gone.

344
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,080
You’re the woman I hate

345
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,120
and in the meantime love the most.

346
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,040
But I can’t love you,

347
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,080
or kill you.

348
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,900
I sent the Gu-infected men troop

349
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,980
to Xiqiu

350
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,080
and kicked the Beili people out.

351
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,030
When you and your brother return home,

352
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,320
live happily with him.

353
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:45,040
Please look after Changbing for me.

354
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,080
My death

355
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,880
perhaps is the best

356
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,080
for both of us.

357
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,400
Your Majesty,

358
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,400
I’m so sorry.

359
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,640
I disappointed you.

360
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:14,780
[In memory of my wife, Han Yunxi]

361
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,520
Brother.

362
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,960
You have to stop grieving.

363
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,600
The state needs its king.

364
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,080
Though State Tianning is united,

365
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,320
one third

366
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,660
of Qinxi’s territory

367
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,660
is still occupied by another state.

368
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,220
There are so many things

369
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,420
waiting for you to do.

370
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,200
I’ll stay here

371
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,760
and mourn Yunxi for a year.

372
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,800
Tang Li,

373
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,300
I have never

374
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,030
had any interest in the throne.

375
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,780
The reason I trained you

376
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,440
whenever there was a chance

377
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,480
is that I wanted you

378
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,920
to take the throne.

379
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:33,880
Brother.

380
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,320
Save it.

381
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,160
My mind is made.

382
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,320
Be a diligent

383
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,240
and loving king.

384
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,320
Brother.

385
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,860
[Hall of Supreme Harmony]
[Qin]

386
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,000
The state of Qinxi

387
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,600
was once boundless.

388
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,220
However, Tianning usurped the throne.

389
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:37,000
Enraged, Prince Qin, Xuanyuan Ye,
killed the usurper

390
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,920
and restored the state.

391
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,480
The officials recommended me to be the king.

392
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,380
However, I have no virtue

393
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,920
to claim the throne.

394
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,920
So I asked the people

395
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,720
and the leaders of the neighboring states.

396
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,520
They replied, the Heaven’s will
had to be answered,

397
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,480
the forefathers’ throne couldn’t be replaced,

398
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,480
and the state craved for its king.

399
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,010
Their hope

400
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,720
is in me.

401
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,600
To honor Heaven’s will

402
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,200
and to keep Qinxi from being split,

403
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,520
I humbly choose this day

404
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,770
to receive the honor of the king

405
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:18,120
at the witness of my officials

406
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,880
and set up the altar

407
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,420
to answer to Heaven with my determination.

408
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,720
Poison girl,

409
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,160
Herb Land

410
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,220
is your favorite part of Yaogui Valley.

411
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,840
I’ve rebuilt

412
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,440
the Herb Land for you

413
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,320
and left two drops of blood

414
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,440
from your heart there.

415
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,200
I wish

416
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,660
you could merge in

417
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,720
the Herb Land

418
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,400
and stay with me forever.

419
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:53,680
Are you willing to?

420
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,360
I regret it so much.

421
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,780
I shouldn’t have helped you.

422
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,540
As a result,

423
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,140
I dreamed of you every night.

424
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,500
The moment you died keeps coming back to me.

425
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,220
Though you’ve

426
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,820
no longer been in this world,

427
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,480
you’ve been my concern.

428
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,320
But don’t worry.

429
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,520
I kept my promises.

430
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,840
I saved the man

431
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,150
you were worried about.

432
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,080
And he

433
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,960
protected the people.

434
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,280
Poison girl,

435
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:23,820
I’ve realized

436
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,080
your wishes.

437
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,520
Are you happy?

438
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:29,540
In our next life,

439
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,140
make sure you keep your words

440
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,880
and be my servant.

441
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,400
And,

442
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,600
I lost the bracelet.

443
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,320
But don’t worry.

444
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,720
I’ll find it.

445
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:10,000
My officials, anything you want to discuss?

446
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,970
Your Majesty,

447
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,740
drought hits hard on the north of Tianning.

448
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,130
The crops yield nothing.

449
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,700
Local governor has ordered

450
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,620
public grain storage to be handed out.

451
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,800
But it’s a drop in a bucket.

452
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,700
I humbly suggest Your Majesty

453
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,540
to approve drought relief

454
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,670
and save the people in stricken areas.

455
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,740
Allocate money

456
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,300
from the National Treasury immediately

457
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,150
to purchase grains from the south

458
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,060
and deliver them to the north

459
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,510
as soon as possible.

460
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:42,620
Bribery of any kind will see

461
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,310
the severest punishment.

462
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

463
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,240
My officials,

464
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,390
anything else to be discussed?

465
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:58,060
Your Majesty,

466
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,520
I have a proposal.

467
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,080
You again.

468
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:03,530
Your Majesty,

469
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,980
there’s only one woman,

470
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,440
the Queen, in your palace.

471
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,860
And the Queen and Your Majesty

472
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,020
are married for a year.

473
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,420
Yet, no heir is produced.

474
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,820
I sincerely ask Your Majesty to expand your harem

475
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,860
and produce many heirs

476
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,290
for Qinxi to flourish.

477
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,460
I just took the throne.

478
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,900
The state is unstable.

479
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,120
The north is having a disaster.

480
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:23,929
The people are suffering.

481
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:25,190
All of this worries me.

482
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,340
How could you ask me to expand my harem

483
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,870
when you should give advice

484
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:32,120
on disaster relief?

485
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,780
Your Majesty,

486
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,860
an heir is significant to the throne.

487
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,760
It’s about the future of the state.

488
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,040
I have to remind you of it.

489
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:41,600
Duly noticed.

490
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:43,620
Say no more on this issue.

491
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,719
If that’s all,

492
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:47,239
let’s call it a day.

493
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:48,190
Your Majesty…

494
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,840
End of the assembly.

495
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:53,840
See you, Your Majesty.

496
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,000
Why aren’t I pregnant yet?

497
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:31,590
Your Majesty.

498
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:34,730
Leave us.

499
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:35,920
Yes.

500
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,620
Ningjing, be seated.

501
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,350
Let me massage your shoulders.

502
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,420
What did you do this time?

503
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,680
Nothing.

504
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,360
I heard

505
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,140
the officials

506
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,590
suggested you to take in concubines

507
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,050
because I don’t have a son.

508
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,700
They can suggest whatever they want.

509
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,060
We just have our own life.

510
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:07,660
I’m absolutely

511
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,160
loyal to you.

512
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,420
In front of you,

513
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,260
those vulgar women

514
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,040
are dimmed.

515
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,060
You say you won’t now.

516
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,660
Maybe you will in the future.

517
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,640
Ningjing,

518
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,800
have a little faith in me.

519
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,280
Have faith in you?

520
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,660
Those officials

521
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,860
tried all means everyday

522
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,980
to find women for you.

523
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,540
I don’t believe you’re not tempted.

524
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,300
No.

525
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,200
I am not.

526
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,500
If I have the slightest desire

527
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,600
to betray you,

528
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,840
let me…

529
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,360
have no children.

530
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:43,140
Are you blaming me for not giving you a son?

531
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,320
It hurts!

532
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,040
Ningjing,

533
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,680
I didn’t mean that.

534
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,180
Well,

535
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,660
you should blame my brother.

536
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,420
It’s his fault.

537
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,220
He forced me to be

538
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,260
the king.

539
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,860
Now even my marriage

540
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,520
has to be discussed in court.

541
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,920
Anyway,

542
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,620
I wonder if my brother

543
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,120
feels better now.

544
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,680
Feiye…

545
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,400
Feiye leaves for Plum Sea.

546
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,900

547
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:29,680

00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:49,240
♫ Remember I will be in your mind ♫

571
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,820
Why should I run away?

572
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,220
I’m His Highness’s

573
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,950
wife whom he had a wedding with.

574
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,580
It should be me

575
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,780
to bear his children.

576
00:38:59,220 --> 00:38:59,840
Yes.

577
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,210
Don’t be shy.

578
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,670
I need to face him bravely.

579
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,040
I’ll go make the medicine.

580
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:14,780
Don’t you always want

581
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,040
to have a son with me?

582
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,000
I’m not ready.

583
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,440
I will plant

584
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,400
lots of wisterias over there,

585
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,200
and hydrangeas

586
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:30,320
and peonies over there.

587
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,320
Then some lotuses in the lake.

588
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,480
In winters, we will have

589
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,740
plum blossoms to pick

590
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,870
and snowball fight.

591
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,340
In summers,

592
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,000
there’ll be humming insects.

593
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,140
We’ll grow some plantain trees,

594
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,730
so that we can enjoy the pitter-patter of rains

595
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:48,190
dripping on their leaves.

596
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:53,400
♫ Remember that I never drew back ♫

597
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:59,880
♫ I’m in your heart at every night ♫

598
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,000
♫ The kiss ♫

599
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:07,200
♫ Is my love for you ♫

600
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,800
♫ Sadly we separate ♫

601
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:14,290
♫ Each time before we’re about to be together ♫

602
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:15,890
♫ It’s not my wish ♫

603
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:20,880
♫ To grieve the parting with watery eyes ♫

604
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:24,380
♫ But for you to forge ahead ♫

605
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:28,700
♫ Wearing the smile that I give you ♫

606
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,610
♫ It happens all over again ♫

607
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:33,260
♫ I guess I’ll do the same ♫

608
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,620
♫ And give up everything ♫

609
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,980
♫ In exchange for your future ♫

610
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:39,100
♫ Even it’s a future without me ♫

611
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,660
♫ But you will understand ♫

612
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:44,960
♫ My eternal love ♫

613
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,580
Yunxi!

614
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,040
♫ It’s destiny ♫

615
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:55,330

00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,210
