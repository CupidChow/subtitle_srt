Episode 23

3
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,380
What’s the matter?

4
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,160
Are you ready?

5
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,770
Today is the Dowager’s birthday feast.

6
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,590
All the ministers will come to congratulate her.

7
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,760
Watch your manner.

8
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:04,569
I have something

9
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,280
with the king.

10
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,039
Go for the Dowager now.

11
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,350
Your Royal highness.

12
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,490
Yunxi.

13
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:25,860
Come.

14
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,610
What’s going on in Prince Qin Mansion?

15
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,390
Your Royal highness,

16
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,860
I keep my eye on Prince Qin all the time.

17
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,150
But he does everything cautiously.

18
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,750
I can’t tell anything weird.

19
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,700
Prince Qin is cunning.

20
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,520
It’s not an easy work for you

21
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,950
to spy him.

22
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,070
This was made by

23
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,640
your mother, Lady Tianxin.

24
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,380
[Tianxin]

25
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,450
Mother. I also want this bag.

26
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,950
No problem.

27
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,530
When you become an adult

28
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,710
and know medicine,

29
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,490
I’ll make a same

30
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,860
medicine bag for you.

31
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:32,450
Are you satisfied?

32
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,200
Yes.

33
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,700
[Tianxin]

34
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,360
There is a way

35
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,950
for you to see your mother.

36
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,110
As long as you

37
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,360
do one thing for me.

38
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,530
Long Feiye will get hurt

39
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,610
at the hall later.

40
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,950
When you treat him,

41
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,360
stick his three acupoints,

42
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,450
Tianshu, Lingxu

43
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,240
and Qihai.

44
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,800
You don’t need to take the responsibility.

45
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,990
Just do

46
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,700
what

47
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,700
I told you.

48
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,110
I can take

49
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,650
you to

50
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,150
see your mother now.

51
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,450
Mother!

52
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,780
Stop here.

53
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,550
If you want to get closer,

54
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,950
do what

55
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,450
I told you.

56
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,280
But a curtain is between us.

57
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,990
I can’t

58
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,329
see my mother clearly.

59
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,240
How can I believe it’s her?

60
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,990
If you don’t trust me,

61
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,650
you can leave.

62
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,950
And you don’t need

63
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,320
to listen to me.

64
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,820
Then, your mother’s life

65
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,150
is nothing to do with you.

66
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,149
Sorry that I said something rude.

67
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:19,410
Please forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

68
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,400
Good girl.

69
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,240
Mother.

70
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:29,860
Kid,

71
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,570
don’t care me.

72
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,900
Live your own life.

73
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,010
What are you waiting for?

74
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,370
Lady Tianxin is tired.

75
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,700
Take her back.

76
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,150
-Yes.
-Yes.

77
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,680
Your highness,

78
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,270
please let me see my mother.

79
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,190
But you have to listen to me.

80
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,700
Princess,

81
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,990
Please.

82
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,740
Han Yunxi

83
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,880
was just a kid

84
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,610
without memory.

85
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,490
No painting can

86
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,200
show her real profile completely.

87
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,820
It’s not hard

88
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,320
to find someone looking like her.

89
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,200
Seems that Princess Qin

90
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,950
is really touched.

91
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,400
Being touched

92
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,990
is the biggest barrier for a person.

93
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,650
Even a smart one

94
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,530
will lose

95
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,650
the judgment.

96
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,780
Your Royal Highness.

97
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,490
Please

98
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,950
don’t hurt my mother.

99
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,780
Han Yunxi.

100
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,110
This is the last time.

101
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,390
As long as

102
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,240
you obey my order,

103
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,070
I’ll let you meet

104
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,320
your mother

105
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,030
after the thing is ended.

106
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,200
Otherwise,

107
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,570
Prince Qin,

108
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:13,950
your mother

109
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,320
and you

110
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,650
can’t go

111
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,070
out of this palace today.

112
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,530
Baili Mingxiang.

113
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,520
Mingxiang.

114
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,040
What’s wrong with you?

115
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,150
You... You...

116
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,840
What’s the matter?

117
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,860
I’ll call a physician for you.

118
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,780
No, no.

119
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,560
I don’t want others to know.

120
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,400
What?

121
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,150
What happened to you?

122
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,750
You don’t need to know.

123
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,320
Accompany me to my room.

124
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,450
No.

125
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,320
You are

126
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,780
weaker and weaker.

127
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,710
I must call a physician here.

128
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:04,700
Servants!

129
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:05,780
Don’t shout.

130
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:07,990
I tell you.

131
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,900
I had much medicine

132
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,360
to gain Beauty Blood soon.

133
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,530
I must save Brother Feiye.

134
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,570
Beauty Blood?

135
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,280
What’s that?

136
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,930
You are suiciding with poison.

137
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:38,500
Stop doing this.

138
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,230
It doesn’t matter as long as I’m used to it.

139
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,610
I’m still alive.

140
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,780
Mingxiang.

141
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,900
What you are doing

142
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,400
is touching.

143
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,110
But

144
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,450
Han Yunxi

145
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,740
is Feiye’s wife.

146
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,490
He only loves her.

147
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,700
I never think

148
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,860
he will love me.

149
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,510
I just want Brother Feiye

150
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,030
to become a normal man

151
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,700
who lives a normal life.

152
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,740
My life is

153
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,700
only for him.

154
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,610
Is your sacrifice

155
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,570
worthy?

156
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,780
When I was a child,

157
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,310
aunt told me that I would marry Brother Feiye.

158
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,450
Brother Feiye was very weak

159
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,610
when he was a kid.

160
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,030
So from then, I decided

161
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,890
to protect Feiye with all I can do.

162
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,450
Mingxiang.

163
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,240
Forget him.

164
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,490
It is not worth

165
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,490
to hurt yourself

166
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,400
for someone.

167
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,570
Mingxiang!

168
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,450
Mingxiang!

169
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,700
Mingxiang, what happened?

170
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,299
I heard that you fainted.

171
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,200
Aunt.

172
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,340
I have something to tell you.

173
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,280
Go ahead.

174
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,510
What’s the matter?

175
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,570
Aunt,

176
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,320
I swear with my life,

177
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,880
Han Yunxi is a spy sent by the Dowager.

178
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,070
I’m very

179
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,810
worried about Brother Feiye,

180
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,490
which makes me weak.

181
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,190
So I fainted.

182
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,650
Are you serious?

183
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,820
Aunt, you know me.

184
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,360
I shouldn’t

185
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,570
have told you this.

186
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,700
But I am really worried

187
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,030
that Feiye will

188
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,320
be in danger in the palace this time.

189
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,780
Did the physician come?

190
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,710
He’s on the way. He may arrive soon.

191
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,850
Aunt, don’t worry about me.

192
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,950
I was just too anxious.

193
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,910
Rest assured.

194
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,070
If Han Yunxi hurts him,

195
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,570
I know what I should do.

196
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,250
What’s the matter?

197
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,710
Do you feel unwell?

198
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,030
No.

199
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:53,860
I’m just a little tired.

200
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,070
Maybe you are not used to this event.

201
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,260
It doesn’t matter.

202
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,420
Once it’s finish

203
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,070
I’ll take you back home.

204
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,900
Your Royal Highness,

205
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,900
wish you longevity.

206
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,450
Consort Qing is filial.

207
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,200
You really make me happy.

208
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,020
Thanks, Your Royal Highness.

209
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,900
Your Majesty,

210
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,400
Your Royal Highness.

211
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,110
This is

212
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,360
the famous swordsman

213
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,030
in Xiqiu.

214
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,320
I know Prince Qin is good at Kung Fu

215
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,030
and swordsmanship.

216
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,570
Can

217
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,780
Prince Qin play

218
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,030
swords with him?

219
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:20,360
Feiye,

220
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,320
Xiqiu’s swordsman

221
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,490
really wants to see your swordsmanship.

222
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,740
Why don’t you

223
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,860
show them?

224
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,570
What do you think?

225
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,500
Your majesty.

226
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,140
Today is the Dowager’s birthday.

227
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,570
It’s not good to use sword.

228
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,710
It doesn’t matter.

229
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:55,450
Just communicate the skills.

230
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,490
Don’t hurt anyone.

231
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,570
Show your

232
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,230
excellent swordsmanship.

233
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,490
Uncle, show us.

234
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,490
Yes, uncle.

235
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,190
Show us. Play for us.

236
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,280
Yes, uncle.

237
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,530
Don’t be too modest.

238
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,630
Show your wonderful swordsmanship.

239
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,280
What?

240
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,070
Prince Qin,

241
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,200
you make me embarrassed?

242
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,750
Your Royal Highness, I’ll play.

243
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,990
Thanks, Your Royal Highness.

244
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,250
Thanks, Your Majesty.

245
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,760
Your Highness.

246
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,740
You haven’t recovered.

247
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,190
You...

248
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,430
Don’t worry.

249
00:14:59,070 --> 00:14:59,800
I’ll be fine.

250
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,760
Your Highness.

251
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,400
Feiye.

252
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,530
Are you okay?

253
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,240
Call the physician.

254
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,070
Don’t bother.

255
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,650
My skill is not good.

256
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,780
Also,

257
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,490
my wife knows about medicine.

258
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,329
She can treat me.

259
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,950
No matter what,

260
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:12,130
there must be a physician by your side

261
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,650
to guarantee your safety.

262
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:01,890
Your Highness,

263
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,150
I need to do acupuncture for you.

264
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,190
Han Yunxi,

265
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,070
if you don’t take action,

266
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:20,570
Prince Qin,

267
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,240
you

268
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,700
and your mother

269
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,030
can’t

270
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,360
go out

271
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,860
of this palace today.

272
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,470
What are you waiting for?

273
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,700
I’m tired.

274
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,990
Finish this feast.

275
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,030
You can go back.

276
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,660
Your Majesty.

277
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,310
How’s it going?

278
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,030
Your Majesty.

279
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,400
Everything is ready.

280
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:33,650
You may go.

281
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,400
Yes.

282
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,400
Ask the archers to be ready.

283
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,110
Han Yunxi,

284
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,700
why did you do so?

285
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,030
Feiye, are you all right?

286
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:36,650
Guards!

287
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,190
Protect the king!

288
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,070
Guards!

289
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,150
Seize him.

290
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,530
Protect the king!

291
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,360
Protect the king!

292
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,860
Guards!

293
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,070
Circle here!

294
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:01,860
Yes!

295
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,280
Seize him!

296
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,700
Yes!

297
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:52,970
Your Highness.

298
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:06,860
Physician!

299
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,360
Physician!

300
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:20,030
Your... Your Majesty.

301
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,240
Darling.

302
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,540
Your Majesty.

303
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,280
Can I ask for something?

304
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,820
Ask me when you are well.

305
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,610
I... I...

306
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,200
I’m afraid if I don’t say it,

307
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,240
I...

308
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,320
I won’t have another chance.

309
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,030
Don’t worry.

310
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,320
With Physician Han,

311
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,400
you will get well.

312
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,570
You must be well.

313
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,000
Your Majesty.

314
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,450
If I...

315
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,820
If I can’t live...

316
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,200
For my sake,

317
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:05,360
please take...

318
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,860
take care of Xiqiu.

319
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,150
Don’t worry.

320
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,200
As long as I take the throne,

321
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,740
I must protect Xiqiu.

322
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,700
Darling.

323
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,490
Physician!

324
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,900
Bastard slaves!

325
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:29,900
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

326
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,160
Physician Han is here.

327
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,240
-Your Majesty.
-Stop the formality!

328
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,450
Diagnose Noble Consort Qing!

329
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,510
Yes, Your Majesty.

330
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:37,530
If Qing leaves me,

331
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,210
you will go to accompany her.

332
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:05,990
-Run!
-Yes.

333
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,530
Your Majesty.

334
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:20,320
How is she?

335
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,490
Consort Qing’s situation is not dangerous.

336
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,360
If the assassin

337
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:24,750
stabbed her more left,

338
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,190
no one

339
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,190
can save her.

340
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,190
Her life is saved,

341
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,700
but Consort Qing needs rest.

342
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,280
I’ll take the prescription.

343
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,450
Don't waste time!

344
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,490
Yes.

345
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:44,910
Your Majesty.

346
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,400
Hurry.

347
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:28,650
Go.

348
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,010
We are cheated.

349
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:38,610
Look.

350
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,240
Isn’t it the palace

351
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,740
to imprison Poison Master?

352
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,320
Yes.

353
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,240
But Poison Master is not here.

354
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,780
And the watcher has gone.

355
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,570
Why is still someone there?

356
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,780
Go have a check.

357
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:00,530
Go.

358
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,610
Is Feiye hurt?

359
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:08,490
Yes, aunt.

360
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,700
Brother Feiye got hurt.

361
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,610
And it’s quite severe.

362
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,780
It must be Han Yunxi.

363
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,270
No matter whether it’s her,

364
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,530
I won’t

365
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,860
let this disaster

366
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,900
stay in this mansion.

367
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:32,860
Your Highness.

368
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,240
I’m sorry.

369
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,740
I didn’t mean to do it.

370
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,030
But I have no choice.

371
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,450
For my mother,

372
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,150
I was forced to do so.

373
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,950
Hope you forgive me.

374
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,240
I apologize.

375
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,030
Why did you do this?

376
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,240
Feiye, are you all right?

377
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,190
Feiye!

378
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:31,700
Feiye!

379
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,740
Come out.

380
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:37,990
How dare you?

381
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,740
You even cheated me?

382
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:41,860
Say it.

383
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,650
What else did you cheat me?

384
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,570
Say it!

385
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:51,220
You don’t need to speak for her.

386
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:52,740
She told me

387
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,820
everything.

388
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:54,740
Mother,

389
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,200
I know His Highness got hurt

390
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,150
because of me.

391
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,450
I admit

392
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,490
that the Dowager sent me

393
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,620
to spy His Highness.

394
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,650
But I swear,

395
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,700
I never did

396
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,580
anything that

397
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,110
hurt this family.

398
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:06,990
Mother?

399
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:10,990
I am not capable

400
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,400
to be your mother.

401
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:17,950
Mother.

402
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:18,990
Feiye.

403
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,110
Open your eyes.

404
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:22,700
How did

405
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,700
she charm you?

406
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,490
She is a jinx.

407
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,540
After she married you,

408
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,020
have you ever lived a comfortable life?

409
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:33,070
Drive her out now!

410
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,820
Now!

411
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:36,610
Aunt.

412
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,320
Aunt, please calm down.

413
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,490
Brother Feiye always knows

414
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:40,530
what he should do.

415
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,770
Please trust me one more time.

416
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,530
I know what to do.

417
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,450
Feiye!

418
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,070
Feiye!

419
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,110
Come back!

420
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,490
Aunt.

421
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,320
Aunt. Calm down.

422
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,400
Aunt. Aunt.

423
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,740
Don’t be angry.

424
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:07,780
Brother Feiye is

425
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,740
very filial.

426
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,280
He will listen to you.

427
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:22,810
Your Highness.

428
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:27,400
If I die,

429
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,430
you will be satisfied, won’t you?

430
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,650
I’m sorry.

431
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,780
I knew you were poisoned,

432
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,280
but I didn’t know

433
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,820
you are a Gu-infected man.

434
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,490
What if you knew it?

435
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,240
Wouldn’t you hurt me?

436
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:49,860
Han Yunxi.

437
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,280
We experienced much.

438
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,740
I thought you are

439
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,490
different to me.

440
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,110
But I was wrong.

441
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:09,650
I was totally wrong.

442
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:11,530
No,

443
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,360
it’s not true.

444
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,330
Let me treat you first.

445
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,400
After you are well,

446
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,360
you can do anything to me.

447
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,820
Why did you do it?

448
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,730
The Dowager threatened me.

449
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,070
If I didn’t do it,

450
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:31,860
you,

451
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,360
I and

452
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,360
my mother

453
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,820
will die.

454
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,200
I thought

455
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:45,050
these three acupoints are not fatal.

456
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,320
So I agreed with her.

457
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,700
I didn’t think

458
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,110
that the Dowager sent someone to watch me.

459
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,030
I had no choice.

460
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,030
But trust me.

461
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:55,320
I did so because

462
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,980
I have a way to solve the issue.

463
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,570
But I didn’t think

464
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,880
that you are a Gu-infected man.

465
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:06,860
Your mother died

466
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,070
ten years ago.

467
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:12,820
No.

468
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,200
I saw her in the Dowager’s place.

469
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,200
Her figure and profile

470
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,570
is the same as my mother.

471
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:28,650
She has my mother’s bracelet,

472
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:30,540
medicine bottle

473
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,650
and medicine bag.

474
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,780
Only my mother

475
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,240
and I know that bag.

476
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:37,570
It must be her.

477
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,450
It’s the dowager’s trick.

478
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,640
She used your love to your mother.

479
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,530
I am sure that

480
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,400
your mother passed away.

481
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,570
No.

482
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,300
You didn’t see my mother.

483
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,240
Why are you so sure?

484
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,570
I saw her.

485
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,780
♫ The wick burns out, the fire dies ♫

486
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:12,450
♫ Fennel and angelica for a heart changing soup ♫

487
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,650
♫ Please have a taste ♫

488
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:18,320
♫ It keeps raining and my eyes get blurred ♫

489
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:22,070
♫ While the past gets clearer ♫

490
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:24,740
No.

491
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,150
My mother is alive.

492
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,240
She must be alive.

493
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,150
She didn’t die.

494
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,360
She didn’t.

495
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,360
My mother is alive.

496
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,200
She didn’t die.

497
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,780
She didn’t.

498
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,139
Your Highness.

499
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,780
Now it’s your work.

500
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,610
Mr. Bai.

501
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:31,570
I believe that you

502
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,110
won’t let me down.

503
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,280
It is said that Qinxi

504
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,949
gained the world with

505
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,320
the troops of Gu-infected men.

506
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,580
For hundreds of years,

507
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,400
the record of Gu-infected men

508
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,449
has lost.

509
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,560
But in the imperial palace,

510
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,949
there are still some records.

511
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,909
With these records,

512
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,190
I can make

513
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,610
Gu-infected men.

514
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,530
Mr. Bai’s medical skill

515
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,400
is the best in the world.

516
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,570
Sir, please.

517
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,950
No. No.

518
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:22,570
Mr. Bai.

519
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,790
What’s this for?

520
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,240
Maybe people of Qinxi

521
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:32,020
can help me succeed easily.

522
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:36,850
What do you want to do?

523
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,570
I won’t allow you to

524
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:38,570
hurt my son.

525
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:44,680
Stand up.

526
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,700
Don’t come!

527
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,900
We have a lot of test targets.

528
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,360
It doesn’t matter to lose one.

529
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,150
Mother!

530
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:03,900
Go.

531
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:08,860
Drink.

532
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:54,490
No.

533
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:57,570
No.

534
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:58,950
No.

535
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,490
I don’t drink.

536
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,900
I don’t want to die.

537
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:02,650
Drink.

538
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:45,240
I lived this life

539
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,840
in the prison for four years.

540
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,520
Every once in a while,

541
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:51,440
they forced me to drink a kind of medicine.

542
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:53,860
Gradually, I became

543
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,320
a theroid Gu-infected man

544
00:37:58,950 --> 00:37:59,860
from a human.

545
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,890
How can they be so ruthless?

546
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,240
They harmed a kid.

547
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:08,650
Are you hurt now?

548
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,730
The pain went away long ago.

549
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,610
But poisonous Gu

550
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,700
attacks time to time.

551
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,630
It’s fine as long as I bear it.

552
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:44,700
Kid.

553
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,320
Wake up.

554
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,780
Mother.

555
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:50,610
Mother.

556
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:02,360
Kid.

557
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:04,300
Don’t worry. I came to save you.

558
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,700
Do you trust me?

559
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,450
Why do you save me?

560
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,140
Because I am a physician.

561
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,000
It’s better than to die here.

562
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,320
I can see the sun at least.

563
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,200
Alright. Let’s go.

564
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:31,820
Chop.

565
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:33,950
Stop!

566
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:37,740
Hurry.

567
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:39,950
Seize them.

568
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,280
Boy, are you all right?

569
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,190
Don’t care me.

570
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,450
I can’t succeed escaping.

571
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:58,740
Silly boy, what are you saying?

572
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,610
You called me “mother”.

573
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:00,670
How can I leave you?

574
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,360
Hurry. Stand up.

575
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:03,780
Stop!

576
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,740
No. We must run.

577
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,490
Hurry up.

578
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,200
Stop!

579
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:19,740
Don’t come.

580
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,310
Don’t get close to me.

581
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:22,490
Give me this boy.

582
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:23,280
You caught innocent people

583
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,280
to be Gu-infected man.

584
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,740
It’s ruthlessly immoral.

585
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,450
Do you

586
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:28,110
still have conscience?

587
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:29,320
You are pushing me

588
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,490
to use violence.

589
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:31,200
Now!

590
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,030
Seize them!

591
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:32,820
-Yes!
-Yes.

592
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,360
Mother.
