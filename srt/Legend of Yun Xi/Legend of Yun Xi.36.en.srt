Episode 36

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,010
Beauty Blood can’t cure poisonous Gu.

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,050
I knew it.

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,510
Every time I drank poison

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,710
to make Beauty Blood,

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,360
though I was in immense pain,

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,220
thinking that Beauty Blood

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,390
can save Feiye,

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,800
I managed to tough it through.

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,350
But…

12
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:33,760
But you told me

13
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,780
Beauty Blood wouldn’t help at all.

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,350
So all my sufferings

15
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,510
are in vain.

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,550
Don’t worry.

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,550
Beauty Blood can be cured,

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,390
but

19
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,310
it’ll take a long time.

20
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,180
I don’t care whether my poison

21
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,240
can be cured or not.

22
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,890
I only worry about Feiye.

23
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,430
I know Yunxi very well.

24
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,260
I’m afraid if she knows it,

25
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,470
she’ll use her blood to save Long Feiye.

26
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,180
Yes.

27
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,800
She loves Feiye

28
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:14,600
very much.

29
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,090
So what’s the way to detoxify Feiye?

30
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:20,850
If it takes Yunxi’s life

31
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,050
to save Feiye,

32
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,210
Feiye won’t

33
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,300
allow her to do it.

34
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,720
By then,

35
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,600
I need you to stop Yunxi.

36
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,390
There’s only one antidote

37
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,930
in this world.

38
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,680
It is…

39
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:45,890
Mister,

40
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:47,930
what is it?

41
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:50,640
I gotta go check

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,220
if your brother is here.

43
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:56,930
Is it the heart blood

44
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,729
of your Poison Master’s family?

45
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,180
If you die,

46
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:02,760
then in the whole world,

47
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,890
only Han Yunxi’s blood

48
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,020
can save Long Feiye.

49
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:05,800
Right?

50
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,550
If both of your heart blood

51
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,800
can save Long Feiye,

52
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,090
then it must be a difficult choice

53
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,220
for Han Yunxi.

54
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,090
I’m helping her,

55
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,220
so that she won’t be torn.

56
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:22,850
Miss,

57
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,680
don’t let the evilness

58
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,010
control you.

59
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,600
Stay sober!

60
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,850
I am sober!

61
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,550
Listen!

62
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,360
If Han Yunxi wants to save Long Feiye,

63
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,890
then she has to die.

64
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,460
If she isn’t going to save him,

65
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,260
I’ll let Feiye know

66
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,930
what a hypocrite she is,

67
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,510
so Feiye

68
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,760
can see that himself

69
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,350
and then take her heart blood!

70
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,970
Why do you want to kill him?

71
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,050
Feiye.

72
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,020
He made all of your family members die.

73
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:58,720
And he made you suffer

74
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,800
a great deal!

75
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,520
But you are asking me why I wanna kill him?

76
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,100
Just because

77
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,220
you love Han Yunxi,

78
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,180
you think you can forget

79
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:05,970
the blood feud

80
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,050
you bear?

81
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,080
Now that you can’t kill him,

82
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,010
then I have to kill him for you

83
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,610
to free you from the dilemma.

84
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:14,600
It’s between

85
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,650
Han Yunxi and me!

86
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,890
How’s that related to you?

87
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,390
No matter whom

88
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,980
I will take revenge on,

89
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,650
it’s my

90
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,700
own business!

91
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,400
Go away!

92
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,630
You still don’t understand?

93
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:29,740
Everything I’ve done

94
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,650
is for you!

95
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,650
For me?

96
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,310
Mingxiang.

97
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,920
I’ll bear it in mind

98
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,550
that you treated me well.

99
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,610
And I do feel guilty.

100
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:40,780
But this is not the reason

101
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,860
for you to do evil!

102
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,570

You promised…

108
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,320
You promised you wouldn’t kill my father!

109
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,649
Why did you go back on your words?

110
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:21,570
Why? Tell me!

111

Don’t you know

178
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,450
if Poison Master dies,

179
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,650
no one can make the antidote to poisonous Gu now?

180
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,980
My brother will be dead!

181
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:15,740
Let her go!

182
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,280
Can you hear her out first?

183
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,530
I can cure Feiye!

184
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,240
I can do it!

185
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,570
Are you crazy?

186
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:26,200
Yes.

187
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,280
I am.

188
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,680
Every one of you

189
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,360
only cares about Han Yunxi.

190
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,490
No one ever

191
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,950
cares about my pain.

192
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,320
I also feel hurt,

193
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,700
frightened

194
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,280
and stressed.

195
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,830
Am I wrong to take care of myself?

196
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,820
Why are you scolding me?

197
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:50,200
Yes.

198
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,280
I’m conscienceless.

199
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,820
Since there’s no room for me

200
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,070
in this mansion,

201
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,070
and Feiye no longer needs me,

202
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,450
I’ll just leave here

203
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,050
and stop bothering you guys!

204
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:06,900
Hey!

205
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,030
She…

206
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,570
Do you think it’s true

207
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,510
that she killed Poison Master?

208
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,280
I think it is.

209
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:21,780
How could she

210
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,060
do such an evil thing?

211
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,260
Yunxi just reunited with her father!

212
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,070
She…

213
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,190
Besides,

214
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,200
Feiye always treats her nicely,

215
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,400
and Her Highness

216
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,990
even sees her as a daughter!

217
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,070
Qishao!

218
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,280
Qishao!

219
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,190
Yuze! You are awake!

220
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,490
Let me save you and Zhuyu out.

221
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,200
Don’t.

222
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,150
I want to go back to Beili.

223
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,780
I gotta solve

224
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,780
these things

225
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:16,740
and get

226
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,740
my mother’s ashes first

227
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,140
before I can leave Beili.

228
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,260
It’s so good that you are awake!

229
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,570
Sorry I didn’t

230
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:24,490
protect you well.

231
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,070
Qishao, don’t blame yourself.

232
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:26,780
I vaguely remember

233
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,440
that an old man detoxified me.

234
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,740
An old man?

235
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,740
It was Poison Master.

236
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,610
I bet it was him!

237
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,030
Yuze,

238
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,070
go save Zhuyu

239
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,150
and get out of here.

240
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,030
What about you?

241
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,880
Don’t worry.

242
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,280
They won’t hurt me.

243
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,030
Come on. Leave here.

244
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,240
Feiye! You are back!

245
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:58,720
Brother,

246
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,150
I have something to ask.

247
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,700
Go ahead.

248
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,930
Did you kill Poison Master?

249
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,610
I did.

250
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,820
Feiye, stop lying!

251
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,030
We know the truth!

252
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:11,950
Mingxiang has

253
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,080
told us everything.

254
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,700
She killed him!

255
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,570
Why did you take the blame for her?

256
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,860
You are not afraid that Han Yunxi will blame you?

257
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,720
No matter what,

258
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,830
I don’t want Mingxiang

259
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,490
to get involved again.

260
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,990
Feiye,

261
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,030
are you going

262
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,280
to give Yunxi up forever?

263
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,150
If Yunxi thinks you

264
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,700
are the one who killed her father,

265
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,150
then

266
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,170
you two can never

267
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,490
be together.

268
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,320
Besides,

269
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:35,950
Poison Master is gone,

270
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,410
what about your antidote?

271
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,950
Remember.

272
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,070
Do not tell anyone

273
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,280
that Mingxiang killed Poison Master!

274
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,880
Mingxiang becomes like this

275
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:47,700
because of me.

276
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,450
She is my sister.

277
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,360
I should be responsible

278
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,740
for her sin.

279
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,620
How dare you ask someone to save Zhuyu!

280
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,910
If you wanna kill me,

281
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:14,950
then do it!

282
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,110
See that?

283
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,190
That’s Yaogui Valley!

284
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,190
I burnt it down.

285
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,270
It’s the price you’ve got to pay
for letting Zhuyu escape.

286
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,150
Jun Yixie.

287
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,420
This time,

288
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,020
I didn’t get Poison Master,

289
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,190
instead, I was humiliated big time in Tianning.

290
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,190
Tell me,

291
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,400
how should we settle that?

292
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,360
Look carefully

293
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,030
and keep it forever in mind

294
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,360
that you are always a lowlife

295
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,160
and you’ll never become a royal!

296
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,400
How can you

297
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:10,650
compare to me?

298
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,240
When we are back,

299
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,860
I will let you pay one by one

300
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,900
for what you did!

301
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:33,520
Brother,

302
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,320
when shall we

303
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,150
take actions?

304
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,450
If Xiqiu and Beili

305
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:40,780
have allied in secret,

306
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,980
once we take actions,

307
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,650
as the princess of Xiqiu,

308
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,580
Chu Qingge will ask Xiqiu and Beili

309
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,780
for reinforcement.

310
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,150
If so,

311
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,160
our chance to win will be much smaller.

312
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:55,970
It’s my fault

313
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,450
that I didn’t make Jun Yizheng our ally.

314
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,580
It’s not your fault!

315
00:15:58,610 --> 00:15:59,200
It’s all because

316
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,600
of that ungrateful jerk!

317
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,070
Tang Li,

318
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,550
the process is more important.

319
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:07,900
Feiye is right!

320
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,100
Your Highness.

321
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,820
Jun Yizheng burnt

322
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,200
Yaogui Valley down.

323
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,790
Looks like Jun Yizheng

324
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,150
is going to force Gu Qishao

325
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,240
into a corner.

326
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,530
Since Yaogui Valley is destroyed,

327
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,860
Gu Qishao will have no backup plan anymore.

328
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,610
I’m afraid his life

329
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,650
will be harder

330
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,680
after he goes back to Beili.

331
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,280
To be honest,

332
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,610
it’d be great

333
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,780
if Gu Qishao were Crown Prince

334
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,530
of Beili.

335
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,400
He and Yunxi are good friends.

336
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,660
He’ll help us for sure.

337
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:39,700
Unlike that

338
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,820
ungrateful jerk,

339
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,500
who never keeps his promise!

340
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,720
What are you talking about?

341
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,390
Your Highness,

342
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,400
I actually think

343
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:50,820
Miss Ningjing’s words

344
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,820
make sense.

345
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,300
Although Gu Qishao is a prince,

346
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,700
his mother was a maid.

347
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:57,740
He’s been kept in the Cold Palace

348
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,070
since he was little.

349
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,570
He doesn’t get along

350
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:01,570
with either the Emperor

351
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,650
or Crown Prince.

352
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,780
Xifeng,

353
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,700
go to Beili

354
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,190
and find out what other secrets

355
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,200
Gu Qishao has.

356
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,359
Yes.

357
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:17,640
Brother,

358
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,900
I thought you always

359
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,280
disliked Gu Qishao.

360
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,700
Gu Qishao is the key

361
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,640
to destroy the alliance of Xiqiu and Beili.

362
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,030
You are right, brother.

363
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,190
Because I gave him a reminder.

364
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,110
Alright!

365
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,540
You are awesome. Okay?

366
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,200
Is there any news about Mingxiang?

367
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,700
Yes.

368
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,320
The secret guards found that she went

369
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,380
to Bai Xiaochuan’s place last night.

370
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,740
Miss Mingxiang,

371
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,000
General Baili is here.

372
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,070
Dad!

373
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,850
Xiaochuan,

374
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,700
leave us.

375
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:17,820
Yes.

376
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,740
Mingxiang,

377
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,320
you are so silly!

378
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,450
I don’t understand

379
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,950
what you are talking about.

380
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,680
Why did you kill Poison Master?

381
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,280
Feiye told you?

382
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,280
No.

383
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,530
Chu Xifeng gave me a letter

384
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,650
and told me His Highness killed Poison Master.

385
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,200
I had a hard time to believe it.

386
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,930
So I investigated it in secret.

387
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:49,310
Someone told me

388
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,900
that you ran out of Xuanyuan Temple

389
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,630
with blood all over your hands.

390
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,490
Dad, you are indeed smart.

391
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,780
I don’t dare lie to you.

392
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:58,820
But Poison Master

393
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,150
was Feiye’s enemy.

394
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,660
Why can’t I kill him?

395
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,110
But he was the only one

396
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,970
who knew how to save His Highness.

397
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:06,400
The only one?

398
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,900
Then how about me?

399
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,320
Mingxiang…

400
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,110
Dad.

401
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:12,950
You know what?

402
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,490
Poison Master told me Beauty Blood

403
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,350
couldn’t detoxify poisonous Gu.

404
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,320
His words

405
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,110
put all my efforts of these years

406
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,070
in vain.

407
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:25,240
And now,

408
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,280
I’ve totally

409
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,810
become the butt of the joke!

410
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,320
I can’t let this happen!

411
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:30,950
Dad,

412
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,490
I can’t!

413
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,450
Mingxiang.

414
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,150
Back then, when I found that

415
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,820
you were cultivating Beauty Blood,

416
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,780
I asked you

417
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,190
what you’d do

418
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,780
if Beauty Blood

419
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,790
couldn’t cure poisonous Gu.

420
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,900
Do you remember how you answered me?

421
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:48,740
You said

422
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,780
no matter what the result was,

423
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,530
you wouldn’t

424
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,530
regret.

425
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:53,990
But now, you…

426
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,650
Dad,

427
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,860
I’ve never regretted.

428
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:58,820
I’ve just been

429
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,150
more and more convinced

430
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:01,570
that my choice

431
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,530
was right.

432
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:03,860
No one

433
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,610
can save Feiye, except for me!

434
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,320
Dad,

435
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:08,740
you’ve got to trust me.

436
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,530
I used my life

437
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,700
in exchange

438
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,780
for Feiye’s love.

439
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,150
But I failed.

440
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,240
Totally failed!

441
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,070
Mingxiang,

442
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,190
don’t you know

443
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,450
such an impulsive behavior

444
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,180
actually ruined His Highness?

445
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,620
Go back with me

446
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,880
tomorrow morning.

447
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,400
Dad,

448
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,030
I won’t go back.

449
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,030
It’s my order!

450
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,070
You must obey!

451
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,290
Let’s set out tomorrow morning!

452
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:02,990
Miss, you look

453
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,170
much better today.

454
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:06,320
I think

455
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:07,610
my father wouldn’t

456
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:08,940
want me to be depressed.

457
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,150
I remember that leader

458
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:13,610
once said that he liked

459
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,990
your smile the most.

460
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,990
Thank you, Physician Gu.

461
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,650
And sorry for making you worried.

462
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,070
I will pull myself together.

463
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,650
Miss,

464
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,110
just call my name

465
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:24,950
in the future.

466
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,950
It’s more casual.

467
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,070
I’ve got used to it.

468
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,570
Looks like it’s a nice day.

469
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,490
Would you like

470
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,700
to take a walk somewhere

471
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,760
and relax a little?

472
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:37,530

474
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,150
Miss, you may not know.

475
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,650
Yaogui Valley is gone.

476
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,150
Gone?

477
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,710
What do you mean?

478
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,030
Someone

479
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,070
burnt it down

480
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,110
last night.

481
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,610
That was everything

482
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:56,610
Gu Qishao had!

483
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:01,670
Forget it.

484
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,900
Just let it be.

485
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,900
Even his identity was fake,

486
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,560
so who cares about the valley?

487
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,110
I just feel sorry about those herbs.

00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,630
Have you thought this through, Your Highness?

527
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,570
Please take good care

528
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,490
of Yunxi.

529
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:38,030
Don’t worry, Your Highness.

530
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,740
Miss Yunxi is my leader’s daughter.

531
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,070
So she’s also my master.

532
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:41,950
I will surly

533
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,740
do my best

534
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,030
to take care of her.

535
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,200
But it’s not for you,

536
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,450
it’s my responsibility.

537
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:55,660
I’m willing to do it.

538
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:01,910
I’ll take my leave now.

539

00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,820
Give my order.

541
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,610
We’ll spend

542
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,030
the night here

543
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,070
and continue the trip tomorrow.

544
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:23,990
Yes, General!

545
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,440
Mingxiang,

546
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,060
tell me what you want to eat.

547
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,370
We still have a long way to go tomorrow.

548
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,060
I’m not hungry.

[Gu’s Mansion]

550
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,450
Move these herbs to medicine room.

551
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:46,990
Yes.

[To: Han Yunxi]

Prince Qin

554
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,110
loves Miss Yunxi deeply.

555
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,570
But why are they

556
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,570
like strangers now?

557
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,280
Don’t put those herbs

558
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,150
in the yard.

559
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,360
Move them to the storehouse.

560
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:11,950
Yes.

561
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:21,490
Miss.

562
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,570
Where did you get so many herbs from?

563
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,820
I’ve asked the Imperial Hospital

564
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,900
for a long time leave.

565
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,570
I selected

566
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:32,400
these herbs in person

567
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,000
from the Imperial Hospital.

568
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:35,450
Since you want

569
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:36,360
to focus on developing

570
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,530
the antidote to poisonous Gu,

571
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:38,860
I should spare no effort

572
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,780
to assist you.

573
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:42,570
I’m afraid

574
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,360
these herbs can only sustain

575
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,820
for a short period of time.

576
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:58,100
General.

577
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,450
Miss Mingxiang is missing!

578
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:01,740
What?

579
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,200
Send people

00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,030
Yes!

582
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200
Stop!

583
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,710
What do you want?

584
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,400
Money?

585
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,750
I have some here.

586
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:44,110
You are such a beauty!

587
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:48,490
Today, we don’t want money!

588
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:51,860
Let me go!

589
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,610
Let me go!

00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,070
Let go!

Don’t come over!

00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,780
What a tough chick!

594
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,570
Listen up!

00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,640
My father is General Baili!

00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,030
Prince Qin is my cousin!

they won’t let you off!

600
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,490
You think

601
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,240
you can scare me by that?

602
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,430
What General? What Prince Qin?

603
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:21,570
I’m the only boss

604
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,490
here!

605
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:23,960
I call the shots!

606
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:34,490
Who did that?

607
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,450
Come out!

608
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,030
Come out!

609
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,530

610
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,280

Why are you here?

614

It’s not the place to talk.

615
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,200
We should get out of here first.

616
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,570
Let me escort you back.

617
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,980
Thank you, Eunuch Li.

618
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,490
Thanks,

619
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:27,530
I got this.

620
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:28,610
It’s okay.

621
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,610
Miss Baili, are you

622
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,340
going to Prince Qin’s Mansion?

623
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:34,200
No.

624
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,700
Then where are you going?

625
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,110
General Baili and I

626
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,110
are good friends.

627
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,450
If you

628
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,530
don’t mind,

629
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:46,950
you can stay

630
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,900
in my house for a while.

631
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:50,860
Then…

632
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:55,700
Okay.

633
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,490
Alright, let’s go.

634
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,450
General.

635
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:28,860
How is it?

636
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,200
I’ve looked all over the place,

637
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,030
but didn’t find

638
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:31,960
Miss Mingxiang.

639
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,990
Ya!

640
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,020
Ya!

641
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,060
Greetings, Your Highness!

642
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:48,840
Please rise.

643
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,660
Don’t mind the formality.

644
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,780
I came to the capital to report my work
this time.

645
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,200
To avoid unnecessary trouble,

646
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,650
I shouldn’t have come to visit you.

647
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:57,650
But I made a sin,

648
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,860
so I have to apologize to you in person.

649
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,070
General, you are

650
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,400
a faithful patriot,

651
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,530
why did you say that?

652
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,860
Mingxiang did such an evil thing

653
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,990
and made you suffer.

654
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,240
As her father,

655
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,730
I have to take the blame.

656
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,570
If I had found

657
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,570
her obsession for you earlier

658
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:12,570
and prevented it,

659
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,190
she wouldn’t have been so silly

660
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,810
and done such an evil thing.

661
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,790
Mingxiang killed Poison Master

662
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,030
to avenge me.

663
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,720
That’s understandable.

664
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,800
But based on Mingxiang’s condition,

665
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,070
she shouldn’t stay in the capital.

666
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,030
I was going to take her with me

667
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,830
and leave the capital this time.

668
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,990
But she ran away.

669
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,400
I’m afraid she’d do something stupid.

670
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,220
If Mingxiang left alone,

671
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:42,320
she might be on the way

672
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,650
back to the capital.

673
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,900
When I saw her this time,

674
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,910
I felt something wrong with her.

675
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,280
It’s my fault

676
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,700
that I spoiled her too much

677
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,160
and didn’t teach her well.

678
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,490
Please forgive me, Your Highness!

679
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,290
Don’t blame yourself, General!

680
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,570
Too many things have happened recently,

681
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:00,490
which caused her mood swing.

682
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,750
But don’t worry.

683
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,530
I will send people

684
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,610
to find her.

685
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,740
Thank you, Your Highness!

686
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,310
Besides,

687
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,570
I’ve left the border for days.

688
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:11,700
If I don’t go back soon,

689
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,610
I’m afraid King Tianhui will suspect.

690
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,110
So please help me find Mingxiang,

691
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,320
Your Highness!

692
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,050
I will do my best for sure!

693
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,280
Thank you, Your Highness!

694
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,160
Greetings, Your Majesty!

695
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,280
Rise.

696
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,450
How is it going with the thing

697
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,400
I asked you to do?

698
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,990
Your Majesty,

699
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,860
it’s done already.

700
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,070
For these years,

701
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,160
I’ve always felt relieved

702
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,660
when you did things for me.

703
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,200
Your Majesty,

704
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,680
I have something else to tell you.

705
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,320
Go ahead.

706
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,650
I saved someone

707
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,420
on my way back to the capital.

708
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:23,150
Who?

709
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:24,950
Baili Mingxiang.

710
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,070
Baili Mingxiang?

711
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,480
General Baili’s daughter?

712
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:30,280
Yes.

713
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,200
Miss Baili walked

714
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,740
in the wildness alone.

715
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,860
If I hadn’t happened to pass by,

716
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,530
Miss Baili might have

717
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,780
been raped by the bandits.

718
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,990
Your Majesty, Miss Baili

719
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,860
seemed to have snuck out.

720
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,490
I’ve arranged her

721
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,950
to stay in my place.

722
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:56,900
Baili Mingxiang

723
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:59,780
is General Baili’s beloved daughter.

724
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,340
Maybe she’ll be useful to us.

725
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,900
Treat her well.

726
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,050
Remember.

727
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,700
Don’t tell anybody else

728
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,900
about this.

729
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,239
Yes, Your Majesty!

730
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:10,250
Your Majesty!

731
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,989
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

732
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:15,650
Bad news!

733
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,199
Why are you so flustered?

734
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,150
Your Majesty,

735
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,460
I just got the message.

736
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,530
A plague broke out in the sixteen provinces
in the Southern Regions.

737
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,489
More than 100 people have died.

738
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:24,360
This is the proposal

739
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,949
sent from there.

740
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,030
Now,

741
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,190
summon ministers into the palace.

742
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,280
Yes, Your Majesty!

743
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:12,660
[Haidong Village]

744
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:25,580
Are you thirsty?

745
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,250
Your Majesty,

746
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:47,990
I think it matters a lot.

747
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,240
We’ve got to send some major ministers

748
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,370
to go there with imperial physicians.

749
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,190
For one,

750
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,070
we can reassure the people;

751
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:56,950
for two,

752
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,110
we can supervise

753

the officials in the Southern Regions

754
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,650
in case they’ll take bribes

755
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,240
and bend the law.

756
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,190

757
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,530
who’s willing

758
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,960
to go to the Southern Regions

759
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,990
and supervise the disaster relief?

760
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,570
Your Majesty,

761
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,190
I’m willing to go

762
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,430
and relieve the people there from suffering.

763
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,070
Your Majesty,

764
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,030
I’m willing to go.

765
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,820
Your Majesty,

766
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,590
I’m the Minister of Revenue,

767
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,900
so I’m familiar with the local situation.

768
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,530
Please allow me to go there.

769
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,150
I’m touched

770
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,780
that you all concern about

771
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,360
the fate of our country.

772
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:50,780
As for who will be assigned there…

773
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,360
Minister of Personnel.

774
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,420
Yes, Your Majesty.

775
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,200
You’ve never

776
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,150
done any

777
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,370
similar job before,

778
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:02,200
and the disaster this time

779
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,050
is quite serious and critical.

780
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,150
It’s not suitable

781
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,360
to send you there.

782
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,280
Minister of of Revenue.

783
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

784
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,990
You are suitable for this job.

785
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,280
But as you said,

786
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:15,860
it matters a lot,

787
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,990
so we should send

788
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,440
a prestigious one there

789
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,740
to show the care of our court.

790
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:26,820
Prince Qin,

791
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:29,360
you are a member of royal family of Tianning.

792
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,610
It’ll be great

793
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,150
if you are willing to go.

794
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,320
Your status

795
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,280
can certainly show the importance

796
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,540
we royal clan attaches to the civilians.

797
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,810
And you’ve done disaster relief for many times,

798
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,780
so you are qualified and experienced.

799
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,450
I think

800
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,570
you are the perfect one to go there.

801
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,290
I won’t fail you,

802
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,240
Your Majesty!

803
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:52,360
Good!

804
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,360
I’ll send Mu Qingwu

805

and imperial physicians to go with you.

806
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,240
Hope you can solve

807
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,610
the plague successfully

808
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,700
and save the people from danger.

809
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,200
I also want to consult

810
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,150
those ministers who are familiar

811
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,570
with the conditions there.

812
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:07,570
Hope you can allow me, Your Majesty.

813
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:08,320
Okay.

[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

815
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,900
Sun Muchu’s force at the Southern Regions

816
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,760
is the main force of my rebellion.

817
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,720
But they may suffer a great loss

818
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,360
due to the plague.

819
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:24,240
Don’t worry, Your Highness.

820
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,280
According to Minister Sun,

821
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,530
currently, only the weak group

822
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,400
got infected.

823
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,610
The weak group?

824
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,950
They surely

825
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:39,660
have poor immunity.

826
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,100
But as the plague goes on,

827
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,320
the situation may change.

828
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,620
I think, seemingly,

829
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,740
King Tianhui sends you there

830
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,070

but actually,

833
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,640
he wants to see if you have

834
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:56,080
any relation with the Southern Regions.

835

Plague disaster is different.

No matter how tough you are,

839
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:06,150
you may still get infected and killed.

00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,820
The situation is so unstable for now.

841

I can’t let you take the risk.

And we’ll strike soon.

At this point,

848
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,190
if anything bad happens to you,

849
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,920
all our efforts will go in vain!

You think we plan to overthrow

852
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,100
King Tianhui’s throne to take revenge?

853
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:37,110
King Tianhui is stubborn and brutal.

854
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,430
He levies heavy taxes every year.

855

in extreme misery.

857
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:46,660
Taking revenge is not the sole purpose

858
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,800
of overthrowing his throne.

859
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:53,200
We are doing this mostly to save the people
from suffering.

860
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,900
If the plague

861
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,500
can’t be controlled in time,

862
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,360
many people will die of it.

863
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,570
Our civilians and country

864
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,860
are both in danger.

865
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,820
We can’t put the cart before the horse

866
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,220
and turn a blind eye to it.

867

-You are right, Your Highness!
-You are right, Your Highness!

what if

00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,280
you get into danger?

871
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,070
I always

872
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:17,780
urge you to study

873
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,490
and practice martial arts hard

874
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,780
so that you can replace me

00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,950
if I’m gone one day.

876
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:26,400
No!

877
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,530
If you are not with me, I…

878
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:29,950
I…

879
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,030
I can’t do it, brother!

880
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,070
Yunxi!

881
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:47,280
Stop looking.

882
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,280
I came here alone.

883
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:51,110
My brother will go to the Southern Regions.

884
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,240
Why?

885
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,860
A plague broke out there.

886
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,320
His Majesty sent my brother to do relief job.

887
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,700
How come there’s a plague all of a sudden?

888
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,070
We haven’t found it out yet.

889
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:00,820
Only when my brother arrives

890
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,880
can he find out why.

891
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,060
I’m worried about his safety.

892
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:05,030
So,

893
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,960
I’m here to see you.

894
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,240
You are good at detoxifying.

895
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,320
I’ll only be relieved

896
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,650
once you are by his side.

897
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:12,990
I have studied

898
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:13,990
plague before.

899
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,000
I’ll be with him.

900
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:16,780
Don’t worry!

901
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,990
So you agree to go?

902
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,030
Of course.

903
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,200
You can’t go!

904
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,570
Why?

905
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:28,650
Miss,

906
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,700
though you are good at detoxifying,

907
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,760
you don’t have great medical skills.

908
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,360
It’s a plague in the Southern Regions,

909
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,070
not poison.

910
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:35,990
So, you can’t

911
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,590
be of much help even if you go.

912
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:38,490
I…

913
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,380
I can assist the physicians.

914
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,320
The Imperial Hospital

915
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,570
has sent half of the physicians.

916
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:44,030
They won’t need more help.

917
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:46,990
What if you

918
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,320
get infected there?

919
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,400
Plus,

920
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:53,280
based on your relationship with Prince Qin
for now,

921
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,010
I don’t think

922
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,650
it’s a good idea that you go.
