Episode 47

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,600
Did you see it clearly?

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,970
Their camp is empty.

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,140
Long Feiye!

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,650
Your Majesty, don’t be angry.

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:18,910
They must have learned

8
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,200
that they couldn’t stand a chance

9
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,030
against our mighty army and run away.

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,920
Whatever tricks he’s playing,

11
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,740
keep on their tail

12
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,350
and catch them by surprise!

13
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,650
-Yes!
-Go!

14
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,150
-General.
-General.

15
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,110
Isn’t this your deputy?

16
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,820
Many men in the garrison

17
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,220
have caught cold lately.

18
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,770
I might have been infected.

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,820
Yes.

20
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,830
He caught cold before.

21
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,039
I assigned him to Xijing to rest.

22
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,950
I never thought His Majesty

23
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:21,820
would lay his hands

24
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,030
on our own men.

25
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,570
Why is His Majesty

26
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,070
so cold-blooded on our soldiers?

27
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,229
Your Majesty, may I ask

28
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,360
where the fifty thousand men

29
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,320
from my troop who caught cold

30
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,490
are now?

31
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,780
General Mu,

32
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,240
what do you mean by this?

33
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,450
Have Your Majesty

34
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,700
made them Gu-infected men?

35
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,570
Yes.

36
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,740
Your Majesty, do you know?

37
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,240
These patriot men

38
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,360
abandoned their home and fought

39
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,900
all the way with me to Xijing.

40
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,780
Many left their families behind

41
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,190
so as to

42
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,360
to protect Your Majesty and your throne.

43
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,820
It’s a soldier’s mission.

44
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,110
My soldiers

45
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,030
should be loyal to me.

46
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,030
A hundred thousand soldiers in my troop

47
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,360
are willing to die for Your Majesty in the war.

48
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,780
Nothing can sway our determination.

49
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,860
But Your Majesty,

50
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,030
you made them

51
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,610
Gu-infected men like walking dead.

52
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,280
It gives me a chill.

53
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,490
General Mu,

54
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,820
are you challenging me?

55
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,740
I dare not.

56
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,990
Like my forefathers did,

57
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,730
I’d like to swear allegiance to Your Majesty.

58
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,780
But I cannot accept

59
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,700
what you did, Your Majesty.

60
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,030
I can’t give my loyalty to a tyrant

61
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,200
who has no respect

62
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,950
for his soldiers.

63
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,860
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

64
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,610
Qingwu, call the troop in!

65
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,860
-Li Quan!
-Yes!

66
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,610
General Mu,

67
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,370
if you go against me,

68
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,620
it’ll make you another traitor.

69
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,190
Do you think you can

70
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,200
walk out of here alive?

71
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,370
Then I

72
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,630
have to die to atone my crime

73
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,320
of disobeying my king.

74
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,150
Father!

75
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,740
You tyrant!

76
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,240
You cruel, innocent men killer!

77
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,400
Even if you win this war,

78
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,550
you’ll not win the throne

79
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:16,970
or the people’s support.

80
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,450
It’s predestined

81
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,529
that the throne isn’t yours to take!

82
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:21,399
Get him out!

83
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,760
You tyrant!

84
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,040
Father!

85
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,980
Protect His Majesty!

86
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,030
-Father!
-General!

87
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,760
-Come on!
-Father!

88
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,320
General!

89
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,280
Let’s go!

90
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,190
Come on!

91
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:02,750
Your Majesty.

92
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,950
Qishao hides far away

93
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,190
so that I can’t get the Noxious Herb.

94
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,990
But I’ll figure out a way

95
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:47,950
to get it.

96
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,820
When Gu comes back,

97
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,800
he’ll help me draw blood from my heart

98
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,330
and cure His Highness.

99
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,320
Cutie,

100
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,530
am I right?

101
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,700
It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter.

102
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,200
His Highness

103
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,410
is pushing his physical limits.

104
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,070
So I need your blood

105
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,360
to give His Highness more time.

106
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,030
I hope Gu

107
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,970
can come back as soon as possible.

108
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,320
Cutie,

109
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,780
I need a lot of your blood this time.

110
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:42,820
I’m sorry.

111
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:06,380
I didn’t know

112
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,780
the Gu-infected man has such great strength

113
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,510
that I couldn’t get rid of him even I’m exhausted.

114
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,280
We have to take the cities and towns first.

115
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,720
Your Highness,

116
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,190
news from the scouts.

117
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,240
Tianhui turned soldiers in Mu’s troop

118
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,500
into Gu-infected men.

119
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,780
The old General Mu was killed

120
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,640
when he was confronting Tianhui.

121
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,900
Mu Qingwu

122
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,700
has revolted against King Tianhui.

123
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,360
To avenge his father’s death,

124
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,450
he decides to lead tens of thousands of his men

125
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,110
to the last war with King Tianhui’s

126
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,110
Gu-infected men.

127
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,280
We have to find out

128
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,880
where King Tianhui is hiding

129
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,380
and save Mu Qingwu.

130
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:45,650
On one hand,

131
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,640
they add to our strength.

132
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
On the other hand,

133
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,150
we damage King Tianhui’s morale.

134
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:51,700
Yes.

135
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,920
Take the medicine.

136
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,650
The pulse is weak.

137
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,380
His Highness doesn’t have much time.

138
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,330
Where are you going?

139
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,850
I’m going to check around

140
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,520
and boost the morale.

141
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,640
One!

142
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,990
Two!

143
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,300
One!

144
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:48,810
Two!

145
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,060
Your Highness.

146
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,740
Why hasn’t His Highness come back

147
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,740
from his visit to the soldiers?

148
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,870
Sorry, I don’t know.

149
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,500
Two!

150
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,570
Has His Highness led the troops out?

151
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,370
I have no idea.

152
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,990
All right.

153
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:04,490
One!

154
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:06,880
Two!

155
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,270
One!

156
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:11,680
Two!

157
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:13,940
One!

158
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,480
Two!

159
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,480
I’m sorry it scared you.

160
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:26,860
Miss,

161
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,990
I’m Gu Beiyue, a royal physician.

162
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,150
I came to examine the bodies on the King’s order.

163
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,650
That was my pet.

164
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,400
She didn’t scare you, did she?

165
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,700
I remember you.

166
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,470
You’re Gu’s little bird.

167
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,180
You want me to follow you?

168
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,780
Gu!

169
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,110
Why are you here?

170
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,830
You’re wounded.

171
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:25,530
Yunxi,

172
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,820
King Tianhui ordered the Gu-infected men

173
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,350
to kill all villagers here.

174
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,110
I ran into it.

175
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,740
So I spent all my power and arrested him.

176
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,700
Let me check your wound.

177
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,360
No, thanks.

178
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,030
Don’t forget that I’m a physician, too.

179
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,450
I know clearly how I am now.

180
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,110
My major organs have ruptured

181
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,570
and exhausted.

182
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:46,820
I had no choice

183
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,680
but to ask my bird to lead you here.

184
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,710
Thank you for coming, Yunxi.

185
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,490
Gu, you can’t die.

186
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,700
That can wait.

187
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,150
I led you here

188
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,240
for an important thing

189
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,440
that you have to know.

190
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,700
Gu Qishao and I sneaked in Xijing before

191
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,110
and stole the potion and prescription

192
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,280
to make Gu-infected men.

193
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,200
We planned to make the cure.

194
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,530
It’s a pity that we failed.

195
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,320
But I think

196
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,030
poisons

197
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,530
transform these men.

198
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,950
Perhaps, we can find a cure

199
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,490
from the Gu-infected men.

200
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,530
This is his blood.

201
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,150
Give it a try.

202
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,030
It’s a new poison

203
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,450
fusing poisonous Gu

204
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,950
and poisonous plague.

205
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,760
Why is the poisonous Gu

206
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,500
so similar with a poison

207
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,700
in Gu Qishao’s body?

208
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,450
He said he ate

209
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,900
Traceless Herb before.

210
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,280
If that’s true,

211
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,400
the Traceless Herb

212
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,990
still functions in Gu Qishao’s blood.

213
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,250
But we don’t have Traceless Herb now.

214
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,490
Yunxi, look,

215
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,150
I asked Miss Yuze

216
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,990
for some.

217
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,530
Great.

218
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,950
Yunxi, what…

219
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,450
In fact,

220
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,570
before I was sure about

221
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,280
Traceless Herb’s inhibitory effect on the plague,

222
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,150
I reckoned

223
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,360
that Traceless Herb could possibly

224
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,620
contain poisonous Gu.

225
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,990
But due to the scarcity of the herb

226
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:19,950
and the difficulty to control the Gu-infected men,

227
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,480
I never did the experiment.

228
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,530
Later I found

229
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,450
a new substance is created

230
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,300
when Qishao’s blood is burned.

231
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,450
It looks like

232
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,390
Traceless Herb is the functioning factor.

233
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,030
A new poison is created

234
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,650
when the poison in these Gu-infected men

235
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,240
fuses with the poisonous plague.

236
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,200
And the product

237
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,190
of Traceless Herb

238
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,950
and poisonous plague

239
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,280
destroys the new poison

240
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,360
and leads to the Gu-infected men’s death.

241
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,950
King Tianhui planted

242
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,450
the poisonous plague

243
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,720
in search for stronger subjects.

244
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,540
All these Gu-infected men carry

245
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,180
the poison of the plague.

246
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,720
If that’s true,

247
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:00,610
we may have found a way

248
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,740
to defeat the army of Gu-infected men.

249
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,280
Finally…

250
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:07,780
Finally…

251
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,070
Gu!

252
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,150
Gu!

253
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:21,820
Gu!

254
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,610
Wake up!

255
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,740
Thank you, Your Highness!

256
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,220
Your Highness,

257
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,070
I’m so grateful to you for saving me again.

258
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,300
You’re welcome, General Mu.

259
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,040
What’s your plan

260
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,030
after this war?

261
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,950
King Tianhui is brutal and inhuman.

262
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,320
He killed my father

263
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,240
and poisoned my soldiers.

264
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,490
I swear on my life

265
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,660
I’ll bring justice to him.

266
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,990
King Tianhui’s army

267
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,170
outnumbers you by multiple times.

268
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,320
General Mu,

269
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,530
please don’t make irrational decision

270
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,490
and get the soldiers killed for nothing.

271
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,360
We need to see it from a bigger picture.

272
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,070
King Tianhui has been studying Gu-infected men.

273
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,110
But my father and I

274
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,130
didn’t stop him due to my family’s loyalty to him.

275
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,490
Now I saw it through.

276
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,950
I’ve made up my mind.

277
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,750
Whatever the price is,

278
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,330
I have to mend the mistakes I made

279
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,160
and do something for the people.

280
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,900
It’s a bless to the people

281
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,810
that you’re on our side now.

282
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:34,950
General,

283
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,570
your troop’s breakaway from King Tianhui

284
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,360
strikes

285
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,340
a heavy blow on King Tianhui.

286
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:42,860
What we need to do now

287
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,320
is to preserve our strength

288
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,320
and work out a plan

289
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,580
to bring a death toll

290
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,820
on King Tianhui.

291
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:49,990
Then,

292
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,400
my men and I

293
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,050
would like to listen to your command.

294
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,990
Gather the Mu’s troop.

295
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,190
Fall back immediately!

296
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,280
Yes, Your Highness!

297
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:13,910
Stop!

298
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,470
Your Highness!

299
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,370
Are you alright, Your Highness?

300
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,080
Listen up, fellows.

301
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,820
What’s your order, Your Highness?

302
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,860
Give out news

303
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,120
that Prince Qin is seriously ill

304
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,110
and dying.

305
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,240
No, Your Highness!

306
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,820
It’ll damage our morale!

307
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,240
King Tianhui’s

308
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:39,990
Gu-infected men army

309
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,740
kills every soul

310
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,740
in their way.

311
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,400
The only solution

312
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,240
is to draw them in the capital

313
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,750
and attack from all directions.

314
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:54,610
Now we need to feign our retreat.

315
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,480
We fight and we retreat.

316
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,280
Only the news of my death

317
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,780
can convince King Tianhui

318
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,070
that we’re losing badly

319
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,190
because you lose your leader.

320
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,390
I see, Your Highness!

321
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,589
Ya!

322
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,390
Your Highness!

323
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,050
Your Highness!

324
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,720
Your Highness,

325
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,950
Physician Gu passed away.

326
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,490
Are you saying

327
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,330
that the smoke of burning Traceless Herb

328
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,610
can kill the Gu-infected men?

329
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:48,740
Gu and I

330
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,420
have tested it on one of them.

331
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,490
What great news!

332
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,030
But all Traceless Herb

333
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,430
is in Yuze’s possession.

334
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,390
But I will figure out something to get them.

335
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,360
You must be tired.

336
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,360
Let me get you in bed.

337
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,860
Give me your hand.

338
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,780
♫ If this world fades ♫

339
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,650
♫ I’ll stay with you ♫

340
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,840
♫ Being in silence to firmly ♫

341
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,450
♫ Withstand the innumerable words ♫

342
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:31,860
Qishao.

343
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,950
Qishao, I have completed

344
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,080
the task you gave me.

345
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,490
These are the rest Traceless Herbs.

346
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,570
Yuze,

347
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,240
I sincerely thank you

348
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,170
for everything you’ve done for me.

349
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,360
A war is around the corner.

350
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,030
I don’t want you

351
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,430
to get involved or killed

352
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,820
in the chaos.

353
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,570
You can leave.

354
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,070
Go pursue

355
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,190
your happiness.

356
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:58,700
Go ahead.

357
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:03,990
Qishao,

358
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,810
please don’t drive me away.

359
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,690
I just want to stay by your side

360
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,770
and keep you company.

361
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,200
That’s the life I want.

362
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,240
Don’t be so stubborn.

363
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,360
You’re free to choose your life.

364
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,560
So am I to choose mine.

365
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,740
I’ll settle down in the capital

366
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,270
and listen to your command.

367
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,450
I have been stubborn

368
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,520
since I met you, Qishao.

369
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,450
But I don’t regret it.

370
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,320
Thank you.

371
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,450
One!

372
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:58,650
Two!

373
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,170
One!

374
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,570
Two!

375
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,680
One!

376
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,590
Two!

377
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,150
His Highness can’t hold on for any longer.

378
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,880
He needs treatment in Plum Sea.

379
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:12,650
But,

380
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,290
what about the troops?

381
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,280
His Highness has given his order

382
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,320
to spread out the news about his illness.

383
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,950
King Tianhui is a suspicious man.

384
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:20,860
If we hide the truth

385
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,190
and feed him wrong information,

386
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,360
he will believe it.

387
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:24,780
However,

388
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,180
we have to keep it from the troops.

389
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,400
Otherwise, it’ll damage our morale.

390
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,000
All right.

391
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,490
I’ll see to it.

392
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:32,860
Xifeng,

393
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,530
you must find Gu Qishao.

394
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,730
Gu Qishao’s whereabouts is uncertain.

395
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,400
I haven’t heard anything from him

396
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,320
for a long time.

397
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,040
You can just tell Zhuyu

398
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:42,950
that if he doesn’t come

399
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,190
to see me in Plum Sea tomorrow,

400
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,530
he’ll never see me again.

401
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,330
He’ll show up.

402
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,360
Yes.

403
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,280
I’m sorry.

404
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,990
Qishao.

405
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:12,810
What is it you want me?

406
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,490
Qishao,

407
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,390
I beg you.

408
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,700
Give the Noxious Herb to me.

409
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,650
When it loses its function in a few days,

410
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,360
we will be unable to save His Highness.

411
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,560
I won’t give it to you.

412
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:20,650
Besides,

413
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,160
I promised Long Feiye.

414
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,450
No.

415
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,700
I can’t use my inner power.

416
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,970
If I lose control to poisonous Gu,

417
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,040
no one will protect poison girl.

418
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,700
Qishao,

419
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,820
please give the Noxious Herb to me.

420
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,750
Forget about it.

421
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,240
Chu Xifeng.

422
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,150
Do you know what you’re doing?

423
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,940
You’re killing Princess Qin.

424
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,490
She’s about to draw blood from her heart

425
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:01,550
to save Long Feiye.

426
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,320
Is it only Long Feiye’s life

427
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,320
that you care?

428
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,240
-Your Highness?
-Xifeng.

429
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,990
Don’t listen to his nonsense.

430
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,390
If you release Gu Qishao,

431
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,070
His Highness will not make it.

432
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,360
And I’ll kill myself.

433
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:24,990
Don’t do this.

434
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,930
Why is it only him in your heart?

435
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,990
Him alone!

436
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:31,650
I’m sorry.

437
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,650
I hurt your heart.

438
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,740
Xifeng,

439
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,490
if you want His Highness to survive,

440
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,950
keep a close eye on Gu Qishao.

441
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:40,570
But…

442
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,530
Take him away.

443
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:43,200
Wait.

444
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,250
You can’t do that to me.

445
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,250
You can’t do that to me!

446
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:56,930
Your Highness,

447
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,060
is what Gu Qishao said true?

448
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,650
You have to give up your life

449
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:01,980
to save His Highness’s?

450
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,240
Xifeng,

451
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,860
as you can see,

452
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,970
the Gu-infected men are winning.

453
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:08,820
If King Tianhui

454
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,990
takes the throne,

455
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,140
the world

456
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,660
will become a mortal hell.

457
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,810
His Highness is the only hope.

458
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,300
I save His Highness

459
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:19,080
for the sake of all people in the world.

460
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,390
You have love for all,

461
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,740
Your Highness.

462
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,200
I admire you.

463
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:28,400
But if you die for His Highness,

464
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:32,120
what should I say to him when he’s fine?

465
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:32,860
I can’t

466
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:33,990
let you sacrifice yourself.

467
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:34,650
Xifeng,

468
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:36,490
you should know

469
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,450
who is more important.

470
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,070
Tell your men

471
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:42,090
to keep it from His Highness.

472
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,150
Poison Beast,

473
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,280
I’m useless.

474
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,600
After a half day of study,

475
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,360
I still can’t use Traceless Herb to cure

476
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,320
His Highness.

477
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,530
Gu has passed away.

478
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,150
I don’t know if Qishao

479
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:16,950
would do me the favor.

480
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:48,070
His Highness can’t wait any longer.

481
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,780
So either he likes it or not,

482
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,360
he will help me in the end.

483
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:05,490
No!

484
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,200
There has to be another way

485
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,490
except drawing blood from your heart.

486
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,570
You can’t die.

487
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,320
No wonder my brother kept saying

488
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,200
that the poisonous Gu in his body is incurable.

489
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,110
Han Yunxi,

490
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,450
you cannot do that.

491
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,190
We can’t trade a life

492
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,820
for another.

493
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,700
Actually, Her Highness

494
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,530
has a point.

495
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,320
If it’s feasible,

496
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,890
I’d rather give up my life

497
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,500
for the life of His Highness.

498
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,030
His Highness’s life

499
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,160
is important to countless more lives.

500
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,610
If he dies now,

501
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:32,860
the course of the war

502
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,190
could be turned around.

503
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,850
Once the Gu-infected men breach the capital,

504
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,400
hundreds of thousands of innocent people

505
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,660
will lose their lives!

506
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,820
But if Han Yunxi dies,

507
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,750
what am I going to say to my brother?

508
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,070
For the people

509
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,780
and His Highness,

510
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,860
I’m willing to give up my life.

511
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,110
No!

512
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,640
Absolutely no!

513
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,150
Han Yunxi,

514
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,230
there has to be another way.

515
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,840
I’ve tried every possible way.

516
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,590
We’re in a critical situation.

517
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,280
There’s no other way.

518
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:06,490
Yunxi.

519
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:08,450
Yunxi.

520
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,930
Aren’t you always smart and wise?

521
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,110
You said we always find a way.

522
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,150
I don’t want you to die.

523
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:22,320
Yunxi,

524
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,070
let’s talk about it later.

525
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,670
It’s pointless.

526
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:30,360
You have to

527
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,070
keep it a secret.

528
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,530
Your Majesty.

529
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:42,780
Rise.

530
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,490
How is the situation?

531
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,510
Your Majesty, you’re blessed.

532
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:49,820
Thanks to your blessing,

533
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,320
we won another victory.

534
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,610
And according to the scouts,

535
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,650
Long Feiye suffers a sudden strike of poisonous Gu

536
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,110
and has been sent to Plum Sea.

537
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,240
I guess he won’t be long before he dies.

538
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,490
He’s severely ill.

539
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,240
Without its leader,

540
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,050
his army is in low morale.

541
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,110
That’s why they’re retreating.

542
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,110
How long will it take to reach the capital?

543
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,150
Your Majesty,

544
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:15,990
when we breach two more small cities

545
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,250
guarding the capital,

546
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,110
we can lead our army in.

547
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,280
Good.

548
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,110
Give my order to the troops.

549
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:25,030
Keep the momentum until the capital is breached

550
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,200
and capture Long Feiye alive!

551
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,950
Yes, Your Majesty.

552
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,450
I wish so much that time could go slowly.

553
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,900
I wish time could pause for a while.

554
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,070
Your Highness,

555
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,900
there are so many things

556
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,100
that we haven’t done.

557
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,070
Why are you crying?

558
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:06,350
Are you afraid that no one would love you

559
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,070
when I’m gone?

560
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,070
Nonsense.

561
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,950
I got smoke in my eyes

562
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:17,100
when I cooked the medicine.

563
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:19,700
Right.

564
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,570
I made a new medicine.

565
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:25,990
You’ll be cured soon.

566
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,070
Don’t lie to me.

567
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,050
Your Highness,

568
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:39,010
is there anything that concerns you?

569
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:44,650
My only concern now

570
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:50,280
is a woman called Han Yunxi.

571
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,650
Since the day we met,

572
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,700
I have never

573
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,030
made her happy.

574
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,610
Now I’m dying,

575
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,030
which makes her

576
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,360
weeping.

577
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,610
I’m thinking

578
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:26,900
it would be good

579
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,320
if we never met

580
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,360
back then.

581
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:38,780
If so,

582
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,780
I would die

583
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,780
without concern

584
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,280
and she would lead

585
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,070
a happy and peaceful life.

586
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,320
It’s the happiest thing

587
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,150
for Han Yunxi

588
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,990
to have met you and loved you.

589
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,760
No matter what we’ve been through

590
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,570
is bitter or happy,

591
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,320
she enjoys it

592
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,150
and will never forget.

593
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:39,410
Father,

594
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,950
a letter to you.

595
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,950
A letter from Yunxi.

596
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:46,820
Really?

597
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:47,990
Open it.

598
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,400
Here. Take it for your father.

599
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:53,030
Father,

600
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,110
I wonder

601
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,320
how your life is.

602
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:58,790
I had a dream last night

603
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:01,020
where our family was united

604
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,610
and everyone was happy.

605
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,320
I’m so delighted.

606
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,070
But father, you seemed

607
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,330
to have more gray hair.

608
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,180
Take care of your health.

609
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,450
It’s been a long time.

610
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,780
Has Ruoxue been married?

611
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:15,990
Whoever she’s married to,

612
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,960
remember to come home frequently.

613
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,700
Yunyi, you should work hard on your study

614
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,490
and learn medicine from father.

615
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,780
When you’re at leisure,

616
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,240
help father with his work.

617
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:26,530
Lady Xu,

618
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:28,110
you’re good at running the family.

619
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,640
I appreciate your efforts.

620
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,860
Aunt, when you’re looking after the others,

621
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,490
look after yourself, too.

622
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,140
Don’t wear yourself out.

623
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,360
At last,

624
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,680
I have good news to share with you.

625
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:40,730
I’m getting married.

626
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,450
His Highness and I are going to organize

627
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:43,450
another wedding.

628
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,280
It’s urgent.

629
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:46,830
So I didn’t invite you.

630
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,210
But I ask my beloved families

631
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,160
to give us your blessings.

632
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,610
The groom may kick the sedan now.

633
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:31,820
Han Yunxi,

634
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,150
from now on,

635
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,030
you’re officially

636
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,150
my wife.

637
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:38,950
You’re now

638
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,530
and always my woman.

639
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,190
I’m happy.

640
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:46,630
After the wedding,

641
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,280
His Highness will take me

642
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,570
to a remote place.

643
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:51,900
So,

644
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,020
I may not be able to see you in short time.

645
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,180
Take care of yourselves.

646
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,820
Your daughter, Yunxi.

647
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:03,190
Good.

648
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:05,700
Yunxi is married.

649
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,570
It’s been long since the last time I saw her.

650
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,610
I miss her.

651
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,650
I miss my sister, too.

652
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:13,780
Although

653
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,280
we’re not by her side,

654
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,780
tonight,

655
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,360
we’ll have a feast.

656
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,740
Let’s

657
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,110
celebrate for her,

658
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,860
-all right?
-Yes! Great!

659
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,530
♫ The ingredient added is kadam ♫

660
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:32,360
♫ At a moon night in the middle summer ♫

661
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,570
♫ Two people separate ♫

662
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,190
♫ The knights will leave without returning ♫

663
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,120
♫ The love will continue next life ♫

664
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:43,280
It’s His Highness

665
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,210
and his princess’s wedding today.

666
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,330
I prepared something for you, too.

667
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:51,490
I warn you.

668
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,760
If you don’t want to let her die,

669
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,200
release me.

670
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:02,950
♫ Play the song for you again ♫

671
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,110
Let me out!

672
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:04,950
Let me out!

673
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,400
Let me out!

674
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,070
♫ It keeps raining and wetting the memory ♫

675
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:10,930
Poison girl!

676
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:14,820
Poison girl!

677
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,470
Long Feiye held a grand wedding in Plum Sea?

678
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,120
Your Majesty,

679
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,820
the troops guarding the capital

680
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,280
are clearly retreating.

681
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,280
Is Long Feiye luring us

682
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,490
in an empty city?

683
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,360
Maybe he’s about to die,

684
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,070
so he wants

685
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,740
to hold a real wedding for Han Yunxi.

686
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,500
Your Majesty,

687
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,240
if it’s true,

688
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,990
why don’t we hold

689
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:42,900
the attack

690
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,470
until Long Feiye is dead?

691
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:46,400
Isn’t that more favorable to us?

692
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:47,530
No.

693
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:49,950
I’m worried

694
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,860
that Han Yunxi will draw blood from her heart

695
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:52,920
to save Long Feiye.

696
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,490
To avoid future troubles,

697
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:59,030
order the army to take the capital down fast.

698
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,820
Yes, Your Majesty.

699
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:02,650
Long Feiye,

700
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,400
however capable you are,

701
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,740
this time

702
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,070
you will die.

703
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,740
You lifted the veil again.

704
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:30,860
Do you want this wedding

705
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,500
to be an official wedding or not?

706
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,610
Then why didn’t you lift my veil?

707
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:39,190
Did you intentionally not to?

708
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,000
I remember

709
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:09,600
you told me once

710
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:12,530
that you wanted me

711
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:14,490
to make you

712
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:16,370
the happiest woman in the world.

713
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,200
But now I realize

714
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,640
that I’m the happiest man

715
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,570
in the world.

716
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:39,320
In fact, I think happiness

717
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,570
is for a couple to be together

718
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,400
forever.

719
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,030
But one of the couple

720
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,110
will die earlier than another.

721
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:53,280
Silly,

722
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,190
don’t talk jinxes

723
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:59,190
on this jubilant day.

724
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,950
Promise me

725
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,450
you’ll not die before I do.

726
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,610
Han Yunxi,

727
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,990
I’m your husband,

728
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,240
the light of your life.

729
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,100
I’ll stay by your side

730
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,570
for the rest of your life.

731
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:10,650
Yunxi,

732
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,190
wait here for me to come back with victory.

733
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,840
I’ll spend the rest

734
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,400
of my life here with you.

735
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,280
Why don’t you eat?

736
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,400
Yunxi.
