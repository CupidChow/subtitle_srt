00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,020
Episode 34

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,720
Love and hate are two different things.

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,120
Can you forget my mother?

5
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,390
Xiqiu and Beili have become allies.

6
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,180
The reason why Chu Qingge entered the palace

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,600
is to kill Prince Qin,

8
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,730
put Tianning in chaos,

9
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,640
so as to avenge her family and her country.

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,800
It’s not confirmed.

11
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,800
Shall we let Yunxi know this?”

12
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:26,980
His Highness!

13
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,400
Miss Mingxiang.

14
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,260
It’s all here?

15
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,590
There are only a few books about poison.

16
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,260
The medicine and poison books

17
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,050
we can find in the capital are all in here.

18
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,180
These medicine and poison scriptures

19
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,400
only recorded

20
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,720
common herbs.

21
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,720
It’s less than half of what

22
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,780
Prince Qin’s Mansion has collected.

23
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,260
Is there any news

24
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,430
from Prince Qin’s Mansion?

25
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,030
Prince Qin

26
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,020
goes out early and comes back late.

27
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:09,640
It’s said

28
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,090
he got poisoned in Heaven Pit.

29
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,550
He’s still not recovered.

30
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,070
Feels like he’s not in his mansion.

31
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:18,720
Get ready,

32
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,890
I’ll go back to Prince Qin’s Mansion.

33
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:21,600
Yes.

34
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,460
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

35
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:36,259
Senior!

36
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,009
Senior!

37
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,350
My brother isn’t here.

38
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,720
Why are you looking for him?

39
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,390
Well…

40
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,220
I came to persuade him.

41
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,140
But I think

42
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,100
I can’t do it on my own.

43
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,890
Persuade him to do what?

44
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,550
To take Yunxi back.

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,300
It isn’t Yunxi’s fault.

46
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,300
I think you should give him some time.

47
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,960
And you’d better say nothing.

48
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,430
Though he looks calm,

49
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,920
he’s actually quite disturbed inside.

50
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,140
Besides, he’s under so much pressure.

51
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,090
Any other person

52
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,120
would’ve already gone insane.

53
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,100
You should be more considerate

54
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,230
and leave him alone.

55
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,010
But

56
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,930
it’s not Yunxi’s fault

57
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,430
that she’s Poison Master’s daughter.

58
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,180
How could he

59
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,680
blame Yunxi for it?

60
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,220
Then you can talk to him

61
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,100
when he comes back.

62
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:21,760
I don’t want to be

63
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,720
a part of it.

64
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:23,760
Besides,

65
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,260
my brother has been very short-tempered.

66
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,640
Whenever I made a small mistake,

67
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,640
he would punish me

68
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,810
by letting me write.

69
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
You go talk to him.

70
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,260
I can’t believe you anymore!

71
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,790
You are not my friend at all!

72
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,910
Hey, why did you say that?

73
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:40,890
Wait!

74
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,680
Don’t go!

75
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,420
Who were you talking about?

76
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:23,780
Long time no see.

77
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,550
You are here to give me this message?

78
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,210
Your Highness.

79
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,100
I know what Poison Master

80
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:49,970
did to you

81
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,220
is unforgivable.

82
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:53,970
But my mother died

83
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,300
because of it.

84
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,090
I shouldn’t come

85
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,240
to beg you for this.

86
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,050
I just hope

87
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,500
you can spare his life

88
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,840
on account of my mother.

89
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:05,970
Okay?

90
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,640
Han Yunxi.

91
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,100
He’s your father.

92
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,100
I won’t kill him.

93
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,340
But neither can I forgive him.

94
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,390
Thank you.

Long Feiye and Han Yunxi

128
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:27,680
just separated.

129
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,180
Why didn’t you let me attack them?

130
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,970
They have many guards protecting them in the dark.

131
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,170
You wouldn’t make it.

132
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
I think you are just afraid of death!

133
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,200
We practice Kung Fu since young

134
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,680
to serve our country

135
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,640
one day.

136
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,900
Do you think a death like that

137
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,260
is worth it?

138
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,220
If we don’t do anything,

139
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,260
His Majesty

140
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,990
will lose his patience with us.

141
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,780
Let’s wait for a better timing.

142
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,650
Have a good rest.

143
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,660
Brother Feiye,

144
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,220
are you sure you’ll let Han Yunxi stay?

145
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:11,600
She is not

146
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,970
on our side.

147
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,470
Do you know

148
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,290
whom she has contact with

149
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,010
and what she’s been doing?

150
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,810
It’s between me and Yunxi.

151
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,650
You don’t need to worry about that.

152
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,880
What matters the most

153
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,680
is your health.

154
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,760
Don’t cultivate beauty blood anymore.

155
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,010
But to me,

156
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:34,640
you are always

157
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,100
my priority.

158
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:38,390
I will keep cultivating

159
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,600
beauty blood for you.

160
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,340
Mingxiang,

161
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,900
I’ll find someone else

162
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,909
to confect a cure for you.

163
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,100
Zhuyu.

164
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,360
You are looking for me?

165
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,260
My Lord,

166
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,100
poison Master has been in our valley for days.

167
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,470
Yet Beili still knows nothing about it.

168
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,200
Why don’t you

169
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,180
inform Crown Prince

170
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,470
to end this?

171
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,220
He’s still useful to us.

172
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,140
How so?

173
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,350
I think you just don’t want

174
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,790
to upset the one you love!

175
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,920
What are you talking about?

176
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,300
Can you use your head

177
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,680
before talking?

178
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,140
If I can gain

179
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,550
Poison Master’s trust

180
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,220
and cultivate

181
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,560
poisonous Gu with him,

182
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,470
then we’ll have

183
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,429
bigger chance to win

184
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,049
while negotiating with Beili.

185
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:35,760
Fine.

186
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:37,590
But we can’t delay it anymore.

187
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,440
You were up all night, weren’t you?

188
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,220
Have some breakfast

189
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,750
then get back to work, okay?

190
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,600
Poison girl, come on.

191
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,650
These things won’t run away.

192
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,090
That’s right. Yunxi,

193
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,600
you need to take care of yourself.

194
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,680
I don’t have time.

195
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:12,930
I need to save His Highness.

196
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:13,930
You guys go ahead.

197
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,640
In this case,

198
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,510
I’ll have to use my authority.

199
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,220
Qishao,

200
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,010
you are wasting my time!

201
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,180
Don’t forget

202
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,760
you owe me many conditions.

203
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,560
You haven’t fulfilled even one.

204
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,050
So I’ll use one more.

205
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,720
Stop what you are doing

206
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,180
and go eat.

207
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:31,760
Qishao,

208
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,720
are you gonna waste your conditions like that?

209
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,180
How is that a waste?

210
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,850
If that’s how you see it,

211
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,300
I’ll waste another one.

212
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,760
Put down the stuff

213
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,130
and go get some sleep!

214
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,720
After you slept and ate,

215
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,010
maybe your research

216
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,180
can go faster.

217
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,300
Yunxi,

218
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,640
I’m here.

219
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:49,970
Go eat something

220
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,140
and take a rest.

221
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,150
That’s right. Be good!

222
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,510
A deal is a deal, okay?

223
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,100
Come on.

224
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,850
I’ll finish the rest

225
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,390
of the experiments for you.

226
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,100
Hear that?

227
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,140
Come on.

228
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,090
Let’s eat first.

229
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:04,760
Okay.

230
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,820
[Xiqiu and Beili have become allies. The reason
why Chu Qingge entered the palace is to kill Prince Qin.]

231
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,010
If this message is real,

232
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,430
then our plan

233
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:19,970
will be at risk.

234
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,300
I think this message

235
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,720
is most likely real.

236
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,600
In the battle against Xiqiu,

237
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,220
we killed

238
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,300
their Emperor.

239
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,010
Xiqiu was defeated.

240
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,220
Because of that,

241
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,260
Xiqiu lost the strength to fight against us.

242
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,890
I’ve guessed the reason

243
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,870
why Chu Qingge came here.

244
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,370
I think Yunxi

245
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,990
must have got this news first

246
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,620
before she came to see me.

247
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:49,680
I don’t want her

248
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,610
to get involved.

249
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:51,580
Brother,

250
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:52,680
someone sent

251
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,960
a secret letter here.

252
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,660
[Your Highness, I have news concerning your life.
I’ll wait for you in the restaurant. ]

253
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,350
You are…

254
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,890
I’m Vice General Chu Xifeng.

255
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,300
Why did you ask His Highness

256
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,300
to meet you today?

257
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:28,640
My Lord,

258
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,600
this is the letter between

259
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,220
Chu Qingge and Crown Prince of Beili,

260
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,140
Jun Yizheng.

261
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,700
Please take a look.

262
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,620
[Beili and Xiqiu are allies already. As long as Prince Qin is dead,
Tianning won’t be a threat to us anymore.]

263
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,220
Why do you

264
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,300
want to tell Prince Qin

265
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,700
such confidential news?

266
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,720
The second Prince was killed by Crown Prince.

267
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,720
Chu Qingge is the one behind it.

268
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,550
Noble Consort Xiao wants

269
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,640
to join hands with Prince Qin

270
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,470
against our shared enemy.

271
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,110
But as far as I know,

272
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,430
Noble Consort Xiao and Prince Qin

273
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,760
aren’t familiar with each other.

274
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,550
Besides,

275
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,840
it’s about the harem.

276
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,390
In theory,

277
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:18,600
Prince Qin

278
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,080
should not get involved.

279
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,490
But it’s an important message.

280
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,220
I will report it

281
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,260
to Prince Qin.

282
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,080
I’ll get back to you soon.

283
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,180
In that case,

284
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,850
I’ll thank you in advance!

285
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,530
You are welcome.

286
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,220
-Okay!
-Alright!

287
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,180
See you.

288
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,900
[Yaohua Palace]

289
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,250
Your Highness!

290
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,250
Your Highness!

291
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,510
“Prince Qin is very cautious.

292
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,010
He doesn’t want to work with us.

293
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,090
Please seek another way out.”

294
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,340
He wouldn’t believe it?

295
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,430
You are cured!

296
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,050
Really?

297
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,550
Rhizoma Smilacis glabrae,

298
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,550
Radix angelicae,

299
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,600
Semen cassiae,

300
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,540
and fritillaria cirrhosa!

301
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,350
That’s it!

302
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,350
Qishao!

303
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,350
I dreamt

304
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,260
of the cure!

305
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,200
I’m serious!

306
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,910
You are too obsessed now!

307
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,300
You promised me,

308
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,550
so you must fulfill it.

309
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,300
Come with me.

310
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,260
Not right.

311
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:35,180
Something is missing.

312
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,140
Hey, don’t run!

313
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,890
Stop, little guy!

314
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,470
With such a severe injury,

315
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:05,430
she is still alive?!

316
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,000
Would you like to try?

317
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:05,890
See?

318
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,920
You should smile like that!

319
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,260
Your father will be relieved

320
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,790
knowing that you are happy.

321
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:13,990
He’s not my father.

322
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,260
His blood is running in your veins.

323
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,849
No matter what he did,

324
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,140
he’s always your father.

325
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,510
I can see

326
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,220
that he cares about you.

327
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,510
Don’t you feel

328
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,290
his care for you these days?

329
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,010
Qishao, let’s drop this.

330
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:32,910
Poison girl,

331
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,640
don’t run from it.

332
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,970
Your father wants you to be happy.

333
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,430
He wants you to accept him.

334
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,240
I can see

335
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,530
his eyes are filled with love.

336
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,450
There’s no hatred or disdain.

337
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,400
Maybe I said too much.

338
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,320
No matter what,

339
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:55,530
I envy you a lot.

340
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,280
You have a father

341
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,250
who cares about you a great deal.

342
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,430
Poison girl,

343
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,030
listen to me.

344
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,030
You’ve got to cherish what you have.

345
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,190
Otherwise,

346
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,190
you’ll regret about it

347
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,390
if you lose it one day.

348
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,800
Thank you for your words.

349
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,900
I understand it all.

350
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:27,950
But my heart still aches

351
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,080
when thinking about

352
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,030
the people he has hurt.

353
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,530
But, thank you for letting him stay.

354
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,320
We are good friends.

355
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:38,610
Don’t mention it.

356
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,860
Han Yunxi,

357
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,950
if you know I’m going

358
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,840
to hand your father to Beili,

359
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,530
will you still see me

360
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,360
as your friend?

361
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,670
Don’t wait for me. Go ahead and eat.

362
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,050
Let’s eat.

363
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:34,950
It’s so tasty!

364
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,200
It is!

365
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,740
Your mother also liked fish.

366
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,430
I can’t cook anything else,

367
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,610
but with fish, I can cook

368
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,950
dozens of dishes.

369
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,780
Yunxi, if you like it,

370
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:55,610
I’ll cook you

371
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,950
different one each day.

372
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,630
There’s still fish soup in the pot.

373
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,740
I’ll go get you some.

374
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,490
Your handwriting

375
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,430
is more and more like my senior’s.

376
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,630
I heard Han Yunxi got poisoned.

377
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,030
Yunxi went out to deal with something.

378
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,700
My senior came up with

379
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,420
this excuse to cover for her.

380
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,740
She went out?

381
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,400
Poison Master,

382
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,410
Han Yunxi’s birth father,

383
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:09,050
used Qinxi royals to make Gu-infected men,

384
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:11,360
putting brother Feiye’s family in jeopardy,

385
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,190
as well as making him

386
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,850
suffer from unbearable pain.

387
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,400
How could Han Yunxi come back

388
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,300
to Prince Qin’s Mansion again?

389
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:18,820
How…

390
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,150
How did you know that?

391
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:22,700
I heard the conversation

392
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,030
between you and Tang Li.

393
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,450
Yes.

394
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:27,900
Yunxi has no right

395
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,630
to ask senior to forgive her.

396
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,650
But she also wants to cure senior

397
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,310
as soon as possible like we do.

398
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,030
Look,

399
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:35,990
she is working very hard

400
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,110
in the valley to make the cure.

401
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:38,900
I believe,

402
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:39,860
she will make it

403
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,990
if she has more time.

404
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:41,820
How much more?

405
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:43,490
One year?

406
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,150
Five years?

407
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,740
Or ten years?

408
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,900
What if brother Feiye

409
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,500
couldn’t wait for that long?

410
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,700
Besides, no one can guarantee

411
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,700
she will succeed.

412
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,030
If she fails,

413
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,600
what’s her next plan?

414
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,490
Right now, only my beauty blood

415
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,220
can save brother Feiye’s life.

416
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
For these years,

417
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,730
I took all kinds of poisons,

418
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:05,860
suffered the pain

419
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,660
that no regular people can bear.

420
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,820
I thought my true love

421
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,750
could make brother Feiye touched.

422
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,650
But I was wrong!

423
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,440
He treats me kindly and takes care of me,

424
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:20,120
just because he feels guilty about me.

425
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,750
That’s not true.

426
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,190
My senior truly cares about you.

427
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,010
But he only believes Han Yunxi.

428
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,060
When did he ever believe in me?

429
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,740
I put my life into risk,

430
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:33,320
hoping to get his love

431
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,570
in return.

432
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,190
What has Han Yunxi done?

433
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,150
How could she replace me

434
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,610
In brother Feiye’s heart?

435
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,070
Mingxiang,

436
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,760
you can’t see it that way.

437
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,590
Senior Feiye isn’t some object

438
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:47,900
for you two to fight over.

439
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,780
Besides,

440
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,550
love is not something you can use for exchange.

441
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,950
And Yunxi never wanted

442
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:54,950
to replace you.

443
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:55,900
Didn’t she?

444
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,320
Since she showed up,

445
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:00,990
I’ve lost.

446
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:02,990
I’ve lost completely.

447
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,530
I hate them.

448
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:07,850
I hate Poison Master.

449
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,400
Why did he

450
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,060
make brother Feiye suffer?

451
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,990
And I hate Han Yunxi even more.

452
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,190
She didn’t do anything,

453
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:18,320
but she won

454
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,190
Feiye’s heart easily.

455
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,650
As for me,

456
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,490
I became their nightmare,

457
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,170
a burden they can’t wait to get rid of!

458
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,780
How could I accept that?

459
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,330
With Han Yunxi showing up again,

460
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,200
Brother Feiye will only

461
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,260
get more depressed

462
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,030
and feel guiltier

463
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:40,890
about the death

464
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,190
of his family!

465
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,030
Ningjing.

466
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,860
For the sake of brother Feiye,

467
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,190
please go ask Han Yunxi

468
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,700
not to meet brother Feiye again,

469
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,400
okay?

470
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,070
Don’t worry.

471
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,920
Yunxi doesn’t even plan to come back.

472
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,570
When’s the last time

473
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,860
you saw a beautiful moon

474
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,740
like this?

475
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,360
I don’t remember.

476
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,550
Maybe it has something to do with our feelings.

477
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,700
Ever since my mother passed away,

478
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,610
I’ve never seen

479
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,960
such a beautiful moon.

480
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:49,240
You know?

481
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,160
The full moon only appears

482
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,610
when people reunite.

483
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,110
Maybe,

484
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,570
it’s a full moon tonight

485
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,100
because you reunited with your father.

486
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,570
Qishao,

487
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:01,700
I’ve never heard you

488
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,160
talked about your family.

489
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:07,240
My family?

490
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,280
When I was little,

491
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,450
I lived in

492
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:13,700
a big mansion.

493
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:18,150
But my mother lived in

494
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,200
the farthest and shabbiest house.

495
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,320
My son,

496
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,990
are these irises pretty?

497
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,440
I’ll give them to you.

498
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,190
So pretty!

499
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,990
Mom!

500
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,610
Mom!

501
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,030
Are you okay?

502
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,150
Mom!

503
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,070
Mom!

504
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,070
You are seriously ill.

505
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,820
I’ll go get you an imperial doctor.

506
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,360
Son,

507
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:05,900
don’t.

508
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,030
I’m fine.

509
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,530
Son,

510
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,070
just leave here.

511
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,280
My low status will only make you suffer.

512
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,360
No, mom! Wait for me!

513
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,200
I’ll go get you a doctor.

514
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,140
[Prunella vulgaris]

515
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,060
[Calcined alum]

516
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,200
Come here! Come on!

517
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,530
How dare you give him medicine?

518
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,190
You don’t wanna live anymore?

519
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,400
He’s such a poor kid.

520
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,530
Poor kid?

521
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,700
You should stay away
from the royal family’s matters.

522
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,610
If you get involved,

523
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,280
you’ll become the poor one!

524
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,620
[Calcined alum]

525
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,450
But his mother is after all

526
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,990
His Majesty’s consort.

527
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,780
What consort?

528
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,780
She’s just a lowlife maid.

529
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,110
The Empress

530
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,950
wants her to die this time.

531
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,780
Mom,

532
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,110
I made you some medicine.

533
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,400
Take it now.

534
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:36,820
My son,

535
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,150
look at your sweaty face.

536
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,570
You are like a dirty cat.

537
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,110
I don’t need the medicine.

538
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:44,860
Mom,

539
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:48,280
you’ll recover after taking it.

540
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,320
Good son.

541
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,570
But it’s already too late.

542
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,780
My son.

543
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:56,860
If I’m gone,

544
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,030
you need to leave here

545
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,740
and go to somewhere far away.

546
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,140
Don’t come back anymore.

547
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,570
This place doesn’t belong to you.

548
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,200
It’s my fault, mom.

549
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,150
I can’t do anything for you.

550
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:08,700
My son,

551
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:11,780
you are God’s

552
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,070
best gift for me.

553
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:16,070
You will grow into a successful man.

554
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,200
No matter what happens in the future,

555
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,460
you’ve got to be strong

556
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:20,460
and optimistic.

557
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,240
Tears are only for the weak.

558
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,780
No matter what happens,

559
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,740
don’t cry.

560
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,280
I’ll remember it, mom!

561
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,530
Don’t know how the irises

562
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,530
look like outside.

563
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:43,070
I planted them

564
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,650
when your royal father came.

565
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:46,110
Irises?

566
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,030
I’ll go get some for you, mom!

567
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,450
Mom!

568
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:44,530
Mom! Don’t leave me!

569
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:45,610
Mom!

570
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,110
Mom!

571
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,360
Don’t leave me!

572
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:52,740
Mom!

573
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:55,610
Mom!

574
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,700
Mom!

575
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,250
Your Majesty.

576
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:16,900
Who allowed this bastard

577
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,990
to wander here?

578
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,520
Why do you want to see me?

579
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:21,610
Father.

580
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:22,950
The irises in my mom’s garden

581
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,530
are blooming.

582
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,950
She wanted you to go take a look

583
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,530
before she passed away.

584
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,190
Nonsenses!

585
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:39,110
A maid’s kid is always a lowlife.

586
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:43,150
Guards.

587
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,760
Send him to Remorse Palace to ponder upon his fault.

588
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,070
Don’t let him out

589
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,730
without my permission.

590
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,110
Your Majesty, let’s go.

591
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:03,820
Father!

592
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,700
Father!

593
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,450
Father!

594
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,610
Father!

595
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,380
Because my mother was a maid,

596
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,810
so there wasn’t even a place

597
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,570
for her to be buried.

598
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,110
I’ve always wanted

599
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,820
to fight hard to win

600
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,280
everything she wanted,

601
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,640
like position,

602
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:30,990
fame,

603
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,030
and dignity.

604
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,450
Have you seen any irises

605
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,570
in my valley?

606
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,820
It’s my mom’s

607
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,190
favorite flower.

608
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,990
What a coincidence!

609
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,820
I also like irises!

610
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:54,740
I don’t think

611
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:55,830
your mom liked

612
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,950
that big mansion.

613
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,280
Do you know

614
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,690
what irises represent?

615
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,110
Freedom and hope.

616
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,060
She didn’t like that place.

617
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,820
She wanted to leave there.

618
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,740
So she planted irises

619
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,190
for your father,

620
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,190
hoping he could

621
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,820
set her free.

622
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,860
So my mother

623
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:27,200
never liked that big mansion.

624
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,150
She didn’t want

625
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:33,030
those splendid things.

626
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:39,740
Yes.

627
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,330
She wanted freedom.

628
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,270
Then those things I did for her

629
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,280
are all in vain.

630
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:55,180
Poison girl,

631
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,530
thank you!

632
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:58,490
This question has been

633
00:32:58,490 --> 00:32:59,820
bothering me for years.

634
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,910
And now, I finally got an answer.

635
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,450
Thank you so much!

636
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:38,900
Your Highness.

637
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,860
His Majesty goes

638
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,070
to Consort Qing’s place every night.

639
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,150
The maid who delivers her dinner

640
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,570
will pass here soon.

641
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,950
I’ve arranged everything

642
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,070
as you told.

643
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,380
When she gets here,

644
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:48,320
you can take her place

645
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,190
and follow the other maids

646
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,280
to get there.

647
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:51,530
I see.

648
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:52,740
Now, go back.

649
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:53,700
Yes.

650
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:07,350
Your Highness.

651
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,530
It’s said Noble Consort Xiao has gone insane.

652
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,469
Even the imperial doctor

653
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:14,280
couldn’t cure her.

654
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,400
It’s said the second prince

655
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,320
took his own life in despair.

656
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,050
Your Highness,

657
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:23,989
do you think it’s real?

658
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,320
The second prince

659
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,989
grew up in a royal family.

660
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:30,780
How could he be so fragile?

661
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,739
As an ambitious person,

662
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:36,070
even if he wanted to end his life,

663
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,449
how could he

664
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:39,280
choose to commit suicide?

665
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:41,190
Madam,

666
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,610
if Crown Prince finds out

667
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:45,610
how the late Empress died,

668
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,750
will he let the second prince live?

669
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,570
Your highness, you mean

670
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,989
the one who killed him was…

671
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,400
That, I’m not sure.

672
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,780
As long as the result

673
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,760
can benefit us,

674
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,900
it doesn’t matter

675
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,490
what the truth is.

676
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,280
Yes.

677
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,360
Your Highness is indeed wise.

678
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:11,200
If we didn’t

679
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,690
let the Dowager find out

680
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,360
about the poison in Noble Consort Xiao’s cakes,

681
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,650
I think

682
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,450
the Dowager wouldn’t find out

683
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:19,990
it was her this quickly.

684
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:24,400
The poor person must be utterly detestable.

685
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,070
You bitch!

686
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,240
How dare you set me up?

687
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:33,950
I’ll kill you!

688
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,080
Your Highness! Run!

689
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,450
Help!

690
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,030
Guards!

691
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,030
Help!

692
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:53,900
Guards!

693
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:54,700
Yes!

694
00:35:58,950 --> 00:35:59,820
Take her down!

695
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:02,200
Get out!

696
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:03,820
Your evil hag!

697
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,650
How dare you to misbehave here?

698
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:06,820
This bitch

699
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,110
killed my son!

700
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,150
I’ll let her

701
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,450
pay for it!

702
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:12,530
Do you have evidence?

703
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:14,190
Tianqing died because of her!

704
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,450
I’ll let her pay!

705
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,330
Take her down!

706
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,360
Let me go!

707
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:21,900
You know what?

708
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,250
I’m the one who killed the Empress!

709
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,780
I was too careless though!

710
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,740
I should have poisoned you

711
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,220
like I did to the Empress!

712
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:31,240
Guards!

713
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,780
Kill her by hanging!

714
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:33,820
Now!

715
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,030
Let go!

716
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:37,990
Chu Qingge!

717
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,590
Listen carefully!

718
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:40,980
Don’t get cocky so soon!

719
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,400
You will end up

720
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:43,570
much worse than me!

721
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:44,300
Take her down

722
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:48,190
Li Quan.

723
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,030
Yes, Your Majesty!

724
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:50,950
Watch her

725
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,320
till her last breath!

726
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:53,900
Yes.

727
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:00,490
Darling, are you okay?

728
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,530
I’m fine.

729
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,190
That’s good.

730
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,300
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

731
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:14,890
Brother Feiye,

732
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:17,450
this kind of herb works well

733
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,030
against the poisonous Gu.

734
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,700
Maybe you can try it.

735
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:28,890
Your Highness.

736
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,830
Miss Mingxiang.

737
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,720
Your Highness,

738
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,240
I have something important to report.

739
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:39,770
Mingxiang,

740
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,150
please go back first.

741
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,610
I’ll let them

742
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,650
send you the book you want.

743
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:47,360
Brother Feiye,

744
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,250
since I’m your sister,

745
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:50,650
what kind of thing

746
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,320
you need to hide from me?

747
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,530
Though I’m weak,

748
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,900
I’m willing

749
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,320
to do my best for you.

750
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:02,860
Go ahead.

751
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,070
Okay.

752
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:06,930
Your Highness,

753
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:10,210
Noble Consort Xiao tried to assassinate Consort Qing.

754
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:13,360
His Majesty has executed Noble Consort Xiao.

755
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:21,030
Noble Consort Xiao died to prove her sincerity.

756
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:21,990
That’s why

757
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:23,320
I think she had

758
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,150
no intention to harm us.

759
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,360
Now that Beili and Xiqiu have become allies,

760
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:30,610
Consort Qing has been

761
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,760
plotting to hurt us

762
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:33,570
since a long time ago.

763
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,990
You’ve been

764
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:47,110
working hard these days.

765
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:48,780
Look at you.

766
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:50,650
You look

767
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,610
so pale.

768
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:54,530
Why didn’t you rest

769
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:55,700
in Zhaoyang Palace?

770
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:58,030
Thank you for caring about me, grandma.

771
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,280
I’m fine now.

772
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,820
I haven’t visited you

773
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:02,990
for a long time.

774
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,400
So,

775
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:05,570
I wanted

776
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,240
to pay you a visit.

777
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:10,900
You are just

778
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,360
like Changbing.

779
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:16,070
Since your mother passed away,

780
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,490
you two

781
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,240
always come to me

782
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:21,150
when you are not well.

783
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,950
You never go find your father.

784
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,190
But it’s also his fault.

785
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,110
Grandma,

786
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,240
I’m here today

787
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,110
to see you.

788
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,030
So,

789
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,650
please don’t blame

790
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,740
my father.

791
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,700
Fine.

792
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,280
No wonder you don’t like to hear it.

793
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,110
I just heard

794
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:50,570
that Noble Consort Xiao actually

795
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,430
poisoned your mother to death!

796
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,490
And Tianqing

797
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,650
was just as evil as his mother!

798
00:39:59,070 --> 00:39:59,820
But

799
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:03,490
neither of them ended well.

800
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:04,610
Don’t

801
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,450
blame your father.

802
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,280
After all,

803
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,280
he avenged your mother.

804
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:11,570
Grandma,

805
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:14,190
my father hasn’t

806
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,900
summoned me for a long time.

807
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,700
Don’t worry.

808
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,520
Tianqing was just gone.

809
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,780
Your father

810
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,570
is still grieving.

811
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,700
Tianmo,

812
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,990
you are Crown Prince.

813
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,700
You must remember

814
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:42,650
that there’s no grudge between father and son.

815
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,570
As long as you follow the rules

816
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,590
and don’t make any mistakes,

817
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,700
your father’s empire

818
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,950
will be yours one day.

819
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,620
Thank you, grandma.

820
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,280
I’ll remember your words.

821
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,130
Go get some rest.

822
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,000
I’ve got this.

823
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:21,320
It’s okay.

824
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,490
I can do it a little longer.

825
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,650
You haven’t rested for quite a while.

826
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,570
You need to take care of your health.

827
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:27,570
Just go take a rest.

828
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:29,530
Yunxi, you also need some rest.

829
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:30,450
I’m not tired.

830
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:32,780
Qishao,

831
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,650
get me a bit more semen cassiae.

832
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:35,200
Okay.

833
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,070
Poison girl, are you okay?

834
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,430
You are not feeling well?

835
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,330
You are burning!

836
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:52,930
Let’s go!

837
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:53,950
Don’t!

838
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,520
It might work this time.

839
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:56,070
Wait!

840
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,450
Get up.

841
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,050
Poison girl!

842
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,030
Yunxi!

843
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:02,900
Poison girl!
