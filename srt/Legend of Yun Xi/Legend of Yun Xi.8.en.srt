Oh, right.

182
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,580
See your face first.

183
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,570
You must be really pretty.

184
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,570
Ningjing, it’s you!

185
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,780
Tang Li, how dare you

186
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,530
run away from our wedding?

187
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,110
It humiliated me

188
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,200
in front of everyone.

189
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,150
Now you’ve got a cheek

190
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,150
coming to a brothel.

191
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,950
Listen carefully,

192
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,780
I will let you

193
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,070
and your little lover

194
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:37,950
die together,

195
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,850
so you won’t feel lonely anymore.

196
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,340
Ningjing!

197
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,530
What on earth are you doing here?

198
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,070
I’m here for work. Stop this craziness.

199
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:01,990
Work?

200
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,650
Your work

201
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,740
is taking off her clothes?

202
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,150
Don’t make trouble again.

203
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,750
I have to take her away first.

204
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,000
Yuze ran away.

205
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,070
Do you really like her that much?

206
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,990
Are you going out for her?

207
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:13,650
Let me go.

208
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,490
No.

209
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,630
I won’t allow you

210
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:16,820
to visit a brothel again.

211
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,070
Cut the crap!

212
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:18,780
You upset

213
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,120
all our arrangements.

214
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,150
Yuze is the person

215
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,400
who framed up Feiye.

216
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,860
Stop! Go!

217
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:42,950
Your Highness!

218
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:43,860
Yuze is running away

219
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,400
to Mosquitoes Valley.

220
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,740
Chu and his people are in chase of her.

221
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,540
Princess Qin is going there too.

222
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,240
Feiye.

223
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,200
Hey.

224
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:17,510
Your Highness.

225
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,130
Where is she?

226
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,110
Our people

227
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,110
followed her here

228
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,930
and saw her run into the valley.

229
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,900
But there are a lot of mosquitoes.

230
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,450
We can’t move without careful thought.

231
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,400
Our people

232
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,360
have surrounded at the mouth.

233
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:31,700
Yunxi.

234
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,430
Do you have a way to help us enter the valley?

235
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,990
I do have a way,

236
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,150
but,

237
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,990
we have too many people.

238
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:42,880
What do you mean?

239
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,650
I have the antidote.

240
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,870
We won’t be poisoned within two hours.

241
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,610
But I only have two pieces.

242
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,680
Your Highness.

243
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,530
Give me one.

244
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,630
I want to go with His Highness

245
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,860
to make up for it.

246
00:09:59,320 --> 00:09:59,900
No way.

247
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,860
Why not?

248
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,820
Because I will enter with His Highness.

249
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,820
I will go myself.

250
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,030
No way.

251
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,780
So you have a tacit understanding.

252
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,530
In case Yuze

253
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,740
has some other poison,

254
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,070
since you don’t understand it,

255
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,610
I’d better be with him.

256
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,970
Your Highness.

257
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:16,990
I think

258
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,570
that makes sense.

259
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,950
That woman is good at using poison.

260
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,650
While Princess is good at detoxifying.

261
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,240
So, if she

262
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,450
can be with you,

263
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,720
we won’t worry that much.

264
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,060
Okay. Yunxi will go with me.

265
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,310
Your Highness!

266
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,860
Why are you still standing here?

267
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,460
Follow me!

268
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,680
Your Highness.

269
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,240
This place is remote

270
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,820
and wet all the year round.

271
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,530
The mosquitoes

272
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,450
should have flown out from this place

273
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,250
and Yuze took advantage of them.

274
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,200
But where is Yuze?

275
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,570
Yuze.

276
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,990
Stop hiding.

277
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,170
Come out right now.

278
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,610
So what?

279
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,010
You’d better

280
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,950
stop the useless resisting.

281
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:07,950
I suggest you

282
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,110
stop resisting.

283
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,920
Then you won’t suffer too much.

284
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,110
Once Prince Qin has a fight,

285
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,450
he won’t have compassion for womanhood.

286
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,630
I’d see what he’s capable of.

287
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,480
The same trick again.

288
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,570
Your Highness, don’t be afraid.

289
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:30,280
Last time, you got injured

290
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,650
because I wasn’t there.

291
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,620
Leave it to me.

292
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,010
Your Highness!

293
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:03,700
Look out!

294
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,280
Yunxi.

295
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:02,990
Yunxi.

296
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:04,700
Yunxi.

297
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:28,990
They’ve been there for a long time.

298
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,400
Why haven’t they come out?

299
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,490
It’s easy

300
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:32,240
for Feiye

301
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,450
to catch Yuze.

302
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,680
Something must be wrong!

303
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,320
No more wait.

304
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,650
I have to go check it out.

305
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:38,380
Childe Tang.

306
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,360
It’s useless to be anxious.

307
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,320
His Highness ordered

308
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,070
we should make no move

309
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,200
before he came out.

310
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,490
Do you mean we can do nothing

311
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,360
but wait here?

312
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:46,740
What else can you do?

313
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,150
It’s dark inside.

314
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,610
You would die

315
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,030
before you enter there.

316
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:51,740
How can you

317
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,190
talk like an unconcerned person?

318
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:53,950
If it weren’t for you,

319
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:54,450
Yuze was already caught

320
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,610
in Gorgeous Chamber.

321
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,320
In that case, Feiye wouldn’t

322
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,280
be in danger.

323
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,110
How can you blame me like that?

324
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,530
You didn’t make it clear

325
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,610
at the beginning.

326
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,400
What’s more,

327
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,490
every woman

328
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,530
will get mad

329
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,030
when she sees her husband

330
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,760
put off other women’s clothes.

331
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,950
Who’s your husband?

332
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,780
You are not ladylike at all.

333
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,980
Just a matter of time.

334
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,820
Think no more of it.

335
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,500
Don’t expect me to marry you.

336
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,110
Wait and see.

337
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,320
Getting you

338
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,820
isn’t a problem.

339
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,070
Mother, where are you?

340
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,190
Mother.

341
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,280
Where are you, mother?

342
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,280
Mother, where are you?

343
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,820
Your Highness. What are you doing?

344
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,260
Why are you taking off my clothes?

345
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,150
Can’t I?

346
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,110
We haven’t consummated.

347
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,610
Do you

348
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,640
want to consummate here?

349
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,360
Hurt?

350
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:13,819
Thank you.

351
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,690
You were injured for me.

352
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,240
But Yuze ran away.

353
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,700
Tang Li and our people are outside.

354
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,700
She can’t escape.

355
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,319
Take a good rest.

356
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:27,819
I will check if there is

357
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:28,700
another way out.

358
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,780
Be careful.

359
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,320
Your Highness.

360
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,700
My bag!

361
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:18,990
Want to die?

362
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,320
Is the bag

363
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:21,960
that important?

364
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,530
My mother left it to me.

365
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,360
♫ Close the door gently ♫

366
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,780

375
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,900
Your Royal Highness.

00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:10,740
Sit.

377
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,240
Thank you.

378
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,750
You may ask someone to send the word

379
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,070
instead of coming mere by yourself.

380
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,200
I’m afraid they can’t make it clear.

381
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,490
How’s His Majesty?

382
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:28,860
Physician Han said

383
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,600
His Majesty’s health didn’t deteriorate.

384
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,780
I believe

385
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,280
His Majesty can come through it.

386
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,110
I hope so.

387
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,030
I decide

388
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,820
to take the concubines

389
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,700
to Daxiangguo Temple for praying for His Majesty.

390
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,490
Hope Buddha

391
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,400
bless His Majesty.

392
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,280
I also want to do my bit.

393
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,070
We can let Madam Lin

394
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,400
go there for me.

395
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,150
Madam Lin.

396
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,650
This is prepared by Concubine Qing.

397
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,900
Please keep it.

398
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,490
How’s Her Highness?

399
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,740
She’s great!

400
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,250
Don’t worry about her.

401
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,210
She asked you to deal with it as soon as possible

402
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,740
[Tianhui is at his last gasp. Contact Xiqiu quickly.]

403
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,700
Tianhui is at his last gasp?

404
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:15,410
Your Majesty.

405
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,780
You are awake.

406
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,610
Qing.

407
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:20,790
Your Majesty.

408
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:21,860
Take it easy.

409
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,530
It won’t be long

410
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,530
before you’ll recover.

411
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,070
Physician Han is here.

412
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,450
Your Highness.

413
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,180
Etiquette is not needed.

414
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,990
How is His Majesty doing today?

415
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,280
After taking the medicine,

416
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,340
His Majesty has been getting better.

417
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:58,950
I made another prescription

418
00:22:58,950 --> 00:22:59,990
for His Majesty.

419
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,270
He will be much better

420
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,320
after taking that.

421
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,820
Please go ahead.

422
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:07,860
Li.

423
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,000
I prepared this prescription for His Majesty.

424
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:38,700
[Zhenshun Gate]

425
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,650
Over there.

426
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,280
One fish over there.

427
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:32,400
So beautiful.

428
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,950
What a big fish!

429
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,250
Take the fish with you.

430
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,240
Hey.

431
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:04,740
You.

432
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,610
You are dead.

433
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,780
Did you often bake fish?

434
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,610
When I gathered herbs before,

435
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,650
if I forgot the time,

436
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,320
I’d bake some mushrooms

437
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,150
or potherbs.

438
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,530
This should be in the same way.

439
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,730
It must be delicious.

440
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,040
Nobody in the Han family cared you?

441
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,360
My mother left me

442
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,650
when I was very young.

443
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,200
My father was indifferent to me.

444
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,990
I had carbuncles on my face.

445
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,530
Lady Xu

446
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:32,490
didn’t allow people in the Han's Mansion

447
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:33,450
to be close to me.

448
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,260
Don’t you hate her?

449
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,490
Even my father was indifferent to me.

450
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,450
She wasn’t bound

451
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:42,430
to be nice to me.

452
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:44,360
You even

453
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,740
don't care about it.

454
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,700
This is life.

455
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:52,990
If we are too particular

456
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:53,990
about everything,

457
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,650
life will become really hard.

458
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,820
What’s more,

459
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,190
I’m used to it.

460
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,860
I am always not that popular.

461
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,030
No matter family or friends.

462
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,610
So I envy you very much.

463
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,200
Envy me?

464
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,360
Your mother

465
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,740
loves you so much.

466
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,110
Tang Li, a fussy guy,

467
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,860
often pays no more attention to others,

468
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,390
but he highly respects you.

469
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,670
It means you are popular with others.

470
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,150
Popular?

471
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,900
I’ve heard of this

472
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:26,710
for the first time.

473
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,570
It means I’m in a very unique perspective.

474
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,050
By the way,

475
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,450
what’s the relationship

476
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:35,110
between Ningjing and Tang Li?

477
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:38,580
Ningjing is my master’s daughter.

478
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:40,990
Tang Li and I studied at Yunkong Academy

479
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,360
when we were little.

480
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:44,460
Since that time,

481
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,500
Ningjing’s liked to impose herself on Tang Li.

482
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:48,240
So

483
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,250
she’s the lady of Yunkong Academy.

484
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:55,850
It’s ready.

485
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,070
Have a taste.

486
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,410
I am not hungry. You may enjoy it first.

487
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:14,650
Look.

488
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,000
Tonight’s stars are bright.

489
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,240
Because you didn’t see many before,

490
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,240
you can’t tell it.

491
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,930
When I was young, my mother told me

492
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,570
every dead person

493
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,490
would become a star

494
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,450
and watch the one he/she loved before dying.

495
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,490
♫ If in this world ♫

496
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,650
Mother.

497
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,950
♫ With my strings ♫

498
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:52,930
Your Highness.

499
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:54,320
I really don’t know

500
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,720
why you went to the villa.

501
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,650
But I was there

502
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,860
only for herbs.

503
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,980
After I get Yuze for you,

504
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,110
let the matter

505
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,450
stop there. Okay?

506
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:04,900
I promise,

507
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,450
I won’t tell others

508
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,700
you ever went there.

509
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:11,530
Okay.

510
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,000
That’s great!

511
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,780
You are really wise

512
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,820
and generous.

513
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,080
That’s rarely seen.

514
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,740
If you don’t eat fish,

515
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:25,000
I will find something else for you.

516
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:28,050
You have injuries.

517
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:29,360
Take a rest.

518
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,350
Don’t run wild.

519
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,530
It’s okay. I will be right back.

520
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,200
♫ Don’t hate the destiny ♫

521

♫ To exchange for tomorrow, even if I’ll not be in it♫

529
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:10,200
♫ But you will understand my eternal love ♫

530
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,300
Why did you shelter me from the arrow?

531
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,110
♫ It’s destiny ♫

532
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:20,320
♫ Also the most beautiful meeting ♫

533
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,490
♫ Don’t hate the destiny ♫

534
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:23,860
You wanted to see

535
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,720
the windclan tattoo on me, right?

536
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:28,860
♫ Once again ♫

537
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:34,110
♫ Recall every bit about before ♫

538
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:37,740
♫ Don’t blame me for not being with you ♫

539
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:41,990
♫ Remember I will be in your heart ♫

540
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:58,990
Blood.

541
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,550
Someone was wounded near here.

542
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,150
What is this song?

543
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,150
It’s so powerful.

544
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,190
It’s the soul booster melody my father taught me.

545
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,700
Specially made for controlling bugs and creeping things.

546
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,530
Really?

547
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:02,490
Of course not.

548
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:49,860
Qishao.

549
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,590
It’s Mosquitoes Valley.

550
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,610
It’s Yuze.

551
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:55,060
It seems there is a problem.

552
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:00,610
Finally we got you.

553
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,780
Tell me.

554
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,570
Where are Feiye and Yunxi?

555
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,610
You may find them yourselves.

556
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,610
Maybe they’ve been eaten

557
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,530
by beasts.

558
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,190
That won’t help you.

559
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,280
Xifeng.

560
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,530
Take her back.

561
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:13,200
Yes.

562
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,150
Feiye.

563
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,400
Qishao.

564
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,830
The Princess looks very familiar.

565
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:36,990
Is she

566
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,110
the poison girl

567
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,860
who went to our valley before?

568
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,200
It’s her.

569
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,450
Anything related to her

570
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:43,400
is troublesome.

571
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,030
I tried to kill her,

572
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,030
but you didn’t agree.

573
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,190
Now the thing is worse.

574
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,950
I guess it’s her

575
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:49,900
who removed the mosquitoes

576
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,700
in the Valley.

577
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,030
Otherwise, Prince Qin

578
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,890
couldn’t get out from the Valley.

579
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,990
Qishao.

580
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:56,860
Are you still missing

581
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,790
the poison girl?

582
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,610
Yuze has been so loyal to you

583
00:33:58,610 --> 00:33:59,740
all these years.

584
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,150
You can’t let her down.

585
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,320
Do you think I don’t want to save Yuze?

586
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,240
I will kidnap

587
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:04,890
Han Yunxi

588
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,080
to change back Yuze.

589
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:06,860
Zhu Yu.

590
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,199
Don’t be childish.

591
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:09,610
Prince Qin’s Mansion

592
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:10,570
has a heavy defense.

593
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:11,320
Moreover,

594
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,650
you don’t need to kidnap her

595
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,030
if you’re that powerful.

596
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:14,949
What should we do then?

597
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:15,350
Will we

598
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,400
leave Yuze alone?

599
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:19,949
Qishao.

600
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:21,239
We

601
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,699
have big plans.

602
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,250
Think about your deceased mother.

603
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:27,699
Bai Su.

604
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,150
Take some people

605
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,199
to check it out.

606
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:31,739
Do remember.

607
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,030
Don’t let anybody

608
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,409
know our whereabouts.

609
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,780
Now Prince Qin only suspects

610
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,310
Crown Prince and his uncle.

611
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,219
But I’m afraid,

612
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,699
if he realizes the problem,

613
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:40,739
it will distract his attention.

614
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:41,469
At that time,

615
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:42,550
we will be exposed.

616
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:43,850
Qishao, don’t worry.

617
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,500
Qishao, what will I do?

618
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:47,780
You?

619
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:49,150
Give me some tea.

620
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,540
It’s purely poisonous

621
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,120
with a unique taste.

622
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,920
Did you extract it yourself?

623
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:14,110
Yeah.

624
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:52,790
You broke your noodle.

625
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:58,860
And you laughed at me?

626
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:18,650
Your Highness!

627
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:19,900
Why don’t you let me

628
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:21,360
send out the information

629
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,240
of Tianhui’s critical illness.

630
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,200
Once we send out the information,

631
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:26,200
Tianning will be in utter disorder.

632
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,130
Then we will have the opportunity.

633
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:30,780
Because Tianhui

634
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,320
doesn’t have smallpox.

635
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,360
Her Royal Highness is coming.

636
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:41,030
Your Royal Highness.

637
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:43,970
Etiquette is not needed.

638
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,990
How is His Majesty?

639
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,570
He’s completely recovered.

640
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,320
You may go out now.

641
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,280
Yes.

642
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,700
Mother.

643
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:06,490
Take it easy.

644
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:11,050
Chicken pox is not a serious disease.

645
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,810
But you still need a good rest.

646
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,240
Did Concubine Qing

647
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,780
take any actions?

648
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,780
Madam Lin went for praying with me.

649
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,460
But she had never been out of my sight.

650
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:27,280
It seems

651
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,570
the measure is helpful.

652
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:34,320
Concubine Qing is here sincerely for peace

653
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,610
on behalf of Xiqiu.

654
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,070
Your Majesty.

655
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,150
Are you so happy for it?

656
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:48,240
I can’t always give her the cold shoulder.

657
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,450
She’s proven to be innocent.

658
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,740
I can surely be at ease.

659
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,190
After all,

660
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,450
it’s really hard

661
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:57,610
to take precautions against a bedmate.

662
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,320
Anyway,

663
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,990
you still can’t relax your vigilance.

664
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,280
You got chicken pox

665
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,280
all of a sudden.

666
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,030
Also, you tested Concubine Qing

667
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,280
with this case.

668
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:10,190
But

669
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,580
she still needs long-term observation.

670
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:16,990
I know it.

671
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:30,200
Han Cong'an is known as a highly skilled physician.

672
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,280
How could he make a mistake

673
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,990
in diagnosing smallpox.

674
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,850
What if he did it on purpose?

675
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,990
How is it possible?

676
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:42,900
I saw the prescription.

677
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,650
It even includes vinegar.

678
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:46,320
Vinegar

679
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,490
is antagonistic to the medicines

680
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,950
for smallpox.

681
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,110
He should know it.

682
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,070
So,

683
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,190
I guess

684
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,240
Tianhui didn’t have smallpox,

685
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:00,320
but chicken pox.

686
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,700
If it’s true,

687
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,990
why did Han Cong’an do that?

688
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,070
If I was right,

689
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,780
Tianhui

690
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,280
directed him to do so.

691
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,780
Why did Tianhui do that?

692
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:27,280
He

693
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,900
must doubt that I have another purpose

694
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,900
for marrying him.

695
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,030
If we send out

696
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,450
the message today,

697
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:35,860
we are in his trap.

698
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,530
This is just

699
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:38,990
what you guess.

700
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,190
If Tianhui

701
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,610
really had smallpox,

702
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,700
we would have lost this opportunity.

703
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,070
Even if it’s just my guess,

704
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,490
we can’t take the risk.

705
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,700
It was so hard at that time.

706
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:55,490
We can’t make any mistake

707
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:59,030
if we are not assured of our victory.

708
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:04,220
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

709
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,500
Physician Gu.

710
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:02,570
Princess Qin

711
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:03,400
has remained unconscious

712
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,400
after returning from Mosquitoes Valley.

713
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,660
She might be poisoned.

714
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,960
Physician Gu. Please.

715
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:16,820
Your Highness.

716
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,020
Physician Gu is here.

717
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:19,950
Your Highness.

718
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:21,820
Thank you for your help.

719
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:36,740
I...

720
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,150
I was

721
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,900
sent by Han Cong’an,

722
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,900
Physician Han.

723
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,490
It’s her.

724
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,360
She is Princess Qin.

725
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,200
Is there anything wrong with her?

726
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:01,270
No big deal.

727
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,760
Your Highness.

728
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,900
Princess Qin has unsettled old wounds,

729
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,160
also she caught a cold,

730
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,150
and has been too tired all these days,

731
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,650
so she is in a coma.

732
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:18,290
I will make some prescriptions.

733
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:19,740
She can recover

734
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,460
after taking the medicines.

735
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,110
If there is nothing else,

736
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,530
I’m leaving now.

737
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,820
Physician Gu. Please!
