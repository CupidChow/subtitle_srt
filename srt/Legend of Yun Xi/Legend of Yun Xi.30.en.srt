2
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,020
Episode 30

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:05,870
So,

4
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:07,620
are you leaving here?

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,450
His Highness and I

6
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,500
have something else to do.

7
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,830
I won’t bother you here.

8
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:13,580
Go ahead.

9
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,910
Anyway, I’m just an outsider

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,910
who detoxified you

11
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:17,500
all night

12
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:18,950
while he is your lover who treated you

13
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,350
no more than half an hour.

14
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,700
That’s not like

15
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,790
what you would say.

16
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,200
You saved my life,

17
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,330
so you’re my savior,

18
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,580
not an outsider.

19
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:29,880
Rest assured.

20
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,680
You’re my best friend forever.

21
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,790
Alright, my friend.

22
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:35,830
Do you want to know

23
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:36,660
the medicine I used to

24
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,580
detoxify you?

25
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:39,540
Of course.

26
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,590
When I’m back,

27
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,330
I’ll write you the prescription.

28
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,390
Thank you, Qishao.

29
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,290
Go ahead.

30
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,250
Yunxi.

31
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,500
Please save father.

32
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,620
What’s wrong?

33
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Here’s the thing.

34
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Your father failed to save Crown Prince

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,410
and was imprisoned

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,240
by His Majesty.

37
00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:12,000
His life is on the line.

38
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,950
I should have guessed.

39
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:15,789
Yunxi.

40
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,080
You must save him.

41
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,220
If anything happens

42
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,830
to him,

43
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,000
our family will lose everything.

44
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:28,080
Yunxi.

45
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,539
That was all my fault.

46
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,120
I apologize.

47
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:32,910
You can

48
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,870
scold me or even beat me.

49
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:37,250
But please save father.

50
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,450
I can’t lose father.

51
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,789
The Han family can’t lose him.

52
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,620
Rise first...

53
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,750
Rise.

54
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,240
Yunxi.

55
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,410
It was

56
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:57,620
all my fault.

57
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:00,580
But your father really cares about you.

58
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,200
He had his reason

59
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,040
to treat you like that.

60
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,120
Yunxi.

61
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:10,870
Yunxi.

62
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:12,550
Our family can’t fall apart.

63
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,250
Your father

64
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,410
did wrong things,

65
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,829
but he is your father.

66
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,290
Even if

67
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,550
you don’t care about Ruoxue and me,

68
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,700
you should think about your madam

69
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,250
and your brother.

70
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:26,660
Yunyi is the only boy

71
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,160
of our family.

72
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,910
You don’t want him

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,700
to lose father so young, do you?

74
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,329
Also,

75
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,000
your father is the sole pillar

76
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,240
of our family.

77
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,540
Besides, Yunxi,

78
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,600
given an incident like this,

79
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,810
if only your father

80
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,000
were to be punished,

81
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,870
that would be a mercy.

82
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,550
It’s just that

83
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:48,870
if something really

84
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,370
happens to Crown Prince,

85
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,579
then

86
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,910
none of our family

87
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,160
can survive.

88
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,040
So,

89
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,750
Yunxi, I beg you.

90
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,500
Please let go of the grudge

91
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,650
and plead with Prince Qin

92
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,370
to save your father

93
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,790
and the Han family.

94
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,040
Yunxi.

95
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:11,950
Yunxi.

96
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,040
You must save him.

97
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,910
Yunxi.

98
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,750
Yunxi.

99
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,370
Yunxi. Please beg His Highness

100
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,079
to save us.

101
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,220
Or else, the whole Han family

102
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,450
will be doomed.

103
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,829
Yunxi.

104
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,250
I beg you.

105
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,200
Don’t worry, Your Highness.

106
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,930
His Highness

107
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,950
is blessed by God.

108
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,450
Bodhisattva.

109
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,250
Bodhisattva, please bless Tianmo

110
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,079
to be safe.

111
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,240
Concubine Qing comes.

112
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,520
Greetings, Your Royal Highness.

113
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,330
Qing.

114
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,790
How is Tianmo?

115
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,320
Your Royal Highness.

116
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,200
He has woken up,

117
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,200
but he

118
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,240
doesn’t look good.

119
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,040
His Majesty accused

120
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,450
Hang Cong’an of improper treatment,

121
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,160
and already

122
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,370
put him into prison.

123
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,450
All the other physicians

124
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,440
had no way to treat him

125
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,660
and all got imprisoned.

126
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,910
How come?

127
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,540
Who else can save Tianmo?

128
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,580
Your Royal Highness.

129
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,790
I think of someone.

130
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,150
Who is it?

131
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,370
Tell me.

132
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,790
Princess Qin

133
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,290
detoxified me.

134
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,900
Now her father is in jail.

135
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,200
She must be

136
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,409
very anxious.

137
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,870
Princess Qin

138
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,290
is a poison master.

139
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,750
Perhaps you may

140
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,870
invite her

141
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,330
to go to the palace and treat His Highness.

142
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,160
What’s up?

143
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,290
It’s unfair.

144
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:14,950
His life has

145
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,160
nothing to do with me.

146
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,870
He is my father, though.

147
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,240
Tell me if you

148
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:23,910
hate him.

149
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,200
I blame him.

150
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,290
I hate him.

151
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,370
When I was bullied by Lady Xu

152
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,230
and Han Ruoxue,

153
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,870
why didn’t he help me?

154
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,500
When they mocked I had no mother,

155
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,790
why didn’t he help me?

156
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,580
When I was homeless

157
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,710
and lived on street,

158
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:41,830
why didn’t he help me?

159
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:45,320
I don’t have a father like him.

160
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,200
In this case,

161
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,140
we may not save him.

162
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,010
If he is ordered to die,

163
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,790
his poor medical skills should be blamed.

164
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,120
Die?

165
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,450
But Crown Prince’s poison

166
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,780
is too hard to detoxify.

167
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,790
Serving the king is like keeping a tiger company.

168
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,750
As the Chief Imperial Physician

169
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,210
of the Imperial Hospital,

170
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:15,910
he could have prepared

171
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:16,840
for this ending.

172
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,250
But how could a life

173
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,700
be so cheap?

174
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,180
So you still want to save him.

175
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,070
I’ve got Physician Gu

176
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,500
to help you

177
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,290
research the cure for Crown Prince.

178
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,540
Thank you, Your Highness.

179
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,810
Greetings, Your Royal Highness.

180
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,700
You may all leave.

181
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:53,870
Yes.

182
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,580
Just now

183
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,500
Concubine Qing recommended

184
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
someone to me to treat Crown Prince.

185
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,620
It reminds me of one thing.

186
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:15,540
Who?

187
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,080
Han Yunxi.

188
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,500
Han Yunxi?

189
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,240
Mother, you mean...

190
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,500
Even if

191
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,480
she can guarantee that Crown Prince can be saved,

192
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,790
but in an unpredictable situation,

193
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,580
who can guarantee

194
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,050
that nothing else would happen?

195
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,370
To save his wife,

196
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,790
Long Feiye will make sure

197
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,500
that Han Yunxi

198
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:45,159
can save Crown Prince.

199
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,120
Taking this opportunity,

200
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,580
we can naturally

201
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,370
bring down Prince Qin.

202
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,290
Although

203
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,500
we may not get him killed,

204
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,240
it concerns the Crown Prince.

205
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,330
If Crown Prince is hurt,

206
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,500
Prince Qin will be demoted to a nobody.

207
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,580
That’s good as well.

208
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,870
The life of Han Cong’an

209
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:17,830
isn’t enough.

210
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,590
I want all his family’s lives...

211
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,460
[Pavilion of Leisure]

212
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,580
Greetings, Your Highness.

213
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,120
Physician Gu.

214
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,270
Your Highness.

215
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,620
This is

216
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,750
Physician Han’s prescription.

217
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,240
This poison is indeed weird,

218
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,790
which can harm both the brain

219
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,450
and organs.

220
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,080
The poisoner

221
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,750
must be a genius.

222
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:06,950
We may

223
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,660
prepare the poison

224
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,050
that Crown Prince took

225
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,450
and then find out a cure.

226
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,660
That’s feasible.

227
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:13,630
It’s just that

228
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,410
we don’t have much time.

229
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,250
Yeah.

230
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,240
He would be already dead

231
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,060
when the poison is detoxified.

232
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,980
Your Highness.

233
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,370
I heard

234
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,330
that there’s a beast in Heaven Pit

235
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,240
which can detoxify any poison.

236
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,120
That said,

237
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,980
it’s too risky.

238
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,260
You mean Poison Beast?

239
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,200
Exactly.

240
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,850
I ever went to Heaven pit.

241
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,160
The poison gas called Poison Sha
there is very strong.

242
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,560
To find the Poison Beast,

243
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,790
we have to figure out the cure

244
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,000
against Poison Sha.

245
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,870
I’m willing

246
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,530
to help you, Your Highness.

247
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,400
Thank you, Physician Gu.

248
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:52,910
We can

249
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,540
handle the poison,

250
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,370
but there are

251
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,580
numerous traps.

252
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,000
Many poison masters

253
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,660
trying to get Poison Beast

254
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,150
failed to come out alive.

255
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,250
That said,

256
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,540
no matter what

257
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,910
lies ahead,

258
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,660
we have to take a chance.

259
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:15,950
Your Highness are

260
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,540
indeed a heroine.

261
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,780
You have my admiration.

262
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,290
Being accompanied by His Highness,

263
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,890
I have confidence of course.

264
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,120
Qishao.

265
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,120
These are the most precious herbs

266
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,290
in the Herbal Sea.

267
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:45,690
You used to hate

268
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,040
picking any of them.

269
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,240
How come you picked so many today?

270
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,500
You don’t understand.

271
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,520
Poison Master is in Heaven Pit.

272
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,160
Since poison girl went back,

273
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,450
she’s been researching

274
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,540
a cure for Poison Sha

275
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,620
in Heaven Pit.

276
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,240
She desperately

277
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,750
needs these herbs.

278
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,160
Qishao.

279
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:03,950
Are you

280
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,080
out of mind?

281
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,000
How come you are still

282
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,730
caring about that poison girl?

283
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,080
You’re hothead.

284
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,500
Use your brain.

285
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,660
If I help her with the antidote,

286
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,460
they’ll surely go to Heaven Pit.

287
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,620
By that time

288
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,370
we can

289
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,180
get what we want effortlessly.

290
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,280
Thank you, Your Highness.

291
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,410
I’ve promised Han Yunxi

292
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,750
to get you out.

293
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,450
I asked Your Highness here

294
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:56,750
not to let you

295
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,240
get me out.

296
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,410
I just want you to keep Yunxi

297
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,330
away from this.

298
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,330
I know

299
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,870
they are going to your mansion

300
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,750
to plead.

301
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,160
Given Yunxi’s temper,

302
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,870
I’m sure

303
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,240
she will try to save me anyway.

304
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,660
However,

305
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,370
I know Crown Prince’s situation

306
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,830
better than anyone else.

307
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,290
He is incurable.

308
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,610
Aren’t you afraid of death?

309
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,580
Yes,

310
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,660
of course I am.

311
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:36,620
But

312
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,290
since I became

313
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,600
the Chief Imperial Physician,

314
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,620
I’ve prepared for this.

315
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,880
As the saying goes that

316
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,140
serving the king is like keeping a tiger company.

317
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,500
I heard

318
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,050
you’ve been hard on Yunxi since her childhood.

319
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,830
She did hate you.

320
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,040
From your look,

321
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,320
you seem to hide something.

322
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,240
Tianxin is

323
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,160
the love of my life.

324
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,080
How could I

325
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,620
be hard on her daughter?

326
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,300
What’s the story then?

327
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,000
Tianxin ever told me

328
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,740
she wished her daughter

329
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,250
would marry an ordinary man

330
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,210
and lead an ordinary life.

331
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,240
She didn’t want her to get involved

332
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,500
in enmity and power struggle

333
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,040
of noble houses.

334
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,540
My Han family

335
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,040
isn’t a prestigious family

336
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,200
that much,

337
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,290
but

338
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,620
it’s influential

339
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,880
in Dowager and His Majesty’s eyes.

340
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,200
I’m afraid that

341
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,250
someday His Majesty

342
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,870
will betroth Yunxi

343
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,950
to a prestigious family

344
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,200
on a whim,

345
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,500
which

346
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,410
will violate the agreement

347
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,880
Tianxin made with me before her death.

348
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,520
That’s why you got Yunxi’s face

349
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,040
have sores.

350
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,160
There was no

351
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,750
another way to go.

352
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,620
Since her childhood,

353
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,700
Yunxi has been smart

354
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,410
and lovely.

355
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,290
When she gets married

356
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,080
into an ordinary family,

357
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,270
I will find a way

358
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,790
to heal her face.

359
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:55,790
I believe

360
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,120
under my protection

361
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,870
she can live her life

362
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,200
peacefully.

363
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,160
But it is

364
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,370
her own life.

365
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,950
She has the right

366
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,830
to choose the life she wants.

367
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,870
Prince Qin.

368
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,580
Are you planning to

369
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,040
take over the world?

370
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,130
You’ve been an official for years.

371
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,800
I’m sure you know

372
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,430
you shall not speculate

373
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,000
others’ mind.

374
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,950
Officials like us

375
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,540
have no power in hand.

376
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,250
Except that

377
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,950
we can see through the situation clearly,

378
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,120
we have no other way to protect ourselves.

379
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,670
I don’t hope Yunxi

380
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,660
marries into Prince Qin’s Mansion,

381
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,080
because I’m afraid

382
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,030
there will be someone like you showing up.

383
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,080
I tried to avoid it.

384
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,200
I didn’t think it’d still happen.

385
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,360
Yunxi is still trying to save you,

386
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,120
even though she remembers

387
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,120
how you mistreated her.

388
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,250
Let her come.

389
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,410
I know how to stop her

390
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,700
saving me.

391
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,500
What?

392
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,910
You still have doubts?

393
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,330
Are you afraid

394
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,910
that I will play tricks?

395
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,510
Why are you doing this?

396
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,920
The proposals His Majesty reads

397
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,830
on the court

398
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,620
are modified several times

399
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,960
before getting to him.

400
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,330
So,

401
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,290
he doesn’t know the tragedies of people.

402
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:01,950
But I

403
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,790
ever practiced medicine among the people.

404
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,450
I know people’s sufferings.

405
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,200
I also know

406
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,010
His Majesty has been unpopular for long.

407
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,450
Crown Prince is at stake.

408
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,700
In a world like this,

409
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,450
only

410
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:20,680
you, Prince Qin, deserve the throne.

411
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:23,750
I

412
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,200
have been

413
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,349
an obstacle to you.

414
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,750
Now that I’m hindering you,

415
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,190
I should be eliminated as soon as possible.

416
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,160
You’re Yunxi’s father.

417
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:39,910
I won’t do so.

418
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,960
Your Highness. If you take the throne,

419
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,870
it’s good for Tianning,

420
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,950
for the people in the world,

421
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,330
and also

422
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,700
for my family.

423
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,750
If

424
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,830
you take the throne

425
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:56,670
and feel sorry

426
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,120
somewhat,

427
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,080
you may

428
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,000
keep all my family safe.

429
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,250
I also hope

430
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,360
when you ascend the throne,

431
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,110
you will still be good to Yunxi

432
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,700
like now.

433
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,790
What I want

434
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,570
isn’t the throne of Tianning.

435
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,870
It doesn’t belong to me.

436
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,580
Besides, I promised Yunxi

437
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,390
that I’d be with her forever.

438
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,120
I hope so.

439
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,250
Please be kind to Yunxi.

440
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,250
Let her come, please.

441
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,540
What a scheme from Chu Qing’ge.

442
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,830
It made Crown Prince suspect His Majesty

443
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,040
and also made His Majesty suspect Long Feiye.

444
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,900
The Han family also got involved.

445
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,260
It killed three birds with one stone.

446
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,830
Qishao. Let me help you.

447
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,160
Poison girl didn’t know

448
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:20,950
Han Cong’an

449
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,950
was imprisoned when she went back.

450
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,080
So, she hasn’t connected

451
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,160
the Poison Beast

452
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,820
with Crown Prince’s illness.

453
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:28,830
But

454
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,290
whether Poison Master is in Heaven Pit or not,

455
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,620
they have to find Poison Beast

456
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,680
as soon as possible

457
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,250
to detoxify Crown Prince.

458
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:37,410
Qishao.

459
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,750
Long Feiye’s martial arts are unrivaled.

460
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,660
The odds to take Poison Master

461
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,500
from him

462
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,500
are little.

463
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,620
In Heaven Pit,

464
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,910
martial are

465
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,570
absolutely useless.

466
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,750
It’s hard to tell

467
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:49,750
who will win.

468
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,500
Don’t worry about that.

469
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:34,860
Physician Gu.

470
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,140
Can these herbs

471
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,430
be used as drug usher?

472
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,100
This herb is sweet

473
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,140
and pungent,

474
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,140
but

475
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,480
not like the detoxifying herbs

476
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,350
we usually use.

477
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,020
Being poisoned by Poison Sha, I found

478
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,270
the poison was strong,

479
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,730
but it’s still possible to be detoxified.

480
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,060
When I was in Yaogui Valley,

481
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,520
Gu Qishao used these herbs

482
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,520
to detoxify me.

483
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:55,680
These herbs

484
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,900
smell like

485
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,650
common detoxifying herbs

486
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,780
when they are fresh.

487
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,690
But the smell gets changed

488
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:01,820
when they are dried.

489
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,790
Poison girl.

490
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:08,480
Qishao.

491
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:09,980
I wondered

492
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:10,400
why you

493
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,000
got poisoned so carelessly.

494
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,730
So you tried the poison

495
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:14,560
on yourself

496
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,530
and then make the antidote here.

497
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,170
How could I take risk on myself?

498
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,730
I have many people and things

499
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:21,650
to take care of.

500
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:22,300
Alright.

501
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,520
Do you remember

502
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,130
the six requests you owe me?

503
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,480
Now grant me the first request.

504
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,230
From now on,

505
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,400
don’t test any poison

506
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,100
on yourself.

507
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:30,730
Got it?

508
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:31,850
Alright.

509
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:32,940
I promise.

510
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,270
Are you working

511
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,130
on the antidote for Poison Sha?

512
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:41,810
Yes.

513
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,850
But the medicinal ushers are not enough.

514
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,190
The herbs from Her Highness are

515
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,140
very hard to cultivate.

516
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,560
There are few suitable environments

517
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,520
for the herbs

518
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,650
to grow.

519
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,190
Qishao.

520
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,850
You have them

521
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,590
in Yaogui Valley. Right?

522
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,280
How many do you want?

523
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,060
Are these enough?

524
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,100
Greetings, Prince Qin.

525
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,100
Who are you?

526
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,270
I’m Bai Xiaochuan, the Supervisor of Tianning,

527
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,000
also General Baili’s student.

528
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,880
You said it’s an emergency.

529
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,080
What is it?

530
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,060
Days ago,

531
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,570
Miss Mingxiang took me

532
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,460
to look for someone in Heaven Pit.

533
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:30,190
We were attacked

534
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,770
at the cave mouth of Heaven Pit.

535
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,370
Miss Mingxiang was missing.

536
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,400
These days I took my men

537
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,020
to look for her several times,

538
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,440
but to no avail.

539
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,120
The last time...

540
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,730
Miss Mingxiang asked me

541
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,760
not to tell anyone about this.

542
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,140
But I’m afraid

543
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:15,600
to delay

544
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:16,900
the rescue of Miss Mingxiang.

545
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,600
So,

546
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,440
I come to seek your help.

547
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,520
Also,

548
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:21,770
when I woke up,

549
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,900
these two things were on my body.

550
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,100
[Prince Qin]

551
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,480
I see.

552
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,600
The masked man saved Bai Xiaochuan

553
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,270
and offered a warning.

554
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,940
Is he a friend or a foe?

555
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,770
I’m going to show Gu.

556
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:55,350
Gu.

557
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:56,910
Boil another bowl.

558
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:06,710
Your Highness.

559
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:09,060
Prince Qin asked for you.

560
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:20,910
How is the antidote

561
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,060
for Crown Prince?

562
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,020
It won’t be soon enough to save his life.

563
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,190
The only way now

564
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,940
is to find the Poison Beast

565
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,760
and cure him with its blood.

566
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,100
What’s this?

567
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,020
The map of Heaven Pit

568
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,080
made by Mingxiang.

569
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,850
Probably Mingxiang is already

570
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:44,980
in Heaven Pit now.

571
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,650
She went to Heaven Pit?

572
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:50,810
She found

573
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,070
the map of Heaven Pit

574
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,520
from the Poisoning Manual

575
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:56,170
and went there secretly.

576
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,520
She’s so presumptuous.

577
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,060
Without the antidote,

578
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,020
she would get killed

579
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,100
even with the map.

580
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,320
In Heaven Pit, there are Poison Master

581
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:08,050
and Poison Beast that can save Crown Prince’s life.

582
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,440
Now even Mingxiang

583
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,910
is probably in Poison Master’s hand.

584
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,350
In this case,

585
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,810
I have to go there myself.

586
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,230
She must take the risk

587
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,350
for His Highness.

588
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,020
Publicly and privately,

589
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,420
I cannot leave her aside.

590
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,690
Rest assured.

591
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:27,140
After I make the antidote,

592
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,800
I’ll go to Heaven Pit with you.

593
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,940
One more thing.

594
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,290
Han Cong’an wants to see you.

595
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,230
Go in.

596
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,000
Don’t worry.

597
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,280
His Highness and I will save you.

598
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:21,150
I don’t need you to save me.

599
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,480
I don’t want to owe you

600
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,520
anything.

601
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:27,940
Not just for you,

602
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:28,930
it’s also

603
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,000
for my siblings and your concubines.

604
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,390
They have nothing to do with you as well.

605
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:35,780
What do you mean?

606
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:36,940
Because

607
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,380
you are not a Han at all.

608
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,600
You have no blood bond

609
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,560
with us at all.

610
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,400
You’re just a bastard.

611
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,480
Our Han family and our affairs

612
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,010
have nothing to do with you.

613
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,310
No way.

614
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,310
I’ve made it clear.

615
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,150
I’m not your father.

616
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,730
I met your mother years ago

617
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,480
when I picked herbs

618
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,330
in the mountain .

619
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,690
Your mother was unconscious at the cliff.

620
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,230
I got her back.

621
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,560
I looked after her,

622
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,310
being together with her day and night.

623
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,520
So, we were in love,

624
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:22,730
and got married.

625
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,020
But I didn’t think

626
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:27,140
she was already pregnant

627
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,900
before we got married.

628
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,400
To save face,

629
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:33,810
I had to let her give birth to you.

630
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,760
I could put up with you

631
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,270
while she was alive.

632
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,150
But she died later.

633
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:41,520
The sight of you

634
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,190
reminded me of the shame.

635
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,560
That’s why you tortured me

636
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,600
once my mother died.

637
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,310
You poisoned me to have sores

638
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,440
and let Lady Xu and Han Ruoxue

639
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,190
bully me.

640
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,560
Exactly.

641
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,150
Because you

642
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,640
reminded me

643
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,100
of the previous shame.

644
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:07,690
So I don’t need you

645
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:08,730
to save me.

646
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,690
I don’t want to owe you anything.

647
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,480
Who is my biological father?

648
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:18,440
I don’t know.

649
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,030
I don’t want to know.

650
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,150
Listen up.

651
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,650
From now on,

652
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,480
the Han family and our affairs

653
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,010
have nothing to do with you.

654
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,140
I don’t need you to save me.

655
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,190
Go!

656
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:36,770
Scram!

657
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,190
Yunxi.

658
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,850
Sorry.

659
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,340
Your Highness.

660
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,300
Father didn’t want me to save him.

661
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,130
I’m not saving your father.

662
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,000
I’m saving Crown Prince.

663
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,790
You don’t have to comfort me.

664
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,270
In this situation,

665
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,020
I don’t want you to get in trouble

666
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,140
because of me.

667
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,690
Listen to me.

668
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,800
King Tianhui has sent men

669
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,680
to keep an eye on my mansion.

670
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:26,270
Now

671
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,340
Crown Prince is at stake.

672
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,190
Saving Crown Prince

673
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,230
is a good reason for me

674
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,690
to go to Heaven Pit openly.

675
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:35,850
But His Majesty

676
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,380
will definitely set traps.

677
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,150
I don’t want you

678
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,410
to get in danger again.

679
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,150
Don’t worry.

680
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:46,480
Believe me.

681
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:47,980
Alright?

682
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,700
I believe you.

683
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,520
Let’s look for Poison Master, Poison Beast

684
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,560
in Heaven Pit and save the Han family.

685
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:16,020
Your Majesty.

686
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,690
How is he?

687
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,190
Not good.

688
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,600
If the poison in his body

689
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,650
cannot be removed

690
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:22,810
within 4 days,

691
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,740
I’m afraid...

692
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:26,650
Leave.

693
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:27,600
Yes.

694
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:28,480
Li Quan.

695
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

696
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,230
How is Han Cong’an?

697
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,020
Your Majesty.

698
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,440
He is still studying in his cell.

699
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,100
He didn’t say he could cure it.

700
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:37,900
Two days ago,

701
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,480
Prince Qin and Princess Qin

702
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,140
went to see him.

703
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:42,850
Any news from them?

704
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,700
Prince Qin was highly vigilant.

705
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,140
Nothing was heard.

Mother.

707
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,860
I sent men to give out the information,

708
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:53,900
yet Prince Qin

709
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,060
had no move at all.

710
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:56,900
I will

711
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,940
never show mercy again.

712
00:33:59,190 --> 00:33:59,990
Your Majesty.

713
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:02,140
Without rooting out Han’s mansion,

714
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,310
it’s impossible

715
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,730
to topple Prince Qin.

717
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:14,310
or dismiss.

718
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:16,440
Your Majesty,

719
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,940
I’ve got a proposal.

720
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:19,440
Go ahead.

721
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,560
This proposal

722
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,600
was jointly sighed

723
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:28,020
by imperial physicians

724
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,230
to charge Han Cong’an,
the chief of Imperial Hospital,

725
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,480
with deception,

726
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:33,060
adulteration,

727
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:34,600
abuse of power,

728
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:36,170
corruption and bribery,

729
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,139
resulting in grievances in Imperial Hospital.

730
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,650
The evidence is solid.

731
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,190
Please judge, Your Majesty.

732
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,830
He dared to violate national laws.

733
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,020
Let the Highest Judiciary investigate it.

734
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,060
If it’s true,

735
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:53,449
confiscate the Han family.

Hah!

739
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,900
Catch them.

740
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,620
-The others go with me.
-Yes.

741
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,780
What are you doing?

742
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,190
Get away.

743
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:17,430
Don’t move.

744
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:19,400
Freeze.

745
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,850
- Freeze! - Freeze!

752
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:14,560
Go to Prince Qin’s Mansion.

[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

754
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,400
Stop.

755
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:28,310
What are you doing?

756
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:28,980
Sir.

757
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,150
I’m the concubine of

758
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,480
Her Highness’s father.

759
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:32,940
My family is in trouble.

760
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,520
Please

761
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,140
go to tell Her Highness.

762
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,760
I have an emergency for her.

763
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:38,810
Your Majesty.

764
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,230
Other than Mrs. Xu,

765
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,020
all other people in Han’s Mansion

766
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,280
have been imprisoned.

767
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,060
We were tipped off

768
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:46,190
that Xu was seen

769
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:47,560
at Prince Qin’s gate.

770
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,020
Should we search Prince Qin’s Mansion?

771
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,770
No.

772
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,980
Since she went to Prince Qin’s Mansion,

773
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,770
Prince Qin

774
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,650
will surely come to me.

775
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,960
Madam and Yunyi were arrested?

776
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:00,730
Yes.

777
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:01,650
All of them.

778
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:03,430
All the people were arrested.

779
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,900
Your father will be executed

780
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,190
in two days at the Meridian Gate.

781
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,140
Your Highness.

782
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,810
You must save your father.

783
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,130
Your Highness.

784
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,740
I’ve sent men to investigate it.

785
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,570
Your father’s guilt

786
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,460
isn’t that serious

787
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,270
as reported,

788
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,750
but the evidence is solid

789
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,680
about his capital offence.

790
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:27,850
Actually,

791
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,850
I tried to dissuade him

792
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,020
from doing that.

793
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,190
But he said

794
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:35,500
the gifts were from officials.

795
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:36,810
It’s inappropriate

796
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:37,940
to refuse them.

797
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,080
So, he accepted.

798
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:40,770
But now

799
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,650
His Majesty can easily

800
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:45,020
get the goods on him.

801
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,090
It’s his fault.

802
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,230
How come Yunyi and his mother

803
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,160
are implicated?

804
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:50,940
Other than

805
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,460
the culprit Han Cong’an,

806
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,270
I can

807
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,850
mediate in it

808
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,760
and keep others safe.

809
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,600
Thanks, Your Highness.

810
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,940
Your Highness. Princess.

811
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,230
You must save him.

812
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:03,730
He can’t die.

813
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:04,770
He cannot die.

814
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,850
Lady Xu, stop it.

815
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,040
Han Cong’an isn’t my father.

816
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,150
Your Highness.

817
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:13,020
You really wronged him.

818
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,310
He cares about you

819
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:16,940
the most.

820
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,150
Back then

821
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:21,520
Lady Tianxin saved Dowager’s life.

822
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,770
So, I’ve been jealous of you

823
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,350
and Lady Tianxin.

824
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,230
After Lady Tianxin died,

825
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:31,900
Dowager no longer contacted

826
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,230
with the Han family.

827
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,850
Your father

828
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,560
is afraid that

829
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:39,270
I bear the old grudges

830
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,650
and take it out on you

831
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:43,560
and torture you.

832
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:44,740
That’s why

833
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,600
he is

834
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:48,690
indifferent to you.

835
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,230
He is afraid

836
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,690
that you torture me?

837
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,290
My maternal family

838
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:58,060
is powerful.

839
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:00,810
Your father dares not to offend me.

840
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:02,850
He’s also afraid that

841
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,190
the better he treats you,

842
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,650
the more jealous I will be.

843
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,610
He needs to go to the palace

844
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:09,140
to treat the nobles.

845
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:11,070
He can’t be with you all the time.

846
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:11,850
Also,

847
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,310
he knows me well.

848
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,790
He is trying to keep you safe.

849
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,690
So, it’s true

850
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:21,150
that he can’t be too kind to you.

851
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,870
What about the sores on my face?

852
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,080
Is he also afraid

853
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,270
that you torture me?

854
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,470
That’s because your father

855
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,440
wants to

856
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,580
marry you into an ordinary family.

857
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,480
Then he’ll cure your sores.

858
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:38,270
He just

859
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,310
wants you

860
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,690
to live a peaceful life

861
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,020
and no longer

862
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,520
get involved in politics.

863
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,140
It...

864
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,440
It’s also why

865
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:53,900
he doesn’t want you

866
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,060
to marry Prince Qin.

867
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:55,660
Nonsense.

868
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,010
You just want me to save him.

869
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:58,980
How do you know

870
00:39:59,150 --> 00:39:59,950
his thoughts?

871
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,560
Your Highness.

872
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,350
I overheard it

873
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,770
when your father

874
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,400
talked to

875
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,900
your mother’s portrait.

876
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,650
Your Highness.

877
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:13,770
Your father

878
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,940
has never let go of

879
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,850
Lady Tianxin in his heart.

880
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,190
You are the one he cares about.

881
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:20,850
But he said

882
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,940
I disgraced him.

883
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,850
He didn’t allow me to save him.

884
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:26,180
Because he doesn’t want to implicate you.

885
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,060
You know

886
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,730
your father is an imperial physician.

887
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:30,850
It’s his duty to save lives.

888
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:31,650
How could he

889
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:32,940
hurt you?

890
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,230
What he said and did

891
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,100
was to keep you away from it.

892
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:38,230
No.

893
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:40,860
I don’t believe you.

894
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,600
What Lady Xu said is true.

895
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,300
Your Highness.

896
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,270
How do you know?

897
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:52,900
Your father told me

898
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,020
when I visited him

899
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:56,940
in the prison.

900
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,020
You really

901
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,460
want to marry Prince Qin?

902
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:09,770
I know

903
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:12,690
I was too hard on you before.

904
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,810
But what I said to you today

905
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,270
is all for your own good.

906
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:22,480
Because you

907
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:23,810
reminded me

908
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,350
of the previous shame.

909
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,140
So, I don’t need you

910
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,020
to save me.

911
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,950
I don’t want to owe you anything.

912
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,930
So I misunderstood him.

913
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:40,100
The only way

914
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,250
to save your father

915
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:43,990
is saving Crown Prince

916
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,020
and making amends.
