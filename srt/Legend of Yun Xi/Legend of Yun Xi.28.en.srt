00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,020
Episode 28

3
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,290
Your Highness.

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:16,640
These are the cakes Princess Qin

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,970
specially made for you.

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,760
Have they tried them?

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,510
His Highness and Her Highness

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,240
have left early in the morning.

9
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:29,680
Already?

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,119
What are they going to do?

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:32,800
His Highness said

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,550
Your Highness is going

13
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:34,930
to Buddha hall for meditation,

14
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:35,720
so Her Highness wanted to

15
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,470
prepare some

16
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,680
tonic pills for you.

17
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,260
That’s why she dragged His Highness

18
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,100
to the market for some herbs.

19
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:43,720
These two kids.

20
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,360
Just enjoy themselves in the market.

21
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,570
No need to think about me all the time.

22
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,510
Your Highness is blessed.

23
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,680
Her Highness is

24
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,220
filial to you in every way.

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,470
Madam Gui.

26
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,800
Go check on them quietly.

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,470
Let's see what they

28
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,600
want to buy.

29
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,100
I'm going to

30
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,760
buy them some.

31
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:05,930
Yes.

32
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:24,700
Feiye.

33
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,320
You don't have to beat yourself up about it.

34
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,200
You've been so good to mother all these years.

35
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,530
She's happy, too.

36
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:31,750
If she knew

37
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,400
you are not her son,

38
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,110
she'd be devastated.

39
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,240
But that doesn't change the fact

40
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,400
that I used her.

41
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,759
The better she treats me,

42
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,500
the more guilty I feel.

43
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,700
Biological or not,

44
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,650
your bond with mother

45
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,580
is unbreakable.

46
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,190
That's why

47
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,570
I didn't have the heart to tell her

48
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,650
that the real Long Feiye

49
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,570
had died.

50
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,320
As long as I am alive,

51
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,650
I will live as

52
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,490
Long Feiye

53
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,390
and do my best for her.

54
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:04,990
The real Long Feiye

55
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,110
would thank you.

56
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,490
Let's go to the store and buy her something

57
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,570
to cheer her up.

58
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,740
[Flowery]

59
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,400
Go.

60
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,780
Miss.

61
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,610
I did what you asked me to do.

62
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,030
Father, mother.

63
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,860
I can only

64
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,610
worship you in secret.

65
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,570
Today, the world is divided into three

66
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,700
and wars keep going.

67
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,990
Qinxi

68
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,780
has long been devastated.

69
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,610
I failed to protect

70
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,740
Qinxi’s people.

71
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,240
I apologize to you, father and mother.

72
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,280
Feiye,

73
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,190
it’s not your fault.

74
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,490
Brother,

75
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,190
we’ll win.

76
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,740
Father, mother.

77
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:38,950
In my lifetime,

78
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,200
I will

79
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,570
unify Qinxi

80
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,320
and let my people live and work in peace.

81
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,579
When the time comes,

82
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,990
I will come to

83
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,240
worship you openly.

84
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,700
Get the carriage ready.

85
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,320
Yes.

86
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,280
Feiye.

87
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,110
Feiye.

88
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:20,570
Tang Li!

89
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,530
Tang Li! Tang Li!

90
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,450
Are you all right?

91
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,610
I'm fine.

92
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:35,820
Tang Li.

93
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,150
Where is Feiye?

94
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,780
Aren't we going to the temple

95
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,780
to pay tribute?

96
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,740
Where is he?

97
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:43,780
He's

98
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,780
in the temple.

99
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,530
Already?

100
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,450
Why didn't you go to the temple

101
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,530
with him today?

102
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,990
I already did.

103
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,880
He told me to come back first.

104
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,780
He…

105
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,990
He is with Han Yunxi there.

106
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,360
My brother seems to

107
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,780
really like Han Yunxi.

108
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,530
Tang Li.

109
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,450
Do you really think

110
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,650
they're a good match?

111
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,100
Back in the day,

112
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,990
I didn't like her very much.

113
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,700
But ever since I saw her

114
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,450
risk her life to save my brother,

115
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,360
I think

116
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,900
she’s good.

117
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:24,860
Am I

118
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,480
not willing to risk my life?

119
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,750
I know what you're thinking,

120
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,950
but you can't

121
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:30,960
force feelings.

122
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,150
Look,

123
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,530
Ningjing chases me all the time.

124
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:34,490
It's no use.

125
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,110
I don't like her.

126
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,900
I'm not like Ningjing.

127
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,860
You're not like Feiye.

128
00:05:58,990 --> 00:05:59,740
Your Highness.

129
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,780
His Highness and Her Highness

130
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,780
went to the market

131
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,240
to buy some incense and candles,

132
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,950
and then went to the temple.

133
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,200
The temple?

134
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,320
What are they doing at the temple?

135
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,240
Maybe they went to

136
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,320
pray for you.

137
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,230
Get the carriage ready.

138

[Late Queen Xuanyuan]

139
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,070
Father.

140
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:40,200
Mother.

141
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,570
I’m here to worship you.

142
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,570
This is

143
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,360
my princess,

144
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,430
and your daughter-in-law.

145
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,530
Father and mother.

146
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,900
I have won

147
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,360
the battle of Xiqiu.

148
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,570
I hope that one day,

149
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,700
I can stop the war

150
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,530
and bring peace to the world.

151
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,200
I want to ask you not to worry.

152
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,280
I will try to cure

153
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,490
his poisonous Gu

154
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,280
and take good care of him

155
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,820
as his good wife.

You can’t go in.

159

It’s always me

160
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,110
who accompanied Feiye.

161
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,610
Why can’t I go in this time?

162
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,150
I’m just following orders.

163
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,950
Please don’t make this hard for me.

164

I’m going in today.

167

I want to see Feiye.

168
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,150

170
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,150
Let her in.

171
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,230
Forgive me.

172
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,530
Please follow me.

173
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:12,430
Your Highness.

174
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,530
Miss Mingxiang is here.

176
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,820
If you're not well,

177
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,900
you don't have to come.

178
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,700
Looks like since Your Highnesses

179
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,760
got Poison Master,

180
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,110
I can’t be much of a help

181
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,900
anymore.

182
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,620
Whether Poison Master can cure it or not,

183
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,900
Yunxi and I

184
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:31,990
will find a way

185
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,280
to cure your Beauty Blood.

186
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,070
But I’m willing to take

187
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:37,900
the pain.

188
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,549
I am a victim of poisonous Gu.

189
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,929
I know the pain when it happens.

190
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,990
I can’t stand by and watch you

191
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,030
like me.

192
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,530
But if I don’t

193
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:48,610
have Beauty Blood,

194
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,650
I'm of no value

195
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,820
to you.

196
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,150
Wouldn't that make me feel even worse?

197
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,900
Mingxiang.

198
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:57,780
Remember.

199
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,400
Even if you don't have Beauty Blood,

200
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,610
I still treat you

201
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,740
as my sister.

202
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,700
Sister?

203
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:13,740
Sister?

204
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,240
I should have seen this coming.

205
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,650
I see your point.

206
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,320
Baili Mingxiang has not seen you

207
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,820
as brother for a long time.

208
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,490
But I don’t have room

209
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,180
in my heart for anyone else.

210
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,700
I know you feel bad

211
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,950
for her.

212
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,570
So I will

213
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,110
find a way to make the cure.

214
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,420
[Late King Xuanyuan]

215
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:48,930
Your Highness.

216
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,820
You are so wise.

217
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,380
When the Crown Prince told us

218
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,860
that Dowager was investigating

219
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,150
Noble Consort Xiao,

220
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,860
you asked Gu Qishao

221
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,070
for some medicine

222
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,320
that gave you the similar symptoms.

223
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,400
Otherwise,

224
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,570
Noble Consort Xiao

225
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,740
wouldn’t fall so easily.

226
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,240
Noble Consort Xiao

227
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,200
is arrogant in surface

228
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,360
and seemingly ruthless.

229
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,570
But in fact she is timid.

230
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,700
Sending me poisonous cakes

231
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,490
after I was poisoned,

232
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,240
this is not

233
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,490
something she could

234
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,990
come up with.

235
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,530
So you mean…Second Prince?

236
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,530
I’ve never met him before.

237
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,360
But

238
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,410
King Tianhui puts him in important position

239
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,560
and Crown Prince is afraid of him.

240
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,030
So

241
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,860
he must get something.

242
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:45,280
Besides,

243
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,570
Noble Consort Xiao

244
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,100
committed such a big crime,

245
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,900
yet King Tianhui didn’t sentence

246
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,820
her death.

247
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:52,740
Putting aside their love as a couple

248
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,530
for so many years,

249
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,610
it must

250
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,000
have something to do with Second Prince.

251
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,780
Now that Noble Consort Xiao is down,

252
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,110
will Second Prince hold grudge

253
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,450
and do you bad?

254
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,480
Don’t worry about that.

255
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,860
This is the palace after all.

256
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,530
We should be careful.

257
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,360
Your Highness.

258
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,720
The wife of Xiqiu envoy

259
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
is here to see you.

260
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,180
Good, bring her in.

261
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:23,930
Yes.

262
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:25,850
Madam.

263
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,100
Why did Xiqiu suddenly

264
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,090
send an envoy?

265
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,600
Is something wrong?

266
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,700
You’ll know when she is here.

267
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,410
Your Highness.

268
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,800
A Xiqiu person

269
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:38,300
may bring close attention from His Majesty.

270
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,760
So we should be careful.

271
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,010
Madam.

272
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,350
I want you to stand guard outside.

273
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,480
Be careful, someone may be listening.

274
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,280
Princess.

275
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,780
Who is she?

276
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,400
Since she can be here,

277
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,070
she must be the wife of some high level official.

278
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,320
But when I was in Xiqiu,

279
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,850
I’ve never seen her before.

280
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,900
Is there anything wrong in Xiqiu?

281
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,920
Although I’m the wife of Xiqiu envoy,

282
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,200
I’m actually

283
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,740
sent by Crown Prince Jun Yizheng

284
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,990
to see you.

285
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,150
Looks like

286
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:21,950
you have gained

287
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,070
the King of Tianning’s appreciation.

288
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,000
But don’t forget

289
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,400
the situation of Xiqiu

290
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,610
and your purpose here.

291
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,330
I will never forget my country’s hatred.

292
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,360
King Tianhui’s research on the Gu-infected man

293
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,200
has paid off.

294
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,190
We must weaken Tianning

295
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,620
and keep messing with the government.

296
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,400
But,

297
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:43,860
as things stand,

298
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,330
the effect is minimal.

299
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,590
We can't wait any longer.

300
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:48,570
So,

301
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,780
the Crown Prince ordered me

302
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,740
to tell you to find a way

303
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,000
to poison Long Tianmo.

304
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,190
Let him be the detonator

305
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,650
and set Tianning off.

306
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,360
Alright, I got it.

307
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,000
I need two kinds of medicine.

308
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,100
Separately, they're non-toxic,

309
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,700
but when mixed,

310
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,460
they're highly toxic.

311
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,530
This medicine is available in Yaogui Valley.

312
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,030
You find a way to tell them.

313
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,190
Got it.

314
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:26,650
Qishao.

315
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:27,880
What’s going on?

316
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:28,740
Jun Yizheng brought

317
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,270
a message from Chu Qing’ge.

318
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,760
Chu wants two kinds of poisons,

319
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:50,700
Seems

320
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,720
there will be another disturbance in the palace.

321
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,020
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

322
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:00,700
Mother.

323
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,280
We think that when you’re in Buddha hall,

324
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,030
there’ll be much inconvenience,

325
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,700
so His Highness and I

326
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,360
prepared a good thing for you.

327
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,240
Mother.

328
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,700
This is a gift

329
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,860
from His Highness and me.

330
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,820
Please take it.

331
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,900
Your Highness.

332
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,700
This swan neck face-washing brush

333
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,360
is from the Flowery.

334
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,120
Wash your face with it.

335
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,490
It's mild and clean.

336
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,340
It's good for your complexion.

337
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,600
This bottle is made of white jade.

338
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,610
You’re very considerate.

339
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,490
I’ll take it.

340
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,240
Yunxi.

341
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,360
I need you to stay here

342
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,690
and watch them clean up.

343
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,680
I'll go check on Mingxiang.

344
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,700
Yes, mother.

345
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,240
Mingxiang.

346
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:42,650
Aunt.

347
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,610
I brought you some cakes.

348
00:17:59,280 --> 00:17:59,940
Mingxiang.

349
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,400
I know what you think.

350
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,820
Back then, I

351
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,450
wanted you to marry Feiye.

352
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,150
So you’re saying this

353
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,150
because you don’t

354
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:17,820
want me to marry him now?

355
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,110
They

356
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,070
love each other.

357
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,360
If you marry him now,

358
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,860
it would be unfair to you.

359
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,150
I don’t care about unfairness.

360
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,240
Silly girl.

361
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:37,950
A woman

362
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,490
must find a man

363
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,210
who loves and cares about her

364
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,900
to gain happiness.

365
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,860
I married to late king.

366
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,650
But I couldn’t even see

367
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:52,490
my own child.

368
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,780
I cried all day.

369
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,260
Do you know how heartbroken I was?

370
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,490
I can relate.

371
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:13,900
Mingxiang.

372
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,610
I am a bad example.

373
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,110
So I don’t want you

374
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,280
to follow my steps.

375
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,990
You deserve someone better.

376
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,070
Mingxiang.

377
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,110
I’m going to Buddha hall for months.

378
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,990
Come with me.

379
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,530
You’re there

380
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,940
to seek peace and quiet.

381
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,030
I can’t go

382
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,190
and disturb you.

383
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:47,700
Fine.

384
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:49,570
In that case,

385
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,570
I won't force you.

386
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,070
You know what.

387
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:56,950
There are a lot of

388
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,480
age-appropriate good men,

389
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,350
and I’ll take you to see them

390
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,070
after I’m back.

391
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,320
Alright?

392
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:08,820
Aunt.

393
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,320
I’m tired.

394
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,350
I want to go back and rest.

395
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,320
Alright.

396
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,400
Have a good rest.

397
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,030
This kid.

398
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,670
She has to get through this on her own.

399
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,860
Don’t worry.

400
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:48,350
Miss Mingxiang

401
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,570
will come around.

402
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,190
Let's hope so.

403
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,200
I can't believe even my aunt doesn't support

404
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,820
me being with Feiye.

405
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,240
Han Yunxi.

406
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,030
Why do you deserve

407
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,290
everyone's approval?

408
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,280
Why?

409
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,740
Feiye.

410
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,150
I’ll make Beauty Blood.

411
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,070
I will

412
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,190
cure you.

413
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:26,530
By then, you will know

414
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,240
who do you the best.

415
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,360
Feiye.

416
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,150
You're not getting any younger.

417
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,030
It’s time to have children.

418
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,150
You two need to try a little harder.

419
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,490
I hope when I get home,

420
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,650
I'll hear good news from you.

421
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,650
Don't worry, mother.

422
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,820
I’m leaving.

423
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,130
Take care, mother.

424
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,820
What are you looking at?

425
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,320
Why am I escaping?

426
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,900
I am his

427
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,530
wife.

428
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,610
It’s normal for me to have children with him.

429
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:38,530
Right.

430
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:39,820
Don’t be shy.

431
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,610
I need to face him bravely.

432
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,860
I’m going to cook medicine.

433
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,580
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

434
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,860
Stop.

435
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,690
I'm going to the palace.

436
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,190
Your Highness.

437
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,400
Your Majesty.

438
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,350
Don't stand on ceremony.

439
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,070
Have a seat.

440
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,320
Thank you.

441
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:28,950
Your Majesty.

442
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,130
I have found out the identity

443
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,650
of Prince Qin.

444
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,150
You don't have to listen to

445
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,400
those voices.

446
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,360
Prince Qin

447
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,490
is indeed

448
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,360
the son of the late king and me.

449
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:46,950
No doubt about it.

450
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,280
So,

451
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,900
you've got

452
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,450
solid evidence, right?

453
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,740
I would never

454
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,200
mistake my son.

455
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,460
The existence of Feiye

456
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,680
is the greatest blessing

457
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,240
given to me

458
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,700
by heaven and the late king.

459
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:15,700
That's good.

460
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:17,400
Then

461
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,490
I can rest easy.

462
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,370
Your Majesty.

463
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,860
I have one more favor to ask.

464
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,820
Please do tell.

465
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,580
Your Majesty and Feiye

466
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,460
are the sons of the late king.

467
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,110
So you are

468
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,360
blood brothers.

469
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,070
My son is stubborn

470
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,350
and doesn’t have worldly wisdom.

471
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:52,610
I hope,

472
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,360
as his brother,

473
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,700
you can look after him more.

474
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,450
What are you talking about?

475
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,280
Of course I will

476
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,950
take good care

477
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,330
of my younger brother.

478
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,280
Please don’t worry.

479
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,510
Thank you, Your Majesty.

480
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,450
I have other things to do.

481
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,400
I’m leaving now.

482
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,320
Take care.

483
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,990
Your Highness.

484
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:48,290
Your Majesty.

485
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:37,990
Seeing Consort Yi,

486
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,450
I don’t think she suspects the identity of

487
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:41,650
Long Feiye.

488
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,400
You can’t take

489
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,360
her word for it.

490
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,700
You need to be careful.

491
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,650
Han Yunxi

492
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,450
knew that Lady Tianxin is dead.

493
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,950
She is no use.

494
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,820
It's just that this girl

495
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,360
is so cunning.

496
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,190
I didn't expect that.

497
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,150
Mother.

498
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,280
It’s not your fault.

499
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,450
Since we have no evidence,

500
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,400
we can't just take

501
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,020
Prince Qin’s Mansion down.

502
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,610
I didn’t expect

503
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,990
Han Yunxi

504
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,150
could win Prince Qin’s heart.

505
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,070
So it seems that

506
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,780
the information she told us

507
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,170
about Long Feiye’s

508
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,360
windclan birthmark

509
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,900
is false.

510
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,400
We don’t have the name

511
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,490
to test

512
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:45,610
the birthmark on Prince Qin’s body.

513
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,010
We don’t want to alarm him

514
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,980
and make him raise his guard

515
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,820
or do other things.

516
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:54,250
Your Majesty.

517
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,450
We can’t wait any longer.

518
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:58,450
We need to hurry.

519
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,820
We have to find another way.

520
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,100
Your Highness.

521
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,240
Poison Master is in Heaven Pit.

522
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,900
That night, those men who attracted

523
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,630
Serene Chamber are from Beili.

524
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,990
Beili?

525
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:29,990
Go find the exact

526
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,850
identities of those men in black,

527
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:33,990
and

528
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:36,740
what they're hiding

529
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,860
in Tianning for.

530
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:38,820
Yes.

531
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:40,410
You may leave.

532
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:43,030
Yes.

533
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:55,280
Zhuyu.

534
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,780
-What are you doing here?
-Yunxi.

535
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,900
Qishao made

536
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:58,990
a new kind of love poison.

537
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,190
Would you like to see?

538
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,570
It’s fine

539
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,740
if you don’t want to.

540
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,610
But,

541
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,820
what a pity.

542
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:08,860
When Qishao made

543
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,110
the poison,

544
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,800
he thought you would like it.

545
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,860
That’s not it.

546
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,820
Alright, I’ll go with you.

547
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,490
Well.

548
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,230
Do you need to tell Prince Qin?

549
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,200
No.

550
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,650
I’m married to Prince Qin,

551
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:21,860
not being kept here.

552
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,240
Can’t I go see a friend?

553
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,820
Let’s go.

554
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,260
Your Highness.

555
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:29,610
Are you going out?

556
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:50,900
Feiye.

557
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,900
Yunxi went to Yaogui Valley again

558
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,860
to see Gu Qishao.

559
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,210
Aren’t you going to stop her?

560
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,000
She likes to study medicine.

561
00:29:58,990 --> 00:29:59,900
Let her go.

562
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,680
Chu Xifeng will be with her.

563
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,530
Feiye.

564
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,820
You have such a big heart.

565
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,490
Your rival

566
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,030
is coming to get your wife.

567
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,360
Yunxi is right.

568
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,190
You are such a cold stone.

569
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,650
I know what you are going to say.

570
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:22,820
You trust her, trust her!

571
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:35,240
Qishao.

572
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,200
I can’t believe

573
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:38,860
Zhuyu can bring you here.

574
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:40,450
Qishao.

575
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,570
Why do you sound so jealous?

576
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,780
What’s wrong?

577
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,530
I just

578
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:49,980
didn’t get much of rest.

579
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,000
Oh, right.

580
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,050
Here you are.

581
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:56,360
What is it?

582
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,320
I figured that

583
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,330
your medicine

584
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,260
is running out.

585
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,570
I don’t need it anymore.

586
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,490
But thank you.

587
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,550
You really don’t need it?

588
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:07,050
Oh, right,

589
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:07,650
how is your

590
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:08,710
love poison going?

591
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,530
Follow me.

592
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,530
Qishao took your Princess

593
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:16,590
to see love poison.

594
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,190
Do you want to taste

595
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,340
the new wine I made?

596
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,530
New wine?

597
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,950
Better than before.

598
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:26,240
Well,

599
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,700
I have to try.

600
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,700
The color is too dark.

601
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,320
The poison is not right.

602
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:45,990
That’s why

603
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:46,950
you’re here.

604
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,820
Help me study it.

605
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:50,790
You have taken

606
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,280
so many herbs from me.

607
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,320
Now it is

608
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,860
the time to pay me back.

609
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,110
You’re sick?

610
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,580
-Let me see.
-Nothing.

611
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,650
I had

612
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,380
a bit of a chill the other day.

613
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,450
I was too busy

614
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,320
to take care of myself.

615
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,200
Don’t worry.

616
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,490
You have

617
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:13,110
such a large field of herbs,

618
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:13,990
and you put your own illness

619
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:14,650
to delay.

620
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,090
Oh, right.

621
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,140
Where is Baisu?

622
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,470
I haven’t seen her for a long time.

623
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,110
She went home.

624
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:29,650
Let's not talk about

625
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:30,450
these things.

626
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,070
Zhuyu made some new plum wine.

627
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,100
Do you want to have a drink with me?

628
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,670
So you invited me here for the wine.

629
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,030
That’s good.

630
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,490
Then let's go get a drink.

631
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:41,020
Let’s go.

632
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:48,800
Drink while you can.

633
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,140
Here, cheers.

634
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,570
Qishao.

635
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,570
Are you in a bad mood?

636
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,740
What happened?

637
00:32:58,650 --> 00:32:59,400
Nothing.

638
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,110
Come on, keep drinking.

639
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,910
Don’t stop. Don’t stop. Come on!

640
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,150
If you don’t tell me,

641
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,210
then I won’t drink.

642
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,190
It’s really nothing.

643
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,980
Just some old stories

644
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:09,790
from the past.

645
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,820
These endless troubles.

646
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,280
No way to sort them out.

647
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,160
So it’s a relationship problem.

648
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,900
Yes, it is.

649
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,570
The girl I like

650
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,200
has a poison.

651
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,360
And this poison

652
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:29,060
is something I really want.

653
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:29,900
But

654
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,070
I can’t get it

655
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:32,240
or buy it.

656
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,200
So I have to ask her

657
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:35,950
to sneak it out.

658
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,450
But,

659
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,620
I don’t want to use her.

660
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,740
So, I’m troubled.

661
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:44,530
What kind of poison

662
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,790
makes you so obsessed?

663
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,380
I won’t tell you.

664
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,490
I was thinking that

665
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,700
if I have it, I would give it to you.

666
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,160
Now even if I have, I won’t.

667
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:00,950
Who is this girl?

668
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,570
It’s…

669
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,449
Qishao.

670
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:12,650
Qishao.

671
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:18,320
I’m not drunk.

672
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:27,870
If you like the girl,

673
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,860
then don’t always

674
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:30,949
think about

675
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,110
her treasure.

676
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,600
You have to chase her.

677
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:35,070
A good-looking man like you

678
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,000
can easy get her.

679
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,650
Let’s drink. Drink!

680
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,020
Drink, drink, drink.

681
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:45,900
Do you know which girl

682
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,989
your master likes?

683
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:50,070
Drink, drink.

684
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:50,699
Qishao

685
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,190
only tells this thing to Baisu.

686
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,489
I can’t keep things a secret.

687
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:54,489
So he won’t tell me

688
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,190
this kind of important thing.

689
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,040
Keeping his mouth shut like that

690
00:34:58,570 --> 00:34:59,900
is not really like him.

691
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:01,710
Whatever.

692
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,030
It’s getting late.

693
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:03,890
I’m going back.

694
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:14,710
Looks like

695
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,900
they have treated

696
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:17,890
Poison Master.

697
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,530
Do you think

698
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,580
Long Feiye can find Poison Master?

699
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:23,700
Poison Master is good at poisons.

700
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,950
Poison Girl won’t let Long Feiye

701
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,030
go face him alone.

702
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,150
I will ask her

703
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,260
to make new poison.

704
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,700
If she

705
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,450
isn’t in

706
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:33,820
Prince Qin’s Mansion for several days in a row,

707
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,860
that means she might be

708
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,190
go helping Long Feiye find Poison Master.

709
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,860
That’s a good idea.

710
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,070
Feiye is

711
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,320
still studying the Poisoning Manual.

712
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,150
Is there

713
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,500
any secret in the book?

714
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:18,620
[Chief Inspector's Mansion]

715
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,200
I’m Bai Xiaochuan.

716
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,320
Miss Mingxiang.

717
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,820
Stand up.

718
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,700
I’ve heard a lot about you from father.

719
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,400
Is there

720
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:33,930
anything I can do for you?

721
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:37,900
I want you

722
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,360
to catch someone for me.

723
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,320
Yes.

724
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,950
Are you going to

725
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:42,900
ask who it is?

726
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:45,110
I owe General a great debt.

727
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,400
Now you’re holding his token.

728
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,200
I think

729
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,650
it’s must General’s order.

730
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:50,200
So

731
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,180
whatever it is,

732
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,530
I will do my best

733
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,780
and cooperate.

734
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:54,700
Good.

735
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,030
But you have to remember

736
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,800
this has to be done in secret.

737
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,110
Keep your mouth shut.

738
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,490
Understand.

739
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,260
Your Highness.

740
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,530
Let me send the wine.

741
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,280
What if Crown Prince found out…

742
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,860
It’s better for me to go.

743
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:15,530
But…

744
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,360
Relax.

745
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:17,700
It’s not hard for me.

746
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,070
However,

747
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,280
how to poison His Majesty’s perfumes

748
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,110
and won’t get caught?

749
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,190
There are a lot of traps.

750
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,320
We must proceed with caution.

751
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:58,950
Ms.

752
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,240
I'll scout ahead.

753
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:00,950
Good.
