Episode 45

3
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,350
Qishao.

4
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,290
How is it going?

5
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,960
I suggest you take a break.

6
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,160
It takes time to find the cure.

7
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,600
Qishao!

8
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,600
Qishao, Physician Gu.

9
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,660
Come and have some.

10
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:58,800
Qishao.

11
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,300
Good.

12
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:19,680
Qishao.

13
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,140
You have to stop it.

14
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,510
Let me take you to your bedroom.

15
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,050
Come on.

16
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,350
Qishao.

17
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,360
Sir, please don’t.

18
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:50,970
We pin the needles

19
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,579
on acupoints of their heads

20
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,930
to control their mind.

21
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,970
These two are grumpier without the needles.

22
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,100
Good work.

23
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,800
It seems

24
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,320
we should find more people

25
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,720
with strong inner power.

26
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,990
But

27
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,200
we don’t have enough guiding medicines.

28
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,610
Why don’t you make more?

29
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,820
The herbs to make it

30
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,950
are extremely rare.

31
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,360
We can’t gather enough

32
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,690
in short period of time.

33
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,360
We can’t make the medicines

34
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,320
out of nothing.

35
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:16,780
Please forgive us.

36
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,570
How pitiful!

37
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,720
However, you need not to worry.

38
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,150
Just a few drops

39
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,200
of the blood

40
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:23,900
from the first generation of the infected

41
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,400
on a cut in one’s body,

42
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,450
he becomes a second generation.

43
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,200
When the transformation is completed,

44
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,490
he will share the mind

45
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,900
of the first generation

46
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,610
and listen to his command.

47
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,280
But as the medicine

48
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,560
and blood is diluted,

49
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,780
the second generation

50
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,570
may be much weaker in power

51
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,650
than the first.

52
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,740
Even so,

53
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,990
gather as much herbs as you can fast.

54
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:45,780
Yes.

55
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:50,300
[Glory Hall]

56
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:46,800
Well done!

57
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,070
Wonderful!

58
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,570
I’m so happy.

59
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,400
Step up the pace to make Gu-infected men.

60
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,110
Remember.

61
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,450
Find men with Kung Fu

62
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,380
as the subjects.

63
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,570
Yes, Your Majesty.

64
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,780
Your Majesty,

65
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,740
the herbs to make poisonous Gu

66
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,980
are rare in the world.

67
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,370
We can hardly gather any in short time.

68
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,610
But I’ve asked them

69
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,900
to work on it.

70
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,700
How many first generations

71
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,570
do we have now?

72
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:20,899
Your Majesty,

73
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,400
we have eight fully transformed men.

74
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,780
The rest is enough to make another ten.

75
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,390
Then the eight infected men

76
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,150
are precious to us.

77
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,220
Don’t send them out all at once.

78
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,400
At worst,

79
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,530
use the first generations

80
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,250
to make second generations.

81
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

82
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,950
Spread out

83
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,110
the plague.

84
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,360
Um...

85
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,320
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

86
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,490
Do you mean to…

87
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,200
I want my army

88
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,450
to be as strong as it can be.

89
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,190
Without me,

90
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,530
the people will have no peace.

91
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,650
One day,

92
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,700
those who make sacrifices

93
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,240
and their offspring will know

94
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,300
it’s worth everything they’ve done.

95
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,490
These are necessary

96
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,610
sacrifices.

97
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,280
Li Quan.

98
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:10,950
Yes, Your Majesty.

99
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,610
I want as many Gu-infected soldiers

100
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,570
as you can make.

101
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,110
Yes, Your Majesty.

102
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,150
Since the first generation

103
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,070
is so precious,

104
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,530
and we can use the blood

105
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,400
of the first generation

106
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,070
to make more

107
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,610
second generations.

108
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,700
Then we have to make most use of them.

109
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,990
I admire Your Majesty’s wisdom.

110
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,030
Li Quan,

111
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,900
send two Gu-infected men

112
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,760
to the capital and kill Han Yunxi.

113
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,740
Once she dies,

114
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,610
the Poison Master loses his last heiress.

115
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,190
The cure for poisonous Gu

116
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,240
will be lost, too.

117
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,240
By then,

118
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,700
not only will Long Feiye lose the woman he loves

119
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,430
he will also die of the Gu poison

120
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,110
in his body.

121
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,610
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

122
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,340
With the Gu-infected men army,

123
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,780
we should be

124
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,240
counting days

125
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,900
until you unite the world.

126
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,030
I would like

127
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,900
to make a Gu-infected man on my own.

128
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,400
I’ll get prepared.

129
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,070
Your Majesty.

130
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,460
[Glory Hall]

131
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,070
-Go get it.
-Yes.

132
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,870
Your Majesty.

133
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:22,990
Your Majesty.

134
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,190
Wash your hands.

135
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,350
Don’t worry, Your Majesty.

136
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,530
The Gu poison

137
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,110
doesn’t harm a bit on skin.

138
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,230
However, within the day,

139
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,020
please don’t touch

140
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,390
any other poisons.

141
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,390
Otherwise,

142
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,290
the part of your body stained with other poisons

143
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,250
turns grey.

144
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,290
Your Highness.

145
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,380
Shall we continue to feed him poison?

146
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,220
With three more doses,

147
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,490
His Majesty will show signs

148
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,560
of the slow poison.

149
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,840
At that time he will be ill.

150
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:32,960
Ma’am,

151
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,280
we’re so close

152
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,799
to complete our mission.

153
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:38,610
But

154
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,400
why aren’t I happy at all?

155
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:42,990
Your Highness.

156
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,850
We’ve drugged him for a few times,

157
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,240
We’re on a way

158
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,530
that has no return.

159
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,430
Your Highness,

160
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,620
don’t trouble your mind with it.

161
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,610
His Majesty the King.

162
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,570
Your Majesty.

163
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,530
Get up.

164
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,110
Your Majesty,

165
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,990
you came so early

166
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,820
today.

167
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,280
It’s strange

168
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,360
I often feel fatigued lately.

169
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,950
So I want to have some leisure

170
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:21,860
with you.

171
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,320
Lotus-seed soup?

172
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,950
Qing, get it for me.

173
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,360
I’m thirsty.

174
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:29,950
Your Majesty,

175
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,860
the lotus-seed soup

176
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,150
is straight from the pot

177
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,150
and very hot.

178
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,150
Why don’t we give it some time to cool?

179
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:35,780
Doesn’t matter.

180
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,740
Give it to me.

181
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,450
Yes.

182
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,670
Are you alright?

183
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,120
Your Majesty.

184
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,820
Don’t worry, Your Majesty.

185
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,950
The Gu poison

186
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,490
doesn’t harm a bit on skin.

187
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,490
However, within the day,

188
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,360
please don’t touch

189
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,610
any other poisons.

190
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,570
Otherwise, your body stained with other poisons

191
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,430
will turn grey.

192
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,450
Has the lotus-seed soup

193
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,400
been drugged?

194
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,410
Your Majesty.

195
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,200
Is everything alright, Your Majesty?

196
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,820
Yes.

197
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,530
I remembered

198
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,860
I had important affairs to deal with.

199
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,740
So tonight,

200
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,570
don’t wait up for me.

201
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,320
Li Quan.

202
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,450
Yes, Your Majesty.

203
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,180
Take the lotus-seed soup back.

204
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,010
I want to have it when it’s cool.

205
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,110
Don’t spill it.

206
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,200
Consort Qing

207
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,610
made it for me with love.

208
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:40,700
Yes.

209
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,540
Your Majesty.

210
00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:04,300
[Glory Hall]

211
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,280
Li Quan.

212
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,380
Yes, Your Majesty.

213
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,110
Take the soup

214
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,700
to the physicians.

215
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,900
Remember, do it secretly.

216
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:16,830
I understand.

217
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,360
I’ll see to it now.

218
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,860
Qing,

219
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,400
don’t let me down.

220
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,280
Qishao,

221
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,540
do you feel better now?

222
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,490
Much better.

223
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,280
Thanks to the Traceless Herb I took,

224
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,560
I could build up my health so soon.

225
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,360
Qishao,

226
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,150
my master was convinced

227
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,740
that poisonous Gu was incurable.

228
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,710
You’ve done your best.

229
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,320
I know it.

230
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,150
But I can’t give up.

231
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,530
I can’t

232
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,270
let poison girl face it alone.

233
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,740
I hear you.

234
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,950
But,

235
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:32,780
I’d rather

236
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,700
stay with Yunxi and His Highness

237
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,320
rather than

238
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,450
wait in vain.

239
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,110
If they need

240
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,570
any help from me,

241
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,400
I’ll give my best.

242
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:45,900
You’re right.

243
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,360
I was being obsessed.

244
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,450
I didn’t see that through like you did.

245
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,400
I was reckless.

246
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,030
Yuze,

247
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:06,110
let’s pack up and return to the capital.

248
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,750
I want to keep poison girl company.

249
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,430
No matter what happens in the end,

250
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,190
I want to stay with her for as long as I can.

251
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,150
Help!

252
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,190
Help!

253
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,950
Let me go!

254
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,150
Help!

255
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:44,850
Not good.

256
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,030
Looks like King Tianhui

257
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,650
has succeeded in making poisonous Gu

258
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,320
and in the meantime,

259
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,980
figured out

260
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,230
how to spread it fast.

261
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,650
That tyrant

262
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,030
is the cruelest.

263
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,070
He’s taking innocent lives.

264
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:56,740
Look,

265
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,280
Qishao, you’re not recovered.

266
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:58,950
You go first.

267
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,150
Let me distract them.

268
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,750
All right.

269
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:13,860
Kill him!

270
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,190
Go.

271
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:49,860
How strange!

272
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,820
We saw old people, women and children

273
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,740
along the way,

274
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,190
but seldom a man.

275
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:56,610
Perhaps,

276
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,990
they’ve been taken by King Tianhui

277
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,390
to make Gu-infected men.

278
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,280
Thanks to His Highness Prince Qin

279
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,700
who has controlled the state,

280
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,560
otherwise, more innocent people

281
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,190
would die of the tyrant’s torment.

282
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,990
When I break through Xijing,

283
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,190
I will chop the tyrant into pieces.

284
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,010
Your Highness.

285
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,500
Physician Gu.

286
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,740
There you are.

287
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:20,740
Great!

288
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,820
King Tianhui

289
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,280
has succeeded in making Gu-infected men.

290
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:25,900
I saw Prince Qin’s troops

291
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,560
marching in the city just now.

292
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:28,190
They will

293
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,300
save Physician Gu.

294
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,950
Don’t worry about him.

295
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,450
The backups have arrived.

296
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,450
I guess the border

297
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:36,950
will be safe with their guard.

298
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:37,490
Yuze,

299
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,740
go to the city with Traceless Herb

300
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,530
and help them

301
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,200
cure the infected people.

302
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,110
What about you, Qishao?

303
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,610
I need to go back to poison girl.

304
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:47,320
I’m worried she might

305
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,110
be in danger

306
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,150
now she’s all alone in the capital.

307
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,410
I have to go back to her.

308
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:52,860
All right.

309
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,000
Are you saying

310
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,650
that they can create a lot more

311
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,360
with just one Gu-infected men?

312
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,070
Yes.

313
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,500
Physician Gu,

314
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,450
is there a cure

315
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,780
for those infected men?

316
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:12,900
Not yet.

317
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,280
That’s too bad.

318
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,570
But it can’t wait.

319
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,150
We have to strike first.

320
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,320
Otherwise, there will be more and more

321
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,450
Gu-infected men

322
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,280
that we can’t defend.

323
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,200
Lieutenant General,

324
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,400
take your men and guard the city gate.

325
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,070
Make sure

326
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,450
none of the Gu-infected men escape.

327
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,200
Yes.

328
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:32,750
Physician Gu,

329
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,570
please stay here

330
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,200
and give consultation to the other physicians.

331
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,190
I need to return to the palace

332
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,590
and report to my brother.

333
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,610
Yuze.

334
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,730
What brings you here?

335
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,320
You cannot

336
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,190
control the plague without Traceless Herb.

337
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:50,860
My master, Qishao,

338
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,860
asks me to come and help

339
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,660
with the herb.

340
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,530
Don’t worry, Your Highness.

341
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,450
Gu Qishao

342
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:56,780
and Yuze risked their lives

343
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,360
to pick the Traceless Herbs.

344
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,900
And Yuze has been

345
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,110
gathering medicines

346
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,110
and toasting the herb

347
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,240
in the last few days.

348
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,920
I would like to vouch for her.

349
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,700
Now that you have Physician Gu

350
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,630
as your voucher,

351
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:10,440
I will believe you once.

352
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:14,030
For the sake of the people,

353
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,780
thank you, fellows.

354
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,650
I have to go back to palace

355
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,900
and report things here to my brother.

356
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,560
My friends,

357
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:21,700
see you.

358
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,420
The younger prince

359
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,470
changes a lot in just a few months.

360
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,570
Thanks to his brother’s guidance.

361
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,030
Your Majesty.

362
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,050
How is it going with the soup?

363
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,030
Your Majesty,

364
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,460
the poison expert says

365
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,190
the lotus-seed soup…

366
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,150
No need to hesitate.

367
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:58,710
Get it out.

368
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,950
There’s a slow poison

369
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,360
in the lotus-seed soup,

370
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,610
in small dose.

371
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,650
But cumulated in long time,

372
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,320
it kills.

373
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,610
Why did she do that?

374
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,650
She betrayed my trust.

375
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,120
Your Majesty.

376
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,790
Consort Qing

377
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,150
feeds you poison.

378
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,030
Besides she keeps close relationship

379
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,570
with powerful officials.

380
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,790
It’s likely she has her own clique.

381
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,620
Your Majesty,

382
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,820
do you want me

383
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:33,530
to arrest

384
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,150
Consort Qing now?

385
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,150
No, I have an idea.

386
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,450
What’s the progress

387
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,520
with my Gu-infected men army?

388
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,490
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

389
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,620
We’re making steadily fast progress.

390
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,530
Soon,

391
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,030
you’ll have an invincible

392
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,530
Gu-infected men army to fight your wars.

393
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:56,950
Good.

394
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,450
But remember.

395
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,860
The first generations

396
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,900
are crucial to my throne.

397
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,780
Find the guiding medicine rapidly.

398
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,150
Yes, Your Majesty.

399
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,190
Leave me.

400
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,650
Yes.

401
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,420
[Map of Xiqiu]

402
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,510
Your Highness.

403
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,370
What do you need

404
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,100
the map of Xiqiu for?

405
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,970
I’m figuring out

406
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,600
the best attacking route

407
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,760
to get my brother out.

408
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,180
His Majesty the King.

409
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,050
Your Majesty.

410
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:38,930
Your Majesty.

411
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:39,800
Get up.

412
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:44,890
Your Majesty,

413
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,550
a few days ago, envoys came from home.

414
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,180
They made me homesick.

415
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,100
So

416
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,820
I take out the map of Xiqiu

417
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,760
to relieve

418
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,660
the homesickness.

419
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,880
You’re the only woman I love

420
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,300
in my palace.

421
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,560
Back in the capital,

422
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,260
I built a new hall for you

423
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,270
modeling on your abode in Xiqiu.

424
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,470
Yet, you still

425
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:10,510
need something

426
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,470
from Xiqiu

427
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,010
to give you a sense of home.

428
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:13,890
Looks like

429
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,430
deep in your mind,

430
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,180
your love to Xiqiu

431
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,050
is more than that to me.

432
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,300
No, Your Majesty.

433
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,470
I’m married to Your Majesty.

434
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,360
That makes me a subject of Tianning.

435
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,030
I have no

436
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,450
other motives.

437
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,280
Rise.

438
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,570
Don't worry.

439
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,280
I’m just talking.

440
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,530
I understand

441
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:39,710
that you miss home.

442
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,320
I come today

443
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:44,110
with great news.

444
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:45,900
Great news?

445
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,860
What is it?

446
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,320
I have an army of Gu-infected men.

447
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,520
They’re unbeatable.

448
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,150
Whoever took my state,

449
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,340
I’m taking it back.

450
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,070
Then I’ll take Beili.

451
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:03,280
By then,

452
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,610
Xiqiu can be a partner state

453
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,400
under Tianning’s wings.

454
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,900
You and I

455
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,900
will govern the world together.

456
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,030
What do you say?

457
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,400
I…

458
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,530
I’d like to express my gratitude

459
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,270
on behalf of the Xiqiu people.

460
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,400
So,

461
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,430
don’t worry about Xiqiu.

462
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,110
I’ll settle everything.

463
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,840
Understood?

464
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

465
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,610
Pack up.

466
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:33,070
March out with me in a few days.

467
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,820
Yes.

468
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,030
Qishao?

469
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,950
Where have you been?

470
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,010
I went to Xijing

471
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,030
to find the prescription of the cure

472
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,030
for poisonous Gu.

473
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,030
I hoped

474
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,610
to find a way

475
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,510
to cure the infected men.

476
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:24,920
Do you know

477
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,490
the way to cure them?

478
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:28,740
Yes. I do.

479
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,690
Have you figured out the prescription?

480
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:33,450
Not yet.

481
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:35,950
I’m sorry.

482
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:39,530
But poison girl,

483
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,390
I beg you.

484
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:43,360
Please don’t kill yourself.

485
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,110
Please.

486
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,450
-Let go.
-Please don’t kill yourself.

487
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,930
Don't sacrifice yourself.

488
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,490
Don’t do anything stupid.

489
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,150
I have to save His Highness.

490
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,190
I know you do.

491
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,490
But look,

492
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,200
we can work out

493
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,260
another solution.

494
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:57,450
Don’t forget

495
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,320
you owe me four times.

496
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:01,990
For the four times you owe me,

497
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,520
all I’m asking is one thing.

498
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,240
Don’t kill yourself.

499
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:05,840
Don’t die.

500
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,650
Don’t, please.

501
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:07,580
I don’t allow it.

502
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,950
Just listen to me.

503
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,510
I’m sorry, Qishao.

504
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,900
I can’t.

505
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:16,950
Sorry.

506
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,650
Poison girl,

507
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,950
if you have to give up your life

508
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,780
to save Long Feiye’s,

509
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,990
I’ll go and kill him now.

510
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,200
Stop it.

511
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:34,210
If he dies,

512
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,280
I’ll kill myself.

513
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,450
If you die,

514
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,030
he’ll spend his entire life

515
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:38,690
in remorse.

516
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,240
In that case,

517
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,570
he’ll be like a dead man.

518
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,110
Think about it.

519
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,600
Is that what you want to see?

520
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,230
Doesn’t it hurt your heart?

521
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:50,450
Please.

522
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,650
I beg you.

523
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,820
Don’t die.

524
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,210
I can take you away.

525
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,780
Let’s leave.

526
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:00,830
Let’s leave this place

527
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,030
and put conflicts here behind.

528
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,070
Leave Long Feiye.

529
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,070
All right?

530
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:05,990
Will you stop it?

531
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,670
Go with me.

532
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,070
-Let go of me.
-Let’s go.

533
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,070
Let go.

534
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,240
No.

535
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,740
Let go.

536
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,650
Gu Qishao!

537
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,170
-Hurry.
-Let me go.

538
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:16,450
Let go.

539
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:17,990
I don’t want to.

540
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:20,610
Let me go.

541
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,070
Let go.

542
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,190
Let her go.

543
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:24,740
Let go.

544
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:26,470
Your Highness.

545
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:27,900
Gu Qishao,

546
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,360
you’re playing with fire.

547
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:31,280
Long Feiye.

548
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,610
Do you know

549
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,780
why we do this?

550
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,820
Do you know poison girl is…

551
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,450
If you tell him,

552
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,460
I’ll draw the blood from my heart now.

553
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:45,860
Han Yunxi,

554
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,450
am I invisible to you?

555
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,760
We have our little talks.

556
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,410
So yes, you are invisible.

557
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:54,110
What?

558
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:55,580
You wanna fight?

559
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:56,750
All right.

560
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,130
I won’t go easy on you this time.

561
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,450
I will not use force

562
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,780
in front of poison girl.

563
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,200
Let’s take it away from here.

564
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,310
Your Highness.

565
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:53,400
Your Highness.

566
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,330
You didn’t harm Gu Qishao, did you?

567
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,750
You care about him very much?

568
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,240
I told you before

569
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,360
he saved my life.

570
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,700
He’s a Beili prince.

571
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,740
He used you

572
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,490
to kill me.

573
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,400
He did all those

574
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,740
for her mother’s safety.

575
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,450
And he has cut

576
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,450
relations with Beili.

577
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:13,980
He’s not a threat to you now.

578
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,570
Threat?

579
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,130
He never was.

580
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,650
What did you do to him?

581
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:20,760
I killed him.

582
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:23,280
What?

583
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,750
He offended me couples of times.

584
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,520
Why couldn’t I kill him?

585
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:29,740
Do you love him more

586
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,830
than you love me?

587
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:31,820
Yes.

588
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,280
The first time we met,

589
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,480
you wanted to kill me.

590
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,420
However, Gu Qishao saved me.

591
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,360
The Dowager promised me to you.

592
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,820
But you refused to marry me

593
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,790
and made me a laughing stock.

594
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,450
When you ignored me because Baili Mingxiang

595
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:45,850
came back to the capital,

596
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,410
Gu Qishao gave me comfort.

597
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,390
You’re always mean to me.

598
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,720
Gu Qishao has always been caring.

599
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,720
My love to him

600
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,200
is deeper than that to you.

601
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:55,820
You’re my woman.

602
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,710
How could you think of another man?

603
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,160
Yes, he treats you well

604
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,730
and he gave you comfort.

605
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:03,730
But do you

606
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,110
have no shame?

607
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,280
No, I don’t.

608
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,320
Long Feiye,

609
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,200
you can control everything.

610
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,930
But you can’t control my heart.

611
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,530
Right, I can’t.

612
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:15,570
But I have control over your freedom.

613
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:16,570
From now on,

614
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:17,820
you’ll not allowed

615
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,820
to leave Plum Sea.

616
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:20,970
You have no right to do so.

617
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,110
As your husband, I do.

618
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,640
I’ve seen it through now.

619
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:26,900
Love and affection

620
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,280
means

621
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,240
nothing to me.

622
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:29,740
I’m going to complete

623
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,740
my mission.

624
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,000
I’m leaving for the capital.

625
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,640
And you’re staying here.

626
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,110
Tell me where Gu Qishao is.

627
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:38,490
I killed him

628
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,360
and left his body there.

629
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,150
You will not see him again

630
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,480
in the rest of your life.

631
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,610
Before there are chances

632
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,870
to implement my ideas,

633
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,990
you give up your love to me.

634
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,530
Han Yunxi,

635
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,490
isn’t that what you want?

636
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,450
His Highness has given up on you.

637
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,170
He’ll forget you gradually.

638
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:31,780
You should be happy.

639
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:42,900
In five days,

640
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,990
I can go pick Noxious Herb.

641
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,430
Your Highness!

642
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,970
Your Highness,

643
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,400
His Highness didn’t kill Gu Qishao.

644
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,160
He had small injuries.

645
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:06,360
What’s more,

646
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,890
Zhuyu is looking after him.

647
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,370
Don’t worry about him.

648
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,070
I know

649
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,130
His Highness wouldn’t do that.

650
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,050
Your Highness,

651
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,400
His Highness is about

652
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,800
to leave for the capital.

653
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:26,200
I mean no offense.

654
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,450
Although

655
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,200
he has some misunderstandings

656
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,190
with Gu Qishao,

657
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:32,860
as far as I know about him

658
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,260
in the years I’m with him,

659
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:35,190
he won’t be angry

660
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,150
for long.

661
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,450
So if it’s convenient,

662
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:40,740
would you please

663
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,800
go to His Highness,

664
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,200
apologize and ask

665
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:44,570
for forgiveness?

666
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:46,320
Perhaps,

667
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,090
His Highness will feel better.

668
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,160
Where is His Highness now?

669
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,340
Let me lead the way.

670
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,760
Your Highness.

671
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:13,900
What are you doing here?

672
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:14,930
Do we have

673
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,360
some misunderstandings?

674
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,690
If I did anything wrong,

675
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,700
I apologize.

676
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,020
Misunderstandings?

677
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:22,660
I saw it with my eyes.

678
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,790
It’s not misunderstanding.

679
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,060
For the last time, Your Highness,

680
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,950
Qishao and I are merely friends.

681
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,650
You have a very expanded definition

682
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,990
of friend.

683
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,280
Looks like

684
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,160
you never learned the virtues as a woman.

685
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,900
What do you mean by that?

686
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,770
I didn’t want to spit it out in your face.

687
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,120
But since you asked,

688
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:49,990
I’ll tell you.

689
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,530
You have no shame,

690
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,450
or virtues,

691
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,200
and you’re a wanton.

692
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:00,730
Long Feiye,

693
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:02,710
What do you take me for?

694
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:07,740
Han Yunxi,

695
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:09,930
let me be clear.

696
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:11,950
In the future,

697
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,250
I’ll claim the throne.

698
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,280
Given your low birth,

699
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,820
why should I let you stand by my side?

700
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:19,820
Don’t you worry about

701
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,530
Gu Qishao?

702
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,530
All right.

703
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,630
Stay as far as possible from me.

704
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,210
Let’s pretend we never met before.

705
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,190
I give you my word.

706
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,760
You can keep the Plum Sea.

707
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,150
From now on,

708
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,860
I’ll never step into it again.

709
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,030
Who cares!

710
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,070
♫ The knights will leave without returning ♫

711
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,740
♫ The love will continue next life ♫

712
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,450
♫ Enter the army, the seed of cowherb ♫

713
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,450
♫ The wick burns out, the fire dies ♫

714
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,990
♫ Fennel and angelica for a heart changing soup ♫

715
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:54,110
♫ Please have a taste ♫

716
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,110
♫ It keeps raining and my eyes get blurred ♫

717
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,400
♫ While the past gets clearer ♫

718
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,640
You saved Han Yunxi’s life.

719
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,210
I will spare you twice.

720
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,230
Yunxi is my princess.

721
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,840
If you get close to her again,

722
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,320
I will kill you.

723
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:15,030
Your princess?

724
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:16,780
Then will you

725
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:18,900
allow her to die for you?

726
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,720
Why will I let her die for me?

727
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,980
What are you talking about?

728
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:24,730
Long Feiye,

729
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:26,740
I draw you out here

730
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,150
to tell you

731
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:29,860
that the most important one

732
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,990
of the three poisons

733
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:32,780
she told you about

734
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,400
that can cure you

735
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,360
is blood from one’s heart.

736
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,360
Blood from her heart.

737
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:41,110
Do you know

738
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,000
what it means?

739
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,980
She’ll keep you alive

740
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,650
at the price of her life.

741
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,320
Is that another wicked trick

742
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,120
to turn Yunxi and I on each other?

743
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,110
I don’t know

744
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,700
you’d bury your head in the sand.

745
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,800
Do you dare not to face it?

746
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:58,400
Or are you afraid to know the truth?

747
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,860
Or do you deceive yourself

748
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:00,570
to stay alive

749
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,860
so poison girl

750
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:02,860
will draw blood

751
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,610
from her heart to cure you?

752
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,360
Shut up.

753
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:08,730
If you want me to stop,

754
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,040
you’ll have to kill me,

755
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,140
which is great,

756
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,030
so that I can die together with poison girl

757
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,490
as a couple who love each other.

758
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,450
Kill me!

759
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:20,490
♫ Play the song for you again ♫

760
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,700
I warn you.

761
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,780
Let poison girl give up her love to you,

762
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:26,150
or she’ll die for you.

763
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,400
She’ll die for you!

764

♫ Man has a heart while heaven doesn’t ♫

765

♫ When the clouds are gone ♫

766

♫ Leave the moon sighing ♫

767
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:48,320
Yunxi,

768
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:50,700
I’m sorry.

769
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:52,990
Forgive me.

770

783
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,560
Even if I gave up the throne,

784
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,550
I would never give up you.

785
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,820
You’re my woman.

786
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,880
How could you think of another man?

787
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,130
Yes, he’s caring

788
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,940
and he gave you comfort.

789
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,030
But do you

790
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,280
have no shame?

791
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:17,790
In the future,

792
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,080
I’ll claim the throne.

793
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,070
Given your low birth,

794
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,740
why should I let you stand by my side?

795
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,360
Don’t you worry about

796
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,200
Gu Qishao?

797
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,780
All right.

798
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,860
Stay as far as possible from me.

799
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,570
Let’s pretend we never met before.

800
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,330
Take this letter

801
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,100
to Southern Regions.

802
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,070
And this letter

803
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,020
to General Baili’s garrison.

804
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,190
Baili…Yes.

805
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:54,990
King Tianhui

806
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,780
has succeeded in making Gu-infected men.

807
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,280
We have to assemble the army

808
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,340
and attack Xijing.

809
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,030
The longer we stall,

810
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,530
the more Gu-infected men he will make.

811
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:04,740
It will make it worse.

812
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:06,110
Brother,

813
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:06,780
trust me.

814
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,240
The provisions for the army are ready.

815
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,450
Give your command,

816
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:11,700
and we can march out.

817
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:13,810
Your Highness,

818
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:14,750
Young Prince.

819
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,190
Her Highness

820
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:19,170
is living in Physician Gu’s.

821
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,400
Got it.

822
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,320
What happened to them?

823
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:30,870
Are you leaving or not?

824
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,670
I’m leaving now.

825
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,070
Southern Regions.

826
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,150
General Baili.

827
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:36,950
Southern Regions.

828
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:37,810
General Baili.

829
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:41,100
[Glory Hall]

830
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,400
Your Majesty,

831
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,020
the poisonous plague

832
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,650
in Qingshan Town and bordering areas with Xijing

833
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,820
has been contained by Long Feiye.

834
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,400
Long Feiye again?

835
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:54,860
What about the guiding medicine?

836
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,860
Have you found it?

837
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,190
Your Majesty,

838
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:58,990
my spies haven’t

839
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,150
sent back news.

840
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,320
I need the Gu-infected men army

841
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,450
as soon as possible.

842
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,190
Light a fire under it.

843
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,240
If you can’t find the guiding herb,

844
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,500
use first generations

845
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,320
to create a large number

846
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,650
of second generations.

847
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,700
The blood of the first generations

848
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,150
is limited.

849
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,950
Second generations

850
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,740
originated from the commoners

851
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,780
are weak.

852
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,780
And the poisonous plague

853
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,820
is contained.

854
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:24,400
On the mass production

855
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,930
of the second generations,

856
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,100
I humbly ask your second thought.

857
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,530
No commoners,

858
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,400
but we have soldiers.

859
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,780
You mean…

860
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,810
It’s the soldiers’ purpose

861
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,570
to fight the wars.

862
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:46,450
Your Majesty,

863
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,110
the Mus

864
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,200
have military control over Xijing.

865
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,650
If they disagree,

866
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:54,950
it’ll be difficult.

867
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,950
That’s why you have to be discreet

868
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:17,070
in spreading the plague among the soldiers.

869
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,740
Remember to increase the doses.

870
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,320
As to the Mus,

871
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,200
I’ll take care of them.

872
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,320
You can go.

873
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,530
Yes, Your Majesty.

874
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:42,610
Qishao,

875
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,710
are you alright?

876
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,320
What could possibly be wrong with me?

877
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,190
Poison girl, you didn’t believe

878
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,520
that I was killed by Long Feiye, did you?

879
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:51,490
Don’t you know

880
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:52,740
who I am?

881
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,670
Would I ever be afraid of him?

882
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,760
Don’t mention him.

883
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,240
You guys break up?

884
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,060
He mistreated you so.

885
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,740
Don’t help him.

886
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:04,520
I have to.

887
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,650
You two have no attachment anymore.

888
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:08,450
Why do you still want to help him?

889
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,990
I’m still his wife.

890
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,150
I can’t do nothing

891
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,010
and let him die.

892
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,530
It was my father’s fault

893
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:15,930
that he ends up like this.

894
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:16,990
I have to

895
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:17,860
do my best.

896
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,000
All right.

897
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,030
I’ll help you.

898
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:23,070
No.

899
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,420
I don’t want to owe you another favor.

900
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:26,680
Poison girl,

901
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,010
it doesn’t matter.

902
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,490
Listen to me, poison girl.

903
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:31,820
When this is over,

904
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,570
follow me to the end of the world

905
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:36,030
and let’s stay together forever, all right?

906
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,530
Once he

907
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:40,020
made the same promise to me.

908
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:42,200
And we break up now.

909
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,110
I’m not going anywhere with anyone.

910
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,920
I can have a happy life on my own.

911
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,320
Don’t punish me

912
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,780
for his fault.

913
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,230
I’m different from him.

914
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,530
Since ancient times,

915
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:54,780
men have been fickle.

916
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:56,280
Those men

917
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
are all jerks.

918
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:58,700
On the contrary, I’m the most caring man

919
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,780
of the century.

920
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:00,920
Don’t worry.

921
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,540
I’ll never betray you.

922
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:04,650
Really?

923
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,150
I promise.

924
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,860
This is the prescription

925
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,860
of the cure father and I made

926
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,990
in Yaogui Valley.

927
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:16,860
I improved it lately.

928
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:19,030
Though it can’t cure him,

929
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,700
it helps relieve the symptoms.

930
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,900
Take it for a year.

931
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:24,030
Maybe the poison can be cured.

932
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:25,820
Take three days

933
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,150
to make pills enough for a year

934
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,820
according to this prescription.

935
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,070
I’ll wait for you in Plum Sea.

936
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,070
Three days later,

937
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,320
come to me with the pills.

938
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,450
I’ll leave the pills behind

939
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:34,320
and go with you.

940
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,310
Why does it have to be Plum Sea?

941
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,360
My stuff is still there.

942
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:40,280
If I’m gonna leave,

943
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,140
I will leave nothing behind here.

944
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,610
Promise?

945
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:50,280
Promise.

946
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,280
Well, I’ll make the pills.

947
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,490
Qishao.

948
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,030
Sorry.

949
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,270
I have to save His Highness.

950
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,240
I don’t want you to see me die.

951
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,150
I wish

952
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,030
you could meet

953
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,280
a girl who loves you.

954
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,050
Your Highness,

955
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,190
Her Highness

956
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,610
is on her way to Plum Sea.

957
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:19,780
I asked Gu Qishao.

958
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:20,740
He said

959
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,530
Her Highness promised him

960
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:24,400
to meet in the Plum Sea three days later.

961
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,600
When they meet again,

962
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,160
they’ll travel the world.

963
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,190
He asked me

964
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,320
to leave them alone.

965
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,490
He was gloating.

966
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,650
These are reports on construction projects,

967
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:39,490
duplicates of account books,

968
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:40,450
state defense affairs

969
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,400
and household registry

970
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,320
of officials in the capital

971
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,280
from the Ministries of Works,

972
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:43,990
Revenue and War.

973
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:45,700
You don’t have to recite all of them,

974
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,780
but you do need to have a rough idea about it.

975
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,150
Therefore, the officials

976
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,990
would dare not to go over their power

977
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,150
and hide truth from you.

978
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,190
So many rolls.

979
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,900
When can I ever finish them?

980
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,760
There’s so many because you slack

981
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:58,740
on the learning

982
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,490
in the past.

983
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,890
When can you get serious about it?

984
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:06,150
Brother,

985
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:07,030
my future

986
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,390
should be in my hands.

987
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:09,200
It’s your business

988
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,110
to claim the throne

989
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,190
and govern the state.

990
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:12,740
Now all the officials are asking me

991
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,400
why you don’t take the throne.

992
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,150
I don’t know

993
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,030
how to answer.

994
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,970
I’m infected with poisonous Gu

995
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,650
and will die in months.

996
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:21,730
I won’t see the day

997
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:23,500
when Qinxi is united again.
