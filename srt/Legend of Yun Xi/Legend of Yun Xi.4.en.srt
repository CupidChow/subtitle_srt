Episode 4

3
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:04,670
Now you should leave.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,430
Let’s go.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,380
It’s our wedding night.

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,850
Where are you taking me to?

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:18,640
You…

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,600
You are Prince Qin?

9
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,970
Hurry, help me rest in bed.

10
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:35,680
Qishao.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,130
Are you the girl who broke into our valley?

12
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,720
It’s Miss Yuze.

13
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:53,800
Yuze,

14
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,300
go back to Gorgeous Chamber

15
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,470
after you get changed.

16
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,800
Take good care, Qishao.

17
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,550
I’ll take my leave.

18
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,350
Someone loves you, but you don’t love her.

19
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,150
Qishao has one more admirer now.

20
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,350
Now, what’s going on?

21
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,300
Oh,

22
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,920
it’s written on this paper.

23
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,100
Qishao,

24
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,300
is it good news?

25
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,930
I’m not sure if it’s good news.

26
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:30,890
Qishao,

27
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,100
we’ve found out what’s in the blood

28
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,160
that Crown Prince brought last time.

29
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,080
Since you show me this soon,

30
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,350
it must be a good thing.

31
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:43,640
The blood contains poisonous Gu.

32
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,680
Crown Prince was looking for a Gu-infected man.

33
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,080
Wherever there’s a Gu-infected man,
there’s Poison Master.

34
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:50,930
I’ve suspected

35
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,140
that Crown Prince and his uncle

36
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,270
kept Poison Master’s men in the manor.

37
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,490
But the place was well guarded,

38
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,280
and I wasn’t fully prepared,

39
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,800
so I didn’t act in a rush.

40
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,360
But I didn’t expect

41
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,760
that Prince Qin was also after Poison Master.

42
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:05,720
Qishao.

43
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,890
Prince Qin kidnapped the Gu-infected man

44
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,100
from Crown Prince,

45
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,890
but Crown Prince dared not tell the Emperor.

46
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,510
Are they hiding something

47
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,220
from the Emperor of Tianning?

48
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,460
The Crown Prince of Tianning,

49
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,180
Prince Qin

50
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,410
and the Emperor

51
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,670
are enemies to one another.

52
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,680
As long as we sow discord among them,

53
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,350
we can make them hurt each other.

54
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,310
Get me a horse.

55
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,950
I’ll go see Crown Prince.

56
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,930
Are you really Prince Qin?

57
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,090
Take off my clothes.

58
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,720
It was such a perfect opportunity,

59
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,380
yet I forgot to check his mark.

60
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,410
Your Highness.

61
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,760
Actually, you are not fully detoxified yet.

62
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,970
That was a wrong medicine.

63
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:35,640
What?

64
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:38,800
I just used the silver needles

65
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,350
to suppress the toxicity.

66
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,510
The rest of the poison will be discharged

67
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,640
only after you take another medicine.

68
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,680
If you don’t believe me,
try to take a deep breath.

69
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,800
See if it hurts a little two inches

70
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:49,890
below your heart.

71
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,640
So you mean,

72
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,560
you didn’t give me the antidote.

73
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,010
How dare you!

74
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:09,970
I…

75
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,720
I was afraid that you were…

76
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,260
I was afraid that you were

77
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,010
an assassin coming at Prince Qin.

78
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,640
So I couldn’t let you leave alive.

79
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,510
So

80
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,970
you did it for my benefit?

81
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:23,800
Of course.

82
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,810
Where’s the antidote?

83
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,580
Your Highness.

84
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,760
It’s a very rare poison.

85
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,550
I don’t have any ready-made antidote.

86
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,150
It takes time to confect one.

87
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,220
How can I make him take off his clothes again?

88
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,659
Your Highness.

89
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,680
The snake venom in you should be discharged

90
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,409
by needles as soon as possible.

91
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,440
Otherwise it’ll hurt you badly.

92
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,050
Now,

93
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,180
please lie down.

94
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,909
I’ll go get the silver needles.

95
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,350
Didn’t you say there’s no gender

96
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,520
in the eyes of a doctor?

97
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,640
Did I say that?

98
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,720
How come I don’t remember?

99
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,430
So many scars.

100
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,220
Where’s the mark?

101
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,790
What are you waiting for?

102
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,800
I heard

103
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,190
there was a carbuncle on your face.

104
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,460
After receiving the edict,

105
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,800
father feared I would bring shame on our family.

106
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,300
So he visited a lot of doctors

107
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,900
and got many precious herbs.

108
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,890
Then he finally managed to cure my face.

109
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:15,600
Really?

110
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,140
Yes.

111
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,680
You can ask my father

112
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,220
if you don’t believe me.

113
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,550
Do you know Mythical Herb?

114
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:27,710
Mythical Herb?

115
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:28,760
I do.

116
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,100
It’s recorded in Herbs Compendium.

117
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,510
It’s very hard to be found.

118
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,170
There are only a few on Mt. Ducheng
in the suburb.

119
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,100
You may go get some.

120
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,510
Really?

121
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,700
Why didn’t you get some back?

122
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,300
It’s really rare.

123
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,220
Very in demand and priceless.

124
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,430
I don’t need such stuff.

125
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,080
You’ve missed out on a treasure. What a waste!

126
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:58,909
Your Highness.

127
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,830
I need to do a few more on your back.

128
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,500
Your highness.

129
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,240
The doctor is here.

130
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,600
Why are you nervous?

131
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,010
Are you guilty of something?

132
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,350
No.

133
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,010
I was just scared

134
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,930
by that sudden voice.

135
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,330
Your Highness.

136
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,210
Your Highness.

137
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,230
Your Highness. Are you alright?

138
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,050
I’m fine.

139
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,610
Does my mother know

140
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,350
what happened today?

141
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,300
Your highness, don’t worry.

142
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,500
Her Highness doesn’t know you are hurt.

143
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,890
Go examine this piece of clothes
stained with blood.

144
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,050
Luckily, I’ve studied hard

145
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,930
on the Poison Scripture with my bracelet,

146
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,320
and found a detoxifying formula
for these two poisons.

147
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,760
Are you finished?

148
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,470
Hand the prescription to Xifeng.

149
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,300
I, Chu Xifeng,

150
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,140
bow in respect before Your Highness.

151
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:47,890
Rise.

152
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,640
Decoct three doses of medicine according to this.

153
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,140
-One dose a day.
-Yes.

154
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,390
Xifeng.

155
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,930
Let the doctors

156
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,260
check if this prescription is okay.

157
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,300
Leave us.

158
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:07,850
Yes.

159
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,470
Since you don’t believe me,

160
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,100
why did you ask me to write the prescription?

161
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,350
It’s late.

162
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,850
You can sleep here.

163
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,320
Tomorrow morning,

164
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,990
enter the palace with me to express gratitude.

165
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,970
We… We’re really gonna sleep together?

166
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:37,930
Well…

167
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,760
I’m not ready yet.

168
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,430
You can sleep on the couch.

169
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,800
So I will.

170
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,220
Princess Qin’s prescription

171
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,620
is much better than other poison doctors’.

172
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:04,300
And the quantity of every herb is just perfect.

173
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,220
Really?

174
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,390
Yes.

175
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,260
I can’t believe

176
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,140
Princess Qin is good

177
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,950
at detoxifying poisons.

178
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,010
Was the candle light too dim,

179
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,970
so he didn’t see me clearly?

180
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,970
Tomorrow morning,

181
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,930
if he finds that I’m the one

182
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,090
who saw his face that day,

183
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,720
he’ll kill me.

184
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:35,850
Oh, no.

185
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,600
I’ve got to take preventive measures.

186
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,800
I need to change the shape of my eyebrows
and my hairstyle.

187
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,640
Or…

188
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,980
I can paint a few freckles on my face

189
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,880
to distract his attention.

190
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,550
I can’t let him recognize me.

191
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,560
Why don’t you sleep?

192
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,300
I’m not sleepy. I wanna take a walk outside.

193
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,440
There’s curfew in this mansion.

194
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,580
No one can walk around outside.

195
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,730
Otherwise, the shadow guards
will kill you for sure.

196
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,540
Why are you still up then?

197
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,820
What did the carbuncle on your face

198
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,470
look like?

199
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,550
Why are you

200
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,770
so interested in the carbuncle?

201
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,100
It’s finally cured.

202
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,050
I of course don’t want to mention it again.

203
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,310
If you are interested,

204
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,200
go to Han’s Mansion and ask about it one day.

205
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,850
Catch them.

206
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,720
Han Yunxi,

207
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,640
don’t even think about running away.

208
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,010
Mom!

209
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,510
Put this on.

210
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,300
I order you to put this on!

211
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,180
It’s really you.

212
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,430
Don’t be afraid, Your Highness.

213
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,390
It’s me.

214
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:04,720
Who are you?

215
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,050
Your Highness,

216
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,640
I’m a maid to His Highness.

217
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,190
I’ve been serving him for over ten years.

218
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,600
Your Highness, you may call me Zhao.

219
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,610
Where’s His Highness?

220
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,010
His Highness is in the study right now.

221
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,470
He asked me

222
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,640
to tell you to wait at the gate of the mansion

223
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,140
in one hour.

224
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:37,430
He’ll take you to the palace
to express gratitude.

225
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,050
Great.

226
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,600
I have one hour.

227
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,700
So I can put on some makeup

228
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,380
to conceal my face somehow.

229
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:46,510
Madam Zhao,

230
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,350
I want to wash up.

231
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,680
Help me to tie up my hair.

232
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:49,720
Yes.

233
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,080
Your Highness,

234
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,180
this is the medicine decocted

235
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,300
according to Princess Qin’s prescription.

236
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,180
The poison doctor already checked.

237
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,180
It has no problem.

238
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,460
Your Highness,

239
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,390
the family

240
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,010
of the Chief Justice

241
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,330
was destroyed recently.

242
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,390
Many guards

243
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,010
saw you on the roof,

244
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,210
thinking you were running away after the crime.

245
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,550
General Mu Qingwu,

246
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,140
who’s in charge of this case,

247
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,000
once mentioned it to His Majesty,

248
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,540
even demanded to investigate our mansion.

249
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,870
His Majesty took your wedding as an excuse,

250
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,890
asking him to investigate from other clues.

251
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,050
By the way, Your Highness.

252
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,650
You got poisoned last night.

253
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,760
Who hurt you?

254
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,090
I didn’t expect

255
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,090
that the girl who stole my Poison Scripture

256
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,020
would take revenge on me secretly.

257
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,660
On my way back here,

258
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,530
another group of people tried to assassinate me.

259
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,450
Another group of people?

260
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,090
I think Crown Prince has known that I’m the one

261
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,390
who took away the Gu-infected kid.

262
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,230
What shall we do, then?

263
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,050
Keep a close eye

264
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,690
on Mu Qingwu’s investigation progress.

265
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,030
Most importantly,

266
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,950
find out who was the woman

267
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,090
drew me out on my wedding day.

268
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,300
Yes.

269
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,460
Your Highness.

270
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,200
Come here.

271
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,220
Let me take a look.

272
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,570
Are you alright?

273
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,050
How did you protect His Highness?

274
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,710
How could you let him get hurt?

275
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,140
Your Highness, please don’t be angry.

276
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,100
It’s my fault.

277
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:33,970
Xifeng,

278
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,260
leave us.

279
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:36,850
Yes.

280
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,100
Let me have a look.

281
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,360
Where did you get hurt?

282
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:44,970
I’m fine.

283
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,140
Guards told me

284
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,860
that you came back after midnight.

285
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,820
Why didn’t you come greet me?

286
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,890
Do you know how worried I was?

287
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,640
I came back in the middle of night.

288
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,970
I didn’t want to disturb you.

289
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,140
You were missing.

290
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,350
How could I sleep?

291
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,030
Sorry I was not thoughtful enough.

292
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,210
Please forgive me, mother.

293
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,030
Fortunately, you are okay now.

294
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:31,680
Feiye,

295
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,050
you wasn’t on the wedding ceremony yesterday.

296
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,850
When you enter the palace today,

297
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,930
you’ve got to cover it up.

298
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,480
Don’t let him take advantage of it.

299
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,760
And

300
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,740
what’s wrong with the Chief Justice?

301
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,850
Why does Mu Qingwu investigate you?

302
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,850
I’m wronged.

303
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,670
Mother, don’t worry.

304
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,820
I will find out what’s going on.

305
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,090
Okay.

306
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:56,550
Then,

307
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,090
get ready

308
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,020
and go into the palace.

309
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,740
[Grand Commandant’s Mansion]

310
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:12,800
Uncle.

311
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:13,930
How is it?

312
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,849
Long Feiye is extremely capable.

313
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,430
Those killers

314
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,220
not even one returned.

315
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,430
What… What…

316
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,510
What are we gonna do?

317
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,390
Prince Qin killed the Assistant Minister

318
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,790
through argument right after he came back.

319
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,540
And now, his ambition is growing.

320
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,350
He even kidnapped Poison Master.

321
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,180
But

322
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,050
he’s also got the goods on us.

323
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,800
He knows even if we find that out,

324
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,390
we dare not report it to His Majesty.

325
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,090
He’s gained the upper hand now.

326
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:53,640
No.

327
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,640
If my father knows it,

328
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,580
I’ll no longer be Crown Prince.

329
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:58,970
And you know

330
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,720
how cruel my father can be.

331
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,890
Uncle. Uncle.

332
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:04,850
Uncle.

333
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,930
You’ve got to help me no matter what.

334
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,300
what are you afraid of??

335
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,260
He’s just Prince Qin.

336
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,850
If you can’t even defeat him,

337
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,930
how can you take the throne

338
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,510
and be revered by people?

339
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,050
Don’t worry.

340
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:25,140
I took an oath before your mother’s deathbed.

341
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:29,020
I’ll protect you from being bulled
at the cost of my life.

342
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,730
I’ll figure out a way

343
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,180
to help you get through this crisis.

344
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,300
Uncle…

345
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,850
I’m afraid

346
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,760
that Prince Qin has suspected

347
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,090
it’s us who stood behind

348
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,540
the Assistant Minister.

349
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,940
Now, His Majesty also suspects us.

350
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:46,600
If

351
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,140
Prince Qin has the evidence

352
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,640
of our financial transactions

353
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,350
with the Assistant Minister,

354
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,140
then His Majesty

355
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,640
will kill us mercilessly.

356
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,010
So, he must die.

357
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:09,960
-I…
-I…

358
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,550
-bow in respect before mother.
-bow in respect before mother.

359
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,890
Rise, please.

360
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,430
Have a seat.

361
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,680
It’s said that Princess Qin has a carbuncle
on her face.

362
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,970
Looks like it’s a rumor.

363
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,550
Mother,

364
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,260
before my wedding,

365
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:30,010
my father managed to cure it.

366
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,600
Princess Qin,

367
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,350
you are so much alike Lady Tianxin.

368
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,840
Thank you for your compliment, mother.

369
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,850
Feiye,

370
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,850
I’ve given you

371
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,430
such an enchanting beauty.

372
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,760
You can see how much I care about you.

373
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,550
Mother, I know that indeed.

374
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,010
But I heard that you didn’t

375
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,050
show up before her sedan.

376
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,930
Is that true?

377
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,260
Yes.

378
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,550
On my wedding day,

379
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:04,210
someone drew me to the Chief Justice’s mansion,

380
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,010
poisoned me,

381
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,560
and tried to attack me.

382
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,100
Luckily,

383
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,150
I saw through their plot in time.

384
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:12,930
After I went home,

385
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,070
Yunxi gave me a treatment right away,

386
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,180
so I survived.

387
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,260
How could this happen?

388
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,850
Who harmed you?

389
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,720
That person had a mask on.

390
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,390
I didn’t recognize who that was.

391
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,930
No any clue?

392
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,050
I’ve been dedicated to our country,

393
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,030
thus have offended many mean guys.

394
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,950
I’m still investigating it.

395
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Find it out soon.

396
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,850
I gotta see

397
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,720
who was so bold

398
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,300
to assassinate Prince Qin.

399
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,500
Don’t worry, mother.

400
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,470
I will find out that person

401
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,390
to clear my name.

402
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,760
Now, go to your brother.

403
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,220
He’s waiting for you in the Qinzheng Hall.

404
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,760
Princess Qin, you can stay here

405
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,510
and keep me company.

406
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,040
I’ll take my leave, mother.

407
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,430
How is it going?

408
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,750
Your Royal Highness,

409
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,890
High Highness came back late last night.

410
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,090
He was badly injured.

411
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,600
When I treated him,

412
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,180
I saw his chest and back.

413
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,630
I didn’t find anything.

414
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:39,850
Back then, Prince Qin’s mark was recorded

415
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,660
in a secret imperial document.

416
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,930
But unfortunately, it was burned by a fire.

417
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,430
I can’t remember

418
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,970
where his mark is.

419
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,180
Help me

420
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,430
check every part of his body.

421
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,050
But…

422
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,350
Is there a problem?

423
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,760
You are his wife.

424
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,140
He got hurt yesterday,

425
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,050
so you must haven’t slept together.

426
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,850
Once you do,

427
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,720
you’ll find it out.

428
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,480
I’m afraid His Highness
won’t lower his guard down easily.

429
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,050
I’m not that patient.

430
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,470
I’ll give you one month at most.

431
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,430
One month?

432
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,050
What?

433
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,410
You don’t want to see your mom
as soon as possible?

434
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,300
But Prince Qin doesn’t trust me.

435
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,930
I’m afraid

436
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:34,930
a month…

437
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,930
I believe

438
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,260
you’ll find a way.

439
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,230
You walked out of the sedan
and married Prince Qin,

440
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:45,140
even detoxified him.

441
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,970
What you’ve accomplished so far

442
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,430
has gone far beyond

443
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,090
my expectations.

444
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,680
I don’t care what you are going to do,

445
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,600
but you must find out

446
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,930
whether there’s a windclan tattoo

447
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,850
on his body in a month.

448
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,860
The sooner you finish the mission,

449
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,100
the quicker you can see your mom.

450
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,050
Understand?

451
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:15,510
Yes.

452
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,100
You may leave.

453
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,100
Yes.

454
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,010
Feiye,

455
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,390
most of the memorials are against you.

456
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,640
There’s been bad blood between you
and Chief Justice.

457
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,550
That day,

458
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,540
you were on the roof
of the Chief Justice’s mansion.

459
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,600
You said someone drew you there.

460
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,170
Do you have any proof?

461
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,930
I’m still investigating.

462
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,640
That’s to say

463
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,990
you don’t have any proof yet.

464
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,850
Brother, do you also think

465
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,550
it’s me who killed him?

466
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,960
You are my brother by blood.

467
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,370
I won’t believe that you’d kill

468
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:26,050
any major minister for personal grudges.

469
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,140
But Chief Justice and His Lord were good friends.

470
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,390
I don’t know how

471
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,050
to explain it to him.

472
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,220
I will give Your Majesty an explanation.

473
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:39,850
Good.

474
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,300
I believe you.

475
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,220
But do it quick.

476
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,430
Don’t make any trouble again.

477
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,500
Thank you for your trust, Your Majesty.

478
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,140
But do I need to help

479
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,800
General Mu with his investigation?

480
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,600
No need.

481
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,720
Just focus on your own matter.

482
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,050
Besides,

483
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,850
you just got married.

484
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,010
Try to spend more time with Princess Qin.

485
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:09,250
Thank you, Your Majesty.

486
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,940
General Mu, please investigate the case thoroughly

487
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,850
to clear my name.

488
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,300
I’ll spare no effort.

489
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:20,930
Your Majesty,

490
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,090
I’ll take my leave then.

491
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,300
Qingwu.

492
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,110
Yes, Your Majesty.

493
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,920
This thing is very important.

494
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,100
You’ve got

495
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,680
to find out the truth.

496
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:51,970
Remember.

497
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,370
A royal shall be punished

498
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,010
like a civilian if he commits a crime.

499
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,600
Don’t let any misgiving stop you.

500
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,640
I’ll back you up.

501
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

502
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,350
I believe you’ll find a way.

503
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:12,220
You walked out of the sedan
and married Prince Qin,

504
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,680
even detoxified him.

505
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,970
What you’ve accomplished so far

506
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:18,030
has gone far beyond my expectations.

507
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:20,260
I don’t care what you are going to do,

508
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,720
but you must find out

509
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:22,890
whether there’s a windclan tattoo

510
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,890
on his body in a month.

511
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,220
The sooner you finish the mission,

512
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,390
the quicker you can see your mom.

513
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,680
Understand?

514
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,850
Who are you?

515
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,220
How come you don’t kneel before me?

516
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,430
I’m Princess Qin.

517
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,510
You are Princess Qin?

518
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,260
Look at you.

519
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,530
You want to steal him from Mingxiang?

520
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,600
You had a carbuncle on your face, didn’t you?

521
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,470
It’s been cured.

522
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,050
I heard you tried very hard

523
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,050
to marry Prince Qin.

524
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,090
The auspicious time had passed,

525
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,430
yet you walked out of the sedan

526
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,430
and finished the ceremony by yourself.

527
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,430
That

528
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,700
didn’t count as an official wedding.

529
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:22,470
How can you call yourself Princess Qin?

530
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,180
Princess, my marriage was granted

531
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,970
by Empress Dowager and His Majesty.

532
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,890
You don’t admit I’m Princess Qin,

533
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,890
so you are denying His Majesty’s edict?

534
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:32,550
How dare you

535
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,050
to slander me!

536
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:34,850
Maid.

537
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,550
Slap her.

538
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:37,550
Yes.

539
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,260
Madam.

540
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:49,890
Hold her!

541
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,300
I’ll slap her myself!

542
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:52,760
-Yes.
-Yes.

543
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,200
Your Highness! Your Highness!

544
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,500
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

545
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,050
-Go!
-Go help her!

546
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,140
Your Highness, are you alright?

547
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,630
-Help!
-Your Highness!

548
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,820
-Help!
-Are you okay? Your Highness!

549
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,390
Your Highness! Be careful!

550
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,210
Your Highness!

551
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,390
Uncle!

552
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,970
This vile maid insulted me!

553
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:13,300
She pushed me into the water!

554
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,260
What did you call her?

555
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,010
Vile maid!

556
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:15,950
Say that again?

557
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,890
Au… Aunt.

558
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,510
And?

559
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:31,260
Aunt, it’s my fault.

560
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:33,640
I…

561
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,640
I was wrong as well.

562
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,210
Let’s go.

563
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,720
Prince Qin scolded Princess Changbing

564
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,970
in public.

565
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,470
He’s obviously belittling me.

566
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,220
Your Majesty, please calm down.

567
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,550
After all, Prince Qin

568
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,520
is Princess Changbing’s uncle.

569
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,260
It accords with seniority

570
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,850
for a uncle to scold his niece.

571
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:09,850
But,

572
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:13,360
Prince Qin’s behavior
was indeed a little improper.

573
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:16,640
After all, Princess Changbing is noble

574
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,930
royal member,

575
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:21,390
and she’s the apple of Your Majesty’s eyes.

576
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,320
That’s not what I care about.

577
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,430
I mean,

578
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,430
the rumor said Han Yunxi

579
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,910
was known as an ugly woman

580
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,980
with carbuncles all over her face.

581
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,850
How come she’s changed

582
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:36,670
after she married Prince Qin?

583
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:39,300
Was the rumor wrong?

584
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,600
Your Majesty.

585
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:44,180
I heard before Han Yunxi got married,

586
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,800
Physician Han found a rare herb

587
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,550
and cured her carbuncles.

588
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,220
Who would know

589
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,970
that she’s actually a beauty

590
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,640
after the carbuncles were removed.

591
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,890
While Prince Qin is still young,

592
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,090
he may be attracted to her beauty,

593
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,800
so he favors her a lot.

594
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:03,220
But it’s not the reason

595
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:06,010
why he looks down upon Princess Changbing.

596
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,090
So is it because he’s Prince Qin?

597
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:18,510
Prince Qin’s power is given by Your Majesty.

598
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:20,930
No matter how capable he is,

599
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,260
he has to listen

600
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,390
to Your Majesty in everything.

601
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,890
Then, tell me,

602
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:32,050
why Prince Qin is so condescending?

603
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,260
I’m dim-witted…

604
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,100
Answer me.

605
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:40,010
Maybe because Your Majesty is merciful.

606
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,510
And to Prince Qin, Your Majesty…

607
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,800
Be honest.

608
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,300
Prince Qin is second

609
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,600
to Your Majesty in the court.

610
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:52,710
He also has military leadership.

611
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,100
That’s why

612
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:56,680
he is arrogant and overweening.

613
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,140
You are right.

614
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:01,620
It’s all because of the military leadership.

615
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,230
Your Majesty,

616
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:09,610
do you want Prince Qin
to hand out military leadership?

617
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,100
I’m afraid it can’t be done

618
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,510
just in a couple of days.

619
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:13,600
Soon.

620
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,600
He will hand it out on his own.

621
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,340
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

622
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,010
From now on,

623
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,550
you can live in Pavilion of Leisure.

624
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,550
Why?

625
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,220
Do you really want to live with me?

626
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,010
I…

627
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,570
Go ask Madam Zhao

628
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,680
to pack up for you.

629
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,370
Your Highness.

630
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,610
Don’t drive me out.

631
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,470
Your wound hasn’t been cured yet.

632
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,870
I can help you to recover.

633
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,720
I’ve got poison doctors.

634
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,980
I don’t need your help.

635
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,050
I…

636
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,600
When you are tired,

637
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,960
I can give you acupuncture and massage.

638
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,090
In bed?

639
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,670
What are you talking about?

640
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,800
If you want to stay, go lie in bed.

641
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,470
If not, move to Pavilion of Leisure.

642
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:19,970
It’s up to you.

643
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:24,930
Fine.

644
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,090
Give me a minute.

645
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,390
This medicine is for you.

646
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,320
I confected it especially for you.

647
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,430
Use it when you take a bath

648
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:42,030
to nurture your vitality
and stimulate your blood circulation.

649
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,230
Don’t forget to use it.

650
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,460
Your Highness.

651
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,800
It seems that the case regarding Chief Justice

652
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,550
has settled down.

653
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,300
It’s just the beginning.

654
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:16,760
Ask someone

655
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:19,350
to send this message to General Baili.

656
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,219
Yes.

657
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,550
Have you found out anything

658
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,030
about the woman who drew me out?

659
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:31,929
I’ve thoroughly searched the place

660
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:33,260
where you got poisoned,

661
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,090
but they did it quick and clean,

662
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:37,969
without leaving any trace.

663
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,639
But, don’t worry, Your Highness,

664
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,800
I will dig deeper into it.

665
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:44,179
Han Yunxi gave me

666
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:45,909
this herbal medicine for bath.

667
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:49,510
Ask the poison doctors to check it.

668
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,370
Your Highness,

669
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,389
are you

670
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,970
suspecting that Princess Qin

671
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,100
is a spy sent by Empress Dowager?

672
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,290
Usually, if we find a spy,

673
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,350
we’d just kill him or her.

674
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,600
But if Princess Qin is a spy this time,

675
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:13,850
then…

676
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,680
I’m so screwed.

677
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,300
Now I can’t even see Prince Qin.

678
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,110
How am I supposed

679
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,180
to check the windclan tattoo on him?

680
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,510
Madam Zhao, let me.

681
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,850
No. No.

682
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,180
I used to be a maid in Han’s Mansion.

683
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,180
I like keeping myself busy.

684
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:45,840
Let me do it.

685
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,680
It’s not proper.

686
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,090
Madam Zhao,

687
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,180
does His Highness have any hobby?

688
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,010
His Highness is a little aloof.

689
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,930
He only likes

690
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:02,650
reading, practicing Kung Fu and drinking tea,

691
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,970
nothing else.

692
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,680
When does he take a bath?

693
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:10,300
Your Highness, why do you ask that?

694
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,230
You may not know,

695
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,140
but His Highness got poisoned a few days ago.

696
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,270
There’s still some poison in his body.

697
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:19,010
Though it won’t hurt his health,

698
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,930
it’d better be discharged as soon as possible,

699
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:21,760
right?

700
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,180
I gave him a bag of herbs today.

701
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,510
But I’m afraid he won’t use it.

702
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,970
So I want to go check on him.

703
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:32,390
His Highness always sticks to a routine.

704
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,720
He takes a bath at 7:00 p.m. every day.

705
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,980
Thank you, Madam Zhao.

706
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:41,250
Your Highness, don’t mention it.

707
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:43,300
It’s all for His Highness’ benefit.

708
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,090
His Highness will know
how much you care about him

709
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,720
and let you move back.

710
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,390
7:00 p.m.

711
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:07,100
[Qinzheng Hall]

712
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:22,800
Your Majesty.

713
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,300
Mother.

714
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,360
What are you thinking about?

715
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,430
I’m thinking

716
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:30,890
about the marriage alliance

717
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:33,010
proposed by Xiqiu State.

718
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,810
Marriage alliance?

719
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,230
The King of Xiqiu

720
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:39,180
died in the war.

721
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:42,390
Their Crown Prince took the throne.

722
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:45,680
Chu Qingge is the new King’s sister by blood.

723
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,760
With their uncle coveting the throne,

724
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,720
they can’t put the officials

725
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:54,090
under control.

726
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,680
Under the circumstances,
they came up with this idea.

727
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,850
I’m afraid they want to use my power

728
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,300
to steady Xiqiu.

729
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:05,180
So,

730
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,050
what are you going to do?

731
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,090
The defeated Xiqiu is not a threat.

732
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,140
But she must pay if she wants

733
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,220
to use my power.

734
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:20,760
In return,

735
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,350
I’ll infiltrate into Xiqiu’s forces.

736
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,640
Xiqiu is famous in Continent Yunchuan

737
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,260
for training warhorses.

738
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,430
By then, my army

739
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,640
will become much more powerful.

740
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,300
This world

741
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:39,510
will eventually belong to us.

742
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,390
Your Majesty is wise and ambitious.

743
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,470
I’m so proud of you.

744
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:46,260
So,

745
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:50,550
Chu Qingge will be married off to Tianmo?

746
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,210
Crown Prince is still young

747
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,550
and ignorant.

748
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,970
I heard Chu Qingge is beautiful and talented.

749
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,090
She also assists her brother as a princess.

750
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,010
I’m afraid she’s not an ordinary woman.

751
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,520
Crown Prince can’t contain her.

752
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,310
While Prince Qin is powerful already.

753
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,260
If he allies with Xiqiu,

754
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:17,050
he’ll become uncontrollable.

755
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:19,390
By then, I won’t be able to defeat him.

756
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:22,070
So, after thinking about it,

757
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:25,470
I should be the one to marry her.

758
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:39,870
Your Highness.

759
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,300
The medicine from Princess Qin

760
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,720
has been checked by imperial doctors

761
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,600
and poison doctors.

762
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,600
It has no problem.

763
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:47,260
They even praised

764
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,540
for such a perfect prescription.

765
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:50,470
If you

766
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,200
take a bath with it every day,

767
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,890
it’ll nurture your vitality

768
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:55,150
and make you stronger,

769
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,680
as well as improve your Kung Fu skills.

770
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,930
The imperial doctors said

771
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:02,100
the prescription included astragalus,

772
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,360
codonopsis pilosula,

773
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,680
lucid ganoderma,

774
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,010
fructus cnidii,

775
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,180
and…

776
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:41,010
Princess Qin wants to take a bath
with His Highness.

777
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,070
Why try to stop her?

778
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,180
She won’t hurt His Highness.
