Episode 39

3
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:04,390
Yuze.

4
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:05,720
Now we are

5
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:06,930
no longer under the control of Beili.

6
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,800
You don’t need to complete any task anymore.

7
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:10,220
You are free now.

8
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:11,890
So you should

9
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,050
live your own life.

10
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,300
My life is being with you.

11
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:17,430
I’m no longer

12
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,180
your master.

13
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,010
Take me as

14
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,390
your friend.

15
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:24,550
I probably

16
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,760
can’t protect you, you know?

17
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,760
I don’t need you to protect me.

18
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:28,600
Yuze.

19
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,350
It’s really dangerous.

20
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,259
You don’t need to go on an adventure with me.

21
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,140
I’m not afraid of death

22
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,390
nor the dangers.

23
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:36,640
Qishao,

24
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:38,600
I have nowhere to go.

25
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,680
If even you don’t want me to be with you,

26
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,470
it’s no difference
between being alive and dead for me.

27
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,090
Yuze.

28
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,760
Is this your only decision?

29
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,220
Don’t worry.

30
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,680
I won’t be a burden to you.

31
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,180
That’s not what I mean, you know?

32
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:54,600
Okay.

33
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,620
[Southern Regions Bureau]

34
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,680
Thank you.

35
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:04,849
It’s very kind of you.

36
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,930
Thank you very much for saving us.

37
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,220
Thank you for your help.

38
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,300
Thank you.

39
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,100
Prince Qin is here.

40
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,100
Prince Qin is here.

41
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,680
Thank you, Your Highness!

Thank you, Your Highness!

Thank you, Your Highness!

47
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,890
Long Feiye.

48
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,430
You really did a better job than I expect.

49
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,970
This time when you went to the Southern Regions,

50
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,100
you were not infected with the poisonous plague,

51
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,890
but even respected and supported by the people,

52
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,600
and praised by the officers.

53
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,260
Li Quan.

54
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:30,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

55
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,010
You didn’t leave any clue

56
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,550
in the Southern Regions,

57
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,640
did you?

58
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,300
Your Majesty.

59
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,550
Definitely no.

60
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,470
General Mu Qingwu is asking for coming in.

61
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,260
Call him in!

62
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,680
Your Majesty!

63
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,300
Rise!

64
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,550
Mu.

65
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,430
You’ve made undeniable contributions

66
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,390
to save the people in the Southern Regions

67
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,640
from the terrible suffering.

68
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,760
That’s my duty.

69
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,470
It’s lucky for the help

70
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,510
of Prince Qin.

71
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,260
I know it.

72
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,010
Prince Qin made great contributions

73
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,850
to control the plague.

74
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,260
I will award everyone

75
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,050
according to their contributions,

76
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,100
including the soldiers and generals.

77
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:35,930
Qingwu.

78
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,600
Tell me

79
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,260
who the officers and generals are

80
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,720
making great efforts

81
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,510
in the Southern Regions.

82
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,300
Your Majesty, I’m afraid it’s unnecessary.

83
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,220
What do you mean by that?

84
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,890
After the breakout of the plague,

85
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,350
most of the local officers

86
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,180
were mortally afraid

87
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,550
of being infected.

88
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,850
Those who can avoid it

89
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,220
have kept away from it.

90
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:04,800
Those who cannot

91
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,100
were just pretending compliance.

92
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:08,640
That,

93
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,550
made Prince Qin very angry.

94
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,720
How dare they?

95
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,430
What about the soldiers?

96
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,600
Over a half

97
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,300
of them were infected.

98
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,470
It’s lucky

99
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,720
that they are stronger.

100
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,350
Now they are all fine.

101
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:26,850
By the way,

102
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,890
Prince Qin treated the officers, soldiers

103
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,050
and ordinary people equally.

104
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,890
Most of the time,

105
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,680
the dying ordinary people

106
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,970
had the priority to be treated.

107
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,050
I see.

108
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,180
Qingwu.

109
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,680
Go back

110
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,640
and take a rest.

111
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:53,510
Yes.

112
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:54,720
Your Majesty.

113
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:06,930
Your Majesty.

114
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,180
Is General Mu Qingwu reliable?

115
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,100
The Mu family has been loyal

116
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,720
to my clan through the ages.

117
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,890
They are the most reliable people.

118
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,550
I took risks to poison

119
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,680
in the Southern Regions

120
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,430
for the purpose of

121
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,140
testing Long Feiye’s relationship

122
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,930
with the officers and men there

123
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,010
except for realizing my final plan.

124
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,930
It seems

125
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,050
they are not close.

126
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,180
I can feel relived in this case.

127
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,680
But Prince Qin

128
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,180
is now accepted

129
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,850
by the people there.

130
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:44,720
Your Majesty!

131
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,760
The next plan…

132
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,010
Long Feiye.

133
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,350
You forced me to do that.

134
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,430
Tianhui

135
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,350
took the ordinary people’s life

136
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,100
to make a test.

137
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,600
I will surely make him

138
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,970
pay for it.

139
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:14,470
Tang Li.

140
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,220
Are you ready for it?

141
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,470
Everything is well prepared.

142
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,390
We are waiting for your command.

143
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:20,930
Feiye.

144
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,220
I’m worrying

145
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,090
Tianhui will surely be prepared.

146
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,260
At that time,

147
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,220
in case we can’t

148
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,300
take the imperial city at one stroke,

149
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,720
the two parties will be in a seesaw battle.

150
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,140
It will definitely
bring disaster to the ordinary people.

151
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,300
Tianhui

152
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,220
is keeping his eyes

153
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,300
on us now.

154
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,050
Then he will lower his guard

155
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,680
to people around him.

156
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,680
I’m really gratified

157
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:43,930
that you can be so thoughtful.

158
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,800
Now, the Lieutenant General,

159
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,970
the South Subduing General,

160
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,010
the Minister of Personnel,

161
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,300
and the Minister of Revenue

162
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,470
are under the command

163
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,680
of the Crown Prince.

164
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,640
It’s unexpected

165
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,050
that father puts me in an important position,

166
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,850
but the high-ranking officials

167
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,260
stand on my side.

168
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,470
Even the ministers of Revenue

169
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,600
and of Personnel

170
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,090
accepted

171
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,430
my gifts.

172
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,100
Congratulations, Your Highness.

173
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,100
Cheers.

174
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,100
A wise bird chooses the tree it will nest on.

175
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,970
It’s no doubt Your Highness

176
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,180
will be

177
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,890
in line to the throne.

178
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,140
We’d appreciate

179
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:32,890
your help

180
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,180
at that time.

181
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:35,760
General.

182
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:36,470
That’s not a problem.

183
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,760
You are wrong, general.

184
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,640
His Majesty is at the prime of life.

185
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,800
I’m afraid he may be still

186
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,890
energetic and strong

187
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,300
when you will have passed away.

188
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,600
Guys.

189
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,100
I won’t let you wait

190
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,180
for too long this time.

191
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,050
Your Highness.

192
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,800
The secret weapons

193
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,470
will arrive at the capital soon.

194
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,140
Now everything is ready.

195
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,180
It’s

196
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,350
the best time.

197
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,600
I need to take actions.

198
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:24,640
Your Highness.

199
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,600
We have the news.

200
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,930
Prince Qin

201
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,180
has been taking

202
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,470
more and more secret actions recently.

203
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,549
His Majesty is calling up troops too.

204
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:38,140
The two parties are

205
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,760
at daggers drawn.

206
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,600
It’s on the verge of a war.

207
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,550
Tianning will really have

208
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,470
a big change.

209
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:49,720
Your Highness.

210
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,680
Do we need to do something

211
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,220
to make things worse.

212
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:54,800
No necessary.

213
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,800
In the civil war by Prince Qin and Tianhui,

214
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,890
neither side gains.

215
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,890
We just need to watch the show.

[Gu’s Mansion]

217
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,050
Mr. Chu?

218
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:32,970
Prince Qin

219
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,220
should be very busy now.

220
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,260
Mr. Chu,

221
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,510
what brings you here?

222
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:38,680
Physician Gu.

223
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,890
His Highness needs your help.

224
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,680
If I guess it right,

225
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,600
His Highness probably wants me

226
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,850
to take Miss away

227
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,850
so that you have no worry.

228
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,260
Exactly.

229
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,220
Something will happen in the capital.

230
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,050
His Highness doesn’t want Princess Qin

231
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,050
to be in danger.

232
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:01,970
What a pity!

233
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,930
I was trying my best

234
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,050
to hide the Divorce Agreement.

235
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,680
But Miss found it at last.

236
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,640
Mr. Chu, please tell His Highness about it.

237
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,850
And hope he can excuse me.

238
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,050
I will tell him.

239
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,100
It’s actually good for Her Highness to know it.

240
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,100
In this case, His Highness has fewer worries.

241
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:23,930
This is the address.

242
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,890
Nobody else knows about it.

243
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:26,800
It’s safe.

244
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,180
Okay.

245
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,090
I’m leaving now.

246
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:10,640
Miss.

247
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,010
Physician Gu.

248
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:12,930
You are here.

249
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,760
Are you studying the poison skill?

250
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,090
I always thought

251
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,390
I was skillful in poisoning.

252
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,050
After the poisonous plague,

253
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,090
I found

254
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,180
I was too proud.

255
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,180
If I could

256
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,180
develop the antidote earlier,

257
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:26,760
there wouldn’t be

258
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:27,640
so many people dying.

259
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,510
It’s not your fault.

260
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,260
The one empoisoning should be blamed.

261
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:33,760
All in all,

262
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,470
learning more knowledge

263
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,390
will be better.

264
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:39,850
Miss.

265
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,300
Maybe we can leave here

266
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,550
after a few days, can we?

267
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,640
Leave?

268
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:44,600
Why?

269
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,890
Do you still want to return to Prince Qin’s Mansion?

270
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,720
It’s impossible for me

271
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,140
to be with him anymore.

272
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,680
In this case,

273
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,010
let’s leave the capital.

274
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,300
Too many

275
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,010
unhappy things

276
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,100
have happened recently.

277
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,350
Staying in the capital

278
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,760
only increases the burden.

279
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,260
Maybe we can take this opportunity

280
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,800
to have a trip

281
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:05,640
and go around.

282
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,970
But you are an imperial physician.

283
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,760
You can’t leave for too long.

284
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,890
I used the identity of a physician

285
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:12,680
for the purpose

286
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,800
of looking for Master and Lady Tianxin.

287
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,800
Now I’ve found you.

288
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:17,470

to work in the palace.

290
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,050
Okay.

291
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,640
Maybe I can forget all these

292
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,090
by walking around.

293
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,090

294
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,680
Please go ahead. Miss.

Not long after you returned to the palace,

374

that you were not my son.

At that time,

377

I blamed myself for being incapable.

378
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:11,220
Felt painful for losing my son.

402
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,640

403

530
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,640
Everything is ready.

531
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,350
Start the action.

532
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:51,640
Powder?

533
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,510
There is powder in the illicit market?

534
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,140
Yeah.

535
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,640
I’ve sent people

536
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,760
to investigate it.

537
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,470
Anybody suspicious

538
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,640
will be caught.

539
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,970
Arrange more guards outside Prince Qin’s Mansion

540
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,010
and watch each of their moves.

541
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:09,970
Yes.

542
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,600
Your Majesty.

543
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,180
Are you suspecting Prince Qin?

544
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,850
Long Feiye

545
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,680
is probably hoarding powder

546
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,260
for unexpected needs.

547
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,800
But the powder exploded.

548
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,720
Maybe it’s an accident.

549
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,680
Or maybe he has some other plots.

550
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,220
Look over his shoulder.

551
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,010
I’d like to see

552
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,430
what he will do

553
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,850
under my nose.

554
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,300
Yes.

555
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,350
Your Highness!

556
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,350
Your Highness!

557
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,640
We got a problem!

558
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,680
The bow and arrow from the Lieutenant General

559
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,140
are really good.

560
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:17,930
Your Highness.

561
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,970
What makes you in a panic?

562
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:21,720
The powder magazine in the illicit market exploded.

563
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:23,640
What?

564
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,510
Not long ago.

565
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,090
His Majesty sent the guards

566
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,100
to investigate it.

567
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,090
What about the result?

568
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,550
They caught a man in charge of the warehouse.

569
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:35,100
Ask the Lieutenant General

570
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,470
and the South Subduing General to see me.

571
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,760
Success or failure hinges on this one action.

572
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,600
Your Highness,

573
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:43,800
are you going to…

574
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,260
Your Highness.

575
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,300
Please don’t act on rash impulse.

576
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:52,680
You don’t know it.

577
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,260
My father is prone to suspicion.

578
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,390
If he finds out

579
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,430
it’s me running the powder magazine,

580
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,680
and the event of Poison Master,

581
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,180
I’m afraid I can’t keep my position of Crown Prince.

582
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,720
I may even lose my life.

583
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,640
Under this occasion,

584
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,720
we can only make a surprise attack

585
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,050
at the moment when father puts every force

586
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,430
to guard my uncle.

587
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,220
The best defense is offense.

588
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,930
Success or failure hinges on this one action.

589
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,050
This is my last chance.

590
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:30,100
[Pure Palace]

591
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,220
It should be this place.

592
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:31,970
How did you know my mother-in-law

593
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,260
was locked here?

594
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,050
Cold Palace is usually used to lock up

595
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,470
the females in the palace who made mistakes.

596
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,680
Otherwise there shouldn’t have been

597
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,680
so many guards here.

598
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,180
But Consort Yi didn’t make any mistake.

599
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,300
I’m afraid being envied

600
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,510
is her mistake.

601
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,300
It must be

602
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:46,430
the old lady.

603
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,100
There are so many guards here.

604
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,220
How can we get in?

605
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,140
Wait for a moment.

606
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:57,680
I’ve an idea.

607
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,760
Do you know how to go to Qingyun Hall?

608
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,550
I went there once long time ago.

609
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,350
Well. Take me there.

610
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,260
I leave her in your hands.

611
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,050
Mother.

612
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:37,850
Yunxi.

613
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:38,600
Come with me.

614
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,350
Why are you coming here?

615
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,260
Madam Gui said

616
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:43,220
you were taken away.

617
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,180
So I came for you

618
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:44,850
with the help

619
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:45,600
of Physician Gu.

620
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,390
It’s too dangerous here.

621
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,220
You have to leave here.

622
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,350
No.

623
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,550
I can’t just leave you

624
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,180
here.

625
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:52,600
The Dowager

626
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,800
can’t do anything to me now.

627
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:54,760
But you,

628
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,090
if they catch you,

629
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,430
the two people

630
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,010
will have one more chip

631
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,220
to threat my son.

632
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,430
Mother.

633
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,930
This is the only chance to leave.

634
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:13,760
I won’t leave.

635
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,300
Mother!

636
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:16,470
Leave here quickly!

637
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,050
Feiye.

638
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:20,850
It’s perfectly exact

639
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:21,680
as you expected.

640
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,180
After we exploded the powder magazine,

641
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,850
Crown Prince is very uneasy now.

642
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,100
Generals,

643
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,550
success or failure

644
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,510
hinges on this one action.

645
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,300
Please try hard to help.

646
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:44,890
We’d like to risk any danger

647
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,350
to charge forward.

648
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,090
Good.

649
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,090
Let’s go now.

650
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:51,180
Yes.

651
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:02,550
General Mu is asking to see you.

652
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,720
Your Majesty.

653
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,720
Crown Prince is making a surprise attack.

654
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,510
Now they are outside Xuanwu Gate.

655
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,430
What?

656
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,260
Say it again.

657
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,220
Crown Prince is making a surprise attack.

658
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,550
Now they are outside Xuanwu Gate.

659
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,850
Is it really the Crown Prince?

660
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,470
Your Majesty.

661
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,010
It is the Crown Prince.

662
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,390
How many people does he have?

663
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,010
Around 5,000.

664
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,010
The Lieutenant General
and the South Subduing General

665
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,010
are there too.

666
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,390
I really have

667
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,100
a good boy.

668
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,800
I’ve sent my men

669
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,430
and the guards to fight.

670
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,430
Catch the Crown Prince back to me.

671
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,260
Yes.

672
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,300
Your Majesty.

673
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,140
Is it really

674
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,010
the Crown Prince attacking the palace?

675
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,680
Why does this happen?

676
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:15,930
Your Majesty.

677
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:22,680
Yunxi.

678
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,220
To be honest,

679
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,180
when the Dowager appointed you to marry Feiye,

680
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,260
I have prejudice against you.

681
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,300
After getting along for a while,

682
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,800
I still didn’t like you.

683
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:40,100
It’s because a princess

684
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,220
should be

685
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,090
gentle, cultivated,

686
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,600
and ladylike

687
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,890
in my point of view.

688
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:51,760
But you are

689
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,550
lively,

690
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,390
smart,

691
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,930
and skillful in poisons.

692
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,100
I’ve been afraid that

693
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,260
you married Feiye

694
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,350
with evil designs.

695
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,260
Mother,

696
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:09,550
I will never hurt him.

697
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:12,639
I know.

698
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,800
I surely know it.

699
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:18,010
You’ve married

700
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:19,550
for a while.

701
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,010
I’m quite clear about

702
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,300
how good you are to Feiye.

703
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,550
I can figure out

704
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:29,679
that you really love him.

705
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:32,639
What surprised me more

706
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,139
is that Feiye becomes more and more

707
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,300
like a normal person

708
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:38,510
because of you.

709
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:41,550
He now has all kinds of emotions.

710
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,800
After I knew that, I accepted you

711
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:46,639
as the destiny

712
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,850
of my son.

713
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:56,639
Yunxi.

714
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,260
I don’t know

715
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,850
what happened

716
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,100
to Feiye

717
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,390
before ten.

718
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,470
But I know

719
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:09,930
it must be

720
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,470
a great pain.

721
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:13,390
So

722
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,100
he isolated himself

723
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,050
and protected himself

724
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,300
with the cold appearance.

725
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:23,140
When you came,

726
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,850
you are like the sun,

727
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,930
warming him little by little

728
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,090
and melted him.

729
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:37,970
Yunxi.

730
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,350
I hope you can take good care of yourself,

731
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,600
and keep loving him and protecting him.

732
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,760
As his mother,

733
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,390
I know he often bears everything alone

734
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,640
no matter what happens.

735
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:53,010
He never speaks it out.

736
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,430
But he really loves you

737
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,050
and needs you

738
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:02,090
in his mind.

739
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,180
Mother.

740
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:07,970
I’m afraid…

741
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,140
Yunxi.

742
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:16,220
As his mother,

743
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,800
this is my last wish.

744
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,890
Hope you can agree.

745
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,090
Well.

746
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,180
Good.

747
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,050
I finally can feel relieved now.

748
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:41,970

749
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,470

Your Royal Highness.

752
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,140
- Mother. - Your Majesty.

753
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,180
What’s going on?

754
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,100
Why did Crown Prince

755
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,550
make the surprise attack?

756
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:00,850
Mother.

757
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,220
I also have no idea.

758
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,850
I just feel weird.

759
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,010
Generally,

760
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,090
Crown Prince

761
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,600
is always indecisive.

762
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,430
He will never take this action

763
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,260
if he isn’t helpless.

764
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,550
Let alone fighting against the palace.

765
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:21,600
Is anybody cast in a bone

766
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,100
between you two on purpose?

767
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,050
You mean

768
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:28,100
Long Feiye?

769
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,300
Anybody else

770
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,550
would it be?

771
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:34,850
Li Quan.

772
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:37,390
How many people died

773
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,510
in the explosion of the illicit market?

774
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,140
Your Majesty.

775
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,970
It seems nobody died.

776
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,180
That’s

777
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,890
Long Feiye’s style.

778
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,720
Does it have anything to do with Crown Prince?

779
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,390
I wasn’t clear about it at the beginning.

780
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,140
If Long Feiye would really use the powder

781
00:37:58,430 --> 00:37:59,890
to fight against me,

782
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:02,510
it shouldn’t have been exploded all in a sudden.

783
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:10,090
Now I finally figure it out.

784
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,850
Since the powder

785
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:14,050
doesn’t belong to Long Feiye,

786
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,390
it must belong to Crown Prince.

787
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,680
Long Feiye stealthily got the powder exploded.

788
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:20,350
I was misled and thought

789
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,850
he would take an action,

790
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,430
so I sent out all the forces

791
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,600
to confront him.

792
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,850
At this moment,

793
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,720
Crown Prince found

794
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,050
I knew the thing about the powder.

795
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,100
That would be bad for him.

796
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,640
So he determined to go on

797
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,090
and made the attack

798
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:41,050
while the defense was weak in the palace

799
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,680
and I was unprepared.

800
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:44,680
But

801
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:45,970
he definitely doesn’t have

802
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,050
the strength.

803
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:48,140
Mother.

804
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,470
Long Feiye

805
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,430
could set up the Crown Prince.

806
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:56,850
He could also deploy it in advance.

807
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,600
I believe

808
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:02,430
the Lieutenant General
and the South Subduing General

809
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,140
are Long Feiye’s men.

810
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,050
In this case,

811
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,100
it appears that the Crown Prince is seizing power.

812
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,510
But actually the whole thing is under the control

813
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,430
of Long Feiye.

814
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:13,680
Yes.

815
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,220
The situation

816
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,760
is not that worse.

817
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,090
At least

818
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,470
we can make preparation ahead of time.
