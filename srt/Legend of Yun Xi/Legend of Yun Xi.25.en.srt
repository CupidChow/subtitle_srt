Episode 25

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,610
Qishao.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,240
Qishao.

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,770
The girl who rushed into Yaogui Valley

6
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,370
and absorbed poisonous miasma last night
has woken up.

7
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:13,450
Her name is Ningjing.

8
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:14,980
She argued to see Han Yunxi.

9
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,080
You, come here. Come here.

10
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:22,650
Come.

11
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,050
Come here.

12
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,110
Do you know who I am?

13
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,030
I don’t know who you are,

14
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,130
but I know you are bold.

15
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:29,570
You...

16
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,370
You think

17
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,820
my place is easy to enter?

18
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,820
If I hadn't been kind enough

19
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,180
to give you the antidote,

20
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,370
you wouldn't have had the chance

21
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,700
to make trouble at here.

22
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,070
Take me to see Han Yunxi.

23
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,610
See Han Yunxi?

24
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,950
Were you sent by Long Feiye?

25
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,570
I am Han Yunxi’s best friend.

26
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,330
I miss her.

27
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,860
Can’t I see her?

28
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,030
Best friend?

29
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,330
How did you know

30
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,610
Han Yunxi is here?

31
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,190
Did Long Feiye tell you?

32
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,140
I...

33
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,200
Of course no.

34
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:56,860
I...

35
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,460
Take me to see her. Hurry.

36
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,820
Han Yunxi is unwell now.

37
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,180
She won’t see anyone.

38
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,239
She’s unwell?

39
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,530
I came at a right time.

40
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,490
I am her best friend.

41
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:10,970
Once she sees me, she’s happy.

42
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,610
And she will be well.

43
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:19,860
Ningjing.

44
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,280
Yunxi.

45
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,190
I heard that you are unwell.

46
00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:24,360
I’m okay.

47
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,070
That’s fine.

48
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,490
Did His Highness ask you to find me?

49
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,050
I had no idea he was so ruthless.

50
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,700
He didn’t want my explanation.

51
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,090
Don’t misunderstand him, Yunxi.

52
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,009
He did that

53
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:46,289
to protect you.

54
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:48,150
But he was very ruthless that day.

55
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:49,890
You must know

56
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:50,700
what Gu-infected man

57
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,740
means.

58
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,410
Once his poison attacks,

59
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,450
he’ll hurt people around him.

60
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,400
Now his mother is angry.

61
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,240
If he offends his mother,

62
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,290
the relationship between

63
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,580
you and his mother

64
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,910
will be worse and worse.

65
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,450
So you mean

66
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,780
this is for me?

67
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,370
You should have

68
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,290
understood it earlier.

69
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,110
Really?

70
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,990
There’s no reason that I lie to you.

71
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,100
I thought

72
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,700
he likes Baili Mingxiang.

73
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,070
Actually, I came here

74
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,490
for Baili Mingxiang.

75
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,570
Her?

76
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,300
What happened to her?

77
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:32,170
Do you know Beauty Blood?

78
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:32,900
Yes.

79
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,250
It is said Beauty Blood

80
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,110
can detoxify all kinds of poison.

81
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,130
To have Beauty Blood,

82
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,290
the one should have

83
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,900
various kinds of chronic poisons

84
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,860
to deposit poison into blood.

85
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,050
Beauty Blood can’t appear

86
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,820
until three hundred kinds of poisons

87
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,110
have been taken.

88
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,930
But this is too cruel,

89
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,190
so no one dares to try.

90
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,210
But someone is stupid.

91
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,400
She believes it.

92
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,110
You mean

93
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,110
Baili Mingxiang...

94
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,150
I had no idea

95
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,650
she can sacrifice her life

96
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,150
for His Highness.

97
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,110
But

98
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,530
her love to Feiye

99
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,610
is too much

100
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,200
to bear.

101
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,890
Also, once she begins having the poisons,

102
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,610
she can’t stop.

103
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,450
Otherwise,

104
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,740
she may die.

105
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,250
Feiye found

106
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,460
many famous physicians for her.

107
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,450
But

108
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,260
all the efforts were in vain.

109
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,650
Maybe

110
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,360
I can have a try.

111
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,420
You know how to treat her?

112
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,360
Not now.

113
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,060
I need to

114
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,150
see her first.

115
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:46,420
At least, I should relieve her pain

116
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,980
and stop it from getting worse.

117
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,740
I believe

118
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,370
all the poisons

119
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,740
can be detoxified.

120
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,280
For His Highness,

121
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,740
I must cure her.

122
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:55,900
Yunxi.

123
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,730
You can’t

124
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,500
enter Prince Qin’s Mansion now.

125
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,360
Also,

126
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,370
Baili Mingxiang

127
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,070
may not appreciate your help.

128
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,030
But I need to have a try.

129
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,690
I know a place

130
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,620
where we can slip into the mansion.

131
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:17,890
Villain.

132
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:18,450
Were you

133
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,110
listening to our talk at here?

134
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,200
I tell you.

135
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,360
I am not that kind of person.

136
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,770
I won’t listen to one word

137
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,230
which I shouldn’t listen.

138
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,570
Poison girl.

139
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,320
Are you well?

140
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:31,810
Yes.

141
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:32,610
I’m fine.

142
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,860
Good.

143
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,750
You are really a smart girl.

144
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,950
Qishao,

145
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,650
thanks for taking care of me these days.

146
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,110
I need to go back to Prince Qin’s Mansion now.

147
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,240
Wait.

148
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,010
You can’t

149
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,460
enter Prince Qin’s Mansion.

150
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,280
Why?

151
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,170
King Tianhui asked General Mu

152
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,280
to take soldiers to surround there.

153
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:57,140
They are watching carefully.

154
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,050
Now even a mosquito

155
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:58,950
can’t enter.

156
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,010
Feiye, what should we do?

157
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,570
She looks tough usually,

158
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,010
but she is not strong in fact.

159
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,050
When she meets Gu Qishao,

160
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,180
she will be bullied.

161
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,450
Don’t worry.

162
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,380
Gu Qishao won’t hurt her.

163
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,120
Your Highness.

164
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,650
I received information

165
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,710
from our informer.

166
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,820
The rumor

167
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,940
came from the Second Prince.

168
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,900
I knew it. King Tianhui made this.

169
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,330
Feiye.

170
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,730
How should we fight back?

171
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,780
Calm down now.

172
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,990
Wait and see.

173
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,110
I misunderstood him.

174
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,830
I must go back to him.

175
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,780
I am his wife.

176
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,290
I must face everything

177
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,610
with him.

178
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,700
You will make it messier if you go back.

179
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,810
Now the most important thing

180
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,200
is to cure Feiye.

181
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,420
But I need

182
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,290
to get in Prince Qin’s Mansion,

183
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,550
and then I can cure him.

184
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,860
Why don’t you treat that mad man first?

185
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,320
If he is sober,

186
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,490
Feiye can be saved.

187
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,110
Is that mad man Poison Master?

188
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:16,020
[Palace of Benevolence and Longevity]

189
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,290
You sent Mu Qingwu

190
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,420
to guard around Prince Qin’s Mansion.

191
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,970
Han Yunxi

192
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,530
saved his life not long ago.

193
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,530
Don’t you worry that he bends your law?

194
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,200
I

195
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,740
did it on purpose.

196
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:37,030
As long as Mu Qingwu

197
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,150
dares to break my law

198
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,700
and let Prince Qin out,

199
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,240
Prince Qin must go

200
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,110
to do something important.

201
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:46,490
Maybe

202
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,190
I can find Poison Master then.

203
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,320
Your Majesty.

204
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,920
The Second Prince is here.

205
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,150
Let him in.

206
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,070
Let the Second Prince in!

207
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,650
Your Highness.

208
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,150
Your Majesty.

209
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,280
Rise.

210
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,250
I asked you to do one thing.

211
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,490
How’s it going?

212
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,410
Father,

213
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,410
it goes very well.

214
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,130
Now, everyone in this country

215
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,260
is discussing Prince Qin’s identity.

216
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,110
Prince Qin

217
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,220
is not well-received by the public.

218
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,070
Good.

219
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,360
Well done.

220
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,430
I always put the shoe on the right foot.

221
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,650
Tianqing.

222
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,950
What do you want?

223
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,110
I don’t dare to ask for a reward.

224
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,490
It’s my duty

225
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:47,780
to help father.

226
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,360
But

227
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,820
I heard that my mother is not well recently.

228
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,480
I am really worried about her.

229
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,110
So I want to see her.

230
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,110
You’ve been

231
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,780
paying full attention

232
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,440
to Concubine Qing these days.

233
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,820
Tianqing is filial.

234
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,650
Let him see her.

235
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,200
Yes.

236
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,110
I’ll pardon your mistake.

237
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:16,900
Tianqing.

238
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,020
You can go to see your mother.

239
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,870
Thanks, father.

240
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,290
Your Highness.

241
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,420
You can’t scare

242
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,010
me next time.

243
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,010
Madam. Don’t cry.

244
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,110
I am well now.

245
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,770
Actually,

246
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:29,530
I had no idea

247
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,060
I could be hurt so severely.

248
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:33,360
I just

249
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,970
wanted to get Tianhui’s trust

250
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,240
sooner.

251
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,740
So,

252
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,700
I didn’t think much.

253
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:40,860
But

254
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,200
you can’t do this again.

255
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,190
If you are in danger,

256
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,400
how will we protect Xiqiu?

257
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,820
His Majesty is here!

258
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,070
His Majesty is here.

259
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,090
-Your majesty.
-Your majesty.

260
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,350
-Your Highness.
-Curtsey is not needed.

261
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,250
Darling.

262
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,530
How do you feel now?

263
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,200
I feel better.

264
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,130
Physician Han told me

265
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,210
to have

266
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,530
more walks.

267
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,570
Fine.

268
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,210
Madam Lin severed you well.

269
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,070
She will be rewarded handsomely.

270
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,780
Thanks, Your Majesty.

271
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,740
Your Majesty.

272
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,900
Now that I

273
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,360
have recovered,

274
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,930
it’s not right

275
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,580
for me to live in the Hall of Virtue.

276
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,380
I should go back to Qinghui Hall.

277
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,070
No hurry.

278
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,690
Han Cong’an told

279
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:37,930
you to walk,

280
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,030
so I’ll take you to a place now.

281
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,900
Where?

282
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,790
You’ll know when you get there.

283
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,450
Darling, look.

284
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,140
Your Majesty.

285
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,400
I know you miss Xiqiu.

286
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,530
So I asked

287
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:25,820
people to build this palace

288
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,080
based on your painting

289
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,150
to relieve your homesickness.

290
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,690
Do you like it?

291
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,900
I like it so much.

292
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,200
These...

293
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,740
These are completely same to

294
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,400
the things in Xiqiu’s palace.

295
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,320
But...

296
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,870
These cost a lot of wealth and efforts.

297
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,490
I feel guilty

298
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,900
for it.

299
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,900
Darling. Don’t think too much.

300
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,740
I know your

301
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,900
love to me.

302
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,990
This palace is yours.

303
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,070
Also, I’ll promote you

304
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,380
to control the harem.

305
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,100
Your Majesty. You can’t.

306
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,650
I am not here for long.

307
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,180
There are still many things I don’t know.

308
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,700
It’s not time to promote me.

309
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,500
Though you are not here for long,

310
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,490
you love me the most

311
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:07,900
among all the consorts.

312
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,320
So you are worth of the promotion.

313
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,320
Don’t worry.

314
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,610
I’ll give you

315
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,740
all the best things.

316
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,840
Thanks, Your Majesty.

317
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,530
Your Highness.

318
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,290
His Majesty

319
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,740
built a palace for Concubine Qing,

320
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,740
and said he’ll promote her.

321
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,400
What?

322
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,990
His Majesty built a palace…

323
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,500
-Your Highness, please calm down.
-…for that witch?

324
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,030
And he’ll promote her?

325
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,610
I’ve worked hard for many years

326
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,990
to get this place.

327
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,290
Why can she

328
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,530
get such honor?

329
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,340
Your Highness, please calm down.

330
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,280
Get lost!

331
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,570
All of you!

332
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,450
Get lost!

333
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,990
Get out of my room!

334
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,280
King Tianhui really put a lot of efforts.

335
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,940
The decoration of this palace

336
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,580
is similar to

337
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,860
your palace in Xiqiu.

338
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,300
Your sacrifice

339
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,740
is worth.

340
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,800
This time,

341
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,030
you get King Tianhui’s trust,

342
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,650
and also, you’ll be promoted.

343
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,130
In future, your status

344
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,990
is the same as Noble Consort Xiao.

345
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,360
Madam.

346
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,400
Noble Consort Xiao is not my rival,

347
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,540
but I’m worried about the Crown Prince.

348
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,490
He is imprisoned

349
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,030
by the King Tianhui.

350
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,740
The information

351
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,000
from the Hall of Virtue

352
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,400
says that

353
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,610
it may be related to

354
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,340
that he makes Gu-infected men.

355
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,450
And then,

356
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,570
the Second Prince is more likely

357
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,570
to get the support from all parties.

358
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,280
Once his status is stable,

359
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,530
the Crown Prince’s situation will be hard.

360
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,940
You are worried that the Second Prince
will replace the Crown Prince,

361
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,540
and then, Noble Consort Xiao will get more power.

362
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,940
If the Crown Prince flops

363
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,570
and loses support,

364
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,530
our situation

365
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,240
will be harder.

366
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:17,900
Yes.

367
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,490
King Tianhui stresses rule,

368
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,070
so

369
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,450
I can’t interfere with this directly.

370
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,200
I can only wait for the chance.

371
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,000
Your Highness, you don’t need to be too worried.

372
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,820
The Dowager always protects the Crown Prince.

373
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,740
She will help him.

374
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,110
By the way,

375
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,150
I was so worried about your health,

376
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,450
so I forgot a very important thing.

377
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,130
The Crown Prince

378
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,990
proved your guess.

379
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,810
The Dowager

380
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:57,030
began investigating Noble Consort Xiao.

381
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,240
Seems

382
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,370
that Noble Consort Xiao

383
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,240
can’t be arrogant for long.

384
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,360
Qishao.

385
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,030
The information from Beili

386
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,650
says that if we can’t find Poison Master,

387
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:18,570
they will let others

388
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:19,830
manage Yaogui Valley.

389
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:21,950
Got it.

390
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,090
Qishao.

391
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,620
Crown Prince also urged us.

392
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,450
Don’t you

393
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,890
have good news

394
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,070
to make me happy?

395
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,740
What’s going on with Chu Qingge?

396
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,530
She has gained

397
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,790
King Tianhui’s trust.

398
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,650
Finally, there’s

399
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,030
a happy thing.

400
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,700
Do you have other information?

401
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,300
Chu Qingge has a strong rival

402
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,700
in the palace as well.

403
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,130
You are

404
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,590
the famous Poison Master?

405
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,200
Do you know

406
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,690
the crime that you committed

407
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,180
makes His Highness suffer even for now.

408
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,840
Whenever I think of this, I...

409
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,410
I must cure you,

410
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,410
and then, His Highness can be cured.

411
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,090
So please

412
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:25,990
be well soon.

413
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,650
It’s hurt. You are bad.

414
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,330
You are bad.

415
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,140
I’m not.

416
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,150
You are bad.

417
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,820
I won’t let you eat if you keep talking.

418
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,610
Don’t move.

419
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,400
You know how to play it?

420
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,810
When I was a child,

421
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:01,950
my mother played it.

422
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,870
Your way is the same as my mother’s.

423
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,370
The weather is dry and things are flammable,

424
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,700
take care not to catch fire!

425
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,160
The weather is dry and things are flammable,

426
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,900
take care not to catch fire!

427
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,300
I’ll keep watch here.

428
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,960
You keep watch at the gate.

429
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,610
Yes.

430
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,079
Your Highness.

431
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:15,530
It’s weird

432
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,609
outside.

433
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,530
In the last two nights,

434
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,940
the guards changed shifts at midnight.

435
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,609
And they are

436
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:22,010
not as careful as before.

437
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,660
How’s the thing that I asked you to investigate
going?

438
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,589
I got the result.

439
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,530
The Minister of Revenue, Minister of Rituals

440
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,130
and all the subordinates

441
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,700
are making household registration

442
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,100
to find the missing people.

443
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,400
I think they’ll have the result.

444
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,700
Anything else?

445
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,490
Her Highness

446
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,890
began treating

447
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:43,820
Poison Master.

448
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,500
Is Gu Qishao with her?

449
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,940
Your Highness, don’t worry about this.

450
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,340
Her Highness always does things carefully.

451
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,860
And our men

452
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,620
is protecting her secretly.

453
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,780
You may go.

454
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,530
Yes.

455
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,070
I’ll go.

456
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,200
I want to

457
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,990
have baby with you!

458
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,490
Yunxi.

459
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,890
Have you found anything?

460
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,570
From the book,

461
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,490
my treatment

462
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,450
is right.

463
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,090
But why hasn’t that mad man

464
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,210
been better?

465
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,190
Take it easy.

466
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,070
Be patient.

467
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,190
You can make it.

468
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,530
I want to cure him sooner.

469
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,700
And then, His Highness can be well soon.

470
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,430
I don’t want him to be in danger.

471
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,860
But you didn’t sleep

472
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,650
for a whole night.

473
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,900
Take care of your health.

474
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,280
I remember

475
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,280
Feiye always told us

476
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:20,970
that something

477
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:21,860
is doomed

478
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,150
in our life.

479
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,180
Vomit your words.

480
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,530
What is doomed?

481
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,570
I only believe

482
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,180
my fate is controlled by myself.

483
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,490
Everyone thought the carbuncle

484
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,650
on my face couldn’t be cured,

485
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,580
but it was cured.

486
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,090
I believe

487
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,450
every poison can be detoxified

488
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,900
in the world.

489
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,070
Feiye,

490
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,570
you must hold on.

491
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,330
Don’t let Han Yunxi

492
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,790
and Baili Mingxiang down.

493
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,320
Look.

494
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,030
Come on.

495
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,580
The way is the same as what my mother played.

496
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,530
Eat that.

497
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:20,860
That.

498
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,130
No. It’s not good.

499
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,570
Eating apricot and chestnut together

500
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,030
will give me stomachache.

501
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,370
You’re like me.

502
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,700
I’ll have diarrhea if I eat them together.

503
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,570
Have the medicine.

504
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,930
No, I don’t.

505
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:35,930
-I don’t.
-You...

506
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,500
I won’t play with you if you don’t drink.

507
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,200
Good.

508
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,120
-Let’s continue.
-So bitter.

509
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,320
Qishao.

510
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,360
Qishao!

511
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,110
You don’t need to go.

512
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,400
Miss Han has come back.

513
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,730
Is she okay?

514
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,610
I think so.

515
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,130
But she's so secretive

516
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,740
these days.

517
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,530
If what I guess is right,

518
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,260
she went to find Poison Master.

519
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:24,950
I knew it.

520
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,490
Do I need to track her?

521
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:27,820
Not now.

522
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,460
Don’t make them notice us.

523
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,330
We need

524
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,330
a further confirmation.

525
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,110
I know.

526
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,060
Do you have anything else?

527
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,490
Qishao, don’t forget

528
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:38,820
your duty

529
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,200
just because of a woman.

530
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,340
Please set store by overall interests.

531
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,330
I know

532
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,200
my thing.

533
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,710
No need to remind me.

534
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,360
Yunxi.

535
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,490
Why are you sleeping here?

536
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:02,780
Don’t get a cold.

537
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,490
I just have a rest.

538
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,420
I wasn’t asleep.

539
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,580
How is Prince Qin’s Mansion now?

540
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,780
Mu Qingwu takes

541
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,200
many guardians at here.

542
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,650
They say it’s protecting the mansion.

543
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,410
But I think

544
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,950
it’s imprisonment.

545
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,550
His Highness must be very upset

546
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,950
with this.

547
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,900
Feiye is prideful.

548
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,650
He must be very grieved

549
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,780
to be imprisoned.

550
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,240
I wonder how Tang Li is now.

551
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,960
Don’t talk about this.

552
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:38,970
Now the most important thing

553
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,280
is to cure that mad man.

554
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,380
You know how to treat him?

555
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,890
I treated him

556
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,240
based on the book,

557
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,180
but it

558
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,280
didn’t work.

559
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,260
Is it something wrong

560
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,650
with my formula?

561
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,980
What should we do?

562
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:58,820
Go,

563
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,470
let’s go to find Qishao.

564
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,750
Poison girl.

565
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,240
Qishao.

566
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,740
I have something with you.

567
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,770
I said that

568
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,280
we have mutual affinity.

569
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,070
Look.

570
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,420
I bring you good food.

571
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,370
I’m not hungry.

572
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,030
Take it.

573
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,050
I am serious.

574
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,780
I have something serious with you.

575
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,490
When did you have

576
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,750
casual things with me?

577
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,100
Tell me, what’s the matter?

578
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,330
I am making a formula.

579
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,450
But it has something wrong.

580
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,510
So I want your help.

581
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,430
It’s a tricky question.

582
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,400
Why?

583
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,610
As usual,

584
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,580
you need to promise me three things.

585
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,820
Three things again?

586
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,440
What’s your thing?

587
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,090
Well...

588
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:40,900
Let me see.

589
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,780
Feiye has a rival in love.

590
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,320
I must tell him now.

591
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,010
Have you decided yet?

592
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,240
Not yet.

593
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,060
Last time, you promised me three things.

594
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:01,900
So you owe me

595
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,360
six things totally.

596
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,660
It’s really hard.

597
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,250
Now that it’s hard,

598
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,250
leave the things for the moment.

599
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,700
Help me now.

600
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,490
Alright.

601
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,400
Since you are sincere,

602
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,050
I’ll break my rule

603
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:15,860
and help you.

604
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,420
You are really a good man.

605
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,780
I’ll get the formula.

606
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,400
Fine.

607
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,150
Hope you’ll always

608
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,750
think I am a good man.

609
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,360
Yunxi.

610
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,610
Does that Gu Qishao

611
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,950
like you?

612
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,460
Don’t tell that joke.

613
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,490
Everyone can see

614
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:43,490
that he likes you.

615
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,570
And you?

616
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,820
What do you think?

617
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,890
What do you mean?

618
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:49,550
We are just ordinary friends.

619
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,020
Don’t think too much.

620
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,490
Yunxi,

621
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,490
I won’t accompany you today.

622
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,220
I need to go back to the mansion.

623
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,570
Yunxi.

624
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,250
Actually today

625
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,650
is Feiye’s real birthday.

626
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,650
So...

627
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,370
So I...

628
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,190
I’ll go.

629
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,240
So beautiful!

630
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,210
I’m sorry.

631
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,450
I didn’t do it on purpose.

632
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,580
I’ll make it for you.

633
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,490
No need.

634
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,200
Today is Feiye’s birthday.

635
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,980
I've been preparing all afternoon.

636
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,370
Those fireflies

637
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,900
were to surprise him.

638
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,450
Now they are ruined by you.

639
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,660
My happiness is also ruined by you.

640
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,610
I didn’t do it on purpose.

641
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,150
Also,

642
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,130
I didn’t know

643
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,700
you prepared those fireflies.

644
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,290
I couldn’t enter in the day.

645
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,290
When the guards

646
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:45,970
relaxed at night,

647
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:46,900
I could come in.

648
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,610
They are just some fireflies.

649
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,330
How did I ruin your happiness?

650
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,450
Is it that serious?

651
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,950
For a dying person,

652
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,950
every second is precious.

653
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,280
How can you understand?

654
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,690
Alright.

655
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,210
I apologize.

656
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,450
You are still weak.

657
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,700
Go back to have a rest.

658
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:08,900
By the way.

659
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,490
Don’t wait for Feiye.

660
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,080
We have something important to discuss.

661
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,770
You have been gathering herbs

662
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:55,820
since morning.

663
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,150
Aren’t you tired?

664
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,410
You keep talking.

665
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,740
Isn’t your mouth tired?

666
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,530
You promised me

667
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:12,180
to find Yunxi with me.

668
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,090
But what did you do?

669
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,410
I couldn’t even see your shadow.

670
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:15,490
A girl walks out alone

671
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,090
at night.

672
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:16,650
Do you know how dangerous it is?

673
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:17,490
Can you...

674
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,190
It’s dangerous for others.

675
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,700
What did you say?

676
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,210
Say it loudly.

677
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:25,010
I told you I needed to keep watch at night,

678
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,490
and when day broke, I would go with you.

679
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,770
Who knew you were so hurried

680
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:28,950
and went alone?

681
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,130
Liar.

682
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:32,200
You are not worried about me at all.

683
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,330
My lady,

684
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:35,260
how come I’m not worried about you?

685
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,530
I’m worried about you,

686
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,460
and I’m more worried about others.

687
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,530
Others?

688
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,150
Who?

689
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,490
Those who met you.

690
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,860
I’m afraid they would be bullied by you.

691
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,010
Tang Li,

692
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,820
do you want to die?

693
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,610
Stop it.

694
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,530
Feiye.

695
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:55,320
Feiye.

696
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,640
Where is Yunxi?

697
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,210
These days,

698
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,570
she's been trying to cure Poison Master.

699
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:01,410
But it seems that

700
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:02,740
her way doesn’t work.

701
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,650
So now,

702
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,120
she’s discussing the new formula

703
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,400
with Gu Qishao.

704
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,290
I think

705
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,410
that Gu Qishao

706
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,190
is not a good man.

707
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,210
Yunxi has married,

708
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,860
but he doesn’t care.

709
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:17,770
Feiye,

710
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:18,970
you need to notice it.

711
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,030
By the way,

712
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,490
this is the antidote

713
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,530
that Yunxi gave you.

714
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:25,330
With it,

715
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,210
the poisonous miasma

716
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:27,130
can’t be your barrier.

717
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,370
Who knows whether it’s antidote or poison?

718
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,450
A knave thinks of others

719
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,980
in terms of his own desires.

720
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:31,990
Feiye,

721
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,610
don’t ignore my words!

722
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:34,770
You must take actions!

723
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:36,130
Otherwise, Yunxi will be taken by others!

724
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,610
And you will regret!

725
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:38,250
Don’t take it seriously.

726
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,530
Let him take her.

727
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:40,530
Tang Li.

728
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,740
Stop it.

729
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,780
I must beat you.

730
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,730
Poison girl.

731
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:45,130
I’ve been accompanying you for a whole day.

732
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:45,990
I’m so hungry.

733
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,500
How will you thank me?

734
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,130
Alright. Alright.

735
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,530
I’ll cook dinner for you.

736
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,060
Someone broke into here.

737
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,030
Why is it him?

738
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,660
He must be sent by Long Feiye.

739
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,530
Qishao.

740
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,300
Do we need to kill him?

741
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:25,860
No.

742
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,490
He must have  come for Han Yunxi.

743
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,330
After all, he doesn’t

744
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,260
know our secret.

745
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,420
We don’t need to kill him now.

746
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,820
How will we deal with him?

747
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,500
Imprison him.

748
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:43,860
Qishao.

749
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,280
Gu Qishao.

750
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,650
I came for Yunxi.

751
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,950
Don’t worry.

752
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,130
Now that I saved you,

753
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:20,280
how can I hurt you?

754
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,530
This can’t be sure.

755
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,420
I shouldn’t have listened to Qishao

756
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,620
to give you antidote.

757
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,660
I should have given you some poison.

758
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,490
Girl, your words are evil.

759
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,420
It’s because you are unbelieving.

760
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,960
Where is my prince?

761
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,010
Prince Qin

762
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:42,670
is the rival of Qishao in love.

763
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,930
He has been buried.

764
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:44,700
Buried?

765
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,840
Your Highness.

766
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,610
I was driven out

767
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:52,130
of Prince Qin’s Mansion by you.

768
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,360
I had nowhere to go,

769
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,820
so I came here.

770
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,150
You came for your friend again?

771
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,820
Don’t be angry.

772
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:00,930
Poison Master

773
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:02,020
is always like this.

774
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:02,930
So I think

775
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,620
it must be something wrong with the formula.

776
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,450
Gu Qishao is the Master of Yaogui Valley.

777
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:07,810
He knows all kinds of herbal medicine.

778
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:10,540
With his help, this issue can be finished sooner.

779
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,500
You really trust him?

780
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,530
Don’t worry.

781
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,610
This is an important thing.

782
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,210
I didn’t tell him even a word.

783
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,350
I just asked him to help me on medicine.

784
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,190
Stop being angry.

785
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,770
I’ll discuss with you

786
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,700
when there’s something next time.

787
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,570
If I make you angry next time,

788
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,150
punish me.

789
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:35,780
How?

790
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,700
You are Prince Qin.

791
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,160
Punish me as what you want.

792
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,720
What if I’m not Prince Qin?

793
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,570
You are my husband at least.

794
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,450
It was me

795
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:48,210
who almost made

796
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:49,410
you expose yourself.

797
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:50,810
I don’t feel wronged

798
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,410
that you and mother blame me.

799
00:33:59,100 --> 00:33:59,960
Your Highness.

800
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,870
It’s fine that you are well.

801
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,450
Your Highness,

802
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:06,130
I have something else.

803
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,050
I need to go.

804
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,070
Wait for me here.

805
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:49,810
I told you

806
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:51,139
to wait for me in the room.

807
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:52,199
Why are you here?

808
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,699
It’s too stuffy inside.

809
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:56,630
So I came to breathe some fresh air.

810
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,810
Today is your birthday.

811
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:01,400
Wish you long life.

812
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,360
I almost forgot

813
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,190
my birthday.

814
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,610
How did you know?

815
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,820
Ningjing told me.

816
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,070
In fact, I planned

817
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,570
to celebrate your birthday

818
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:21,900
at here alone.

819
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,070
But I didn’t expect you could come.

820
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,090
Don’t think about

821
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,030
the past.

822
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,330
I will be with you

823
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,660
on your every birthday.

824
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,450
What a pity.

825
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,100
There’s no star tonight.

826
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,070
But, look,

827
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,990
there are many fireflies.

828
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,900
Who told me

829
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,700
that I can punish her

830
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,220
if she makes me angry?

831
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,110
Today is your birthday.

832
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,910
Punish me as you please.

833
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,630
Close your eyes.

834
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,370
Qishao.

835
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:12,570
What are you looking?

836
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,540
Did Long Feiye leave?

837
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,570
He went back to his room

838
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:18,830
to rest with Han Yunxi.

839
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,900
Your breakfast is ready.

840
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,210
Fine.

841
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,030
Got it.

842
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,590
Are you still angry?

843
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,490
You played a joke

844
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:45,740
with our prince’s life.

845
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,730
How can I be calm?

846
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:47,810
You are stupid.

847
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:49,020
How come you believed it?

848
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:49,610
You...

849
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,610
I won’t eat.

850
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:00,610
I don’t know

851
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:01,980
whether you put poison in it.

852
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,650
Whatever.

853
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:08,940
You cooked it?

854
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:09,900
Of course.

855
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,700
Do you like it?

856
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,280
Yes.

857
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,810
Taste the wine that I just made.

858
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:30,810
How’s the flavor?

859
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,570
You can make wine?

860
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,190
How’s it?

861
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:43,780
Not bad.

862
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,450
Not bad?

863
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:46,900
Is it good or bad?

864
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,150
It means...

865
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,650
I want more.

866
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,240
Father.

867
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:19,370
Last night,

868
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:20,410
our spy sent in Prince Qin’s Mansion

869
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:21,110
says that

870
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,370
two people in black

871
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:23,530
went out

872
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:24,280
secretly.

873
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,650
But our men

874
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:28,460
didn’t catch up with them around Yaogui Valley.

875
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,730
They are most likely

876
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,060
to enter Yaogui Valley.

877
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,820
Yaogui Valley is full of poisonous miasma.

878
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,020
If they just entered,

879
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,520
they may lose their lives.

880
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,860
I sent guardians

881
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,170
to Yaogui Valley

882
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,130
to spy those who enter

883
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,110
and go out.

884
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,450
I know.

885
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,200
Tell me if something happens.

886
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,110
Yes.

887
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,780
Is there such a place?

888
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,610
Nice.

889
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,010
It’s a good place

890
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,860
to imprison a mad guy.

891
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,930
After the pill to cure madness

892
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:18,780
is finished,

893
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,070
it should be gray

894
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,900
because different kinds of medicine react.

895
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,450
Though my pill’s color is similar,

896
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,570
the effect

897
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:29,830
is totally different.

898
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,700
This needs time.

899
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,280
I need to study it.

900
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,140
How long will it take?

901
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,920
Why are you so hurried?

902
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,370
The medicine is to save people.

903
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:41,580
Of course I’m hurried.

904
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,510
I don’t want to cost you a long time.

905
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,460
You must want to leave here earlier.

906
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,490
This is not Prince Qin’s Mansion after all.

907
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:52,290
It’s not convenient for His Highness to stay here.

908
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,540
You make my heart break.

909
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,980
You beg me when I’m useful for you,

910
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,580
and you leave me when I’m not.

911
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,700
I also want to stay here longer.

912
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,290
But I worry that you and His Highness

913
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:01,890
may have a quarrel

914
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:03,150
if you two always meet.

915
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,360
You know

916
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,450
his temper.

917
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,250
Think about it.

918
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:08,410
Think about it?

919
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:10,070
Could you say something else?

920
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,100
You don’t say it clearly at one time.

921
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:13,740
Forget it.

922
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,920
Medicine book is the best.

923
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,090
I can find any formula

924
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:17,770
for incurable diseases

925
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:18,860
in the book.

926
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,370
Borneol,

927
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:25,370
Medicated Leaven

928
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,530
and Gold Leaf.

929
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,240
They are used for madness.

930
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:30,570
Seems that

931
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,030
Poison Master is hid by Long Feiye.
