Episode 19

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,320
I can’t believe it!

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,160
He doesn’t even trust me!

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,680
If he doesn’t care about his own life,

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,010
why do I bother to worry?

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,760
What if he’ll die?

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,800
Yunxi,

9
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,140
what are you doing here?

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:28,890
What are you doing?

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:29,750
Let me tell you.

12
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,550
Goodness!

13
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,970
Baili Mingxiang’s father

14
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,510
is Feiye’s retainer.

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,770
He used to share life

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,760
and death with Feiye on battlefields.

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,100
And Baili Mingxiang also

18
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,350
likes Feiye.

19
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,890
How could she poison him?

20
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,220
I’m also wondering.

21
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,010
Who knows?

22
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,260
Cats hide their claws.

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,550
Then,

24
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,250
what do you plan to do?

25
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,710
Keep an eye on her for me first.

26
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,600
Don’t let her give Feiye poisonous medicine again.

27
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,050
He has had that for many times.

28
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,390
He is not deeply poisoned.

29
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,550
But there must be poison left in his body.

30
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,220
I have figured the antidote out yesterday.

31
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,280
I’ll go make it now.

32
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:08,850
Alright.

33
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:09,760
Hurry up.

34
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:10,580
Don’t worry.

35
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,010
I will keep a

36
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,260
close eye on Baili Mingxiang for you.

37
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,930
-I won’t give her chance to do that.
-Watch her.

38
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:15,930
Watch. Watch her.

39
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,370
Poison Girl.

40
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,050
You came to my valley to pick up herbs

41
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,180
without telling me.

42
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,350
You really don’t think of yourself as an outsider.

43
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,680
It’s a life-and-death matter.

44
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,340
I’m in a hurry to get the herbs.

45
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,390
What’s more,

46
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,390
the bell will ring if someone comes.

47
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,140
I knew that you will come to me.

48
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,280
So I won’t waste my time to find you.

49
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,950
Life-and-death matter?

50
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,100
Who is it?

51
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,140
One ungrateful person.

52
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:00,770
Can you tell me

53
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:01,550
who it is?

54
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,140
I can’t.

55
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:06,720
Well,

56
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,600
doesn’t your husband Prince Qin

57
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,860
have a close eye on you?

58
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,430
How could he let you out?

59
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,640
Him?

60
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,100
Someone is taking care of him.

61
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,700
He doesn’t care about me now.

62
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,720
Alright. Thank you for this.

63
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,720
See you next time.

64
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,660
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

65
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:44,510
How is it?

66
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,720
Nothing unusual.

67
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,090
She just stays in room.

68
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,180
That’s good.

69
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,480
Looks like she doesn’t dare to do

70
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,870
anything after being found by me.

71
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:55,800
Yunxi,

72
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,380
have you made the medicine?

73
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,970
Yes. I got it.

74
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,850
But now Feiye doesn’t trust me.

75
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,090
I don’t know how to let him drink it.

76
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:19,540
Brother,

77
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,220
His Majesty built three dungeons

78
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,020
to confuse us,

79
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,430
trying to disperse our forces.

80
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,220
Which dungeon

81
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,640
do you think he will transfer Poison Mater to?

82
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,700
The Dark Guard Feng

83
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,750
is as strong as Your Highness.

84
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,430
It must be the dungeon

85
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,930
he will head to.

86
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,100
His Majesty’s guard is that strong?

87
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,140
Then you need to hijack it yourself?

88
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,180
Xifeng.

89
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,390
Choose a group of soldiers

90
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,420
who have great flying skill

91
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,930
to have quick attacks in the three lines.

92
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,390
Don’t waste time on fight.

93
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,510
If they give priority to pursuit

94
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,910
and neglect prevention,

95
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,760
that means Poison Master

96
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,150
is not with them.

97
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,300
Yes.

98
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,640
Feiye,

99
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,150
the medicine is ready.

100
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:00,550
Brother,

101
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,010
it’s lucky that Mingxiang’s blood

102
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,740
can suppress the poisonous Gu.

103
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,260
Or if it breaks out when we go to

104
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,390
hijack Poison Master,

105
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,930
that will be a big trouble.

106
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:09,540
Brother,

107
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,930
you need to thank Mingxiang.

108
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,550
I’m not good at fighting

109
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,720
and I have no good plan.

110
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,450
I can’t do other things to help.

111
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,470
Only my Beauty Blood is useful.

112
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,579
I’m already satisfied that

113
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,850
I can help you.

114
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,360
By the way,

115
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,760
did you get disturbed by Han Yunxi this time?

116
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,510
No.

117
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,550
I saw that she was doing snacks

118
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,970
in the kitchen just now.

119
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,240
But Ningjing kept watching me.

120
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,360
Thanks for the guard Xifeng arranged

121
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,430
to stop her for me.

122
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,300
That girl

123
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,720
always follows Han Yunxi.

124
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,550
She will definitely cause trouble to us one day.

125
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,430
You yelled

126
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,010
in your room last night.

127
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,390
What happened?

128
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,800
No… Nothing happened.

129
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,800
Just that Ningjing went crazy and

130
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,470
borrowed medicine from Han Yunxi to get me dizzy.

131
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,130
Or how could I be tied up by her?

132
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,330
What’s next?

133
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,390
Next…

134
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,230
I slept with my hands and feet tied.

135
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,210
I don’t know what she wanted to do.

136
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,640
Anyway I got rid of the ropes in the morning

137
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,970
before she woke up.

138
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:10,930
That’s all?

139
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:12,470
Yes.

140
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,880
What else could happen?

141
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,100
Tang Li,

142
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,390
you spent a night with Ningjing alone.

143
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,680
You have to be responsible for her.

144
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,180
What…

145
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,970
Who is responsible for whom?

146
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,600
I’m the victim!

147
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,840
Why are you laughing?

148
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,390
Your Highness.

149
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,360
You can go first.

150
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,390
Yes.

151
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,390
Feiye,

152
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,260
it was my fault yesterday.

153
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,260
I shouldn’t have had fight with you.

154
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,300
You and Baili Mingxiang grew up together.

155
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,720
Of course she won’t hurt you.

156
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,050
It must be someone else.

157
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,480
You have to be careful.

158
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,390
I’ll find it out.

159
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,350
What’s this?

160
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,090
Osmanthus cakes.

161
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,640
I made these to apologize to you.

162
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,390
Have a try.

163
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:42,830
It tastes good.

164
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,850
Then have some more.

165
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,800
This is not too sweet.

166
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,300
It’s OK to have some more.

167
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,430
I’m not hungry now.

168
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,220
But the medicine…

169
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,260
It might go bad

170
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,960
if you don’t finish it soon.

171
00:06:59,350 --> 00:06:59,930
Fine.

172
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,740
I will take it back to my room.

173
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,950
My old disease broke out days ago.

174
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,010
So I called Mingxiang here

175
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,010
to treat me.

176
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,150
She knows my condition well.

177
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,430
Don’t overthink.

178
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,090
Do you need me to have a check?

179
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:20,510
No.

180
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:21,680
I’m fine now.

181
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,140
That’s great.

182
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:34,550
Yunxi.

183
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:35,970
What happened?

184
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,110
You smile happily.

185
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:38,850
Feiye explained to me

186
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,850
why he didn’t go to the Lantern Show.

187
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,970
You’re Princess Qin.

188
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,600
Why bother to explain?

189
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,600
By rights,

190
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,210
he doesn’t need to explain.

191
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,440
It means that he has me in his heart.

192
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,100
Come on.

193
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,890
You’re his wife.

194
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,610
Of course he has you in heart.

195
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,240
By the way,

196
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,100
I’m sorry that

197
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,510
I lost the track of Baili Mingxiang.

198
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,330
I apologize.

199
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,470
It’s OK.

200
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,800
I have put the antidote in the cakes.

201
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,300
If he is really poisoned,

202
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,370
he will be fine after he eats that.

203
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,800
He needs to eat all of them?

204
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,390
How much did he eat?

205
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,430
Only one.

206
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,050
Didn’t you say it will work only

207
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,310
after he eats them all?

208
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,260
The herb’s smell will be too heavy

209
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,180
if I only make one of it.

210
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,390
He will suspect.

211
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,600
So I made four.

212
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,510
Are you sure that he will eat them all?

213
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,970
Maybe.

214
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,090
I asked Madam Zhao

215
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,299
what his favorite food is.

216
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:43,030
He said it tasted good just now.

217
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,050
That’s great.

218
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,860
Your Highness.

219
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,730
This is the plan for the hijack.

220
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,180
Order everyone to gather at Serene Chamber.

221
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,100
Yes.

222
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:36,600
Your Highness.

223
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,180
The thing is settled.

224
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,300
After the case of Grand Commandant,

225
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,260
Tianqing has completely

226
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,060
taken over the task of watching the Poison Master.

227
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,550
According to His Majesty’s practice,

228
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,430
I’m afraid the prison Poison Master is in

229
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,560
has been given away.

230
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,890
The building of the dungeon

231
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,430
must be related to the transfer of him.

232
00:09:58,930 --> 00:09:59,510
Madam,

233
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,550
send this message to Yaogui Valley now

234
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,020
and let them to find out

235
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,010
what Ministry of Works is doing recently.

236
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,390
Your Highness, you don’t know that

237
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,790
these days the palace is under martial law.

238
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,430
Eunuchs and maids can’t leave at will.

239
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,890
The gate is under strict management.

240
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,760
If I want to find an excuse to leave now,

241
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,900
it’ll be easy to arouse suspicion.

242
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:20,640
Oh, no.

243
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,180
His Majesty has begun to transfer him?

244
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,800
We got the news so late.

245
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,970
Your Highness,

246
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,090
what should we do now?

247
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,750
This news has to be delivered.

248
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,390
How about

249
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,970
I pretend to go out

250
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,300
to buy herbs for you in Yaogui Valley?

251
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,090
No.

252
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,850
We’ll be exposed.

253
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,300
You can’t go out.

254
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,220
But someone can.

255
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,390
His Majesty arrives!

256
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,970
Your Majesty.

257
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,800
Rise.

258
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,430
Dear,

259
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,090
why are you ill again?

260
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,550
It’s all my fault.

261
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,600
Her Highness got weak after getting poisoned.

262
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,050
And she caught a cold today

263
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,970
and felt uncomfortable.

264
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,300
I didn’t take good care of Her Highness.

265
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,100
I’m to blame.

266
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,050
Where is the Imperial Physician?

267
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,800
Why didn’t you call the physician here?

268
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,600
Your Majesty,

269
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,090
I want Princess Qin to come

270
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,260
to treat me.

271
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,930
Princess Qin is outside the palace.

272
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,260
And

273
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,390
she is Prince Qin’s wife.

274
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,100
It’s not appropriate to call her here

275
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,970
frequently.

276
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,230
And you are not poisoned this time.

277
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,650
Just call the Imperial Physician.

278
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,430
Call Han Cong’an here.

279
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:44,550
Yes.

280
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,480
Your Majesty,

281
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,050
my period came two days early.

282
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,760
I want Princess Qin to help me with that.

283
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,850
We are both women after all.

284
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,110
It’s more convenient.

285
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,680
When I get well,

286
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,260
I can get ready

287
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,930
to have the baby for you.

288
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:08,720
Alright.

289
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,350
Just do as you said.

290
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:13,640
Guard!

291
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,180
Call Princess Qin here.

292
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,700
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

293
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,540
Your Highness.

294
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,180
Dealing with military affairs again?

295
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:33,600
Yes.

296
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,850
I made Osmanthus Cakes for Feiye.

297
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:38,600
You know?

298
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:39,930
Yes.

299
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,390
You have a good cooking skill.

300
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,050
I even

301
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,300
want to eat that cake.

302
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:44,800
You had it?

303
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,430
No.

304
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,140
His Highness didn’t give me.

305
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,670
I don’t dare to ask for that.

306
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,390
That’s great.

307
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,300
I know that

308
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,090
you made that especially for His Highness.

309
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,930
I’m not allowed to eat that.

310
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:00,640
No. No.

311
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,930
I don’t mean that.

312
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,010
If you like it,

313
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,760
I can make it for you next time.

314
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:05,680
Really?

315
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,640
Thank you, Your Highness.

316
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:12,760
Feiye,

317
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,600
how do you feel?

318
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,680
Do you need the medicine again?

319
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,140
I’m fine now.

320
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,090
Great!

321
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,130
Mingxiang,

322
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,640
thank you.

323
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,680
It’s my pleasure to help you.

324
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,220
Now the poisonous Gu is suppressed.

325
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,220
It won’t break out for now.

326
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,090
You can go back home first.

327
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,820
Or your father will be worried.

328
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,800
Feiye,

329
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,600
I want to stay here.

330
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,470
The poisonous Gu in your body

331
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,200
breaks out more and more often.

332
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,970
And the time is not under control.

333
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,050
When it breaks out the next time,

334
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,550
I can help you in time

335
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,050
if I’m here.

336
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,220
That makes sense.

337
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,290
You can write a letter now

338
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,550
and I will order them to send to your father.

339
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,880
Don’t make him worried.

340
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,530
Then, I’m going to write it now.

341
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,800
Osmanthus cakes.

342
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,600
I made these to apologize to you.

343
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,300
Have a try.

344
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,470
These cakes are no longer fresh.

345
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,350
Let me help you to throw them.

346
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:24,890
No.

347
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,350
If you like this,

348
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,100
I can make you some fresh ones.

349
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,410
I want to eat it now.

350
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,230
Just put it down.

351
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,390
Your Highness.

352
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,470
Eunuch Li is here.

353
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,720
He invites you to the palace

354
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,120
to treat Concubine Qing.

355
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,260
Treat her?

356
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,730
She is poisoned again?

357
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,640
I don’t know.

358
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,430
Please go to the hall now.

359
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,470
You are just weak.

360
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,680
It’s no big deal.

361
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,140
I can give you some medicine.

362
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,720
You’ll be alright after taking them.

363
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,140
Thank you, Yunxi.

364
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,300
I’m always weak.

365
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,250
When I was in Xiqiu,

366
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,650
I always got medicine from the Imperial Physician.

367
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,650
And

368
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,180
I have been having restoratives.

369
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,700
I took some of it to Tianning.

370
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,610
But I didn’t expect to finish them so soon.

371
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,140
Why not let the physician here to get you some?

372
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,360
Because there are many

373
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,250
precious herbs in the medicine.

374
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:04,780
I’m afraid the physicians here will say

375
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,840
I’m haughty with His Majesty’s love.

376
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,530
There are many rules in the palace.

377
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,990
I understand.

378
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,700
I asked Madam Zhao

379
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,220
to buy them in the market.

380
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,690
But they were not found.

381
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,860
Yunxi,

382
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,490
I heard from you that

383
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,150
Yaogui Valley has many precious herbs.

384
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,740
I wonder if there are any things I need.

385
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,750
What do you need?

386
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:28,950
Let me have a look.

387
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,570
They are really uncommon.

388
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,030
Even I have never

389
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,280
seen this Bodhi Lotus in Yaogui Valley.

390
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,190
I wonder if Gu Qishao has it.

391
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,360
Yunxi,

392
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,700
can you help me to find it there?

393
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:53,530
OK.

394
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:54,610
I will go there.

395
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,200
But

396
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,860
I can’t be sure whether I can

397
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,080
find them all there.

398
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,860
If I can’t,

399
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,950
you can use my prescription for now.

400
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,609
Yunxi,

401
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,150
I’m already so grateful

402
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,589
as long as you can help me.

403
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,400
I don’t mind whether you can find them all.

404
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,250
Then I’m going now.

405
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,109
Take care.

406
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:15,859
Alright.

407
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,140
You came for herbs again?

408
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,860
But I think you are not really here for herbs

409
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,240
but to see me.

410
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,990
I’m here to find the herbs for Concubine Qing.

411
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,110
Do you have these?

412
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,050
These are really precious herbs.

413
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,460
Here is it.

414
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,140
I’ll find them one by one.

415
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:14,570
You can wait here.

416
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,200
I’ll ask Baisu

417
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,860
to get you some Bodhi Lotuses first.

418
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,900
And we can get the rest of them on the mountain.

419
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,500
You really have Bodhi Lotus?

420
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,490
What?

421
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,320
You don’t trust me?

422
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,700
That’s amazing!

423
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,880
You even have this?

424
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,530
Bodhi Lotus is

425
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,450
hard to raise,

426
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,280
pick

427
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,190
and preserve.

428
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,190
I just took a chance to see if you have it.

429
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,320
But you really have it!

430
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,580
Do you want to learn it?

431
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,400
If you can stay in my valley

432
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,610
for years,

433
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,190
I can teach you

434
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,530
how to raise it.

435
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,470
How about it?

436
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,530
When I finish my job,

437
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,450
I will come to learn that.

438
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,050
Let’s go get the herbs first.

439
00:18:59,070 --> 00:18:59,740
Gu Qishao,

440
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,150
why do you look strange today?

441
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,200
I’m wondering

442
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,860
why you became

443
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,900
an errand of the King’s concubine.

444
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,700
Physicians save people.

445
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,530
I’m just doing my job as a physician.

446
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,570
Your job?

447
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,030
They have so many maids and servants.

448
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,400
Why do you bother to help them?

449
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,860
They even asked you to come here to get herbs.

450
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:22,740
Because I’m the only

451
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,280
close friend of you.

452
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,010
Poison girl,

453
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,800
let me give you an advice.

454
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,780
You’d better stay away from people in the palace.

455
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,530
It’s Qishao.

456
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,900
The conflicts in the palace are nasty.

457
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,110
I heard Concubine Qing is favored by the King.

458
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,000
And you saved her life.

459
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,780
The other concubines must hate you a lot.

460
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,580
I don’t want that, too.

461
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,070
But I have no choice.

462
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:49,610
Gu Qishao,

463
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,030
thank you for helping me every time.

464
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:53,610
Qishao.

465
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:54,990
Ms. Han.

466
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,470
The Bodhi Lotus you want.

467
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,110
Thanks.

468
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,860
I have got the herbs I want.

469
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,700
I’m going now.

470
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,950
Oh, right. Qishao,

471
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,780
next time I come here,

472
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,950
I will make you some of my secret poisons

473
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,780
in return.

474
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,930
You always say next time.

475
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,240
I don’t even know when you will

476
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,100
come next time.

477
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,950
You just say that

478
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,500
without real actions.

479
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,600
How about this?

480
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,240
Make the poisons for me today.

481
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,070
I need to go back to make cakes.

482
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:21,790
Next time.

483
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,830
Next time I will.

484
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:29,990
Qishao,

485
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,150
why did you remind Han Yunxi

486
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,360
to beware of Chu Qingge?

487
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,190
If Han Yunxi

488
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,530
can help us to deliver the message,

489
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,200
everything will be convenient.

490
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,530
That’s because Qishao likes Ms. Han.

491
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:39,990
He doesn’t want to make use of her

492
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,590
and get her involved in this.

493
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,530
Then why did Qishao

494
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,320
go to fish for the information?

495
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,520
You’re so talkative.

496
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,360
Let’s go.

497
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,960
Let’s see what message

498
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,520
Chu Qingge delivered to us.

499
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,450
Chu Qingge found that Long Tianqing

500
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,780
is overseeing the construction of the dungeons.

501
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,780
She suspects Poison Master will be transferred.

502
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,110
But she doesn’t know

503
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,400
the details about it.

504
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,950
And the King strengthened the guard.

505
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,860
The message will be hard to deliver.

506
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,320
Since that,

507
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,490
he will be transferred these days.

508
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:41,610
Qishao,

509
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,700
it’s urgent.

510
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,280
We have to arrange it as soon as possible

511
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,610
to get Poison Master out.

512
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,200
Qishao,

513
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,240
it’s late to call reinforce from Beili now.

514
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,640
Then the Crown Prince should do it himself.

515
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,990
Although the Grand Commandant is dead,

516
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,530
the foundation he laid for him is still there.

517
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,530
But

518
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,320
the Crown Prince has lost his morale

519
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,710
because the King prefers Long Tianqing.

520
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,570
He even ignored you

521
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,030
when you went to see him.

522
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,700
Will it work if you go to him

523
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,750
again this time?

524
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,200
I can only take the risk now.

525
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,260
[Gorgeous Chamber]

526
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,640
-Another shot.
-Pour me.

527
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,900
Pour me another shot.

528
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:26,970
Your Highness.

529
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,490
Mr. Gu?

530
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,380
Come on. Let’s drink together.

531
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:36,930
Who asked you to stand up?

532
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,330
Did I ask you to do that?

533
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,260
Your Highness,

534
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,570
I heard that you have been

535
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,300
in Gorgeous Chamber recently.

536
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:43,950
I haven’t seen you for a while.

537
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,280
Why are you so addicted to play now?

538
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,190
You don’t know that.

539
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,030
I got the truth lately that

540
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,900
life is short,

541
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,970
I should seize the day to have fun.

542
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,490
Why do you think so?

543
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:00,900
Why?

544
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,780
After my uncle died,

545
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,370
I’m like walking on thin ice every day.

546
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,860
I tried so hard to please my father.

547
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,520
But he just either blamed me or scolded me.

548
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,770
And he treated Long Tianqing so well instead.

549
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,950
Isn’t it

550
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,320
the same as before?

551
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,190
You even came to ask me

552
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,810
how to fight against the second prince.

553
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,030
Now, Your Highness,

554
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,490
you are getting closer with Concubine Qing.

555
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,780
Are you going to give up now?

556
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,990
What’s more, I have found the result

557
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,880
of the poison you got secretly.

558
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:36,320
Don’t you want

559
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,320
to crack down Long Tianqing’s mother

560
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,030
with Concubine Qing?

561
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,210
Concubine Qing almost got killed.

562
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:47,490
But father didn’t do anything to his mother.

563
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:51,860
Isn’t it obvious that he doesn’t want to

564
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:55,170
investigate it for protecting Long Tianqing?

565
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,480
What’s ridiculous is

566
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,490
uncle said before he died that

567
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,080
as long as I don’t make big mistake,

568
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,990
father won’t abolish me.

569
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,530
Now

570
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,900
it looks like a joke.

571
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,490
So you just give up

572
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,970
and start to waste time for fun?

573
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:21,860
Or

574
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,280
what should I do?

575
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:26,180
If you keep doing like this,

576
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,150
it will arouse others’ suspicions.

577
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:30,410
And it will make others get your weakness

578
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,740
and get yourself abolished soon.

579
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,650
Whatever.

580
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:41,190
Everything I do is wrong

581
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,200
in father’s eyes anyway.

582
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,450
Guards!

583
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,150
Guards!

584
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,280
Help!

585
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,860
What are you doing?

586
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,720
Your Highness,

587
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,530
this is your ending

588
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,960
if Long Tianqing takes the throne.

589
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,320
Since that,

590
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,430
there’s no turning back for me.

591
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,490
I have to move forward?

592
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,180
Your Highness,

593
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,230
you can’t solve a problem by running away.

594
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,530
Then you will be dealt with.

595
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:34,200
Your life

596
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,700
is in your

597
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,490
own hands.

598
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,250
I don’t want to die.

599
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,800
I don’t want to die.

600
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:43,650
Mr. Gu,

601
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,900
please help me.

602
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,240
Don’t worry.

603
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,180
I’ll try my best to help you.

604
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,400
Then what should we do now?

605
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,930
Let’s ask Long Tianqing out

606
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,000
to see what he is doing recently.

607
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,950
And then destroy what he has been doing

608
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,320
to let His Majesty suspect of his ability.

609
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,240
Then, you can get your position

610
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,520
in His Majesty’s heart back gradually.

611
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:03,900
OK.

612
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,780
I’ll do as you said.

613
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:07,570
Since

614
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,730
you have found out the poison,

615
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,240
I’ll send people to inform

616
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,300
Concubine Qing now

617
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:14,010
to let her prepare early,

618
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:17,700
making her be against Noble Consort Xiao

619
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,650
to help me take down Long Tianqing.

620
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,280
Your Highness, calm down.

621
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,580
He just thinks he got the favor of father!

622
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,320
How dare he let me wait here for long!

623
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,990
Brother, I’m sorry.

624
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,150
I’m busy.

625
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,780
Father gave me a lot of work

626
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,780
to do.

627
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,700
Sorry to let you wait.

628
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,520
You’re helping father.

629
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:01,740
Don’t bother to apologize.

630
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,870
Come on, have a seat.

631
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,150
No, thanks.

632
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,610
I just came here to check how you are doing.

633
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,210
I still got many things to do.

634
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,460
I need to leave now.

635
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,070
Tianqing,

636
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:14,200
are you really busy

637
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,490
or pretending to be busy

638
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,030
for doing jobs for father?

639
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:23,900
Brother,

640
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,280
to be honest,

641
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,950
father asked me to transfer Poison Master.

642
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,820
I have built three dungeons

643
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,360
to confuse those who want to cause troubles.

644
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,110
Today is the day to transfer.

645
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,070
So,

646
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,240
brother,

647
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,240
see you.

648
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,430
Your Highness.

649
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,650
Shouldn’t you tell the details

650
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:02,110
about the transferring to His Highness?

651
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,530
I just told him

652
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,250
those things deliberately.

653
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,110
I want to stimulate him

654
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:10,700
to make mistakes.

655
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,220
If he really goes to take Poison Master away

656
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,860
and let me get the evidence

657
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,070
to tell father,

658
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,400
do you think

659
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,240
he still can

660
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,740
keep his position of Crown Prince?

661
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,200
What if His Highness really

662
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,650
takes Poison Master away?

663
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:29,360
I know him well.

664
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:31,070
He can’t succeed to do that

665
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,200
with his force.

666
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,780
How dare him!

667
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:38,810
Your Highness,

668
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,400
do you believe

669
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:42,090
what Tianqing said just now?

670
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,350
I have spies in Ministry of Works.

671
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:47,810
I know that they are building dungeons.

672
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,200
So what he said just now

673
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,110
could be right.

674
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,710
I think this is a good chance.

675
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,880
Why do you think this is a good chance?

676
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,490
Now His Majesty gave him an important job.

677
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:01,320
It’s bad for you.

678
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,890
If we can take Poison Master away,

679
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,740
His Majesty will think

680
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:07,750
that Tianqing is incapable.

681
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,860
And it can strengthen our force.

682
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,150
Isn't that killing two birds with one stone?

683
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,490
But what if father

684
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:14,450
finds that?

685
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,740
He told me this news

686
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,320
just to lead me to his trap.

687
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,190
No.

688
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:22,450
I can’t jump in his trap now.

689
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,700
Your Highness,

690
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,110
rest assured.

691
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,070
You asked me to rest assured last time.

692
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,030
What was the end?

693
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,560
Uncle warned me before he died

694
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,740
that I should keep a low profile now.

695
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,920
Grand Commandant was right.

696
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,410
But time won’t wait for us.

697
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,240
You have seen how arrogant

698
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,200
Tianqing is.

699
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,820
You want peace.

700
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:41,740
But I think

701
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,950
he won’t give us more time.

702
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,350
Your Highness,

703
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,820
I promise you I won’t fail this time.

704
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:51,270
Please give me some warriors.

705
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,190
I’ll take the warriors to strike.

706
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,820
I’ll poison them at the first place.

707
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,320
When it is finished,

708
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,860
whether we succeed or not,

709
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:00,780
they’ll all die.

710
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:03,490
No one can find you out.

711
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,150
Except us, someone else

712
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,610
will also go to hijack tonight.

713
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,530
You mean, Prince Qin?

714
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,200
Yes.

715
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,980
So, you don’t need to worry.

716
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,390
It’s a plan to kill three birds with one stone.

717
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,740
We can frame Prince Qin,

718
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,950
and get Tianqing blamed

719
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,650
for being incapable.

720
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,860
Then, thank you for this.

721
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:31,200
Don’t worry.

[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

723
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:39,320
How is everything arranged on the way?

724
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,520
Everything is ready.

725
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,280
The final war is in these days.

726
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,610
-Yes.
-Don’t slack off.

727
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:45,850
Your Highness,

728
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,110
His Majesty invited you

729
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,740
and Princess Qin to go to the palace together.

730
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,030
Wow!

731
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,820
You guessed it right again.

732
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,190
His Majesty really asked you to go there

733
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,450
to watch you in person.

734
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:58,490
What’s the reason

735
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,280
to invite Princess Qin together?

736
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,570
Her Royal Highness misses Her Highness a lot

737
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,610
for not seeing her for long.

738
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,740
She wants to talk with Her Highness.

739
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:07,400
Brother,

740
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:08,360
Han Yunxi married you because of

741
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,530
the order of Her Royal Highness.

742
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,650
They are so close.

743
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,240
Do we need to beware of her?

744
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,410
You may go now.

745
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,360
Yes.

746
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,150
Do as our plan.

747
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,280
Got it.

748
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,190
Your Highness,

749
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,200
Her Royal Highness ordered you

750
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,280
to go to the palace.

751
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,400
His Majesty also called His Highness together.

752
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,740
Her Royal Highness called me now?

753
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:49,030
Did she get any new ways to torture me?

754
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,920
Why is His Majesty involved?

755
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,000
Is this a coincidence?

756
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:19,900
I don’t believe that

757
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,760
mine is not as delicious as yours.

758
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,210
What’s this smell?

759
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,030
Why is there a smell of herbs?

760
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,570
This is what she makes to Feiye.

761
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,100
She wants to detoxify the poison?

762
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:50,320
Feiye,

763
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,180
how do you feel recently?

764
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,250
Do you feel better?

765
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:56,080
Brother, thanks for your concern.

766
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:57,310
I’m better now.

767
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,820
Your breath looks stable.

768
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,360
It’s the same as before.

769
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,190
Feiye,

770
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,360
you have to have enough rest.

771
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,930
Thanks for your concern.

772
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,700
I have been resting at home,

773
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,700
neglected to practice playing Go.

774
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,150
If I make any mistake later,

775
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,610
please don’t laugh at me.

776
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,030
Han Yunxi,

777
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:31,190
Prince Qin went back home for illness.

778
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,360
You are his wife.

779
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:36,030
Do you know what illness he got?

780
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,200
I heard he got heavily injured

781
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,190
while practicing martial arts skills.

782
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,650
He thought I was annoying.

783
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:42,190
So he kicked me out of Mingyue Chamber.

784
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,820
I don’t know how he is doing recently.

785
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,680
Maybe he has some secrets

786
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,320
that he doesn’t want you to know.

787
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,820
You really know nothing of it?

788
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,990
Please forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

789
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:56,790
Because Concubine Qing is sick,

790
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,570
I was called to the palace twice.

791
00:33:58,570 --> 00:33:59,990
And Consort Yi’s niece

792
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,360
Baili Mingxiang came to our mansion,

793
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,030
who always accompanies His Highness.

794
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,150
To not be exposed,

795
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,640
I can only take no action.

796
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,530
Baili Mingxiang?

797
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:14,110
The chosen daughter-in-law of her.

798
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:15,570
After she came,

799
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,320
you got kicked out.

800
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:21,699
Looks like you will become

801
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:24,239
the abandoned wife soon.

802
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:26,449
So, Your Royal Highness,

803
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:28,320
I have no value to be used.

804
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:31,489
Can you just tell me my mother’s whereabouts?

805
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,070
I will ask for the divorce

806
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,190
and get away from this.

807
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,199
And I won’t

808
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:36,860
tell anyone about

809
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:38,239

810
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:51,100
General, everyone is here.

811
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:53,110
Set off!

812
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:54,070
Yes!

813
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,570
Give my order. Get ready.

814
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:02,780
Yes.

815
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:09,740
Set off!

816
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:10,740
Yes!

817
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,190
-Set off!
-Yes!

818
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,950
Three ways together.

819
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:11,110
Feiye, you need to be careful.

820
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:14,250
Withdraw!

821
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,150
This time,

822
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,520
the three dungeons outside

823
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,190
are all traps.

824
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:52,990
One hour after they set off,

825
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:56,860
you take Poison Master to the dungeon in palace.

826
00:38:58,530 --> 00:38:59,200
Yes.

827
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,530
Brother,

828
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,200
you ask Xifeng to have a quick attack

829
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,110
to see if Poison Master is real there.

830
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:41,860
What if His Majesty

831
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,110
knows your plan?

832
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:47,190
Poison Master won’t be in any of them.

is here.

-The palace?
-The palace?

840
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,510
The palace is the safest place.

841
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,150
Putting it under his nose

842
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:06,710
is the most secure.

843
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:08,650
I heard that Tianqing

844
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:11,150
also asked Ministry of Works to repair

845
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,550
the Imperial Ancestral Temple meanwhile.

846
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:17,360
The temple is His Majesty’s final choice.

847
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,900
How can we know that

848
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:21,150
they are really sending him back to palace?

849
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:23,350
In order not to attract the attentions,

850
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,200
His Majesty will ask

851
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:27,670
Tianqing pretend to withdraw to take

852
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:31,070
Poison Master back to the palace secretly.

853
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,070
I see.

854

Tianqing usually takes the carriage.

855
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:39,200
We can tell whether there is

856
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,400
one or two people inside

00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,190

858

Brother,

859
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,530
since you know His Majesty will do that,

860
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,790
do we still need to hijack the three ways?

861
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:48,570
Yes.

862
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,530
It’s to make him think

863
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,150
that I made wrong judgement

864
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,900
to let his guard down.

865
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,760
Then we can attack surprisingly.

866
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,730
His Majesty is very discreet.

867
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,810
He will call me to the palace

868
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,680
on the day of the transfer

869
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,360
to watch me in person.

870
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,740
What about the Dark Guard Feng?

871
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,150
We can’t defeat him.

872
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,240
You keep close watch on Tianqing.

873
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:14,990
When he goes near the gate of the city,

874
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,450
release the whistling arrows.

875
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:18,110
When General Baili sees them,

876
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:19,780
he will send people

877
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,360
to see His Majesty

878
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:22,930
to report the emergency.

879
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,280
After His Majesty leaves,

880
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,940
I will find a chance to get out.

881
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:34,570
The arrows keep whistling in the city.

882
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:36,190
I wonder what happened.

883
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:41,040
It sounds like it’s out of the city.

884
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,190
If you are worried,

885
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:46,070
I can go out to have a check.

886
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,120
Don’t bother.

887
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,280
It must be some rascals.

888
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,020
I can let others to check on it.

889
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,990
Let’s focus on our game.
