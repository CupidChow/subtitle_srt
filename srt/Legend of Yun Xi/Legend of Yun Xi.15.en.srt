00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,190
-We misunderstood each other.
-Misunderstood?

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,280
Changbing

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,010
is young, innocent,

6
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,070
and messes around.

7
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:11,860
Look,

8
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,410
her father

9
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,070
has taught her a lesson.

10
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:17,110
Sister,

11
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,650
do not get mad

12
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:21,810
at a girl.

13
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,030
Everyone knows her.

14
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,180
You indulge her too much.

15
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,860
Yes, yes.

16
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,070
My apology,

17
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,650
Your Highness.

18
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,700
I can’t afford it, sister.

19
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,070
I was just kidding.

20
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,490
People do indulge their children.

21
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,370
I am no exception.

22
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,030
I indulge Yunxi.

23
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,570
Maid,

24
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,140
bring the ten-sect cicada exuviation.

25
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,720
Have some tea, sister.

26
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:13,700
Your Highness.

27
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,450
This

28
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,340
is the ten-sect cicada exuviation.

29
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,700
Bring it to Yunxi.

30
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,570
Tell her to heal Changbing.

31
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,950
Thank you.

32
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,200
Changbing will be grateful.

33
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,900
So long.

34
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,490
It’s time to say goodbye.

35
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,610
Treating her is important.

36
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,030
Then I won't keep you.

37
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,360
See you, sister.

38
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:58,490
She’s been against me for her life.

39
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,820
She never begged me.

40
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,280
I don’t know why

41
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,259
Han Yunxi wants the ten-sect cicada exuviation.

42
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:10,449
Is she intentional or unintentional?

43
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,070
Anyway it’s good.

44
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,200
The late king gave it to me.

45
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,780
I gave it to her.

46
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,150
It makes me happy.

47
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,400
When Han Yunxi is back,

48
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,860
I’ll reward her.

00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,190
The princess is alright.

51
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,360
It doesn’t itch now.

52
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:39,820

Grandmother, look.

57
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:46,740
Let me see.

58
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,320
They’re fading.

Really?

60
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,090
Yes.

61
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:53,900
Look.

62
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,070
Aren’t they?

63
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,140
Excuse me.

64
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,050
The princess is alright now.

65
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,280
May I leave?

66
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,690
They’re fading.

67
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:01,280
Yes.

68
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,450
You’re beautiful again.

69
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,700
Great, grandmother!

70
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,230
You got there and kick away the ladder.

71
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,240
These two are alike.

72
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,030
Changbing,

73
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,360
you’re beautiful again.

74
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,820
Really!

75
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,700
They are fading.

76
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,780
Changbing,

77
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,290
you will

78
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,610
remember the lesson.

79
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,190
I did it for you.

80
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,110
It was a disgrace.

81
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,150
Consort Yi

82
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,610
had her day.

83
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,050
Thank you,

84
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,360
grandmother.

85
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,370
I

86
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,930
will behave myself.

87
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,530
I won’t embarrass you again.

88
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,650
That’s great.

89
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:41,890
I didn’t know

90
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,970
the old witch loves her ill-bred

91
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,650
granddaughter so much.

92
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,200
It’s about the mid-autumn.

93
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,250
I wonder how aunt and Yunyi are.

94
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,200
I miss them.

95
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,579
Father, don’t worry.

96
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,860
Whether

97
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,990
I am happy

Foods in the palace look good

118
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,620
but taste terrible.

119
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,960
And too many rules.

120
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,010
I’d rather go home

I make her mad

00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,370
and she loses her appetite,

124
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,970
and the yummy foods are mine.

125
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,740
They said when I was not home,

126

mother punished you.

127
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,090

179
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,450
for this, will you?

180
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,950
You have a glib tongue.

181
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,570
I have his favor for years.

182
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,410
I’d like someone else

183
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,700
to serve His Majesty.

184
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,530
I do not envy.

185
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,320
Thank you, sister.

186
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,930
Sister, you set a model for the harem.

187
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,780
I admire you.

188
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,610
You flattered me.

189
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,050
I heard

190
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,290
Princess Changbing had ringworm

191
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,450
and was healed.

192
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,140
I’ve been in the palace for long

193
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,740
and haven’t paid her a visit.

194
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,150
I think this is a good time.

195
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,490
Sister, you…

196
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,770
I am visiting Changbing, too.

197
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,289
Let’s go together.

198
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:40,200
Yes.

199
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,610
Lyuluo, come over.

200
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,860
Is my face alright?

201
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,280
Is this a dream?

202
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,130
Princess,

203
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,010
your face is alright.

204
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,450
The red spots are gone.

205
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,190
That’s good.

206
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,400
Consort Qin is wonderful.

207
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,730
Don’t mention that bitch!

208
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:11,530
Yes.

209
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,900
Han Yunxi has nothing but good luck.

210
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,530
It was the Thousand Years’ Blood Jade

211
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,060
and ten-sect cicada exuviation that worked.

212
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,810
Noble Consort Xiao arrives!

213
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,240
Concubine Qing arrives!

214
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,930
Noble Consort Xiao.

215
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:32,990
Concubine Qing.

216
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,030
Changbing.

217
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,360
I heard your face was almost damaged.

218
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,150
How do you feel now?

219
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,030
Thank you, Noble Consort Xiao.

220
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,860
I’m fine now.

221
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,990
It’s rare.

222
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,410
We don’t expect to meet

223
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,650
the Noble Consort Xiao every day.

224
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,530
Well today,

225
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,690
your presence graces

226
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,030
my Wangyou Palace.

227
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,140
Shouldn’t you

228
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,870
be with my father and serve him?

229
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,860
Changbing,

230
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,280
I am your mother.

231
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,130
You don’t feel well

232
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:00,930
and I come to visit you.

233
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,300
Isn’t it natural?

234
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,570
I used to have

235
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,370
cold or headache

236
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,780
from time to time,

237
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,990
but you didn't care about me.

238
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,360
Mother?

239
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,700
I dare not to call you mother.

240
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,290
Grandmother will blame me

241
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,700
for neglecting of rules.

242
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,280
Are you Concubine Qing?

243
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,820
Your Highness.

244
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,650
No wonder they say your beauty

245
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,320
is known to the three nations.

246
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,740
No wonder it’s said

247
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,320
father favors you so much.

248
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,110
With your face,

249
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,730
I’m afraid all women in the palace

250
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,030
feel ashamed.

251
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,130
Noble Consort Xiao,

252
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,200
am I right?

253
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,190
Yes.

254
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,530
She has

255
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:46,990
a beautiful face.

256
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,210
If Concubine Qing

257
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,970
and father have a princess

258
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,070
or a prince,

259
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,050
it must

260
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,250
be like an angel.

261
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,850
You flattered me, princess.

262
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,330
My beauty

263
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,950
comes from the makeup.

264
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,370
You

265
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,450
are blessed with

266
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,610
natural beauty.

267
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:04,810
You and General Mu

268
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,650
are a heaven-made match.

269
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,170
Really?

270
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,530
You met Qingwu?

271
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:10,450
Yes.

272
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,130
When I

273
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,900
served His Majesty dessert,

274
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,490
he was there.

275
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,290
His Majesty said

276
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,530
he stands out

277
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,970
the young generation

278
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,250
and is the nation’s hope.

279
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,650
In my eyes,

280
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,740
you’re so pretty.

281
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,950
General Mu is so lucky.

282
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,960
You flattered me, Your Highness.

283
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,450
Your Highness,

284
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,180
I heard

285
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,490
you got the ringworm.

286
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,620
Are you alright now?

287
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,740
Yes, thank you.

288
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,780
This is the facial cream

289
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,810
made by the imperial physician of Xiqiu.

290
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,130
I hope it may help

291
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,280
you recover.

292
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,950
So many of them!

293
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,130
Everyone knows Xiqiu has

294
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,200
the best skin care.

295
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,900
Are they for me?

296
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:50,740
Yes.

297
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,900
You are so sweet.

298
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,250
It was

299
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,330
your Thousand Years’ Blood Jade

300
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,860
that helped me heal my face.

301
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,030
Was it?

302
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,370
The Thousand Years’ Blood Jade

303
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,690
helped the princess.

304
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,180
It’s a great honor.

305
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,180
Your Highness,

306
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,650
you’re so sweet.

307
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,190
Changbing!

308
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,530
I suddenly remembered

309
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,010
I have something urgent to do.

310
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,320
I will say goodbye.

311
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,070
Enjoy yourselves.

312
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,970
Goodbye, Noble Consort Xiao.

313
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,740
I won’t see you out.

314
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,740
Witch!

315
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,360
Your Highness.

316
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,700
Ignore her.

317
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,130
That witch

318
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,490
takes advantage of her son

319
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,860
and disrespects me.

320
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,820
Who knows what makes her

321
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,900
come to see me?

322
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,450
And her son Tianqing

323
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,210
always bullies the Crown Prince.

324
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,110
I hate them.

325
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,050
Alright, enough.

326
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,210
Would you like some dessert?

327
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,030
Great.

328
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,400
I am hungry.

329
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,370
-What do you have?
-Many of them.

330
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,070
Come on.

331
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,950
These will go to aunt.

332
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,570
-These will go to Yunyi.
-Yunxi.

333
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,200
Yunxi.

334
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,010
So many gifts!

335
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,140
Where are you going?

336
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,250
I’ve married in for three months

337
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,700
without revisiting my home.

338
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,940
It’s about the mid-autumn.

339
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,330
The full moon blesses home reunion.

340
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,200
I wanna go home.

341
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,490
Will Feiye go with you?

342
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,360
He’s too busy.

343
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,150
I just revisit my home.

344
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,570
He’s Prince Qin.

345
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:28,500
Not convenient.

346
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,780
He’s not going.

347
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,370
No way!

348
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,930
If you revisit home for the first time

349
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,330
without your husband,

350
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,900
you'll be laughed at.

351
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,290
Let them do.

352
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,190
I don’t care.

353
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,700
A wood is cut straight along the ink marker.

354
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,280
The king takes advices and is wise.

355
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,490
The king is wise

356
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,740
and his ministers voluntarily give advices.

357
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,950
Who …

358
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,270
Who dares not to follow
my king’s wise instructions!

359
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,030
You again!

360
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,210
Don’t worry.

361
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,450
I don’t come to see you.

362
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,770
You don’t come to see me?

363
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,650
Every time you see Feiye,

364
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,740
you hide from him.

365
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,090
How could you come to see me

366
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,360
in Mingyue Chamber?

367
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,200
Get to your book!

368
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,570
Brother.

369
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:24,130
Get to your book!

370
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,530
It’s the science of king.

371
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,900
Don’t waste time fighting,

372
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,660
or get out of here!

373
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,770
I don’t want to be a king.

374
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:32,530
Why should I learn

375
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,530
the awkward text?

376
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,650
It’s unfair!

377
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,780
She started it!

378
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,610
Feiye,

379
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,330
Yunxi is going home.

380
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,610
You’re her husband.

381
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,190
Why don’t you go with her?

382
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,610
I’m busy.

383
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,320
Feiye.

384
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,740
Yunxi is so good to you.

385
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,490
Why can’t you

386
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,740
be good to her?

387
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,990
Feiye,

388
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,490
don’t be like this man

389
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,410
who always breaks woman’s heart.

390
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,130
Woman has a tender heart.

391
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,180
If her heart is broken,

392
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,050
she won’t be like a fool

393
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,360
and waiting for you.

394
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,860
Are you crazy?

395
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,690
Princess Qin

396
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,730
sent a message

397
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,860
that she and Prince Qin will come home.

398
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,030
Why haven’t they come yet?

399
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,990
Prince Qin is coming.

400
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,250
I got up for makeup

401
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,450
before day break.

402
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,530
Silly girl.

403
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,240
There they come!

404
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,490
Why are you alone?

405
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,620
Where is Prince Qin?

406
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,450
Yes, I’m alone.

407
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,180
He’s too busy

408
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,070
to come.

409
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,530
The young prince is sick.

410
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,340
Lord went to the palace in the morning.

411
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,740
I don’t come for him.

412
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,150
I come for aunt and Yunyi.

413
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,290
Seems that you

414
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,780
have forgotten us

415
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,460
after you became Princess Qin.

416
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,860
Where are aunt and Yunyi?

417
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,050
She’s in the kitchen

418
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,450
making you the banquet.

419
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:51,930
Well,

420
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,590
I don’t think it’s necessary.

421
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,190
Prince Qin is not coming.

422
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,860
An average family

423
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,450
has average food.

424
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,930
Though Prince Qin is not here,

425
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,130
I am Princess Qin.

426
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,250
Princess Qin’s food

427
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,650
shall be carefully made.

428
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,609
Sister,

429
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:06,700
do you understand?

430
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,740
You!

431
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,319
Revisiting home alone?

432
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,240
Did he divorce you?

433
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,089
I…

434
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:17,250
A divorced woman

435
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,170
has no right

436
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,319
to revisit her home.

437
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,950
Han Ruoxue.

438
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,089
Her Royal Highness

439
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:23,450
made me Princess Qin.

440
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,410
Watch your language.

441
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,490
Or you’ll be executed.

442
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,109
Are you threatening me?

443
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,410
You come to revisit home.

444
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,540
Where’s Prince Qin?

445
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,170
It is the rule that

446
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,530
a newly married woman

447
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,020
shouldn’t revisit home by herself.

448
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,410
You come back alone.

449
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,860
You must be divorced.

450
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,150
Oh, no.

451
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,820
He has to marry you before divorcing you.

452
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,010
Prince Qin did not

453
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:46,930
kick your sedan.

454
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,610
He did not marry you at all.

455
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,400
I…

456
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,950
It’s between Prince Qin and me.

457
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,650
It’s not up to you to cut in,

458
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,050
daughter of a concubine.

459
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,530
If

460
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,890
your mother

461
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,140
hadn't seduced my father

462
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,690
and married in pregnant,

463
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,750
how could my mother have come second?

464
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,070
Aren’t you ashamed to revisit home?

465
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,700
If it were not for your mother,

466
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,380
I would be the lineal daughter!

467
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,280
I would be Princess Qin!

468
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,700
♫ If this world fades ♫

469
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,400
♫ I’ll stay with you ♫

470
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,280
Your Highness.

471
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,820
♫ Withstand the innumerable words ♫

472
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,900
♫ If everything in the world ♫

473
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,150
♫ Breaks down ruthlessly ♫

474
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:50,650
♫ I’ll seam it for you with my strings♫

475
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,200
Han Cong’an greets Your Highness.

476
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,900
I didn’t know Your Highness was coming.

477
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,780
My apology for not greeting you.

478
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,340
Pardon me, Your Highness.

479
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,870
Indeed you didn’t greet me.

480
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,830
I’m afraid if I didn’t come,

481
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,240
you wouldn’t come back.

482
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,040
Pardon me, Your Highness.

483
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,130
It was because

484
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,330
the young prince got sick,

485
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,990
I had to take care of him.

486
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,360
You taught your family well.

487
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,560
Princess Qin came home today.

488
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,720
Not only was she not welcomed,

489
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,500
and kept out of your door.

490
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,820
What would you have done

491
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,030
if I hadn't arrived on time?

492
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,520
Your Highness,

493
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,070
I didn’t teach her well.

494
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,900
I beg your pardon.

495
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,820
My daughter was young

496
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,830
and offended Her Highness.

497
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,860
I will give her a lesson.

498
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,240
Your Highness,

499
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,820
please forgive her.

500
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,820
Your Highness,

501
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,900
before Princess Qin was married,

502
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,780
she and Ruoxue were good friends.

503
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:02,900
Just now,

504
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,250
they were

505
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,150
making fun at the door.

506
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,490
Han Yunxi marries me.

507
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,900
She is Princess Qin.

508
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,860
This is the hierarchy.

509
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,620
Lady Xu, do you want to tell me

510
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,780
you are senior to me?

511
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,730
I dare not. My apology!

512
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,610
Dare not?

513
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,200
Yes, you dare to!

514
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,200
Your daughter disregards

515
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,490
the hierarchy!

516
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,450
Even if

517
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,900
Han Yunxi is not Princess Qin,

518
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,160
she’s the lineal daughter of Physician Han.

519
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,740
A concubine’s daughter

520
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,650
dares to violently yell

521
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,980
to the lineal daughter!

522
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,240
Where are the manners?

523
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,370
Your Highness,

524
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,730
it’s all my fault.

525
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,190
I beg your pardon.

526
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,450
Your Highness,

527
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,790
show mercy, please.

528
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,010
Show mercy.

529
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:57,870
Your Highness,

530
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,570
it’s my home revisit.

531
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,610
That’s enough.

532
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,100
For the sake of Princess Qin,

533
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,650
I spare your lives.

534
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,200
Yet your offense

535
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,610
is not condoned.

536
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,190
Princess Qin doesn’t bring her maids.

537
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,490
You will be

538
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,650
the maid of Princess Qin.

539
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,200
You will learn

540
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,280
the hierarchy

541
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,900
and seniority.

542
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,070
Yes,

543
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,820
Your Highness.

544
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:41,860
Besides,

545
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,530
I am not

546
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,740
interested in marrying sisters.

547
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,570
I advise you behave yourself

548
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,530
and remember who you are.

549
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,950
Watch your language.

550
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,860
Don’t stain my name

551
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,990
and my wife’s name.

552
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,450
You can’t afford it.

553
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,190
Yes.

554
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,950
I’ll keep it in mind.

555
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,740
Next time.

556
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,750
Next time I’ll give you a treat.

557
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:31,820
Wait.

558
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,130
Always next time.

559
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,240
When is next time?

560
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,610
In ten days,

561
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,530
right here,

562
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,780
I’ll give you a treat.

563
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,280
Qishao.

564
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,530
Baisu.

565
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,700
Right on time.

566
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:49,700
Where's that new clothes

567
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,230
you told me about last time?

568
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,690
Are you looking for this?

569
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,450
Yes.

570
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,130
That’s it.

571
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,570
Are you going out?

572
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,950
I will meet a friend.

573
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:06,970
Maybe tonight

574
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:07,770
I won’t come back.

575
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:08,770
Don’t wait for me.

576
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,450
Who is your friend?

577
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,740
A man or a woman?

578
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,070
Curious?

579
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,820
You’re curious.

580
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,270
I’m not telling you.

581
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,030
Look at him.

582
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,200
Hey, are you alright?

583
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,860
Do you know who the friend is?

584
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,490
I asked him.

585
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,570
He didn’t tell me.

586
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:30,780
You know it?

587
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,740
I think

588
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,200
he goes to meet Han Yunxi.

589
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,610
Yeah.

590
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:35,810
It must be her.

591
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:36,970
At this moment,

592
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:37,530
he went to see

593
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,780
that Princess Qin.

594
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,530
Do you notice

595
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,930
that the way Qishao treats Han Yunxi

596
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:42,950
is different?

597
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,130
-Different?
-Right?

598
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,610
It’s very different!

599
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,930
In the beginning, I thought

600
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,370
her eyes

601
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,530
look very like his mother’s.

602
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,650
And they both named their rabbits White Ear.

603
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,410
I thought Qishao cared for her

604
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:55,650
out of empathy.

605
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,810
Well now,

606
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,740
Qishao and Prince Qin are enemy

607
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,810
and he went to see Princess Qin.

608
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,130
I’m afraid he’s in love

609
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,190
with Princess Qin.

610
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,650
Maybe

611
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,010
Qishao approaches to her

612
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:06,780
for his purpose.

613
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,860
You might be right.

614
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,530
Actually,

615
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,570
Qishao may fancy her.

616
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,400
It’s alright.

617
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,090
She’s just a woman.

618
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,130
Just take her.

619
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:15,970
Han Yunxi is not

620
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,030
an ordinary woman.

621
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,030
She’s Princess Qin of Tianning.

622
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,070
As long as Qishao likes…

623
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,280
Don’t indulge him.

624
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,770
Her husband is Long Feiye,

625
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:27,890
Ares of Tianning.

626
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,610
She can’t be taken.

627
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,770
You’re puffing up the enemy

628
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,170
and shaking our courage.

629
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,170
Isn’t Qishao

630
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,500
better than Long Feiye?

631
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:42,340
[Hongfu Inn]

632
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,210
Your Highness.

633
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,170
That’s unnecessary.

634
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:52,930
Sit down, please.

635
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,390
Thank you, Your Highness.

636
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,010
Your Highness summons me.

637
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,110
How can I serve you?

638
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,250
Sorry for taking your time.

639
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,280
It’s urgent.

640
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,370
I have an issue

641
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,650
which is very important.

642
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,240
I need your help.

643
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,140
You flattered me.

644
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,800
Please share, Your Highness.

645
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,840
Your Highness,

646
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,030
is Her Highness…

647
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,070
What’s your idea?

648
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,280
Concubine Qing is Xiqiu’s princess.

649
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,070
She’s noble.

650
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,500
Although she has no influence in the court,

651
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,320
her identity

652
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,530
is her greatest guarantee.

653
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,190
Once she is in favor for a long time,

654
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,290
she will threaten

655
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,450
Her Highness and Your Highness.

656
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,760
That woman is new in the harem.

657
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,840
But she gave my mother a headache.

658
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,400
She’s very good at scheming.

659
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,130
Father favors her

660
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,360
and indulges her.

661
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,360
I must take precautions.

662
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,130
All my accomplishments come from

663
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,240
my mother.

664
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,490
But now,

665
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,740
my mother is weakening.

666
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,330
Concubine Qing is special,

667
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,260
different from other concubines.

668
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,240
So,

669
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,950
I need your help.

670
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,930
Thank you for trusting me, Your Highness.

671
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:23,730
So,

672
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,190
I’d like to share my view.

673
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,370
Save the courtesy.

674
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,570
I expect your advice.

675
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,450
As you mentioned,

676
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,170
Your Highness is here

677
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:34,650
because of Her Highness.

678
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,890
His Majesty

679
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,250
highly values you,

680
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,370
but he puts his hope

681
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,860
on the Crown Prince.

682
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,610
Besides, things are

683
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:43,870
changing in the harem.

684
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,070
His Majesty’s in his heyday.

685
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,150
There are many possibilities.

686
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,490
So,

687
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:50,740
since it is that,

688
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,250
I advise you to eliminate the risk

689
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,950
before it becomes a risk.

690
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,950
Are you telling me…

691
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:00,990
Yes.

692
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,780
Since Her Highness worries,

693
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,700
Your Highness should act first.

694
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,170
Furthermore,

695
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:08,970
as long as we

696
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,180
make it unnoticed,

697
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:10,770
there will be

698
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,400
no negative effect.

699
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,170
And Her Highness

700
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,300
will feel relieved.

701
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,400
You’re right, sir.

702
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,900
Thank you for your instruction.

703
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,340
My pleasure, Your Highness.

704
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,900
It’s a great honor

705
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,480
to service Your Highness.

706
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,110
Charity, please.

707
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,320
We need food.

708
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,240
We’ve been starving.

709
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,610
Charity, please.

710
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,150
Thank you.

711
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,320
Charity, please.

712
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,290
Here you are.

713
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:00,140
Thank you!

714
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:00,820
Here you are.

715
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:04,370
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

716
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:05,830
-Here you are.
-Thank you!

717
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,200
Thank you!

718
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,400
God bless you!

[Han’s Mansion]

720
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,010
Well,

721
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,940
go get the rice cake in the kitchen.

722
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:31,930
His Highness

723
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:32,930
and Yunyi love it.

724
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,580
You already have enough!

725
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,570
Just go get it.

726
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,320
Yes.

727
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:43,690
Why did you

728
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,110
have her serve me?

729
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,450
You’re not embarrassing her.

730
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,850
You’re embarrassing me.

731
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,110
If I knew it,

732
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,030
I’d ask you to punish her.

733
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,190
Insubordination

734
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,790
is capital offense.

735
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,030
It was for your sake

736
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,440
that I spared her life.

737
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,700
If you don’t like this,

738
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,410
I’ll give her the penalty.

739
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,530
Alright, alright.

740
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,610
Forget it.

741
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,200
Your words count.

742
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,320
I’m a daughter of a physician.

743
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,570
I have to obey.

744
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,620
Yunyi, what are you laughing at?

745
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,690
He’s embarrassing your sister!

746
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:20,890
Are you happy at this?

747
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,220
You’re supposed to be on my side.

748
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,210
His Highness is not embarrassing you.

749
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:27,410
He’s protecting you.

750
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,030
Ruoxue was rude to you

751
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,740
and bullied you.

752
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,700
She needs a lesson.

753
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,780
Ruoxue

754
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,860
bullied her?

755
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,430
Yes, Your Highness.

756
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,500
Call me brother-in-law.

757
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,500
Yes, brother-in-law.

758
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,210
Ruoxue bullied her all the time.

759
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:46,770
She didn’t

760
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:48,370
allow her to join us in meals.

761
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,320
She always…

762
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,990
That does embarrass me.

763
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,570
I was not always a victim.

764
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,110
I fought back, alright?

765
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,530
Why?

766
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,110
That is the truth!

767
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,170
She went beyond my bottom line

768
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,650
and I heavily fought back.

769
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,660
How high is your bottom line?

770
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,200
About this high.

771
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,450
This high.

772
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,490
Sister, are you angry?

773
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,570
Sister!

774
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,780
Your Highness.

775
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,650
Yunxi!

776
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,190
So,

777
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,330
you really don’t want

778
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,570
to see me again?

779
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,240
Thank you

780
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,000
for saving your aunt’s pharmacy,

781
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,780
and thank you

782
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:15,930
for keeping the family

783
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,150
away from this.

784
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,130
You only care about

785
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,650
the family?

786
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,030
I know

787
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,320
I was too harsh on you.

788
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,370
I hope

789
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,530
you don’t hate me.

790
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:37,900
I do hate you.

791
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,620
I lost my mother when I was little.

792
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,330
I expected love

793
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:42,570
from you.

794
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,650
But you just

795
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:45,450
neglected me,

796
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:46,570
and let Lady Xu and Ruoxue

797
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:47,450
bully me.

798
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,200
I want to know

799
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,320
why you treated me in that way.

800
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,030
If I didn’t do that way,

801
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,530
Ruoxue and her mother

802
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,130
would be even crueler to you.

803
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,570
I had to serve the court every day.

804
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:01,570
I couldn’t protect you all the time.

805
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,370
You know the very nature

806
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,250
of your aunt.

807
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,410
Yunyi was young.

808
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,970
Who else could help you?

809
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:07,610
Father,

810
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,240
till this day,

811
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,740
do you think that could persuade me?

812
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,070
Wanna a bowl of noodle, sir?

813
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,740

Have some water, please.

815
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:43,860
Thank you.

816

Qishao,

817
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,340
sorry for keep you waiting.

818
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,570
Not at all.

819
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:03,650
I didn’t wait for long.

820
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:04,650
I just arrived.

821
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,170
Did you?

822
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,490
Do not lie to me.

823
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,330
I did.

824
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,530
I’ll never lie to you.

825
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,140
Look,

826
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,400
I haven’t ordered yet.

827
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,490
Does that mean

828
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:16,860
you’re very hungry?

829
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,570
I’m not.

830
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:19,570
I know girls

831
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:20,610
take a bit long time.

832
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:21,610
Before you came,

833
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:22,530
I walked around the street.

834
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,490
I just arrived.

835
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,190
I’m sorry.

836
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,240
It’s fine.

00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:31,990
Sir,

838
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,330
are you waiting

839
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:34,250
for the girl who came here with you

840
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,240
last time?

841
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,740
You remember me?

842
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,330
Both of you look like from heaven.

843
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:41,190
How couldn’t I?

844
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,780
You have a good memory.

845
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,370
Thank you, sir.

846
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:46,530
I do business.

847
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:48,130
If a businessman doesn’t remember

848
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,180
his regular customers,

849
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,410
that’d be terrible.

850
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:51,210
It’s fine.

851
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:52,170
I will wait a little longer.

852
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:52,810
You go ahead.

853
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:53,370
Alright.

854
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:54,360
Have some rest.

857

Your Highness.

858
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,989
Be careful, Miss.

859
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,210
Are you hurt?

860
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,650
I’m sorry! I didn’t mean it!

861
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:43,989
I didn’t mean it!

862
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:47,489
How dare you!

863
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:48,820
You hurt His Highness.

864
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,090
Go kneel down in the courtyard

865
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,889
till His Highness forgives you!

866
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,770
You beat me!

867
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:55,530
So what?

868
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:56,900
Ruoxue,

869
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,090
didn’t you hear Her Highness?

870
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,330
Get out and kneel.

871
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,110
Mother!

872
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,490
I won’t help you.

873
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,320
You deserve it.

874
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,450
How dare you!

875
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:32,690
You hurt His Highness.

876
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:34,350

till His Highness forgives you!

878

You beat me!

So what?

880
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,860
Han Yunxi!

881
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,490
This will help.

882
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:07,990
Apply every six hours.

883
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,880
Why did you defend Han Ruoxue?

884
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,320
I didn’t.

885
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,530
You punished her

886
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,110
before I would do,

887
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,650
in case I’d be cruel to her.

888
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,450
She’s an innocent girl.

889
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:26,130
She can’t

890
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,660
take Your Highness’s fury.

891
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,240
No wonder Yunyi said

892
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,980
you don’t have a bottom line.

893
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,820
It’s better to save trouble.

894
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,200
Besides,

895
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,150
Your Highness is generous.

896
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,210
You won’t

897
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,530
be annoyed by an innocent

898
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:42,610
little girl,

899
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:43,400
will you?

900
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,650
Did you live here?

901
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,070
Yes,

902
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,200
and my mother did, too.

903
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:53,610
Here

904
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:54,810
makes me feel at home.

905
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:55,860
I love it.

906
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,240
Mother,

907
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,490
I’m married.

908
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,530
This is my husband.

909
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:33,820
Run!

910
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,030
Stop there!

911
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,450
Go!

912
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:44,650
Get them!

913
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:45,280
Yes!

914
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,490
Are you alright, boy?

915
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,570
Leave me.

916
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:04,650
I can’t survive.

917
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,090
What are you talking about!

918
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:06,770
You call me mother.

919
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:08,110
I’ll protect you.

920
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,530
Come up.

921
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:10,190
Over there!

922
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,240
Stop!

923
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,290
Come on, we need to run!

924
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:14,950
Run!

925
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,110
Stay away!

926
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,530
Stay away!

927
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,030
Lady Tianxin

928
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,370
is found guilty

929
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:33,210
for helping the Gu-infected man escape.

930
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,210
Surrender him

931
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:35,570
and your life is spared.

932
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:36,410
Or,

933
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:37,860
don’t expect my mercy!

934
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,570
Your mercy?

935
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:40,730
You take innocent people

936
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:41,690
and infect them.

937
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:42,950
That’s inhuman!

938
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:43,970
I wonder

939
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:45,450
if you have any mercy!

940
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,370
I take that

941
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:47,650
as resisting arrest!

942
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:48,330
Soldiers!

943
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:49,250
Take them!

944
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,070
Yes!

945
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,280
You… you don’t have to kneel.

946
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,740
I do for the deceased.

947
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,810
My mother is not deceased.

948
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,360
She just disappeared.

949
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,360
Lady,

950
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,410
I swear I’ll

951
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,540
take good care of your daughter.

952
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:48,360
♫ Get angelica into the decoction ♫

953
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:52,950

00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,780
Yunxi,

974
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,010
before your

975
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:06,370
intercourse at night,

976
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,950
put this under your pillow,

977
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,450
and next year

978
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,070
you’ll have a baby.

979
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:15,400
Intercourse?

980
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,110
Alright.

981
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,810
It’s time to go.

982
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,280
Serve His Highness in bed.

983
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,810
He can do it himself.

984
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:26,010
Why shall I serve him?

985
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,700
Aren’t you going home?

986
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,450
You want me to go?

987
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:57,530
No.

988
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:58,640
Absolutely no.

989
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,360
I’m afraid mother will miss you.

990
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:05,820
Really?

991
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,410
If you wanna go home,

992
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:09,810
I’ll get the wagon ready.

993
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:10,950
No need.
