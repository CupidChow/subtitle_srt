00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,780
Episode 12

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,130
Your Highness, don’t.

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,140
It doesn’t depend on you

5
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,470
either he dies or lives.

6
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,100
We have countless capable physicians in palace.

7
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,670
I don’t need your help.

8
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:11,920
You were the only

9
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,340
person there when he was found.

10
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:13,840
My son.

11
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,700
As Princess Qin…

12
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,540
-Son!
-shouldn’t you stay at home?

13
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,880
Why were you there?

14
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,500
You said

15
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,940
you were relieving his poison.

16
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,140
Why do his symptoms go severe

17
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,400
instead of improving?

18
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,540
You fooled my uncle

19
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,740
and General Mu

20
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,730
with your honey tongue.

21
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,290
But you can’t fool me.

22
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,710
Today, I’ll slit your throat.

23
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,630
Then I’ll report to father.

24
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,130
Stop!

25
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,210
Your Highness.

26
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,400
Do you remember who she is?

27
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,500
Uncle.

28
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,840
How is my son?

29
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,500
The poison has been contained.

30
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,450
Don’t worry, General Mu.

31
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:12,850
Physician Gu is with him.

32
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:15,330
Uncle,

33
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,860
Qingwu is dying.

34
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,660
But you’re protecting this low…

35
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,940
You’re protecting your princess.

36
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,580
She can’t prove her innocence.

37
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,630
Even if it means I have to offend you,

38
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,580
I cannot let a criminal

39
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,840
get away from justice.

40
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,539
If you keep it down

41
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:30,500
with your power,

42
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,140
I dare not challenge you.

43
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,620
But when I go back to palace,

44
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,820
I’ll seek justice from my father

45
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,950
and my grandmother.

46
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,660
I have been pretty sure

47
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,820
since I was little that Qingwu

48
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,840
is my soul mate.

49
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,940
You worry about your princess.

50
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,620
I also

51
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,289
worry about my fiancée.

52
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,420
We don’t know what the fact is.

53
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:50,660
And you’re so sure you’re right?

54
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,539
I’m a princess.

55
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:52,620
I’m never wrong.

56
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,220
She is

57
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,530
the one who poisoned Qingwu.

58
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,050
Unless you have evidence

59
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,380
to prove her innocence,

60
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,800
I’ll have no choice

61
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,100
but to subject it

62
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,700
to my father.

63
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,560
Don’t you dare!

64
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,070
Listen to me carefully.

65
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,210
She’s my princess.

66
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,169
Every one,

67
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,000
His Majesty included,

68
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,210
isn’t allowed to hurt her.

69
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,850
I didn’t poison Mu Qingwu.

70
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,100
If you don’t believe me,

71
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,010
ask Sir Beigong

72
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,180
to put me behind bars.

73
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,930
But if, due to your prejudice,

74
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,530
we miss the prime time to save him,

75
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:25,750
will you regret it?

76
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,130
Who knows if you can

77
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,590
relieve the poison or not?

78
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,090
Give me two days.

79
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:34,300
In two days,

80
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,430
if I fail to cure him,

81
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,310
you’re free to take my life.

82
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,660
All right.

83
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,290
Then I’ll wait

84
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,290
to take it.

85
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,170
Your Highnesses,

86
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,860
I’m worried about my son.

87
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,250
Excuse me.

88
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,500
Are you absolutely sure?

89
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,210
No.

90
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,060
Then why did you promise her?

91
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,190
What else could I do?

92
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,220
If His Highness and Changbing

93
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,090
start a conflict

94
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,130
and draw His Majesty’s attention,

95
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,250
it will be ugly.

96
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,780
I don’t want to drag His Highness down.

97
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,840
And I believe

98
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,620
I can relieve the poison.

99
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,380
Yunxi,

100
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,620
you’re smart.

101
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,180
I believe

102
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,110
you can weather through the storm.

103
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,210
Thank you.

104
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,210
You’re my princess.

105
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,470
That’s what I should do.

106
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:46,340
Mu Qingwu

107
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,740
needs physicians’ care.

108
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,380
I have to stay here.

109
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,170
Do you trust me?

110
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:55,500
Two days later,

111
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,800
I’ll wait for you to come home.

112
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,050
Oh, Tianmo.

113
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,800
Haven’t I warned you

114
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,050
to make no irrational move?

115
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,380
You could have

116
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,460
asked Gu

117
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:38,700
to kill

118
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,590
the escort girl and Mu Qingwu.

119
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,590
Why didn’t you just listen?

120
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,750
If I didn’t hear the news,

121
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,980
how long would you hide it from me?

122
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,590
Uncle,

123
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,060
I knew you were focused

124
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,260
on the account books of the border army.

125
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,580
I didn’t want

126
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,700
to bother you with such trivial matters.

127
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,340
Besides…

128
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,380
Besides, the escort girl

129
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,780
is one of Gu Qishao’s crew.

130
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,420
If Gu Qishao doesn’t…

131
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,170
What?

132
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,010
His Majesty

133
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,550
and the officials all fix their eyes on it.

134
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,230
It’s related to Prince Qin.

135
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,670
If you left any traces,

136
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,930
they could

137
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:10,860
give us out.

138
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,320
That’s not trivial at all.

139
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,500
Yuze knows too much.

140
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,450
If Mu Qingwu takes her,

141
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,750
we’ll be doomed.

142
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,880
I had to do it.

143
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,020
I was

144
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,250
at my wits’ end.

145
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:24,960
All right.

146
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,590
Where is the girl now?

147
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,060
What about Mu Qingwu?

148
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,380
Is he dead or not?

149
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,250
We didn’t get Yuze,

150
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,340
but Mu Qingwu

151
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,550
is poisoned.

152
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,320
He’ll die sooner or later.

153
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,540
When Mu Qingwu dropped down,

154
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,140
there was a woman by his side.

155
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:43,780
Who was it?

156
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,050
Princess Qin,

157
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,050
Han Yunxi.

158
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:55,659
The Poison Scripture in my bracelet

159
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,700
can only tell me

160
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,000
a few possibilities

161
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,990
but cannot be sure about which.

162
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,420
He’s severely poisoned.

163
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,670
I’m not totally sure

164
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,050
and I can’t try

165
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,090
one by one.

166
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,960
Which poison is it?

167
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,050
Blue Ringed Octopus?

168
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,210
Ghost Scorpion?

169
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,090
Or…

170
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,050
Han Yunxi.

171
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,490
It’s been two days.

172
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,130
Have you found the cure?

173
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,150
What are you looking at?

174
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,180
The sun is in the east.

175
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,290
It’s not noon yet.

176
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,750
So it’s not two days yet.

177
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,080
Save your excuses.

178
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,010
Just tell me.

179
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:34,580
Do you find

180
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,180
the cure to Qingwu’s poison?

181
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,460
No.

182
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:38,880
Guards!

183
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,390
Take her to the dungeon.

184
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,380
I’m curious how my uncle

185
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,700
is going to protect you now.

186
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,750
Changbing,

187
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,220
you’re a noble princess.

188
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,500
How could you go against your words?

189
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,220
Because I’m a real princess.

190
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,260
You, on the other hand, are a low-born girl.

191
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,250
It’s been two days

192
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,750
because I said so.

193
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,530
After the noon,

194
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,210
I’ll behead you.

195
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,130
Seize her!

196
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,300
-Go.
-Stop!

197
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,880
Your Highness, it’s not wise.

198
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,620
In the last two days,

199
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,180
were it not for Her Highness,

200
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:07,820
the young general

201
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,980
would have died of mass blood loss.

202
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,840
It’s all right.

203
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,060
I’ve invited

204
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,740
the best physicians

205
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,960
to treat Qingwu.

206
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,900
Physician Gu,

207
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,180
draw the poison out for the young general

208
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,540
as I did in a timely order.

209
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,490
Make sure

210
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,750
you come to me in the dungeon before noon.

211
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,960
Don’t let Prince Qin know.

212
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,000
Trust me.

213
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,180
I’m afraid

214
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,860
you won’t meet each other alive.

215
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,590
My aunt,

216
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,520
this day finally comes to you.

217
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,740
Take her away.

218
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,080
I can walk on my own.

219
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,549
Han Yunxi,

220
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,090
you poisoned Qingwu.

221
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:36,970
I won’t

222
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,669
let you get away from it.

223
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:39,750
Look,

224
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,380
I urged Sir Beigong

225
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,049
to clean the floor

226
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:45,500
for you.

227
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,780
It’s said lots of prisoners

228
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,250
died here.

229
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,940
It’s filthy here.

230
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,090
You’re nobody but a pariah.

231
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,500
Wipe off your aloof face.

232
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,460
Guards!

233
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,340
Let me settle you in.

234
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,680
Your Highness, please don’t.

235
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,740
She’s nobody

236
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,920
but a prisoner.

237
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:13,670
Move.

238
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:14,590
But…

239
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,290
Han Yunxi,

240
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,290
you will not get out of here alive.

241
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,130
You’re dead.

242
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,900
[Grand Commandant’s Mansion]

243
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,840
My father permits Changbing’s prank

244
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,800
and puts Han Yunxi in the dungeon.

245
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,840
Tomorrow afternoon,

246
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,500
Han Yunxi will be executed.

247
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,300
I’m afraid Changbing’s trick

248
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,670
can’t kill Princess Qin.

249
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,710
However,

250
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,420
it gives us a chance

251
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,630
to stay clear of it.

252
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,660
Do you have a plan, uncle?

253
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,060
It’s a piece of cake to get rid

254
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,060
of an escort girl.

255
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,460
But the key is General Mu Qingwu.

256
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,630
General Mu has grudges with Prince Qin.

257
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,460
We need to make Han Yunxi confess

258
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,130
that Long Feiye

259
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,860
ordered her to poison Mu Qingwu

260
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,550
to destroy the evidence.

261
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,340
Then we kill Han Yunxi

262
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,250
secretly

263
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,500
and make it look like a suicide.

264
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,920
As for Mu Qingwu,

265
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,710
we have to get rid of him.

266
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,670
In that case,

267
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,130
we’ll take the upper hand.

268
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,340
Then we could frame

269
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,800
all the crimes on Prince Qin.

270
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,780
Prince Qin has been the pain

271
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,170
in His Majesty’s eyes.

272
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,130
In this way,

273
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,090
we can pull out

274
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,940
from the counterfeit of account books

275
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,630
out clean.

276
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,290
Good plan, uncle.

277
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,760
In the meantime, stay in your palace.

278
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,380
Don’t make any moves.

279
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,340
I’ll take care

280
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,170
of the rest.

281
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,140
Why are you following us?

282
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,050
Excuse me, sir.

283
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,100
Are you General Baili Yuanlong?

284
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,290
Yes.

285
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,050
You’ve followed us for a long time.

286
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,170
May we help you?

287
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,050
I…

288
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,250
Don’t worry.

289
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,250
There are only the three of us.

290
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,090
Just speak it out.

291
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,660
I wonder if you’re

292
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,420
looking into

293
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,840
the case of corruption.

294
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,130
How do you know?

295
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,750
It doesn’t matter.

296
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,620
I just

297
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,620
have key evidence

298
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,670
to give in.

299
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,580
With the evidence

300
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,420
you gathered

301
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,880
and these from me,

302
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,920
I’m sure you can take him down.

303
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,880
Who ordered you to do this?

304
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,820
When the case is solved,

305
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,660
I would like

306
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,590
to express my gratitude in person.

307
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,780
You’re welcome, General Baili.

308
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,050
I listen to no one’s order.

309
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,460
He

310
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,840
is a greedy man.

311
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,960
The people detest him.

312
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,340
I’m doing this

313
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,740
for the people to give you

314
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,880
the evidence.

315
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,490
Now you have them.

316
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,420
I’ll bid you farewell.

317
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:33,920
Thank you.

318
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,510
Thank you, general.

319
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,620
General Baili

320
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,220
has found proof of his crime.

321
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,020
The orderly rides day and night

322
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,950
and will bring it here by midnight.

323
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,050
In this case,

324
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,690
we could convict the Crown Prince

325
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,090
and his uncle.

326
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,800
The Crown Prince

327
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,900
isn’t involved in account books counterfeit.

328
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,660
Mu Qingwu is still unconscious.

329
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,110
Yuze’s statement isn’t credible.

330
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,090
The Princess is involved.

331
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,180
Everything

332
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,340
is so coincidental.

333
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,090
I understand

334
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,050
that the Crown Prince

335
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,130
has his pawns in it.

336
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,600
But there’s a third force.

337
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,640
Your Highness,

338
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,380
what do you think of the third force?

339
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,500
Clearly,

340
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,290
they disagree

341
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,250
on Yuze.

342
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,780
The Crown Prince wants her dead.

343
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,290
They want her alive.

344
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,170
On Mu Qingwu,

345
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,840
they share the same goal.

346
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,290
I…

347
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,090
I don’t understand.

348
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,800
The state faces threats from home and abroad.

349
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,050
His Lord waits to see Your Majesty.

350
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,050
Send him in.

351
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,840
Your Majesty.

352
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,130
Rise.

353
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,860
Thank you, Your Majesty.

354
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,750
What is it that brings you

355
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,300
in court?

356
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,840
I’m here to offer my help.

357
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,090
With what?

358
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,800
If I may,

359
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,710
I noticed you often frowned.

360
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,460
I guess you’re troubled

361
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,060
by Princess Qin’s assassination of Mu Qingwu.

362
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,250
Come forward.

363
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,840
In my opinion,

364
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,800
this case is difficult to handle.

365
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,290
One side is Prince Qin who just won a victory

366
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,160
and his princess granted by Her Royal Highness.

367
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,210
On the other,

368
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,420
it’s General Mu Qingwu.

369
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,500
Both are pillars of the state.

370
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,960
You’re right.

371
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,220
They leave me

372
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,750
in an awkward position.

373
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,340
Since

374
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,290
you’re here to offer help,

375
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,580
I guess you have worked out

376
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,880
a solution.

377
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,340
Routinely,

378
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,980
the Chief Justice

379
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,420
should be put in charge of the case.

380
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,630
But his murderer

381
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,420
is still in the air.

382
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,090
And General Mu

383
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,500
has proved

384
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,460
Prince Qin to be the prime suspect,

385
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,960
which makes

386
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,420
the case extremely complicated.

387
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,200
Your analysis has a point.

388
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,340
That being said,

389
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,670
do you have any good ideas

390
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,340
that you’d like to share with me?

391
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,140
You flattered me, Your Majesty.

392
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,880
It hurts me

393
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,400
to see Your Majesty troubled by the case.

394
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,310
I volunteer to lead the investigation

395
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,130
and solve your trouble.

396
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,710
At present,

397
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,090
both Prince Qin

398
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,380
and the Mus

399
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,920
would show me the respect.

400
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,800
I’ll be just in the investigation

401
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:11,589
and make both sides convinced.

402
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,800
What’s your opinion, Your Majesty?

403
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,670
General Mu is a military genius.

404
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,000
He contributed a great deal to my throne.

405
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,339
Do you remember

406
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,960
the motto I used to say?

407
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,170
I do.

408
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,800
You said

409
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,460
the army is the foundation of the state.

410
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,710
If anyone

411
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,920
holds evil ideas on my army,

412
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,670
I won’t go easy on him.

413
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,590
Don’t worry, Your Majesty.

414
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,630
If General Mu is loyal to you,

415
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,420
I’ll bring justice to him.

416
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,130
If anyone

417
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,780
dares to ruin the peace within our borders,

418
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,500
even he’s a prince,

419
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,710
I’ll risk everything

420
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,880
and take him down.

421
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:22,750
Get up.

422
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,340
Thank you, Your Majesty.

423
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,840
I’m touched

424
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,550
by your loyalty.

425
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,500
Good.

426
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,920
I’ll issue an edict

427
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,340
and put you

428
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,700
in charge

429
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,360
of Princess Qin’s assassination of General Mu.

430
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,540
Thank you, Your Majesty.

431
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,970
Long Feiye’s move to draw the snake out

432
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,170
is wily.

433
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,930
I humbly ask Your Highness

434
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,290
to be discreet.

435
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,660
My uncle preaches about it.

436
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,250
So do you.

437
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,840
I did make a mistake on this.

438
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,630
Thanks to my uncle’s tip,

439
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,250
Mu Qingwu being poisoned

440
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,670
gives us a chance

441
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,880
to frame it on Long Feiye.

442
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,090
How do you plan

443
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,130
to frame it on him?

444
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,880
Apparently,

445
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,220
to the outsiders,

446
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,100
Mu Qingwu was poisoned

447
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,290
by Princess Qin, Han Yunxi.

448
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,810
The old General Mu

449
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,710
has grudges with Long Feiye.

450
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,170
Nobody would question

451
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,970
that Princess Qin was ordered by Long Feiye

452
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,670
to murder Mu Qingwu.

453
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,520
Your Highness,

454
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,500
you’ve made it

455
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,250
too simple I think.

456
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,130
How could Long Feiye possibly

457
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,590
target the old General Mu?

458
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,800
Even if he could,

459
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,970
do you think Long Feiye would do

460
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,370
such a despicable thing

461
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,740
to ask his princess

462
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,090
to murder a court official

463
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,670
in the open street?

464
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,420
Who would believe

465
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,580
such a thing?

466
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,580
I don’t care if they believe it or not.

467
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,460
We have the witness and evidence.

468
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,420
With the full support of my father

469
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,590
and my uncle,

470
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,050
Han Yunxi has been put in dungeon.

471
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,100
It won’t be easy

472
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,460
for her to turn the tide

473
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,000
in this case.

474
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,340
But…

475
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,850
I think you’re too cautious

476
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,380
in this operation.

477
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,940
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

478
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,210
Feiye!

479
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,590
Feiye, bad news! Feiye!

480
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,460
Feiye!

481
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,380
Feiye, listen to me!

482
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,470
Can you be quiet for a while?

483
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,500
Don’t yell about

484
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,030
whenever there’s bad news.

485
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,840
I wonder if Tang Li…

486
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,840
Tang Li?

487
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,380
It’s not about Tang Li.

488
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,340
I mean

489
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,540
I dragged Yunxi

490
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,780
to go to the fair with me

491
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,460
which led her

492
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,540
to the troublesome case.

493
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,540
I…I went

494
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,970
to General Mu’s mansion today.

495
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:55,700
But I didn’t see her

496
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,840
for all the time.

497
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,500
I asked around and heard

498
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
that Princess Changbing was there.

499
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:01,740
I’m here

500
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,070
to give you the message.

501
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,860
Yunxi must be in trouble.

502
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,170
Go save her.

503
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,300
I’m sorry.

504
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,250
But you and I

505
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,420
are by fate

506
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,840
on the opposite sides.

507
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,460
Be good.

508
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:16,860
Take this pill,

509
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,390
and it will keep you from ill

510
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,500
and the coldness here.

511
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,220
Mother,

512
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,840
what is it you’re drying?

513
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,180
Well, this is the Flower of Immortality.

514
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,050
It helps wounds to heal.

515
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,500
They’re pretty.

516
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,340
I want to become a person like you

517
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,460
who knows all kinds of herbs

518
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,540
and saves people

519
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,800
for no returns.

520
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:38,970
Good girl.

521
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,670
That’s good.

522
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,500
Physician Gu.

523
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,380
Your Highness.

524
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,420
You’re right about the time.

525
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,210
Am I?

526
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,140
I drew the general’s blood

527
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,060
at nine at night

528
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,590
as you ordered.

529
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,670
Here is his blood.

530
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,930
How was the general

531
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,250
at nine last night?

532
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,980
The general woke up and passed out

533
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,980
from time to time.

534
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,220
When he was awake,

535
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,420
he couldn’t talk.

536
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,780
And his fever isn’t improving.

537
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,510
His lips and tongue are purple.

538
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,930
His blood is darkened.

539
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:37,970
Except the blood smell,

540
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:40,100
it smells a slight fragrance of peony.

541
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,730
Fever?

542
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,960
Purple lips and tongue?

543
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,180
These poisons fall in different categories,

544
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,440
but all can be drawn out with the needles.

545
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,180
I don’t know the key

546
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,780
lies in these two acupoints.

547
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,260
The Poison Master is so wise,

548
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,460
as wise as I am.

549
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,210
It’s the Snakes’ Venom.

550
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,710
The Snakes’ Venom?

551
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,840
The Snakes’ Venom is extracted

552
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,420
by the top ten poisonous snakes’ venoms.

553
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,820
Its symptoms are hard to detect.

554
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,700
Once the symptoms show,

555
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,860
the patient will die within two hours

556
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,780
without the cure.

557
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,780
I couldn’t be sure

558
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,540
if the young general

559
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,700
was poisoned by the venom.

560
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,050
Judging by his blood,

561
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,260
I’m sure it’s the Snakes’ Venom.

562
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,250
How could you be so sure?

563
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,580
At nine in night,
Sanjiao is the center of all channels.

564
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,460
Sanjiao includes the chest

565
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,220
and the upper and lower abdomen.

566
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,420
General Mu’s poisoned

567
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,740
exactly in the abdomen.

568
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,820
The blood here at nine

569
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,780
tells accurately

570
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,840
what the poison is.

571
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:49,860
To relieve the Snakes’ Venom,

572
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,020
we have to draw it out at the fixed acupoint

573
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,950
with the help of the golden needle.

574
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,380
I’ve never heard

575
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,300
of such a treatment.

576
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,940
Did you also read it

577
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,460
from an ancient book?

578
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,660
I like

579
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,170
to study these.

580
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,800
Let’s put it aside.

581
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,010
I asked you not to tell Prince Qin.

582
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,610
You didn’t tell him, did you?

583
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,660
Trust me, Your Highness.

584
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,320
I didn’t even tell General Mu.

585
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,340
The physicians came

586
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,180
with Princess Changbing

587
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,620
are all flashy with no substance.

588
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,670
They can’t cure the general.

589
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,050
But I don’t understand

590
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,140
why you didn’t

591
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,500
let me tell Prince Qin.

592
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:28,930
I can see it’s complicated

593
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,000
behind the case.

594
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,650
I’m afraid they would make me a target

595
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:32,860
to frame on His Highness.

596
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,740
So I have to

597
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,930
nip the bud

598
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:35,970
of future trouble.

599
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,220
So Mu Qingwu’s incident

600
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,080
won’t get His Highness involved.

601
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,180
Your affection

602
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,640
with His Highness is deep.

603
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,820
I admire

604
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,170
your wisdom.

605
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,210
Listen,

606
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,340
the prescription is on my table.

607
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,020
Gather the medicines

608
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,780
to cure the Snakes’ Venom.

609
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,540
Cook it

610
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,690
and let Mu Qingwu drink it.

611
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:53,880
Then he’ll wake up.

612
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,460
When he does, he’ll be able to testify for me.

613
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,460
Then I can get out.

614
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,780
Time is pressing.

615
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,150
I’m counting on you.

616
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,210
Your Highness, take care.

617
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,560
Your Highness,

618
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,020
His Lord has a few questions to ask.

619
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,020
Please follow me.

620
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:39,710
All right.

621
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,920
Han Yunxi,

622
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,580
you poisoned the young General Mu

623
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,300
in broad daylight.

624
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,220
What’s in your evil mind? Come clean.

625
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,420
I didn’t poison him.

626
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,930
I saw him knocked down on the ground

627
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:54,860
by the men in black.

628
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,190
I was trying to save him.

629
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,090
Men in black?

630
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,340
Stop lying.

631
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,250
No one saw the men in black.

632
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,530
They saw you

633
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:09,970
by Mu Qingwu’s side

634
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,230
intending to kill him.

635
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,340
Forget about the idea

636
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,800
that your rank can save you.

637
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,420
I think

638
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,880
you need a little push.

639
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:23,860
Continue.

640
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,550
Yes.

641
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,170
Ouch!

642
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,090
You’re free to go.

643
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:02,840
Yes.

644
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,090
Your Highness,

645
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,060
I had no choice but to offend you just now.

646
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,170
Please forgive me.

647
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,140
You were gentle with the beat.

648
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,740
I couldn’t be more grateful.

649
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,130
But why did you help me?

650
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,990
Did Prince Qin send you?

651
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,420
The truth is

652
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,340
I was

653
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,010
saved by Lady Tianxin.

654
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,780
During the plague by Luo River

655
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,740
in the west suburb,

656
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,860
Lady Tianxin

657
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,120
cured my whole family.

658
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:31,780
Her Ladyship

659
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,170
was my family’s savior.

660
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:33,780
And

661
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,300
you’re Lady Tianxin’s daughter.

662
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,630
I have to save yours no matter what.

663
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,290
Medicine practitioners save lives.

664
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,750
It’s my mother’s mission.

665
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,480
Your Highness,

666
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,190
I’ve arranged everything.

667
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,460
There’s no one guarding the gate.

668
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,300
I know a way

669
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,670
to the outside.

670
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:50,970
You’re letting me go?

671
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:51,750
Yes.

672
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,490
I heard from my superior

673
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:54,420
that they’ll

674
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,130
behead you after noon.

675
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,050
They will make it look like a suicide

676
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,780
for your guilty of the crime

677
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,130
so that they can

678
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,530
frame it on Prince Qin.

679
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:04,340
No way.

680
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,300
I can’t let them

681
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,420
hurt Prince Qin.

682
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,630
No one here knows.

683
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,420
It leads to the outside.

684
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,750
Your Highness, go.

685
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,840
Hurry.

686
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,630
It’s clearly a trap.

687
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,750
Forget it.

688
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,160
I’ll take the risk.

689
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:32,750
My Lord.

690
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,460
Good work.

691
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,170
Han Yunxi,

692
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,750
I thought you were a smart girl.

693
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,880
But you fell into my trap.

694
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,130
The minute you leave the dungeon,

695
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,880
you’ll be a fugitive.

696
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,960
If you’re killed outside,

697
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,630
Prince Qin

698
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,170
can’t blame us for it.

699
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,590
Then you can never

700
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,180
prove your innocence

701
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,210
in Mu Qingwu’s case.

702
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,000
Your Highness,

703
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,620
you came!

704
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,170
I thought

705
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,250
I was going to die.

706
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,420
Princess Changbing is so wicked.

707
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,020
She poured ice-cold water on my head.

708
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,920
His Lord

709
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,980
ordered the guard to beat me with a cudgel.

710
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,170
And the warden.

711
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,090
He thought I didn’t know

712
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:33,960
he cheated me.

713
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,780
I would die if I stayed.

714
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,090
I’d rather take my chances.

715
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,420
Perhaps I could save the young general.

716
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,350
Then you wouldn’t be dragged down.

717
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,840
Can you get down now?

718
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,310
They thought I was weak.

719
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,210
They just want to make me confess

720
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,940
and frame all the crimes on you.

721
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,420
These people are wicked.

722
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,340
We have a life to save.

723
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:58,960
Right.

724
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,540
Take me to General Mu’s Mansion now.

725
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,490
Mu Qingwu would have no chance

726
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:02,820
if we don’t help him now.

727
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:03,920
Let’s go.

728
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,860
[General’s Mansion]

729
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,420
Your Highnesses.

730
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,260
The young general has taken the medicine.

731
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,220
But he can’t stop vomiting blood.

732
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,590
He can’t even talk.

733
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,800
Your Highness,

734
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,970
I used to offend you.

735
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,840
Please forgive me.

736
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,490
Those physicians

737
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:31,000
are useless.

738
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,380
I count

739
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,710
my son’s life on Your Highness.

740
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,800
General Mu, don’t worry.

741
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,860
Physician Gu, please give me a hand.

742
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,920
Sure.

743
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:42,800
Please.

744
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,880
Your Highness.

745
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:07,730
Uncle,

746
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,190
surrender your princess.

747
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,660
She failed

748
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,500
to carry out her promise.

749
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,420
Please focus on the needles, Your Highness.

750
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,630
You’re pretty clear

751
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,900
who broke the promise first.

752
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,130
His Lord is in charge of the case now.

753
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,460
Uncle, you harbored your princess

754
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,550
and helped her escape in midnight.

755
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,000
My father has learned about it.

756
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,710
I have my father’s order

757
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,930
to hold Han Yunxi in custody.

758
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:31,790
Your Highness,

759
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,380
my son’s life is at risk.

760
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,130
Please wait for a while.

761
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,540
When my son wakes up,

762
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,050
he’ll tell us the truth.

763
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:39,780
General Mu,

764
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,440
you believe her instead of me?

765
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,130
I would never hurt Qingwu.

766
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,970
I’m ordered to seize the fugitive!

767
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:45,740
Take her!

768
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,750
Don’t you dare!

769
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,750
Take her!

770
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,170
He’s fine.

771
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,210
Qingwu.

772
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,820
Qingwu.

773
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,880
Do you feel better?

774
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,750
Father, Your Highness.

775
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,420
I feel much better now.

776
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,000
Qingwu.

777
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,740
Thank you, Your Highness

778
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,250
for saving my son.

779
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,660
I misunderstood you

780
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,700
so much.

781
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,250
Please don’t put it in mind.

782
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,220
You didn’t know the truth.

783
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,750
The young general is awake.

784
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,740
He’s cleared His Highness and my name.

785
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,880
I’m thankful to him.

786
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,130
I’m ashamed.

787
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,090
Sir Beigong.

788
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:42,300
Yes, Your Highness.

789
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,840
I want to ask you

790
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,170
why my princess

791
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,800
is a fugitive.

792
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,120
Why do I know nothing about it?

793
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,290
I received an order

794
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,090
which says Prince Qin is a fugitive

795
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,740
hiding in the General’s Mansion.

796
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,420
I was asked to seize her.

797
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,340
Fugitive?

798
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,360
One has to be a criminal first.

799
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,370
Am I a criminal?

800
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:03,340
No, no, no.

801
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,220
Were it not

802
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,420
for Your Highness’s help,

803
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,460
the young general

804
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,670
would have died by now.

805
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,590
You’re not a criminal.

806
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,880
Who says that?

807
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,090
You led so many men

808
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,410
to arrest me.

809
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:17,180
Don’t you just take me

810
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:17,980
as a criminal?

811
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,240
This is a huge misunderstanding.

812
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,340
Your Highness,

813
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,340
you saved the young general’s life.

814
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,700
How come you’re a criminal?

815
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,230
Why did you try to arrest me?

816
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,600
Your Highness,

817
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,130
it’s my fault.

818
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,780
I was just doing my work.

819
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,710
Your Highness, mercy.

820
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,340
Doing your work? Great.

821
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,380
It’s time to do my work.

822
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:41,920
Guards!

823
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,090
Take Sir Beigong

824
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,770
to the Ministry of Personnel for questioning.

825
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:47,700
-Get up.
-Move.

826
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,810
Mercy, Your Highness!

827
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,750
Mercy!

828
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,340
Changbing,

829
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,590
what else do you want to say?

830
00:37:59,020 --> 00:37:59,710
Uncle,

831
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,970
I was worried

832
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:02,050
about Qingwu’s safety

833
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,290
and made the wrong

834
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:04,620
judgment about my aunt.

835
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,840
That’s why I joined Beigong’s fuss.

836
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,050
Fuss?

837
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,090
You had His Majesty’s order.

838
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,350
You call that a fuss?

839
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,130
Uncle,

840
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,170
it was Beigong.

841
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,580
He turned us on each other.

842
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,050
I was fooled.

843
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,750
I would never do it again.

844
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,570
Uncle,

845
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:24,860
can you please

846
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,340
speak for me to my father?

847
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,550
Changbing,

848
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,620
your plot fails

849
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,930
and you don’t want to take the responsibility,

850
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:35,660
now you know this is your uncle?

851
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,960
How handy!

852
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,180
It’s not the first time

853
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,330
you want to behead your aunt.

854
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:43,530
And you ordered men to fight your uncle.

855
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,630
What do you want, aunt?

856
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,130
This is your punishment?

857
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,710
Yes.

858
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,300
About my father…

859
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:04,910
Don’t worry.

860
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,090
I’ll explain to my brother.

861
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,660
General Mu,

862
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,520
can you please explain to Qingwu.

863
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,290
Don’t…

864
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,420
Don’t let him hate me.

865
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,300
Of course, Your Highness.

866
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,560
Since Concubine Qing came to palace,

867
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,260
everything has been tough for me.

868
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,330
That filthy woman

869
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,050
even makes me

870
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,910
the laughing stock of the palace.

871
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,330
I can’t

872
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,880
swallow the insult.

873
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,500
When your father had smallpox,

874
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,920
I was worried.

875
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,690
But like the other concubines,

876
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,050
I didn’t have smallpox before.

877
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,170
I was afraid.

878
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,050
Unexpectedly, that filthy woman

879
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:05,210
took the chance

880
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,550
and won your father’s heart.

881
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,050
Her advantage

882
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:11,310
is her identity as the princess of Xiqiu.

883
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:11,930
Let me

884
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,500
look into her background.

885
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,570
Mother,

886
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,000
don’t worry about her.

887
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,960
All she has is her rank.

888
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,780
She has no help in the palace.

889
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,210
Trust me.

890
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,630
I’m here.

891
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,170
My father won’t be indifferent to you

892
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,090
for too long.

893
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:28,960
Mother,

894
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,420
you’ve been my father’s favorite for years.

895
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,550
He won’t be mad forever.

896
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,620
Mother,

897
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,580
when you think fit,

898
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,980
apologize to my father, and you’ll be fine.

899
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,880
Son, you know how to calm me down.

900
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,840
I’ll listen to your advice

901
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,010
and apologize

902
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,610
to your father when it’s fit.

903
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,080
I just want you to be happy.

904
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,820
♫ If this world fades ♫

905
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:28,750
♫ I’ll stay with you ♫

906
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,810
♫ Being in silence to firmly ♫

907
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:34,710
♫ Withstand the innumerable words ♫

908
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,460
♫ If everything in the world ♫

909
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,300
♫ Breaks down ruthlessly ♫
