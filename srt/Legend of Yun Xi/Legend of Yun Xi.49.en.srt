3
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,820
You owe nothing

4
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,700
to this world.

5
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:25,780
I know

6
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,300
you won’t be so cruel to me.

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,220
Forgive me

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,320
for making this decision.

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,500
Because this is the best

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,580
for both of us.

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,740
Don’t be afraid.

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,580
I won’t let you die.

13
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,020
I know you want me to live.

14
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,860
But you’re the only man

15
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,060
I love.

16
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:48,860
If you die,

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,700
I will have no one

18
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,660
to love anymore in this world.

19
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:54,740
I will spend every day

20
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,380
in the pain of losing you.

21
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,860
You can’t be so cruel to me.

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,380
I’m going to Qishao now.

23
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,460
Don’t know if he will

24
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,239
help draw blood from my heart.

25
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,620
If he doesn’t help,

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,900
I’ll do it myself.

27
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,260
I will save you

28
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,340
either way.

29
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,500
Wait for me.

30
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,200
What are you doing?

31
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,420
If you promise me to save His Highness,

32
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,740
I’ll promise you anything.

33
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,000
What do I need a dead woman’s promise for?

34
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,430
What are you doing? Put the knife down.

35
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,830
Gu Qishao, listen to me.

36
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:40,620
If His Highness dies,

37
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,680
I will kill myself.

38
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,220
You’re crazy!

39
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,220
This is a potion I made.

40
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,940
I count the rest on you.

41
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,539
After I die,

42
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,060
draw blood from my heart.

43
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,340
I beg you. No!

44
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:05,980
No!

45
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,620
No!

46

Are you stupid?

49
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,180
Why did you do that?

50
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,260
Why did you do that to me?

51
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,340
Qishao,

52
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,780
I made a wish once

53
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,710
that in my next life,

54
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,060
I will be your servant

55
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,220
to pay the debts I owe you in this life.

56
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,500
Good.

57
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,780
Good.

58
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,680
Handsome man and his pretty servant.

Where is Han Yunxi?

89
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,860
She passed away.

90
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,620
She died for you.

91
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,340
Didn’t you promise me

92
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,200
not to help her?

93
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,420
You think I wanted to?

94
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,320
I never wanted to save you.

95
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,780
How could I possibly let her die?

96
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,940
She took the Noxious Herb

97
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,960
and stabbed herself in the chest.

98
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,350
If I didn’t save you,

99
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,520
that would make

100
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,580
her death meaningless.

101
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,620
Then tell me

102
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,860
where her body is.

103
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,720
I want to see her for the last time.

104
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,000
She told me before she died

105
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,220
that she didn’t want you

106
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,620
to see her after she died.

107
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,300
She’s passed away.

108
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,180
So please

109
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,030
honor her last will.

Why did you do that to me?

113
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,740
You know I’d rather die

114
