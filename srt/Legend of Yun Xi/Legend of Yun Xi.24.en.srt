Episode 24

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,740
How can they be so ruthless?

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,000
They killed my mother,

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,610
threatened me with her

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,700
and hurt you again.

7
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,110
I’ll kill them!

8
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:18,820
Yunxi.

9
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:19,990
Calm down.

10
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,070
My mother was killed.

11
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,130
How can I calm down?

12
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,610
It’s not time for revenge.

13
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:27,770
Do you know?

14
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:28,700
Let me go!

15
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:29,950
Let me go!

16
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,510
What’s the matter?

17
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:04,739
Feiye,

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,400
Xifeng is back.

19
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:15,810
After Yunxi wakes up,

20
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,810
please do something for me.

21
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,200
How’s it going?

22
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,360
Everything goes well.

23
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,110
We’ve led them to the temple.

24
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,500
After a while,

25
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,820
His Majesty will

26
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:36,780
know that the Crown Prince

27
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,310
is making Gu-infected men.

28
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,740
I came up with

29
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,860
this idea.

30
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,490
Han Yunxi,

31
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:15,900
why did you...

32
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,070
Why did you do this?

33
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,070
Well done.

34
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,750
You won an honor.

35
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,570
The King Tianhui

36
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,070
tested us many times.

37
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,990
I should have told him

38
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,990
that Long Tianmo is making

39
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,950
Gu-infected men earlier.

40
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,070
Then, he won’t fix his eyes

41
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:39,990
on us.

42
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,770
How can His Majesty believe us

43
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,030
if the Gu-infected men are not erased?

44
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,450
It’s the right time.

45
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,200
He must believe us.

46
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,530
Qishao.

47
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,380
Chu Qingge sent us a message.

48
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,300
What’s the result this time?

49
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,150
We failed.

50
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,530
Long Feiye is

51
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,530
harder to deal with

52
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,660
than what I thought.

53
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,700
We still don’t know

54
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,790
if Long Feiye is a Gu-infected man.

55
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,160
Beili State keeps giving us pressure.

56
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,340
You erased the Crown Prince’s uncle,

57
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,650
and played King Tianhui, the Crown Prince

58
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,780
and Prince Qin off against each other.

59
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,780
But the situation is changing,

60
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,240
which makes me very worry.

61
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,240
The power of Prince Qin is enhanced.

62
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,280
And this is what people want.

63
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,110
I’m worried that though

64
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,780
we erase King Tianhui,

65
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,740
we still have a trickier rival,

66
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,400
Prince Qin.

67
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,190
You are right.

68
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,860
Now, father and brother

69
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,070
want the Gu-infected man very much.

70
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,450
And the point

71
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,700
is Long Feiye.

72
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,900
His weakness is only one.

73
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,329
Princess Qin?

74
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,030
If one way doesn’t work,

75
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,470
I’ll change another way.

76
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,020
[Hall of Virtue]

77
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,160
Darling, you’re finally awake.

78
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:21,740
Your Majesty.

79
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:27,850
For these days,

80
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,600
you must have a good rest.

81
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,550
The physician said that you need more rest.

82
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:33,210
Remember,

83
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,900
you can’t be so reckless.

84
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,050
Do you understand?

85
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,000
Your Majesty.

86
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,950
If time could go back,

87
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,450
I would protect you again.

88
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,030
Because your life

89
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,070
is much more important than mine.

90
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,150
Before you recover,

91
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,280
stay at my hall.

92
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,530
But this breaks the rule.

93
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,110
What rule?

94
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,450
I am the rule.

95
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,610
Just stay and rest.

96
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:11,750
I’ll take care

97
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,250
of other things.

98
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:15,740
I know.

99
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,700
Your Majesty,

100
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,860
they are back.

101
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,790
They are waiting out of the hall.

102
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,870
Your Majesty.

103
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,780
The state affair comes first.

104
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,490
Have a rest.

105
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,150
I’m sorry.

106
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,370
I didn’t seize the one who disguised
as Gu-infected man.

107
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,280
He’s a fake?

108
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,240
Your Majesty.

109
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,820
Did Prince Qin leave?

110
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,190
Yes.

111
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,860
Did you see

112
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,790
any weirdness of Prince Qin?

113
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,740
Your Majesty,

114
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,650
I fixed my eyes on him.

115
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,030
Prince Qin

116
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,780
is just weak.

117
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,110
I didn’t find

118
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,650
anything weird.

119
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,240
But

120
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,450
Chu Xifeng wasn’t with him.

121
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,860
Someone who I don’t know

122
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,350
picked Prince Qin up.

123
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,530
Seems that

124
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,840
Prince Qin is still suspected.

125
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,190
Watch Prince Qin

126
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,450
carefully.

127
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

128
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,580
Your Majesty.

129
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,990
What’s the matter?

130
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,820
I ran after

131
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,360
the fake Gu-infected man.

132
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,030
I arrived at the temple

133
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,240
where Poison Master was imprisoned.

134
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,280
I found someone was still

135
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,409
studying how to make Gu-infected men.

136
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,630
Do you know who is doing this?

137
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,950
Your Majesty,

138
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,250
it’s the Crown Prince.

139
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:12,990
You may go.

140
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,820
Yes.

141
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,700
The unfilial son!

142
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,700
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

143
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,400
Though His Majesty’s attention

144
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,660
has been transferred,

145
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,200
he is suspicious.

146
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,610
So he may

147
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,780
suspect you.

148
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,990
So what?

149
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:36,610
What can he do

150
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,820
without evidence?

151
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,110
Now His Majesty

152
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,490
has known that

153
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,650
the Crown Prince is making Gu-infected men,

154
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:44,990
which makes the father and son

155
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,120
suspect each other.

156
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,400
With King Tianhui’s temper,

157
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,900
he may not only abolish the Crown Prince,

158
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,240
but also kill him.

159
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,250
When the Crown Prince is restless,

160
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,260
we just take the advantage of him.

161
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,860
We will win.

162
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,240
What do you mean?

163
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,400
Feiye

164
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,780
has driven you out of the mansion.

165
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,490
Take your things

166
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,360
and leave here.

167
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,450
I don’t believe you.

168
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,500
Let me see him.

169
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,070
Listen,

170
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,570
Feiye and I

171
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,740
grew up together.

172
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,450
We are a perfect match.

173
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,100
I must see Long Feiye.

174
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,570
Tell him that I want to see him.

175
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,990
He dumped you.

176
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,650
For Feiye,

177
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,910
I don’t care my life.

178
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,820
And you?

179
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:55,950
What did you do?

180
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,320
Because of you, his identity

181
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,400
was almost exposed before His Majesty.

182
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,130
Because of you, he almost died.

183
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,010
How can you still stay with him?

184
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,430
I didn’t do it on purpose.

185
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,610
You didn’t do it on purpose?

186
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,700
You made Feiye

187
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,740
hurt severely.

188
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,460
If you were on purpose,

189
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,900
he would die!

190
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,360
Do you want Han Family and Prince Qin’s family

191
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,700
to die with you?

192
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,240
I just want to see him.

193
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,470
Your Highness,

194
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,750
will you really drive me out?

195
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,190
There’s no room

196
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,570
for you in this mansion.

197
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,990
Where is my mom’s tomb?

198
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:44,650
Tangmen.

199
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,780
Ningjing will take you to worship her.

200
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,110
Your Highness, thanks for

201
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,710
taking care of me these days.

202
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,620
I’ll leave. Take care.

by Prince Qin?

251

she didn’t go home a whole night.

that she did?

can detoxify your poison.

that you poisoned me?

00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,530

do you have?

316
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:14,940
recovered,

317
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:15,740

319

What should we do?

323

Wait and see.

324
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,110
Everything went well before.

325
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,360
But Feiye changed

326
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,700
his love suddenly.

327
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,400
It’s hard to

328
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:43,740
know men.

329
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,490
Don’t pin a label on men.

330
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,150
How many men do you know?

331
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,530
I don’t know many men,

332
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,900
but what a pity,

333
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,240
they are all bottom-class ones.

334
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,820
You!

335
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,110
Alright.

336
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,650
I won’t be serious with women.

337
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,360
I think what Feiye did is right.

338
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,740
Men should focus on big things.

339
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,700
How can he lose himself

340
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,700
in love?

341
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,310
I won’t waste time with you.

342
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,000
By the way,

343
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,070
let me tell you a secret.

344
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,530
But you can’t tell others.

345
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,990
Don’t worry.

346
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,190
I won’t risk

347
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,240
Feiye’s life.

348
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,450
It’s raining heavily.

349
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,910
Where can Han Yunxi go?

350
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,680
Your Highness.

351
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:30,310
Your Highness.

352
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,720
Your Highness!

353
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:37,470
Your Highness!

354
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:40,470
Your Highness.

355
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,280
Qishao.

356
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,600
Your Highness.

357
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,950
Why did you do this to me?

358
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,060
Your Highness.

359
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,320
You two

360
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,080
take care of her.

361
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,410
I’ll take some medicine for her.

362
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,420
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

363
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,070
Long Feiye rode a horse back

364
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,930
after the early meeting was over.

365
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,150
I don’t know

366
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,840
why he prefers riding horse?

367
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,900
[Long Feiye got up at 6 a.m., had breakfast at 8 a.m. and practiced sword and read books with Tang Li at 10 a.m..]

368
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,200
Give me!

369
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,650
Give me!

370
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,650
Give me!

371
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:57,780
Give me back!

372
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,860
♫ If this world fades ♫

373
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:05,740
♫ I’ll stay with you ♫

374
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,860
♫ Being in silence to firmly ♫

375

♫ Withstand the innumerable words ♫

376
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,670
♫ If everything in the world ♫

377
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,740
♫ Breaks down ruthlessly ♫

378
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,530
Who am I?

379
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,570
Are you drunk?

380
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,950
I am Princess Qin.

381
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,320
The whole world is the king’s place.

382
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,740
And in Prince Qin’s Mansion,

383
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,190
there must be my place.

384
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:39,680
brother,

385
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:41,200
Feiye.

386
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,350
What are you reading?

387
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,710
What’s the matter?

388
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,820
Feiye.

389
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,700
Are you thinking

390
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,650
of Han Yunxi?

391
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:56,900
Be serious.

392
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,190
Everything is under our control.

393
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:00,990
King Tianhui sent people

394
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:01,820
to the temple.

395
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,570
Be faster.

396
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,530
After you succeed in making Gu-infected men,

397
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,130
I’ll reward you handsomely.

398
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,520
Thanks, Your Highness.

399
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,820
Your Majesty.

400
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,030
Father, please calm down!

401
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,320
Forgive me, please!

402
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,610
I don’t dare to do it next time!

403
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:48,610
You don’t dare?

404
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,200
What don’t you dare to do?

405
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,700
You make Gu-infected men secretly.

406
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,280
Who do you want to fight against?

407
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,450
Me?

408
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,010
Father, you are the king.

409
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,110
I never think

410
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,260
of that evil thing.

411
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,950
I do this just to protect myself.

412
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,480
Please investigate it.

413
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:09,860
Protect yourself?

414
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,680
You are the Crown Prince.

415
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,400
You are only second to me in this country!

416
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,130
Why are you still unsatisfied?

417
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,450
I don’t dare to be unsatisfied.

418
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,740
But I’m afraid.

419
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,610
Uncle died,

420
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,180
and you treat me

421
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,360
worse and worse.

422
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,210
You also let my brother

423
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,340
deal with the issue of Poison Master.

424
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,110
I was scared

425
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,520
and made the mistake.

426
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,360
Please forgive me.

427
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,530
Shut your mouth!

428
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,150
Aren’t you embarrassed to mention your uncle?

429
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,820
He was very good to you.

430
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,190
I lost my mother in my childhood.

431
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,700
If my mother were here,

432
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,200
I wouldn’t be so stupid.

433
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,900
I’m always

434
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,190
alone.

435
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,200
I can’t get your love,

436
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,190
and you sent people to spy me.

437
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,530
I am

438
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,820
really desperate.

439
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,110
Please execute me.

440
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,030
Then I can

441
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,280
go to meet my mother.

442
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,490
I won’t make you angry.

443
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,570
What did you say?

444
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:20,360
Repeat

445
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:21,400
your words.

446
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:22,780
I beg you

447
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,400
to forgive me.

448
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,110
Say it!

449
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:28,900
I...

450
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:30,820
I said

451
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,400
that I am

452
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:33,610
always alone.

453
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,900
I can’t get your love,

454
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,450
and you sent people to spy me.

455
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,700
When did I send people

456
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,900
to spy you?

457
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:43,900
Tell me!

458
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,710
If you hadn't made Gu-infected men

459
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,950
and ruined my plan,

460
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,110
how could I know

461
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,190
your secret?

462
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,360
Father, I’m wronged.

463
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,900
I never succeed in

464
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,390
making Gu-infected men.

465
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,490
Those who drank poisonous Gu

466
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:59,860
all died.

467
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,320
How can I

468
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,610
ruin your thing?

469
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,070
What a framing game!

470
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:06,360
Guards!

471
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,870
Imprison the Crown Prince in Sun Hall.

472
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,570
Without my order,

473
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,990
he can’t go out!

474
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,740
Thanks, father.

475
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,120
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

476
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,450
I’m furious!

477
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,700
I’m so disappointed!

478
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,860
Her Royal Highness arrives!

479
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,110
Your Royal Highness.

480
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,120
Your Majesty.

481
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,110
Don’t be angry.

482
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,650
Your health is the most important.

483
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:52,570
Mother.

484
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,280
The Crown Prince really lets me down.

485
00:24:59,110 --> 00:24:59,990
I know.

486
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,700
The Crown Prince lost mother in his childhood.

487
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,560
So it’s understandable that he made some mistakes.

488
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:11,570
But the Crown Prince is essential to the country.

489
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:13,610
If you abolish him,

490
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,160
Your Majesty,

491
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,990
please think about the state.

492
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,320
It’s chaotic now.

493
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,110
Other countries are watching us.

494
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,650
And Prince Qin has evil desires.

495
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:34,070
Prince Qin’s power is enhanced.

496
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,360
And he is more and more

497
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,570
popular among the public.

498
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,580
Your Majesty.

499
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,530
It’s not a good time

500
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,400
to abolish the Crown Prince.

501
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,110
I know.

502
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,030
Now,

503
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:58,950
your only rival

504
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,320
is Prince Qin.

505
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,650
You asked me to cooperate with you last time

506
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,610
to make him

507
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,940
expose his identity, Gu-infected man.

508
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,990
But what a pity,

509
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,650
we didn’t get strong evidence.

510
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,320
Prince Qin

511
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,610
is cunning.

512
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:18,990
He plays tricks on me

513
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,150
and the Crown Prince.

514
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,200
He’s so evil!

515
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,670
It must be Prince Qin’s trick

516
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:29,990
that Gu-infected man assassinated me

517
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,280
and the Crown Prince made Gu-infected men.

518
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,240
Actually,

519
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,110
I have suspected Prince Qin’s identity

520
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,280
for long.

521
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:42,490
But I don’t have evidence,

522
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:43,860
and I don’t want to

523
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,590
make you go against each other.

524
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:48,820
Now that you

525
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,570
also suspects Prince Qin,

526
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,150
I’ll remind you.

527
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,570
The popular will always changes.

528
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,870
Prince Qin’s popular will is not good.

529
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,650
You can make him restless

530
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,950
with the popular will.

531
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,200
You mean...

532
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,900
Spread the information

533
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,400
that Prince Qin

534
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,070
is not a member of royal family.

535
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,530
He is the Gu-infected man

536
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:23,730
who has lived among the public for long.

537
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,820
I’ll see

538
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,760
whether he is well-received among people.

539
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,030
Mother, you are right.

540
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:34,990
Spread the information.

541
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,530
Yes, Your Majesty.

542
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,240
We can also

543
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,820
use his weakness.

544
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,780
Han Yunxi.

545
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,170
With the chaos inside and outside,

546
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,280
Prince Qin won’t take any action

547
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,070
though he has evil desires.

548
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:02,780
[Hongfu Inn]

549
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:04,540
Did you hear that

550
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,250
Prince Qin

551
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,400
is a Gu-infected man?

552
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,490
Everyone says so.

553
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,650
Is it real?

554
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,490
It is said

555
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:10,570
that he is not

556
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:11,360
Prince Qin.

557
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,700
He is not a member

558
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,300
of royal family of Tianning.

559
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:16,030
Don’t say that casually.

560
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,570
Slandering the royal family

561
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,950
is a capital crime.

562
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,130
I’m sure it’s true.

563
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,030
I have my way.

564
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,030
This information

565
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,160
is completely true.

566
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,950
The Crown Prince asked me here. Where is he?

567
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:28,570
Mr. Gu.

568
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,530
His Majesty found that His Highness

569
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:31,610
made Gu-infected men.

570
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,860
His Highness is imprisoned in Sun Hall.

571
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,150
What?

572
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,490
His Highness asked me to beg you

573
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:41,150
to think of an idea.

574
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:46,820
Father.

575
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:49,030
This thing goes very well.

576
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,110
Everyone in the capital city

577
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,370
is talking about that.

578
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,490
I think they will believe

579
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,150
that Prince Qin

580
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,610
is not a prince

581
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,740
but a Gu-infected man who’s been hiding away.

582
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:03,990
Tianqing.

583
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,950
You did well on it.

584
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,200
I made a mistake.

585
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,490
But father cares about me

586
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:11,110
and gave me a chance

587
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,190
to make up for it.

588
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,900
So I wouldn’t let you down

589
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:14,780
again.

590
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:19,240
After that thing,

591
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,900
you've grown up.

592
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,250
You are not like your brother
who’s good for nothing.

593
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,740
He was just confused.

594
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,450
Silence!

595
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,170
Don’t speak for him

596
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,450
on this.

597
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,820
Focus on

598
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,240
what I told you to do.

599
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,650
All the public must

600
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,450
know

601
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,450
the true color

602
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,610
of Prince Qin who they love.

603
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,740
Yes.

604
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,900
I’ll do it now.

605
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:02,280
Ningjing!

606
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,190
Why are you so anxious?

607
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,070
Bad news.

608
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,030
Everyone is talking about

609
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,320
that Feiye is a Gu-infected man

610
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,740
instead of a member of the royal family
of Tianning.

611
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,150
How did they know?

612
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,090
It must be because of Han Yunxi.

613
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,200
How come?

614
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,900
It is said that

615
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,240
on Her Royal Highness’s birthday feast,

616
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,280
Feiye had a fight with a master of Xiqiu

617
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,030
and got hurt.

618
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:19,700
When Han Yunxi

619
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,530
treated him,

620
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,490
she stabbed his acupoints with silver needles

621
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:23,530
and reversed his veins.

622
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,110
Feiye showed his true color.

623
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,200
Does His Majesty know this?

624
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,900
The rumor may not be totally true.

625
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,900
But Han Yunxi must

626
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,520
be the most suspicious one.

627
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,150
I don’t think so.

628
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,550
There’s no possibility.

629
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,400
Why?

630
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,740
It must be because after Han Yunxi

631
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,600
was driven out,

632
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,650
she hated Prince Qin

633
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:41,450
and revenged.

634
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:43,650
Han Yunxi is not this kind of person.

635
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,780
You know her well?

636
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:49,820
Does Feiye know it?

637
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:50,780
Gosh!

638
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:51,610
You are wasting my time

639
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:52,320
here.

640
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:53,490
I must tell him

641
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:54,150
now.

642
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,320
It’s your fault obviously.

643
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,190
Why do you blame me?

644
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:56,990
Stop talking.

645
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:57,700
Let’s go.

646
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,740
Why did you tell her

647
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,280
your real identity?

648
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,280
It must be her who told Her Royal Highness

649
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,700
because she hates you.

650
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,910
I believe that Yunxi

651
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,900
didn’t do so.

652
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:16,530
Why do you believe her?

653
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:17,820
Why did you

654
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:18,860
tell her this?

655
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:20,650
She is my wife.

656
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,240
Feiye.

657
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,490
Don’t forget.

658
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,030
You drove her out

659
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:24,960
of this mansion.

660
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,800
She is not your wife any longer.

661
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,970
It’s lucky that she’s not here.

662
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,450
Otherwise, this rumor

663
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,200
will hurt her much.

664
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,700
She’s not in this mansion,

665
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,610
but she is still my wife.

666
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,310
She is your sister-in-law.

667
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,320
I hope you can respect her.

668
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,400
Sister-in-law?

669
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,200
I never take you

670
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,240
as my brother.

671
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,820
Of course I won’t

672
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,700
take a stranger as sister-in-law.

673
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,200
Feiye!

674
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,570
Bad news!

675
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:55,900
They...

676
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,070
They are saying...

677
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:57,820
I have known.

678
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,820
You’ve known?

679
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,280
They are saying that

680
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,280
Han Yunxi made you show your true color

681
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,700
with silver needles.

682
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,950
Is this true?

683
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,700
It must be King Tianhui

684
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,150
who spread this rumor.

685
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,200
He wants us to be panic.

686
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:11,820
So Han Yunxi knows

687
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,550
that you are a Gu-infected man?

688
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,490
Now Han Yunxi knows

689
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,140
Feiye is a Gu-infected man,

690
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,990
and she also knows

691
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:19,320
Feiye’s real identity.

692
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:22,820
Tang Li.

693
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:24,820
Pass my order.

694
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,070
No one in this mansion can discuss about this,

695
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,240
and the more important is

696
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,840
that my mother can’t know it.

697
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:31,740
Yes.

698
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,030
Feiye.

699
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,350
What should we do now?

700
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,450
Someone must be waiting for me.

701
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,780
Your Majesty, Your Royal Highness.

702
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,650
You haven’t recovered.

703
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,610
Please stand up.

704
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,000
Thanks, Your Majesty.

705
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,650
Mother

706
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,320
mentioned you just now.

707
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,490
Have you known

708
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,700
the rumor of the public?

709
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,530
I am here for this.

710
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,110
The rumor of the public

711
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,070
is ridiculous.

712
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,780
Mother and I won’t believe it.

713
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:28,610
But

714
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,740
it’s not easy to stop people’s words.

715
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,220
Do you think so?

716
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,190
Time

717
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,530
will prove that.

718
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:38,950
I don’t think

719
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:41,190
rumors came out of thin air.

720
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:43,070
Mother,

721
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,320
I believe

722
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:46,900
Feiye is innocent.

723
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,190
But now all the ministers

724
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,740
report this to me.

725
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,360
Seems that they believe the rumor.

726
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,740
So it’s hard for me to deal with it.

727
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,360
Your Majesty.

728
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:00,280
Please give me a chance

729
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:04,030
to prove myself.

730
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,030
Feiye, don’t worry.

731
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,449
I will give you the chance.

732
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,360
But for your safety,

733
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:12,320
before your innocence is proved,

734
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,699
you and your guardians

735
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,280
should stay in the palace.

736
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,239
I’ll send General Mu

737
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,400
to protect your mansion.

738
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,110
Thanks, Your Majesty.

739
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:26,280
You may go.

740
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:27,650
Yes.

741
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:34,989
Your Majesty.

742
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,489
Good idea.

743
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:42,020
This is only the first step.

744
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:47,580
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

745
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:20,700
Mingxiang.

746
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:22,700
Mingxiang.

747
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,280
Mingxiang! Mingxiang!

748
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:31,390
What happened?

749
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,360
I’m fine.

750
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,200
The poison attacks.

751
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,200
I’ll be okay after drinking some medicine.

752
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,200
You are vomiting blood.

753
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,110
How can you be fine?

754
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,450
Don’t worry about me.

755
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:44,790
Don’t tell

756
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,280
Feiye about this.

757
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:49,280
I don’t want him

758
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,340
to see me like this.

759
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,490
Give me the medicine.

760
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,030
Stand up now.

761
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:02,590
Take care.

762
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,720
Your medicine.

763
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,220
How do you feel?

764
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,780
Are you getting better?

765
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,150
Though I don’t tell Feiye,

766
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:28,570
I need to

767
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,770
ask a physician here.

768
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:30,970
You really make

769
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,320
me worry.

770
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:34,950
I’m okay.

771
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,740
The poison always attacked before.

772
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,440
As long as I’m used to it.

773
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,150
I’ll be fine

774
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,570
after having medicine.

775
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:43,990
Now

776
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,200
Feiye’s identity has

777
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,700
been suspected.

778
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,740
I must have Beauty Blood soon.

779
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,360
Otherwise,

780
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:54,150
when Feiye’s poison attacks,

781
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:56,110
we’ll have no way.

782
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,740
Mingxiang.

783
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:01,950
For Feiye,

784
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,110
you have done a lot.

785
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,900
For Feiye,

786
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:10,780
I will do everything

787
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,520
even under the risk of my life.

788
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,190
Don’t worry about me.

789
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,320
Everyone has to die

790
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,200
sooner or later.

791
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,400
I won’t

792
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,450
leave any regret

793
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,900
if my death is worth.

794
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,700
I’m fine.

795
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:39,360
You can go back.

796
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,820
Take care.

797
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:12,240
Tang Li.

798
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,650
Why did you come out

799
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:18,860
from Mingxiang’s room

800
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,490
at night?

801
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,920
What’s the matter?

802
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,460
Why are your eyes with tears?

803
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,990
Did Baili Mingxiang

804
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:29,700
bully you?

805
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,280
Who else dares to bully me

806
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,200
beside you?

807
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,700
Why are you crying?

808
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,030
I just think

809
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,570
Mingxiang is pitiful.

810
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,490
She knew Feiye first,

811
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,740
and she did a lot for him.

812
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,900
But now...

813
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,490
Is that Han Yunxi better?

814
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,570
You can’t say that.

815
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,320
Love is not

816
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,610
in order of arrival.

817
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:01,780
Also,

818
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,530
everyone has his own taste.

819
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:05,030
You like feast,

820
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:05,900
but Feiye may like

821
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,360
light food.

822
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,150
I’ll repeat my words.

823
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,360
No one has right

824
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:11,220
to interfere

825
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,920
with others’ relationship.

826
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,190
If we don’t stop this,

827
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,200
Mingxiang

828
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:17,320
will

829
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:19,240
die soon.

830
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,280
Baili Mingxiang really

831
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:25,150
sacrifices a lot for Feiye.

832
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,570
Where is Yunxi now?

833
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,650
She must have an idea.

834
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:36,110
She must

835
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,570
hate us very much.

836
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,700
How can she save him?

837
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,190
She is my friend.

838
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,950
If I can find her,

839
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,870
I’m sure I can persuade her back.

840
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:52,110
She...

841
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,320
She is at Yaogui Valley.

842
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,830
How did you know?

843
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,460
Everyone knows it.

844
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:00,820
What?

845
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:01,990
You all take me as a kid!

846
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:03,520
You don’t tell me anything.

847
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:04,780
Go.

848
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:06,250
Let’s go to find Yunxi.

849
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,400
No.

850
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:09,170
I need to keep watch at night.

851
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:10,740
You are so annoying.

852
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,780
It’s not safe to go at night.

853
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,150
I’ll go with you

854
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,490
when day breaks.

855
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:22,320
Does this mean

856
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,580
that you care about me?

857
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,250
Forget my words.

858
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,450
Qishao.

859
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,190
Han Yunxi wakes up.

860
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,030
Really?

861
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,030
Good.

862
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,190
Protect her.

863
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,340
Ask what she needs.

864
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,490
When the medicine is finished,

865
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:58,490
I’ll go to see her.

866
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,900
She is very upset now,

867
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:00,960
just lying there

868
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:01,890
without a word.

869
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:02,900
We are kind to let

870
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,450
this sorehead Princess Qin stay here.

871
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:05,070
Should we

872
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,200
adapt to her disposition?

873
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,060
Don’t say that.

874
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,410
She is not in good mood.

875
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:16,700
Feiye.

876
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,860
What happened?

877
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,530
Why are

878
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,530
General Mu and his guardians

879
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:22,990
surrounding the mansion?

880
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:24,810
Mother, don’t worry.

881
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,700
On Her Royal Highness’s birthday,

882
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,450
a Gu-infected man assassinated His Majesty.

883
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:30,610
His Majesty suspects this is related to me,

884
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:32,940
so he ordered General Mu to surround here.

885
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:35,410
This must be Her Royal Highness’s trick.

886
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,230
Mother, don’t worry.

887
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,360
I am fine.

888
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:46,470
Your Highness.

889
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:48,650
I have something important

890
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:49,610
to discuss.

891
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,570
Mother, go back to rest.

892
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:53,950
Alright.

893
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,760
Your Highness,

894
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,490
if we are imprisoned here,

895
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:06,310
we can’t go to Serene Chamber.

896
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,820
Also, we can’t treat Poison Master.

897
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:09,640
Feiye.

898
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,000
I have something else.

899
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,150
Ningjing may have gone to Yaogui Valley

900
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,070
to find Han Yunxi.
