Episode 18

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,660
Your Highness,

4
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,090
how could I dare to deliver

5
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,390
the wrong order?

6
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:09,970
It’s true that

7
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,890
Concubine Qing is poisoned.

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,550
Poisoned?

9
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:28,510
Then she is

10
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,170
just a girl who knows nothing.

11
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,220
She doesn’t know how to detoxicate.

12
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:33,710
Your Highness,

13
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,350
Princess Qin

14
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,640
detoxicated the strange poison

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,300
on Royal Princess’s face.

16
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,800
Everyone in the Palace knows that.

17
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,680
Now Prince Qin is not here,

18
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,180
as his wife,

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,600
and Concubine Qing is dearly loved by His Majesty,

20
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,470
if she caused any problem,

21
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,760
how could I

22
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,050
explain to Prince Qin?

23
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,220
Eunuch Li, how about this?

24
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,260
Let me go with her.

25
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,690
Is that alright?

26
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,720
Your Highness,

27
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:12,390
if the treatment

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,370
for Concubine Qing is delayed,

29
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,890
I can’t bear the guilt.

30
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,300
Your Highness,

31
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,100
please don’t give me a hard time.

32
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:22,550
But…

33
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:24,720
Mother,

34
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:25,430
I’m confident that

35
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,890
I can cure Concubine Qing.

36
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,520
You’re still young. You don’t know it.

37
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,720
Concubine Qing is distinguished.

38
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,390
And she is the princess of Xiqiu.

39
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,590
If you fail to cure her

40
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,800
and cause the war,

41
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,430
even Feiye won’t be able to protect you.

42
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,490
Then I will cure her

43
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,420
and never

44
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,270
embarrass you and His Highness.

45
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,759
You…

46
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,259
Mother.

47
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,320
Please trust me.

48
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,430
I’ll come back soon.

49
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,180
I still need to

50
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,780
go to the lantern show later.

51
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,090
Alright.

52
00:01:58,509 --> 00:01:59,470
Take care.

53
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,930
Be careful, you know?

54
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,009
Thank you, Your Highness.

55
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,060
[Qinghui Hall]

56
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:21,430
How is it?

57
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,579
Can this poison be detoxified?

58
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,090
The poison is a mixture

59
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,390
of different strong poisons.

60
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,590
It’s really unusual.

61
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,060
But there is still a way to detoxify it.

62
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,100
Your Majesty, please don’t worry.

63
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,180
This will be cured.

64
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,090
Thanks for your help.

65
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,540
Don’t say that.

66
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,350
I’m a physician.

67
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,680
It’s my duty to help you.

68
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,010
Lie down and have a rest first.

69
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,810
I’ll go write the prescription.

70
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,579
Alright, dear.

71
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,510
Lie down.

72
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:51,730
Physician Gu,

73
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,720
prepare medicine according to this prescription

74
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,600
three times a day.

75
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,060
The poison will be detoxified in three days.

76
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,310
Your Majesty,

77
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,100
the herb called Zinnia in it

78
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,430
needs to be fresh to keep its effect.

79
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,010
The Zinnia in the Royal Plant House

80
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:20,930
is not ripe yet.

81
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:21,940
It can’t be used.

82
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,710
I know where it can be found.

83
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:25,800
Physician Gu,

84
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,100
you can go to Yaogui Valley.

85
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,700
They have ripe Zinnia there.

86
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,950
You can tell them you are my friend

87
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,300
when you arrive there.

88
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,430
The master of the valley will give you that.

89
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,180
Go now.

90
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,630
Yes, I’ll go right away.

91
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:43,890
Your Majesty,

92
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,140
since everything is done,

93
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,300
I’ll leave now.

94
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,430
Wait.

95
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,390
Concubine Qing is weak now.

96
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,650
I’m afraid there will be other troubles.

97
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:53,890
Princess Qin,

98
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,900
you can live in the palace for now

99
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,050
and go back home when

100
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,010
she recovers.

101
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:19,850
Take care.

102
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:29,000
Hah.

103
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:40,470
Qishao,

104
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,550
the King of Tianning sent someone to ask for herbs,

105
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,470
why didn’t you take the opportunity

106
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,100
to build a good relationship with His Majesty?

107
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:45,800
Why don’t you send the herbs

108
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,200
to the palace forwardly?

109
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,430
It’s of no use to play up to His Majesty.

110
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,720
Too much enthusiasm may

111
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,780
arouse suspicion.

112
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,970
We have a good relationship with the Crown Prince.

113
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:54,970
If he knows that

114
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,450
we play up to His Majesty,

115
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,850
we’ll fail to get along with both sides.

116
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,650
Yuze gave the Crown Prince away,

117
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,680
will he really not be

118
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,970
suspicious of us?

119
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,640
Now in this situation,

120
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,470
he has no reliable person

121
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,470
around him.

122
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,850
And Tianhui

123
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,590
is now watched by Chu Qing’ge.

124
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,930
Is there a better

125
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,090
spy than her?

126
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,180
But this poison girl

127
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,300
got me lose a few Zinnias

128
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,140
this time.

129
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,800
Next time I see her,

130
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,590
I’ll let her pay double times.

131
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,390
Qishao,

132
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,090
we still haven’t found

133
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,220
detailed information

134
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,550
about Long Feiye and Poison Master.

135
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,510
And the Crown Prince is urging again.

136
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,040
Where can we break through?

137
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,400
We got someone to help us now.

138
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,820
Qishao, where are you going?

139
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,350
That person is Princess Qin, of course.

140
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,090
You’re finding the excuse

141
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,550
to see Princess Qin again.

142
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:47,680
Fine.

143
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,090
Then you don’t have to

144
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,680
feed the rabbit to miss her every day.

145
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,140
Look how fat it is now.

146
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,270
You’re right.

147
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,810
I really miss her a lot.

148
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:56,350
You…

149
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,550
I’m going to see what she

150
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,510
is doing now.

151
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,760
What if His Highness gets impatient

152
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,050
and leaves first?

153
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,140
Lantern show. Lantern show.

154
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,300
- Your… - Your Majesty!

155
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,800
Your Majesty.

156
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:30,640
Go ahead.

157
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,510
Your Majesty,

158
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,640
I took people

159
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,850
to search Noble Consort Xiao’s place.

160
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,600
But nothing was found.

161
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,580
When we were about to leave,

162
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,350
a maid in charge of planting flowers

163
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,260
suddenly got poisoned

164
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,990
and died beside the flowerpot.

165
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,300
I asked people to dig up the flowerpot

166
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,760
that the maid had planted,

167
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,090
and found a bag

168
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,350
of poison powder in it.

169
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,930
I took it to the Imperial Physicians

170
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,610
and they said it’s the poison Her Highness got.

171
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,930
That means

172
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,970
you found the evidence,

173
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,290
but the witness died.

174
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:04,760
So it can’t prove directly that

175
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,970
it’s done by Noble Consort Xiao,

176
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:06,600
right?

177
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:07,620
No, it can’t.

178
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,480
Your Majesty,

179
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,970
I think

180
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,800
this is not Xiao’s fault.

181
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,100
Your Majesty,

182
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,720
Xiao

183
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,970
gave every concubine the dessert.

184
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,350
Why

185
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,290
am I the only one who got poisoned?

186
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,260
This is the first doubt.

187
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,850
Eunuch Li took people to search,

188
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,760
but the maid died suddenly.

189
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,500
That’s the second doubt.

190
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,930
With Xiao’s personality,

191
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,430
if she really wanted to poison me,

192
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,010
how could she have

193
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,430
put the evidence in such an obvious place?

194
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:43,680
So,

195
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,050
to prevent chaos in the harem,

196
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,350
please let this go.

197
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,390
I can’t do that.

198
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,220
If she dares to hurt you,

199
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,390
she will dare to do harm to me one day.

200
00:07:59,100 --> 00:07:59,890
But

201
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,010
Xiao is Tianqing’s mother.

202
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,050
Without hard evidence,

203
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:05,970
you can’t convict her.

204
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,550
I think

205
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,970
we can’t act rashly.

206
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,930
The investigation can be done secretly.

207
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,390
Then I’ll do it as you said.

208
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,550
You are really clever.

209
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,800
This harem struggle is really complicated.

210
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,309
Your Majesty,

211
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,720
now I feel

212
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,100
better.

213
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:38,600
People with no duty now

214
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,049
can leave.

215
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:42,850
I only

216
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:45,300
want you to be by my side.

217
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,300
But…

218
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:47,770
Your Majesty,

219
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,510
after the poisoned blood is discharged,

220
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,930
Her Highness’s mood is unsettled.

221
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,260
And the medicine also

222
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,640
consumed her energy.

223
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,750
Now Her Highness needs more rest.

224
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,600
Fine.

225
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,220
Princess Qin,

226
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,220
you may leave now.

227
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:04,890
If Concubine Qing feels

228
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:05,720
uncomfortable again,

229
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,970
you should come again right away.

230
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,370
Thank you, Your Majesty.

231
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,540
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

232
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:19,970
Your Highness.

233
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:20,800
His Highness is still not back yet?

234
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,680
No.

235
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:23,980
That’s great.

236
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,450
I thought I would be late.

237
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,010
Then I’ll go to change my clothes

238
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,670
and wait for him on the street.

239
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:34,760
Delicious sugar-coated haws!

240
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,220
Sugar-coated haws!

241
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,260
Delicious sugar-coated haws!

242
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,610
I want two sticks of it.

243
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:46,800
Here you are.

244
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,220
Here.

245
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,090
OK.

246
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,970
That’s great.

247
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,640
So beautiful.

248
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,990
This way!

249
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,020
Come here!

250
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,480
Come on.

251
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,210
Your Highness!

252
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,230
Your Highness, are you alright?

253
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,170
You move back to Pavilion of Leisure tonight.

254
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,140
Why?

255
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,010
Did I allow you to move in?

256
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:37,680
You…

257
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,090
You didn’t ask me to move out yesterday.

258
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,750
Why should I move out tonight?

259
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,060
It’s not negotiation.

260
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,550
It’s an order.

261
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,350
OK, I’ll move.

262
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,260
Feiye,

263
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,050
if it keeps going like this,

264
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,260
will Yunxi get us wrong?

265
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,850
I can’t let her know

266
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,930
that I got poisoned by poisonous Gu.

267
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:26,850
I got it.

268
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,510
This is between

269
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,970
you and me.

270
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,640
I won’t let her know.

271
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,280
The poisonous Gu

272
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,760
is suppressed for now.

273
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,850
You can go back to rest now.

274
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,200
Ask Xifeng to guard outside.

275
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,570
No one is allowed in

276
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,860
except you and Tang Li.

277
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:42,510
Yes.

278
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,720
I see.

279
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,180
Yunxi.

280
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,050
One day,

281
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,600
you will understand

282
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,470
everything I do now

283
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,800
is for you.

284
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,720
Move them in.

285
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,510
Be careful.

286
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,220
Clean this up.

287
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,140
Put it here. Slow down.

288
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:20,590
Be careful.

289
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,640
- Get those ready first. - Yes.

290
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,260
Your Highness,

291
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,680
don’t be upset.

292
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,850
Since you moved in there this time,

293
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,450
you will get another chance.

294
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,640
Maybe His Highness

295
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,890
has his own difficulty

296
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,050
or he is in bad mood.

297
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,150
When he figures it out,

298
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,600
he will definitely ask you

299
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,660
to move back there.

300
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,260
Madam Zhao,

301
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,930
it’s so late now.

302
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,470
What are the two of them

303
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,090
doing in Mingyue Chamber now?

304
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,050
Well,

305
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,850
I don’t know.

306
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,390
But

307
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,050
I believe in His Highness.

308
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,100
Lone male and female.

309
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,100
Anything might happen.

310
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:44,930
Your Highness.

311
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,260
Is His Highness inside?

312
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,180
Yes.

313
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,260
But

314
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,260
he is dealing with

315
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,140
some military affairs.

316
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,800
So, please don’t disturb.

317
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,300
Military affairs?

318
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:58,850
Yes.

319
00:14:58,930 --> 00:14:59,760
I see.

320
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,270
I won’t disturb him.

321
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,680
If it’s military affair,

322
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,340
why is Baili Mingxiang there?

323
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,220
I don’t know.

324
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:14,680
Xifeng,

325
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,760
send Princess Qin away.

326
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,260
Yes.

327
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:20,870
Your Highness,

328
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,160
you heard that.

329
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:23,550
Please.

330
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,260
Does he

331
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,760
really have affairs

332
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,020
with Baili Mingxiang?

333
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,800
Did they…

334
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:30,790
Your Highness,

335
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,930
please don’t give me a hard time.

336
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:33,720
Please.

337
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,390
Luckily, he is there.

338
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,010
At least there are not only the two of them.

339
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:48,850
Han Yunxi,

340
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,550
stop thinking too much.

341
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,430
Your Highness, please.

342
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,540
Your Highness.

343
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,760
This way.

344
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,260
I didn’t expect that

345
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,140
the poisonous Gu broke out

346
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,470
earlier than expected.

347
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:12,470
Feiye,

348
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,550
the Gu in you breaks out

349
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,010
more and more frequently.

350
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:15,930
We need to find Poison Master

351
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,060
as soon as possible.

352
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,170
Only he can make

353
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,730
the real antidote of the Gu.

354
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,470
When I practice into Beauty Blood,

355
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,100
I can also save Feiye.

356
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,510
Beauty Blood is just a legend.

357
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,800
What if it’s just a palliative?

358
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,530
Poison Master is still the key.

359
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,410
Here’s a present for you.

360
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,390
What is it?

361
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,100
It’s the poison

362
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,140
I made.

363
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,390
The note in it will tell you how to use.

364
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,350
You can use it to protect yourself.

365
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,050
Thank you.

366
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:54,640
Your Highness,

367
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,440
please take the medicine first.

368
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,750
Don’t think too much.

369
00:16:59,010 --> 00:16:59,850
Your Highness.

370
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,140
Princess Qin said

371
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,720
the poison in your body

372
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:03,850
can be detoxified completely

373
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,470
after this medicine.

374
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,430
Please don’t take risk again.

375
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,099
Your body can’t bear it again.

376
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,800
See you, Xiao.

377
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,720
Your Highness, see you.

378
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,120
Your Highness,

379
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,310
let me throw it away.

380
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:40,890
No.

381
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,010
Take a silver needle to test it.

382
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,850
Your Highness, you’re considerate.

383
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,450
I’ll go find a silver needle.

384
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,050
Madam.

385
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,180
Look,

386
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,680
I’m fine now.

387
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,470
But it’s still so dangerous.

388
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,460
[Qinzheng Hall]

389
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,890
Father, please make a judicious judgment.

390
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,800
Someone must have framed mother.

391
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:48,720
No matter how stupid her can be,

392
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,300
she would never

393
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,140
give poisonous dessert

394
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,050
to Concubine Qing

395
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,310
in front of the public.

396
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,390
There is many doubts about the matter.

397
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,550
Don’t worry.

398
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,100
I will definitely clear

399
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,230
your mother’s name.

400
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,410
Thank you, father.

401
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,600
Raise.

402
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:04,720
Yes.

403
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:09,720
I asked you to build

404
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,260
the dungeon in the palace.

405
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,470
How is it going?

406
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,090
Does anyone know about it?

407
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,390
Father,

408
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,510
I took the excuse of

409
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,640
building the temple

410
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,430
to ask Ministry of Works to send people.

411
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,850
All the construction site had been blocked.

412
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,600
The workers lived and ate in the palace.

413
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,130
No one was allowed to go out.

414
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,930
Now the dungeon in the palace

415
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:34,970
has been built.

416
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,050
And I

417
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,850
have killed all the workers

418
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,600
and buried their bodies

419
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,010
in the countryside.

420
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,090
Great.

421
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,760
You got things done cleanly.

422
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,850
I’m not wrong about you.

423
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,350
You may leave now.

424
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,100
Yes.

425
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,260
Li Quan.

426
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,820
Yes, Your Majesty.

427
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,640
Investigate the matter

428
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,240
of Concubine Qing secretly.

429
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,220
Remember

430
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,080
to send people to watch Noble Consort Xiao.

431
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,850
Don’t let anything go.

432
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

433
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,090
Crown Prince said

434
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,510
the poison from Noble Consort Xiao is special.

435
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,390
Even the Imperial Physicians can’t figure it out.

436
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,680
He could do nothing.

437
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,470
Or

438
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,720
he wouldn’t

439
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,110
have done nothing to Noble Consort Xiao.

440
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,120
And there is no evidence.

441
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:38,890
If

442
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,050
I proposed it to Tianhui,

443
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,220
Noble Consort Xiao

444
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,420
would have made a false countercharge,

445
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,510
and caused his suspicion of me.

446
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,520
There is one thing I don’t understand.

447
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,050
Why is there

448
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,220
a same poison as ours

449
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,430
found in her place?

450
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,430
Thanks to Gu Qishao.

451
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,390
He lied to the Crown Prince

452
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,200
that Beili has a poison which can protect himself

453
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,300
and asked him

454
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,890
to write the letter to tell me

455
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,300
that Noble Consort Xiao would poison me,

456
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,470
suggesting me to countermine

457
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,930
and make a big deal of it.

458
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,550
And the Crown Prince sent people

459
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,500
to change Noble Consort Xiao’s poison.

460
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:23,220
That’s the whole story?

461
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,540
I didn’t expect

462
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,530
Noble Consort Xiao to be so stupid.

463
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,850
She is so arrogant at usual

464
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,800
but so timid actually.

465
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,090
She asked her maid to bury the poison

466
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,890
right after she heard her place would be searched.

467
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,050
She gave herself away.

468
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,970
His Majesty must suspect it now.

469
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,390
And Your Highness,

470
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,100
you suggested to investigate secretly.

471
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,600
In that way,

472
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,850
I think many troubles

473
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,470
will be caused.

474
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:58,930
Why is he still not back?

475
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,470
I’m so worried!

476
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:01,470
Mother!

477
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:02,470
Mother.

478
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,050
Tianqing! Tianqing.

479
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,140
Tianqing,

480
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,430
finally you are back.

481
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,470
What can I do?

482
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,600
Now everyone is suspecting me.

483
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,430
Your father

484
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,930
also found the poison powder here.

485
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,130
Mother, don’t worry.

486
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:15,490
You must be

487
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,570
framed by someone.

488
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:17,760
Our poison

489
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:18,550
would never cause

490
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,850
the symptoms Concubine Qing had.

491
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:20,850
But it’s true that

492
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,220
Concubine Qing got poisoned.

493
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,890
Will your father…

494
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,470
Mother. Mother.

495
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,760
Calm down.

496
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,930
I went to see father just now.

497
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,970
He didn’t mean to look into this thing.

498
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,900
That means he doesn’t suspect you.

499
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,100
Or with his temper,

500
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,120
he would have given order to investigate strictly.

501
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:42,930
You mean, we…

502
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,720
There must be many people

503
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,390
in the harem

504
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,890
who want to hurt Concubine Qing.

505
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,550
Father loves her the most now.

506
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,640
Many people envy her.

507
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:52,800
So this time

508
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:53,800
it must be someone

509
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,680
who wanted to

510
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,360
kill her through your hands.

511
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,510
But it’s a coincidence that

512
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,220
we also

513
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,760
wanted to poison her.

514
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,470
Then, who is that?

515
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,140
Who prevented my plan

516
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,680
and got me suspected?

517
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:11,640
Mother,

518
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,970
I’ll find it out.

519
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:15,090
What you need to do now

520
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,300
is to pretend that

521
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,410
nothing happened.

522
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,510
Remember

523
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,410
not to give the show away.

524
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,000
Your Highness.

525
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,390
His Majesty added

526
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,850
more soldiers around the temple.

527
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:29,910
Have you got the map

528
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:30,870
of the dungeon?

529
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:31,680
Yes.

530
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,600
The three dungeons they built

531
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,130
are all in the countryside.

532
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,180
And every dungeon

533
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,100
is heavily guarded.

534
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,540
[Map of Tianning]

535
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,180
So our people

536
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,850
can’t get in there for now.

537
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:47,760
We can only hijack

538
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,160
Poison Master on the way they transfer him.

539
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,140
Once the Poison Master is locked in the dungeon,

540
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,720
it’ll be hard for us to get him.

541
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:58,970
I see.

542
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,680
Anything else?

543
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:09,790
Your Highness,

544
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,010
Princess Qin

545
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,680
went to see a friend today.

546
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,920
The Master of Yaogui Valley, Gu Qishao.

547
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,180
But Yaogui Valley

548
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,290
is not open to the public.

549
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,300
And Gu Qishao

550
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,760
is a mysterious person.

551
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:24,930
So it’s difficult

552
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,790
for our people to watch him.

553
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,390
And we know

554
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,760
little of him.

555
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,510
I see.

556
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:35,720
Lass,

557
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:36,840
you not only

558
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,140
come to my valley for herbs,

559
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,510
but also let others go there.

560
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,510
If you keep doing this,

561
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,430
my Yaogui Valley will end up

562
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,760
living beyond my means.

563
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,220
How silly you are!

564
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,680
It’s the King’s money.

565
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,600
Why not accept it?

566
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,930
You should have told me earlier.

567
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:49,730
If you told me,

568
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,760
I would have asked for double price.

569
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,100
You didn’t go wild

570
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,100
after you got drunk

571
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,830
in my valley last time, did you?

572
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,180
Stay away from him.

573
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,850
He is mine.

574
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,720
You did?

575
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,260
No! No!

576
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,820
I fell asleep right after I went back.

577
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,260
I thought

578
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,610
you would act wildly to Prince Qin.

579
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,050
Prince Qin…

580
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,480
What’s wrong?

581
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,350
He made you angry?

582
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,050
He is so busy recently.

583
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:38,850
I haven’t seen him

584
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:39,760
for days.

585
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,050
That means

586
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,140
your relationship is not that good.

587
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:47,850
How about this?

588
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,380
Put me into consideration.

589
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,530
Don’t just think

590
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,050
about the title of Princess.

591
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,100
You can have a happy life

592
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,500
in Yaogui Valley with me.

593
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,350
Don’t make a joke like that.

594
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,620
Feiye, you’re off duty now?

595
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,300
Greetings, Prince Qin.

596
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:10,380
Even this shop is graced by your presence.

597
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,470
This is my friend, Gu Qishao.

598
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,680
Don’t bother to introduce.

599
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,480
We are familiar with each other.

600
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,050
You know each other?

601
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,550
We got to know each other

602
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,930
because of you.

603
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,930
Do you know why

604
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:28,300
I was after her that day?

605
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,640
Of course I know.

606
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,850
She has told me.

607
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,050
Because

608
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,140
she saw your face.

609
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,750
So you wanted to kill her.

610
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:37,800
As for why

611
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,260
you are so cruel,

612
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,080
I’d like to hear the reason.

613
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,220
Are you a regular guest of Gorgeous Chamber?

614
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,260
Not really.

615
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,260
What?

616
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,100
You also go there usually?

617
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,550
You even went to a brothel?

618
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,930
I wonder if you know

619
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,800
the courtesan there, Yuze.

620
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,510
Of course I knew Yuze.

621
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,100
She is famous.

622
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,350
People who have been to Gorgeous Chamber

623
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,140
all know her.

624
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,300
But I heard that someone made

625
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,090
a tremendous uproar there

626
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,300
and Yuze was missing.

627
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,490
Later that brothel

628
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,370
was closed down several times.

629
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,320
Do Your Highness

630
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,090
have anything to do with that?

631
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,430
I was the one who caught her

632
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:40,110
and interrogated her under torture.

633
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,220
She kept saying

634
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,560
“Master” while she was in a coma.

635
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,890
I didn’t know the meaning at first.

636
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,300
But now I know.

637
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,220
Know what?

638
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,540
Your Highness.

639
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,140
Is there any

640
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,940
misunderstanding between you?

641
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,010
Prince Qin,

642
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,630
let me tell you this directly.

643
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:13,180
It’s so tiring to talk in circles with you.

644
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,930
I used to be Yuze’s benefactor.

645
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,360
And I also saved Princess Qin’s life.

646
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,140
As for the reason why

647
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,850
I didn’t let you search my valley

648
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:22,250
is that

649
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,260
I didn’t know your identity.

650
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,100
Now

651
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,890
you want to arrest me without

652
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:28,680
any reason.

653
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,560
I think you can’t throw

654
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:33,460
your weight around even if you are the Prince.

655
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,480
Take him away.

656
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,100
Master.

657
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:42,720
Please.

658
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:00,290
Your Highness, you also want to torture me?

659
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,580
Your Highness,

660
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,470
Gu Qishao is my life savior.

661
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,260
When you sent people

662
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,260
to hunt me down before,

663
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,510
if it hadn’t been him,

664
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,850
I would have died already.

665
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:08,430
You can’t just

666
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,160
arrest him without any reason.

667
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,400
You are defending him?

668
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,220
He is my friend.

669
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,300
As long as I can,

670
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:20,630
I have to protect him.

671
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,110
I’m leaving now.

672
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:39,510
Go.

673
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,050
Master,

674
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,110
are you alright?

675
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,510
I’m fine.

676
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,180
Luckily, I took you with me today.

677
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,300
If I took Zhu Yu with me,

678
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,230
with her temper,

679
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,510
she would cause trouble.

680
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,970
You were almost arrested just now.

681
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:02,700
Don’t worry.

682
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,630
They were just pretending.

683
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,260
If they really wanted to arrest me,

684
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,180
they wouldn’t have

685
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,710
talked so much before that.

686
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,220
They just made a test.

687
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,850
Luckily I didn’t do anything today.

688
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:15,910
Or I would have been in the prison now.

689
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,850
Prince Qin.

690
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,050
Do you

691
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,900
really suspect me now?

692
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,180
Master, you have to be

693
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,790
more careful in the future.

694
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,620
Your Highness.

695
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:42,900
Are you alright?

696
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,350
I’m fine.

697
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,930
You should go back to rest.

698
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,260
Feiye,

699
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,600
you haven’t recovered yet.

700
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,910
You shouldn’t have gone outside.

701
00:31:59,090 --> 00:31:59,800
Mingxiang,

702
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,090
you’re weak now.

703
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:04,390
You should have more rest.

704
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,720
Thanks for your concern.

705
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,970
Then I’m going back now.

706
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,260
A heavy smell of herbs.

707
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,750
He is really having medicine.

708
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,220
Long Feiye,

709
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,400
what disease are you having?

710
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,360
Why don’t you let me help you?

711
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:42,930
Right.

712
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:44,680
As long as I can know

713
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,880
what medicine Baili Mingxiang made is,

714
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,770
I can find out what disease it is.

715
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,510
Miss Baili.

716
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,050
Help me to clean it

717
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,550
and send it to my room.

718
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,930
I need to use it tomorrow.

719
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:02,720
Yes.

720
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,140
Your Highness.

721
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,470
Just leave me alone.

722
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,720
I’m hungry

723
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:15,390
and come to see if there is anything to eat.

724
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:16,090
Your Highness,

725
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,390
here are some freshly baked osmanthus cakes.

726
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,650
Let me get some for you.

727
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,510
Why is it poisonous?

728
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,010
Is anyone sick?

729
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,720
Whose medicine is this?

730
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:47,850
Your Highness,

731
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,720
Miss Mingxiang is making medicine.

732
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,650
We’re just doing

733
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,680
the washing work.

734
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,740
She made the medicine alone?

735
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,620
Your Highness.

736
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:04,760
I’m sorry.

737
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:05,760
Let me in.

738
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:06,640
I got something important

739
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,800
to tell His Highness.

740
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,659
Your Highness,

741
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,719
you can’t get in there.

742
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:10,600
His Highness is having a rest.

743
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,300
Please come tomorrow.

744
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,010
No way!

745
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,230
I have to see him now.

746
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:14,469
Feiye!

747
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,250
-Feiye!
-Your Highness!

748
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:17,929
Xifeng.

749
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:19,010
Let her in.

750
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:20,050
Yes.

751
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,760
What’s the matter?

752
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,389
His breath is stable.

753
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:30,969
If Baili Mingxiang

754
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:32,290
really poisoned him,

755
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,389
either the poison is not effecting yet

756
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:35,989
or he is not deeply poisoned.

757
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:39,760
Feiye,

758
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,050
your face

759
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:42,510
looks like you’re poisoned.

760
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,110
Do you need me to have a check?

761
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:45,190
Don’t bother.

762
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:46,889
I was eager to

763
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,469
succeed in practicing these days

764
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:51,260
and got countercharged by my power.

765
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,600
I’ll be fine after days of rest.

766
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,300
But…

767
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,139
No.

768
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,719
If I tell him,

769
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,730
Baili Mingxiang won’t admit it.

770
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,430
And it will alert her.

771
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,410
If there is nothing else,

772
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,720
you can leave now.

773
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,430
Then, take care.

774
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:17,960
Your Highness,

775
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,100
does Her Highness know

776
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,630
that you’re poisoned by Gu?

777
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,040
She is good at using poison.

778
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:25,720
It’s normal for her to know I got poisoned.

779
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:26,550
But she doesn’t know

780
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,750
what poison it is now.

781
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,220
After I finish

782
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,550
the last dose tomorrow,

783
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,140
the Gu will be settled down for now.

784
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:33,800
And then

785
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:34,930
we just need to

786
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,850
put her off with something else.

787
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,220
Again?

788
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,470
So childish!

789
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,410
What medicine did Han Yunxi give you again?

790
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,010
Special sleeping powder.

791
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:07,510
You!

792
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,220
Do you feel dizzy and

793
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:10,510
want to sleep now?

794
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:32,650
Ningjing!

795
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,680
What do you want to do?

796
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,430
Let go of me!

797
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:39,180
Mother depends on child.

798
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,430
After tonight,

799
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,050
he’ll be my man.

800
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,390
Let go of me!

801
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,570
What are you doing?

802
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,930
What do you want to do?

803
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,950
You should sleep with me tonight.

804
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,180
With you?

805
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,300
Yes.

806
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,720
With me.

807
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:08,430
Help! Help me! Help!

808
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,260
Ningjing wants to act indecently to me!

809
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,260
Help!

810
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,220
Help me! Help me!

811
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,350
Help me!

812
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,970
Tang Li,

813
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:37,930
I like you so much.

814
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,930
Why don’t you like me?

815
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,140
Tang Li.

816
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,180
I like you.

817
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,470
Can you like me?

818
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,970
Tang Li.

819
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:50,800
Tang Li.

820
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:52,930
Tang Li.

821
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,140
Tang Li.

822
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,220
Tang Li.

823
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,010
Tang Li.

824
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,600
Tang Li.

825
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,300
Tang Li.

826
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,640
Tang Li.

827
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,460
There is nothing wrong with this.

828
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,940
It’s really the same as yesterday.

829
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,350
She must put poison in it.

830
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:10,470
Baili Mingxiang,

831
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,100
let’s wait and see.

832
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:23,800
Feiye,

833
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:24,850
have the medicine now.

834
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:25,580
This time, I…

835
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,570
What are you doing?

836
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:30,760
Do you know

837
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,760
that this is hard to make?

838
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,020
What’s wrong with you?

839
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:38,050
Look.

840
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:39,430
It’s poisonous.

841
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,880
She wants to poison you.

842
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:44,470
I believe that Mingxiang won’t do harm to me.

843
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,470
Get out now.

844
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,850
She made the medicine herself.

845
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:47,930
No one helped her.

846
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:49,180
It’s such an obvious evidence.

847
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,220
Why are you defending her?

848
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,480
Can you guarantee that

849
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,180
Mingxiang never leaves

850
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,720
your sight for a moment?

851
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,140
Han Yunxi,

852
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:00,680
don’t think that

853
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,010
you can do anything you want

854
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:03,940
because you’re the Princess here.

855
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:05,350
I spoiled you a lot.

856
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:06,470
Get out!

857
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,680
You did this to me

858
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,550
just for her?

859
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,350
Xifeng!

860
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,010
Yes.

861
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,390
Walk Princess Qin out.

862
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,540
Your Highness,

863
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:16,930
please.

864
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,600
From now on,

865
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:19,800
I won’t care

866
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,260
about you again!

867
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:29,870
Your Highness!

868
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,430
Miss Mingxiang,

869
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,090
what are you doing?

870
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:32,890
I need to use my blood

871
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:33,760
to detoxicate Feiye!

872
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,360
Nonsense!

873
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,090
Feiye,

874
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,110
you need my blood

875
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,220
to detoxify the poisonous Gu.

876
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,850
