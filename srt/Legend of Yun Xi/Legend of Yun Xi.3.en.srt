00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,980
Episode 3

3
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:13,750
Your Highness,

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,420
you don’t need to be insulted like this.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,390
I really can’t stand it.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:20,890
Lower your voice.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,910
His Highness did it on purpose.

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,490
Granting an imperial sedan
is in the eyes of the people.

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,680
Stripping off the armor

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,140
makes His Highness

11
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,390
suffer embarrassment and hardships.

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,510
The Ministry of Revenue is being difficult,

13
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,100
so he strips off the armor and asks for punishment.

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,500
It’s not disobeying the emperor's orders.

15
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,510
As the victor, he isn’t awarded but punished.

16
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,910
His Majesty is the one being put on the spot.

17
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,350
You can wait and see!

18
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:52,980
Your Majesty.

19
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,300
What is the matter?

20
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,510
Prince Qin stripped off his armor

21
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,720
and asked for punishment.

22
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,550
He also said…

23
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,390
What?

24
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,050
Prince Qin said

25
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,140
if Your Highness don’t call him in,

26
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,540
he’ll kneel in front of the former emperor.

27
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,050
Ridiculous!

28
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,390
It’s really ridiculous!

29
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,010
He enjoyed the honor of a triumph.

30
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,850
So he could just strip off the armor as he wished,

31
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,680
but why did he ask for punishment.

32
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,220
It obviously means I did him an injustice.

33
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,930
Call Prince Qin in!

34
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,430
Yes, Your Highness!

35
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,220
Call Prince Qin in!

36
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,350
Call Prince Qin in!

37
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,140
Call Prince Qin in!

38
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,259
Call Prince Qin in!

39
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,430
Your Majesty!

40
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,180
Feiye.

41
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,680
Rise!

42
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:16,720
As you were!

43
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,300
It’s said

44
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,960
the war against Xiqiu

45
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,180
caused an empty treasury.

46
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,010
I

47
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,290
feel really nervous.

48
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,980
Although Xiqiu was put to the rout,

49
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,340
I have to strip off and beg forgiveness.

50
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,260
There is one thing

51
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,720
I have to speak out.

52
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,550
Yes?

53
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,260
The war

54
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,180
always causes the most suffering

55
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,380
to the common people.

56
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,720
After I came back,

57
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,260
it's the first and foremost
to open the granary-grain

58
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,720
and relief victims.

59
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,360
But there are often

60
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,850
big rats.

61
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:57,680
Feiye.

62
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,800
What is your point?

63
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,100
Cornering the market or making a fortune

64
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,900
in state calamity is not the most serious problem.

65
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,510
Some people levy taxes

66
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,780
under all sorts of pretexts.

67
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,800
It even includes food tax.

68
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,660
I heard of it for the first time.

69
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,050
People need to pay even for having food.

70
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,350
Assistant Minister, the Ministry of Revenue.

71
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,390
Is it true?

72
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,480
Your Majesty,

73
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,930
Prince Qin is slandering me.

74
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:22,220
He…

75
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,350
He has no proof.

76
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,260
Slander?

77
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,890
I went to everywhere

78
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,720
of the border areas.

79
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,640
Each one of the refugees

80
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,290
from the thirteen counties

81
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,550
is a witness.

82
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,090
You firmly believed I’d lose the bell

83
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,420
and be killed in battle.

84
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,140
You couldn’t believe I’d won a victory,

85
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,430
so you took an preemptive action

86
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,970
and complained first.

87
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,660
Did I say anything wrong?

88
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,400
Your Majesty,

89
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,710
I was put in the wrong.

90
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,600
Wronged?

91
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,640
Do you think I

92
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,470
will believe you or my brother?

93
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,300
If you confess now,

94
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,090
I will only punish you.

95
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,140
Otherwise, when the evidence is certain,

96
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,300
your whole clan will be implicated.

97
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,260
An Zhonggu,

98
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,090
His Majesty is clear about reward and punishment.

99
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,720
You’ve made a blunder.

100
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,890
Admit your guilt quickly.

101
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,550
Unless you want to implicate your family.

102
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,850
Your Majesty.

103
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,800
I admit my guilt.

104
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,930
It’s all my fault.

105
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,550
Take him out!

106
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,720
-Behead him!
-Your Highness!

107
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,580
Please help me!

108
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,010
My Lord, please help me!

109
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,100
Please!

110
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,090
Your Majesty!

111
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,640
Your Majesty! I was wronged!

112
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,300
Your Majesty!

113
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,760
Your Highness! Please!

114
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,180
My Lord, please!

115
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:43,640
Feiye.

116
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,260
I’m sorry to delay the dinner

117
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,020
to welcome you home.

118
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,090
Your Majesty, you did that for the state.

119
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,390
I’m alright.

120
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,220
Your Highness! I’m Han Yunxi.

121
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,050
Rise.

122
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,760
Thank you!

123
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:08,970
Well.

124
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:10,970
Come here.

125
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,140
Remove the veil.

126
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,890
Your eyes

127
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,090
are exactly similar

128
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,600
to those of your mother, Lady Tianxin.

129
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,260
Your Highness, did you really meet my mother?

130
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,720
You ask me?

131
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,800
Your mother once saved my life.

132
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,930
It’s really like that.

133
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,220
I’m originally nobody.

134
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,850
How is it possible for me to be granted a marriage?

135
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,550
Let alone it’s Prince Qin.

136
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,800
You are kind of smart.

137
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,760
It appears

138
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,970
I made a right choice.

139
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,890
What did she mean?

140
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,300
Sure enough, no fruit will be reaped

141
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,220
without hard work.

142
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,010
Yunxi,

143
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,760
do you remember your mother, Lady Tianxin?

144
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,220
Sure.

145
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,760
But

146
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,800
others say that your mother has been dead.

147
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,300
Do you believe it?

148
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,100
Of course not.

149
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,010
Then

150
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,680
do you want to find your mother?

151
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,050
Yeah. I’d like to

152
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,140
and live with her.

153
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,610
What if you have to do something for me

154
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,730
before I help you find your mother?

155
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,140
Your Highness, please tell me

156
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,600
where my mother is.

157
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,350
It’s easy for me to tell you.

158
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,010
But

159
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,890
you have to do one thing for me.

160
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,680
The marriage is really granted

161
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,880
without good intent.

162
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,550
Mother disappeared

163
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,380
after going out of the Palace.

164
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,260
Since Dowager said mother saved her,

165
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,050
mother’s missing

166
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,150
must have something to do with her.

167
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,300
I will not only tell you her whereabouts,

168
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,850
but also agree to let you reunite.

169
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,410
Your Highness,

170
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,850
a mere verbal statement is no guarantee,

171
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,180
so how could I trust you?

172
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,050
How dare you!

173
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,850
As vulgar people,

174
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,760
you can’t query Dowager.

175
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,510
If Her Highness can’t do it,

176

Would you mind

It’s about the marriage of course.

that Princess of Xiqiu will marry to Tianning.

You’d better ask Her Highness about it.

In the court,

to contend with His Majesty.

Now, I can be sure

353

Prince Qin also wants Poison Master
and to be the emperor.

but doesn’t dare to announce it.

In this case,

357

I’m not afraid His Majesty will know it.

358

His Majesty fears he might be ambitious.

359
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,180
If we can kill Long Feiye,

360
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,220
we don’t need to worry

361

363

So?

You don’t dare?

366
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,470
Uncle,

367
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,170
it’s not I don’t dare.

368
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,600
But Prince Qin is too powerful.

369
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,600
If we fail,

370
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:01,010
it’ll be more difficult for me

During the wedding,

his mansion will be crowded,

378
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,720
and it's hard to guard.

379
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,890
It makes sense.

380
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,390
We can kill him

00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:37,290
You’re going to crush me.

527
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,050
Don’t move.

528
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,220
You are poisoned.

529
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,820
Your heart is beating slowly

530
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,350
and breath is heavy.

531
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:53,010
You must have got more than one kind.

532
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,220
The most serious one is snake venom.

533
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:58,220
According to the damage of your clothes,

534
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,550
it stared from four inches from your heart

535
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,280
above your stomach an hour ago.

536
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,350
And…

537
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,550
You can’t die now!

538
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,220
It’s the first day of my marriage!

539
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,800
Wake up! Wake up!

540
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,930
He passed out

541
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,470
Poison him to die?

542
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,470
No, no.

543
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,720
If I killed someone right after I married in here,

544
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,920
Consort Yi will definitely kick me out.

545
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,010
For my mother,

546
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,850
I have to stay here,

547
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:47,180
take Prince Qin down

548
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:49,550
and find the tattoo

549
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,980
Empress Dowager said.

550
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,010
Don’t move.

551
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,300
If you move, the venom will travel through

552
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,430
the blood to the heart.

553
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,510
Then you will be in more dangers.

554
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,510
You have to listen to the physician!

555
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,240
What are you doing?

556
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,010
Take off your clothes of course.

557
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:37,510
Or how can I detoxify you?

558
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,760
I can do it myself.

559
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,550
Why bother to be shy?

560
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,600
I’m a physician.

561
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,550
There is no gender difference in

562
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,680
medical treatment.

563
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,220
What’s more,

564
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:52,920
you’re a male, I’m a female.

565
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,430
I’m the one who loses.

566
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,430
God bless!

567
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,290
Please don’t recognize me.

568
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:41,050
Or I’ll be in trouble.

569
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:47,300
Why

570
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:49,140
did you come here?

571
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:52,970
What do you think?

572
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:58,390
You want to assassinate Prince Qin?

573
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:01,140
Now he’s not here.

574
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,600
You should leave after I cure you.

575
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,730
I won’t tell anyone.

576
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:26,140
Who are you?

577
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,220
I’m here to find

578
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:30,610
the Mythical Herb for the scar on my face.

579
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,840
There is heavy security during the day.

580
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:38,010
Have we met before?

581
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,110
No.

582
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,590
You must be wrong.

583
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:44,440
I felt

584
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,440
you and one of my father’s apprentice

585
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,100
are alike.

586
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,440
I’m curious why he is here.

587
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,550
I’ve sealed

588
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,340
your Tianyang and Qingyin points

589
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,670
to control the poison.

590
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,460
Take it.

591
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,130
One piece per day.

592
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:24,710
You’ll be fine within ten days.

593
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:25,770
I will take you out.

594
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:29,670
Come on.

595
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:35,380
It’s my wedding day.

596
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:38,050
Where are you taking me to?
