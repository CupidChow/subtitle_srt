Episode 26

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:09,500
Brother.

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:10,580
How's it going?

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:12,780
What are you doing here?

6
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:15,130
You’ve been suffered.

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,000
As your younger brother, if I do nothing,

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,790
wouldn't it be unkind of me?

9
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,410
You don't have to be such a hypocrite about it,

10
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,040
alright?

11
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,190
Father grounded me here,

12
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,750
aren't you the happiest?

13
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,970
Brother, why do you say that?

14
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,250
I didn't know

15
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,369
you were grounded

16
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,950
until the last few days.

17
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,410
And I beseeched father

18
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,330
to lift your ban

19
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,540
as soon as possible.

20
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,500
Would you be so kind?

21
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:49,120
What are you doing?

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:49,750
Brother.

23
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:51,790
I have sin.

24
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,000
I should be at your side in time

25
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,790
to help you out.

26
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,160
You’re the future king,

27
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,150
You're the Crown Prince.

28
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:06,250
I should

29
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:06,910
take the blame

30
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,250
for you.

31
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,750
Brother, you…

32
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:13,700
Brother.

33
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,700
You suffered.

34
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,380
All right, brother.

35
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,410
I've been wrong about you.

36
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:25,680
Don't worry.

37
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:26,990
When I get out of here,

38
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,450
we'll have a nice drink.

39
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,410
Really?

40
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:33,550
Of course.

41
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,450
Have a nice drink?

42
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,500
Lovely brotherhood.

43
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,289
I'm touched by me, too.

44
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,910
Long Tianmo, Long Tianmo.

45
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,950
I just don't get it.

46
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,560
Who are you to be the Crown Prince?

47
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:04,950
Right.

48
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,080
You had a

49
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,370
good, dead mother.

50
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,540
Other than that,

51
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,450
what else you got?

52
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,990
You don’t have the brain.

53
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,730
You don’t have the ability.

54
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,200
Who are you to compete with me?

55
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:24,290
Don't you feel guilty

56
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,040
being the Crown Prince?

57
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,360
Long Tianqing.

58
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,200
You played me.

59
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,870
I could have you

60
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,750
killed anytime, anywhere.

61
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,660
Then I'll be waiting for you

62
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,750
to take my head.

63
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,360
Your Highness.

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,700
Your Highness.

65
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,560
What happened?

66
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,500
Damn Long Tianqing!

67
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,290
From this day forward,

68
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,990
he and I are at loggerheads!

69
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,590
Your Highness, take it easy.

70
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,630
Let’s not care about these people.

71
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,880
We have bigger picture to think about.

72
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,950
How is it going with father?

73
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:26,579
His Majesty

74
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:28,120
is still investigating Gu-infected man.

75
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,370
Now, according to folklore,

76
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,300
Prince Qin is the Gu-infected man.

77
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:32,910
The Minster of Revenue and Minster of Personnel

78
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,120
are secretly tracking down

79
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,920
the one developed poisonous Gu.

80
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,870
That would be me.

81
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,110
Your Highness.

82
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,500
I came up with a plan.

83
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,829
We can pin

84
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,570
the crime of your poisonous Gu

85
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,870
on the Second Prince.

86
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,190
Tell me, what is the plan?

87
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,410
They say

88
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,660
the enemy of your enemy

89
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,750
is your friend.

90
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,000
We can

91
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,700
give the evidence we collected

92
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,540
about the Second Prince

93
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,140
developing poisonous Gu and

94
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,579
the evidence we want to frame him

95
00:03:57,579 --> 00:03:59,410
to the Minster of Personnel.

96
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:01,910
In this way…

97
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,500
Did Gu Qishao

98
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,180
give us any advice?

99
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,200
He just told us to wait.

100
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,450
Wait?

101
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,370
Again with the waiting.

102
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,290
How long do we have to wait?

103
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,420
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

104
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,060
Your Highness.

105
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,000
The Crown Prince did

106
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,910
hand over all the evidence against

107
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:29,970
the Second Prince.

108
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,980
[The Crown Prince gave the evidence of Second Prince
developing poisonous Gu and the evidence he wanted
to frame him to the Minster of Personnel]

109
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,159
How is the wine

110
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,790
of Yaogui Valley?

111
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,150
Your Highness.

112
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,540
Tonight,

113
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,530
are we going to Yaogui Valley?

114
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,710
Last time someone said

115
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,260
I should punish her

116
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,480
if she upset me.

117
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,870
Today is your birthday.

118
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,250
How are you going to do the punishment?

119
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,130
What's going on?

120
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,159
Bad mood?

121
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,790
Or are you thinking about whether Long Feiye

122
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,390
will come to see you tonight?

123
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:45,870
No.

124
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,409
It's written all over your face.

125
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:49,409
Still denying it.

126
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,909
Really?

127
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,250
Is it that obvious?

128
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,780
Thick grow the rush leaves;

129
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,810
Their white dew turns to frost.

130
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:00,080
She whom I love;

131
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,970
Must be somewhere along this stream.

132
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,870
You like me?

133
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,080
I like you a lot.

134
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,080
Can’t I?

135
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,660
Of course you can’t.

136
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,200
I'm a married woman.

137
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,430
Gu Qishao.

138
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,410
Don’t be like that.

139
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,120
I don’t want to

140
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,870
destroy our friendship.

141
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,870
I'm just kidding.

142
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,370
I don’t have to

143
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,980
steal someone else's wife.

144
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:36,750
You scared me.

145
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,159
Making a joke like that.

146
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,110
Because you’re easy to be fooled.

147
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,250
I have everything

148
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,540
I promised you.

149
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,750
That's the medicine!

150
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,680
How did you do it?

151
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,990
I found that one of the medicines in the

152
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,750
prescription was used in such small quantities

153
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,160
that it was difficult to weigh it accurately,

154
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,660
so,

155
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,330
in that case,

156
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,500
I had to do it with my bare hands.

157
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,500
Teach me, please.

158
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:06,990
Well.

159
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,820
You can't learn it overnight.

160
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:10,990
Master.

161
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,040
Please teach me.

162
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,730
Why are you being so polite?

163
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,510
I’m warning you.

164
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,480
Don’t you ever touch her again!

165
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,200
Let go of me!

166
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,200
Do you know you’re wrong?

167
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,500
What's wrong with me?

168
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,490
You are the one to blame.

169
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,040
Gu Qishao was helping me

170
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,100
studying the cure.

171
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,830
You broke into his place

172
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:45,159
and he didn’t blame you.

173
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,420
Yet you did this to him.

174
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:47,250
You’re still

175
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,659
think about that Gu Qishao.

176
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:49,990
He is my friend.

177
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,909
Friend?

178
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,890
The drinker's heart is not in the cup.

179
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,710
You stay away from him.

180
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,700
Not in the cup?

181
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,660
He’s been drinking all along.

182
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,660
Do you have to 	twist my words?

183
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,910
Can you please not be jealous?

184
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,830
Am I jealous?

185
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,650
You still won't admit it?

186
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,200
You still won't admit it?

187
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,080
Your Majesty.

188
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,540
Lately,

189
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,120
the story of Prince Qin being the Gu-infected man

190
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,250
is widely spread among the people.

191
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,410
The people are terrified.

192
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,370
There are also rumors that

193
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,970
there are people in Tianning

194
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,040
who are secretly planning to

195
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,890
manufacture Gu-infected men.

196
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,080
Minister of Revenue, Minister of Personnel

197
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,290
and I are suspecting

198
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,870
that this is related to Prince Qin.

199
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,500
I've sent someone to investigate.

200
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,120
I have made a census of the whole state.

201
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,330
It's true that

202
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,810
thousands of people go missing every year.

203
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,990
I investigated officials

204
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,250
of several places

205
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,870
with large missing persons.

206
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,800
The results of the report show that

207
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,750
missing persons are indeed

208
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,470
strongly connected to them.

209
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,080
In the face of overwhelming evidence,

210
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,990
they admitted their guilt.

211
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,540
I have brought them

212
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,790
to the capital

213
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,000
to await Your Majesty's judgment.

214
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,660
Bring them.

215
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,540
-Your Majesty, I am innocent.
-Your Majesty, I am innocent.

216
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,400
Are you working

217
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,620
for Prince Qin?

218
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,340
Your Majesty,

219
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,250
Prince Qin didn't do this.

220
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,620
Their testimony is all here.

221
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,910
How dare you!

222
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,330
As officials,

223
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,190
you dared to take men’s life

224
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,830
and spread rumors about Gu-infected men.

225
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,250
You troubled people’s mind.

226
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,290
Unforgivable!

227
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:56,630
Drag them down

228
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,200
and behead them!

229
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,000
Your Majesty.

230
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,580
-Injustice, Your Majesty!
-Injustice, Your Majesty!

231
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,540
-Injustice!
-Injustice!

232
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,330
Take them!

233
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,330
We were just following Your Majesty's orders

234
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,790
to find out the true identity of Prince Qin.

235
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:17,200
We didn’t expect it turned out like this.

236
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,200
I trust the two of you have reached

237
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,410
a decision on this matter.

238
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,080
These officials must have spread rumors

239
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,790
and caused trouble

240
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,810
in the case of Gu-infected men.

241
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,990
Our Tianning is a great state.

242
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,040
Under the wise rule of Your Majesty,

243
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,660
who would dare to develop

244
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,120
Gu-infected men.

245
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,090
Your Majesty.

246
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,330
The Gu-infected man

247
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,450
is only a folk tale

248
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,010
and not to be believed.

249
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,990
General Mu has the vision.

250
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,370
The whole made-up story is

251
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,700
freaking people out.

252
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,290
I'll tell the world

253
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,560
that Gu-infected man doesn't exist.

254
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,330
It’s nothing but a rumor.

255
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,620
I’ve already

256
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,950
beheaded the rumor mongers.

257
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:03,910
From this day forward,

258
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,640
anyone who brings this up again

259
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,360
will be punished severely!

260
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,700
Your Majesty is wise!

261
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,000
I'll withdraw

262
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,550
the troops that are watching Prince Qin.

263
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,870
Dismiss.

264
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,410
Yes.

265
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,580
Dismiss!

266
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,660
Your Majesty.

267
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,860
Your Royal Highness.

268
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,040
Guards found these

269
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,910
in the palace

270
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,250
of Noble Consort Xiao.

271
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,370
Go.

272
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,870
Get Physician Gu

273
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:48,790
here.

274
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,410
Yes.

275
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,370
Hold it.

276
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,200
Your Highness.

277
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,950
Leave us.

278
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,750
Yes.

279
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,980
Your Highness.

280
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,750
The Second Prince's influence in prefectures

281
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,550
has been basically eliminated.

282
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,570
How is Long Tianqing?

283
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,080
Did he get punished?

284
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,750
His Majesty is protecting him.

285
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,160
Don't let it bother you.

286
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,200
At least,

287
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,950
Minister of Revenue and Minster of Personnel

288
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,280
know what Second Prince

289
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,370
has done.

290
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:00,790
After I get out,

291
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,910
I’ll try to

292
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,000
win them over.

293
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,750
Yes.

294
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,940
[Hongfu Restaurant]

295
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,400
Your Highness!

296
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,500
Stop drinking!

297
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:23,690
Your Highness!

298
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,790
You win and you lose.

299
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,910
Pull yourself together!

300
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,370
How can you be so decadent?

301
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,500
Pull together?

302
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,250
All of my men

303
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,410
have been killed.

304
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,830
All of them!

305
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,910
All those years of work

306
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,200
go down the drain.

307
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,330
How am I supposed to pull myself together?

308
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,910
As far as I'm concerned,

309
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,620
at least His Majesty's

310
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,620
keeping you safe.

311
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,950
The Crown Prince is nearly forfeited the right.

312
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,910
In His Majesty's mind, now you are

313
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,370
the crown prince.

314
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,750
Do you understand?

315
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,450
Now,

316
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,330
we need to track down the men of Yaogui Valley

317
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,490
and bring Poison Master back.

318
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,010
You make your name,

319
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,660
and the position of crown prince

320
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,990
will be yours.

321
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,750
This time,

322
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,790
I must not fail.

323
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,000
Come, come, come.

324
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,500
I made you your favorite.

325
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,660
Have a seat.

326
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:55,830
Qishao.

327
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,180
His Highness is wrong in this matter.

328
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,210
I apologize on his behalf.

329
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,610
It’s his fault,

330
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,530
why are you apologizing to me?

331
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,000
He's my husband.

332
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,620
I should do it for him.

333
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,660
Besides,

334
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,500
this happened because of me.

335
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:14,410
Fine.

336
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,700
In that case,

337
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,790
you and I need to

338
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,990
stop seeing each other

339
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,990
so Prince Qin doesn’t come after me.

340
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:20,990
Go back.

341
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,330
Don’t be mad.

342
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,250
You should go.

343
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,950
All right, all right.

344
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,870
I’ll leave.

345
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,370
Thank you

346
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,830
for taking such good care of me.

347
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:45,700
When you’re not mad,

348
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,430
I'll come back and check on you.

349
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,339
Where is His Highness?

350
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,869
His Majesty passed his words to the world

351
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:14,619
and clarified the rumors

352
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:15,450
against my brother.

353
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,540
So he came to the palace to say thank you.

354
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,369
So you're here

355
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,410
to take me back?

356
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,500
Even though Her Highness is still mad at you,

357
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,500
now is a good opportunity

358
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,079
for you.

359
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,829
Mingxiang is seriously poisoned.

360
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:29,290
As long as you can cure her,

361
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,990
Her Highness might be happy

362
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:31,750
and

363
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,160
keep you in the mansion.

364
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,750
Let's go.

365
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,700
Qishao.

366
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,120
We got

367
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,250
words from Beili.

368
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,500
You always

369
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,790
exaggerate things.

370
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,660
That’s not true.

371
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,660
You can ask Bai Su.

372
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,250
You don't have to worry.

373
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,160
We'll have a lead on Poison Master soon.

374
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,910
Really?

375
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,910
How do you know?

376
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,370
Qishao.

377
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,490
You've been

378
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,030
staying up late these days.

379
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,450
Now Ms. Han is gone.

380
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,250
Why don't you get some rest?

381
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,350
I'm going to sleep.

382
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,450
Qishao!

383
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,910
Don't you think Qishao

384
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,080
is different today?

385
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,580
I don't think so.

386
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,910
Didn’t he smile?

387
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,080
He was smiling,

388
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,700
but his eyes were cold.

389
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,270
Aren't you overthinking this?

390
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,450
Your Royal Highness.

391
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,290
Stand up.

392
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,170
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

393
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,410
Physician Gu.

394
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,750
I summoned you here

395
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,870
is for you to see something.

396
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,950
Physician Gu.

397
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,080
Do you know what are these?

398
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,240
Your Royal Highness.

399
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,040
If I’m right,

400
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,620
these powders

401
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,840
are from the southwest Meilin area

402
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,680
and they are extremely rare.

403
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,790
These

404
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,330
are rare

405
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,450
tonics.

406
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,000
It's just…

407
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,080
It's just what?

408
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,200
It's just these powders’ nature

409
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,250
is cold.

410
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,700
People cannot eat too much,

411
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,500
otherwise they’ll be addicted.

412
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,080
Especially for women,

413
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,440
they can affect fertility.

414
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,250
And they are complicated.

415
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,330
Mixing them with others

416
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,620
may produce toxins

417
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,500
and poison the body,

418
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,700
harm it,

419
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,950
and eventually kill the body.

420
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,330
I have been sent by His Majesty

421
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,580
to the southwest for

422
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,750
disaster relief and treatment.

423
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,790
I came across this kind of medicine.

424
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,080
Because of its special nature,

425
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,910
the local people

426
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,310
do not dare to use easily.

427
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,990
Therefore, one should be very clear about it

428
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,330
before using it.

429
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:30,450
All right.

430
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,370
You may leave.

431
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,370
Excuse me.

432
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,240
Your Royal Highness, what’s your plan?

433
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:53,460
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

434
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,660
What are you doing here?

435
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,040
I'm here to see you.

436
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,290
I'm fine.

437
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:08,830
Alright.

438
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,540
When you're dead,

439
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,910
no one will fight with me for His Highness.

440
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,820
If you don't get treatment,

441
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,990
I have to write a suicide note

442
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,870
for you.

443
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,000
No, I can't die!

444
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,040
You need to calm down.

445
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,500
I'm not trying to cure you.

446
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,040
Just trying to ease your pain.

447
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,120
To keep you alive for a while.

448
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,450
I won’t accept the cure!

449
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,450
This poison

450
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,980
is not that easy to be cured.

451
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:34,590
I’m afraid

452
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,580
you’d be dead

453
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,660
before you could make Beauty Blood.

454
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,700
See?

455
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:53,950
In that case,

456
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:55,700
I'll trust you once.

457
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,180
But you must always remember

458
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,620
that only Beauty Blood

459
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,290
can cure

460
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:01,630
Feiye’s poisonous Gu.

461
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,040
Relax.

462
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,310
I want to save him as much as you do.

463
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,360
How'd it go?

464
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,870
Not very well.

465
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,660
I've already given her acupuncture.

466
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,870
But detoxifying her

467
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,160
without killing her

468
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,660
is not an easy task.

469
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,130
I’m going to make some medicine.

470
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:41,830
Go ahead.

471
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,540
Feiye.

472
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,200
Stop thinking about it.

473
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,220
Now it’s not the time to be jealous.

474
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:10,830
She did so much

475
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:11,870
for Long Feiye.

476
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,250
She deserves to be treated well.

477
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,870
If Long Feiye doesn’t treat her well,

478
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,470
you should be disappointed.

479
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:48,660
Mother.

480
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:01,290
It’s you.

481
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,380
What are you doing here

482
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:04,870
in the middle of the night?

483
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,660
I am making medicine for Mingxiang.

484
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,250
After cooking over the night,

485
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,180
she can drink it tomorrow morning.

486
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,410
Tell me.

487
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,750
What kind of disease

488
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,040
does Mingxiang have?

489
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,200
There are just some toxins in the body.

490
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,460
It's nothing serious.

491
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,700
You have to fix her.

492
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,450
Or you'll never come back.

493
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:28,250
So,

494
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:29,660
you’re saying I can

495
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,620
come back?

496
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,080
That's not what I said.

497
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,750
It’s Feiye and Ningjing who said

498
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,540
only you

499
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,790
can cure Mingxiang.

500
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:40,890
So I let you stay here for now.

501
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,580
Are you hungry, mother?

502
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,500
But eating so late

503
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,880
is not good for health.

504
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,450
This kind of tonic can make you feel full

505
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:00,870
without putting a strain on the internal organs.

506
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:01,790
Try it.

507
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:04,660
No.

508
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,410
Try it.

509
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,450
Just don't poison me.

510
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,450
Cute.

511
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,650
Seeing as how you've been so nice today,

512
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,040
I will forgive you

513
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,320
for what you've done.

514
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,160
What did you say?

515
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,330
I…

516
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,160
I said make the medicine right.

517
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,560
Make the medicine right.

518
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,330
I won’t drink the medicine

519
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:02,730
and I won’t get detoxify.

520
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,800
You need to stop wasting your time.

521
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,450
If you don't take the medicine,

522
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,910
Long Feiye will feel guilty.

523
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,110
Is that what you want?

524
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,280
What are you talking about?

525
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,000
How can I

526
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,540
make brother Feiye feel bad?

527
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,200
Everything I did,

528
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,160
I did to save him.

529
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,950
All the more reason for you to take medicine.

530
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,910
You can't have Beauty Blood

531
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,120
until you get well.

532
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,910
So Long Feiye can recover.

533
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:26,870
I don't know what

534
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,000
Long Feiye told you.

535
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,910
But I know

536

he only wishes you good.

You don't have to drink it.

538

But if you die,

539
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,620
I'll be the one

540
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,760
with His Highness.

541
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,620

[Palace of Benevolence and Longevity]

543
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,750
I thought

544
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,090
she was just being domineering.

545
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,000
I never expected

546
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,130
she could commit such a heinous crime!

547
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,700
None of the registered concubines

554
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,910
I heard that

555
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:18,670
you are going to bestow on Concubine Qing

556

the title of Noble Consort.

557
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:21,580
Exactly.

558
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,260
I let the Ministry of Rituals

prepare for the ceremony.

After all, Concubine Qing

is the princess of Xiqiu.

566

00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,240
and never got healed.

700
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,290
Eventually she died.

701
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:44,000
His Majesty has been in this for years.

702
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,660
No new empress is bestowed since,

703
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:49,170
which shows His Majesty’s love.

704
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,290
What you've done this time

705
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,700
may have touched

706
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:54,870
His Majesty’s memory.

707
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:57,950
He might be

708
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,640
feeling something similar.

709
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,300
[Qinghui Hall]

710
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,950
Your Highness.

711
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,870
Stand up.

712
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,630
Noble Consort Xiao.

713
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,130
I’ve been treating you well for years.

714
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,580
And you’ve been killing my children.

715
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,500
In these years,

716
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,000
how many consorts and concubines

717
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,060
died in your hands?

718
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:29,990
Your Majesty.

719
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:31,290
There must be some mistake.

720
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,000
Mistake?

721
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,700
Li Quan.

722
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,380
Your Majesty.

723
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,330
Your Majesty. I’m innocent!

724
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:46,200
Innocent?

725
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:47,870
Don't think I don't know

726
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:48,950
your little mind.

727
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,000
Over the years,

728
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:51,660
I have loved you dearly.

729
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,910
I didn't know you had such a heart!

730
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,160
If I didn’t send people to investigate

731
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,830
after Concubine Qing was poisoned,

732
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:58,580
I wouldn’t know

733
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,700
you’ve done so many things!

734
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,500
Your Majesty!

735
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,920
I don't know any of them

736
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:03,580
in this booklet.

737
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,410
Why would Your Majesty say such a thing?

738
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,610
How dare you lie to me!

739
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,730
These people

740
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,790
were the servants of the concubines in trouble.

741
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:10,540
Most of them

742
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,920
died of sudden illness

743
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,450
after their concubines' deaths.

744
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,290
And all of these people

745
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:15,660
had some kind of contact

746
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,080
with you before they died.

747
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,660
Walls have ears.

748
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,370
My men

749
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,200
have found something.

750
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,950
It details everything

751
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,450
you've done over the years.

752
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,250
Your Majesty!

753
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:27,830
This must be

754
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,620
a setup.

755
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,250
I didn't do any of this.

756
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,330
Your Majesty, you must see it.

757
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,790
You didn’t do any of this?

758
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,370
What about the powders

759
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:38,620
Li Quan found

760
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:39,910
in your palace?

761
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,580
If you're not guilty,

762
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,300
why did you bury the powders?

763
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,450
Why do you keep sending cakes

764
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,000
to the concubines?

765
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,660
And none of the concubines

766
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,500
are pregnant.

767
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,520
Or if they were,

768
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,440
they were dead.

769
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:53,790
Cakes?

770
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,250
Her Highness only likes to eat cakes

771
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,790
sent by Noble Consort Xiao.

772
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:58,620
What?

773
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:19,790
Physician Gu.

774
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,500
How is Concubine Qing?

775
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:24,710
Your Majesty.

776
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,900
The medicine in the cakes

777
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,290
is the same as the one

778
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:29,620
Her Royal Highness found

779
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,330
in her hall.

780
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,410
Can Concubine Qing's body

781
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,680
still recuperate?

782
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,050
According to the pulse condition,

783
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,990
fortunately she didn’t take much,

784
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:39,790
her body can slowly recuperate.

785
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,120
Guards!

786
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:49,910
Yes!

787
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,610
Take her to the Cold Palace!

788
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,080
Yes!

789
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:52,960
Your Majesty!

790
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:54,620
Your Majesty!

791
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,450
I’m innocent!

792
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,500
Your Majesty!

793
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,040
I’m innocent!

794
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:59,290
Your Majesty!

795
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:23,010
I've tried

796
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,000
everything,

797
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,520
and he's still like this.

798
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,700
If you can't cure him,

799
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:28,950
then kill him!

800
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,870
Really?

801
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:33,830
Guards!

802
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:34,790
No, no, no.

803
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,410
I got it. I got it.

804
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,950
I’ve been treating him for so long.

805
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:40,120
There are feelings.

806
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,300
I don’t want to see him beheaded.

807
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,080
When he poisoned me,

808
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,410
he wasn't as kind

809
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:49,210
as you are now.

810
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:52,160
He's an old man, after all.

811
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:04,370
Here's some candy.

812
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:05,080
Candy.

813
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:09,410
Good, good.
