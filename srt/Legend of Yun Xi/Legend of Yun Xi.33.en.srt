1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,020
Episode 33

3
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,060
I found Concubine Qing colluded with Beili

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,700
to harm Prince Qin.

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:09,360
Also,

6
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,340
I’ve got the evidence for it.

7
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,240
Once Long Tianmo dies

8
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,090
and father puts me in a high position,

9
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,190
you will be able to

10
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,620
settle the score with Concubine Qing.

11
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,120
How did you get the information?

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,500
Your Highness.

13
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,630
Are you gonna silence me?

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,750
As a matter of fact,

15
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,300
I should thank you.

16
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,890
Crown Prince is dying.

17
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,250
State Tianning

18
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,250
will be mine.

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,750
However,

20
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,360
I don’t want anyone

21
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,750
get the goods on me.

22
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,090
Only the dead won't talk.

23
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,420
Looks like

24
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,000
I need another secret

25
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,340
for the trade.

26
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,300
What is it?

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,709
I’m intrigued.

28
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:06,380
In my clothes.

29
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,710
Take it out and have a look.

30
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:29,820
[Beili has allied with Xiqiu.
We won’t fear Tianning once Prince Qin is wiped out.]

31
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,210
Great! Chu Qingge,

32
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,420
you really surprised me!

33
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,570
Your Highness.

34
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,800
If you kill me today,

35
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,800
Beili and Xiqiu

36
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,170
won’t let you off.

37
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,920
You won’t be in peace even if you

38
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,550
take the throne someday.

39
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,840
I trade such a huge secret

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,800
with you

41
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,460
for my life.

42
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:56,090
I don’t think

43
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,880
you’ll kill me.

44
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,000
You’re smart.

45
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,000
Alright.

46
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,340
I just hope you won’t

47
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,960
outsmart yourself.

48
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:09,800
Guards.

49
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,460
Keep guarding here.

50
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,260
Kill those who access here

51
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,710
without my permission.

52
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,460
Yes.

53
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,130
But

54
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,250
Concubine Qing is currently being favored.

55
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,300
It’s huge.

56
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,880
If anything goes wrong,

57
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,170
I’m afraid she will

58
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,130
bite back

59
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,590
and frame us.

60
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,190
Tianqing.

61
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,800
Don’t do this rashly.

62
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,300
That said,

63
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,170
with this evidence,

64
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,750
we can wipe out Chu Qingge

65
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,880
by using Prince Qin’s hands.

66
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,090
I can’t agree more.

67
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,090
Luckily, we didn’t get Prince Qin killed

68
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,670
in Mount Tianquan.

69
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,290
So,

70
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,090
by then, we can

71
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,290
kill two birds

72
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,300
with one stone.

73
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,140
Your Majesty.

74
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,840
His Highness has taken the medicine.

75
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,750
He’ll be fine

76
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,480
after resting for a few days.

77
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,460
Brother.

78
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,210
There is another thing baffling me.

79
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,420
Say it.

80
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,660
When I went to catch Poison Beast,

81
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,290
I was chased by some men.

82
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,350
Who were they?

83
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,500
How bold they are!

84
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,230
I dare not jump to a conclusion.

85
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,460
It’s just that

86
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,590
even the guards you sent

87
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,550
to protect me

88
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,670
would have been killed

89
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,870
if I hadn’t saved them

90
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,710
in time.

91
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,250
I think

92
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,290
they meant to

93
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,290
stall for time

94
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,750
so as to

95
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,089
get Crown Prince killed.

96
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,090
You mean

97
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,060
someone wants Crown Prince to die?

98
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,500
Exactly.

99
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,130
Ridiculous!

100
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,400
Look into it.

101
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,730
Whoever they were,

102
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,380
I will not spare them.

103
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,659
My respects, Your Majesty.

104
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,460
You have the nerve to see me?

105
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,170
Pardon us, Your Majesty.

106
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,130
We were coerced and persecuted

107
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,130
by Second Prince,

108
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,420
so the mission failed.

109
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,820
Pardon us, Your Majesty.

110
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,050
How did Prince Qin

111
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,750
bypass all of you

112
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,080
and reach Heaven Pit?

113
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,000
You weren’t targeted

114
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,380
by Second Prince, were you?

115
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,250
Your Majesty.

116
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,230
Prince Qin didn’t go to Heaven Pit.

117
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,290
Nonsense.

118
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,750
This morning,

119
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,880
he took Poison Beast’s blood

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,920
to the palace.

121
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,070
Hadn’t he reached Heaven Pit,

122
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,000
how could he get the blood?

123
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:16,630
That night,

124
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,240
Prince Qin, Princess and us

125
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,150
were all trapped

126
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,010
in Tianquan Inn by Second Prince.

127
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,400
He didn’t withdraw the guards

128
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,860
until yesterday morning.

129
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,990
How come?

130
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,280
What a trick!

131
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,450
You fools were

132
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,820
all tricked by him!

133
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:45,990
Listen up.

134
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,190
I will kill Long Feiye

135
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,740
at any cost.

136
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,720
Your Highness. Bad news.

137
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,610
Prince...Crown Prince is saved by Prince Qin!

138
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,990
What? Impossible!

139
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,030
It’s true.

140
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,490
Your Highness.

141
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,700
What should we do now?

142
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,200
Look what you’ve done.

143
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,780
You disappointed me so much.

144
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,860
You used to be reliable,

145
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,720
intelligent

146
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,150
and flexible.

147
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,190
I had high hopes on you.

148
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:29,950
I can’t believe

149
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,700
you are so vicious.

150
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,150
Do you really want

151
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,110
your brother to die?

152
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,610
Father!

153
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:37,610
Father!

154
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,280
I’m wronged.

155
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,150
I just meant to

156
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,130
get Poison Beast

157
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,110
and assassinate Prince Qin for you!

158
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,640
I meant to help you, father!

159
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,040
You’re still arguing.

160
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,240
Your purpose

161
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,650
wasn’t to kill Long Feiye,

162
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,700
but to stop him from going to Heaven Pit.

163
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,740
Over these years,

164
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,780
you’ve been against Crown Prince.

165
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,070
I am not so muddleheaded

166
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,000
that I can’t tell right from wrong.

167
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,150
You see?

168
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,530
These reports

169
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,650
detail all your crimes.

170
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:03,610
Treason,

171
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,860
corruption, bribery,

172
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,650
covering up your men, violation of the law,

173
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,650
and murder.

174
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,190
Do you

175
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,950
still have me in your eyes?

176
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,590
You dared to try to kill Crown Prince.

177
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,410
You will be bold enough

178
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,490
to put a sword

179
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,650
at my throat someday, right?

180
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,070
Father, I dare not.

181
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,610
I don't have any

182
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,360
of these

183
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,450
treacherous thoughts.

184
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,070
-Father!
-Shut up!

185
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,190
You don’t dare to think,

186
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,450
but you dare to do them.

187
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,950
You bastard!

188
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,150
I indulged you

189
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,280
to be against Crown Prince

190
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,190
over these years

191
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,820
so as to train your mentality.

192
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,280
-I didn’t think you’d...
-Father!

193
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,280
-Guards!
-Father!

194
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,200
Take him down!

195
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:36,900
-Yes!
-Father!

196
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,650
-Father!
-Take him to his palace.

197
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:38,650
-Father!
-Without my order,

198
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,510
no one shall visit or contact him.

199
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,200
Father!

200
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,380
Father! I can explain! Father!

201
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,190
Father!

202
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,190
I’m wrong, father!

203
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,190
Father!

204
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:51,990
Your Majesty.

205
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,620
Take care of yourself.

206
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,070
I believe Second Prince

207
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,200
will think it through.

208
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,110
Then what?

209
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,400
He’s so vicious

210
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,200
and dares to harm his brother.

211
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,680
Take it easy, Your Majesty.

212
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,860
Forget it.

213
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,390
Your Highness.

214
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,110
Second Prince intercepted

215
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,240
Prince Qin halfway,

216
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,650
meaning to rob Poison Beast

217
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,670
and get Crown Prince killed.

218
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,820
Who told you this?

219
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,290
Everybody in the court

220
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,190
has known it.

221
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,530
His Majesty has imprisoned

222
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,860
Second Prince.

223
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:34,950
Madam.

224
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,610
Let me tell you something.

225
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,030
Your Highness.

226
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,240
Is the information reliable?

227
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,030
Yes.

228
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,820
Crown Prince told me

229
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,490
when you were out at noon.

230
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,450
Crown Prince told her

231
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,070
to come to me

232
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,200
if there was an emergency.

233
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,030
She was

234
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,950
an informer assigned by the Lord

235
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,490
to Noble Consort Xiao.

236
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:00,710
If it isn't

237
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,030
an emergency,

238
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,190
she will never

239
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,490
risk her life

240
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:06,650
to come to me.

241
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,360
I’m surprised

242
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,740
Noble Consort Xiao

243
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,400
has such an old story.

244
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,450
Back then

245
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,900
she was just a concubine.

246
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,450
I can’t believe

247
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,320
she’s so vicious.

248
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,900
His Majesty favors the former Empress.

249
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,740
If he knows this thing,

250
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,900
I’m afraid he’ll kill

251
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,070
Noble Consort Xiao.

252
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,280
It’s an old story.

253
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,470
I don’t want to interfere with it.

254
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,780
Also,

255
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,320
Tianhui just imprisoned Noble Consort Xiao

256
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,380
in the Cold Palace,

257
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,530
not depriving her title.

258
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:47,950
Maybe

259
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
he has concerns over Second Prince.

260
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,700
Since Crown Prince is saved,

261
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,290
I’d like to see

262
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,530
how he fights with Second Prince.

263
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,860
His two sons fight.

264
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,030
Not only the court will be affected,

265
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,650
but Tianhui will also be in a dilemma.

266
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,780
You’re wise, Your Highness.

267
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,490
Madam.

268
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,360
Go to prepare some nutrients.

269
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,070
I’m gonna visit Crown Princess in Sun Hall

270
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,280
with Princess Changbing.

271
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,490
Yes.

272
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,610
I’ll see to it.

273
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,190
Yunxi.

274
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,740
You had a busy day.

275
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,240
I think you haven’t eaten.

276
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,950
I made some dishes.

277
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,490
Come and eat.

278
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:53,860
I don’t know

279
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,190
what dishes you like.

280
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,650
So, I made the dishes

281
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,020
your mother favored.

282
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,990
You’d better spend

283
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,320
the time in developing

284
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,120
the antidote for Poison Puppet.

285
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,240
Yunxi.

286
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,780
Eat some.

287
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,950
Don't call me Yunxi.

288
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,740
If you fail to cure His Highness,

289
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,140
I will never forgive you.

290
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,320
It’s weird.

291
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,650
These poisons are of similar properties,

292
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,650
yet the properties do not accumulate.

293
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,320
On the contrary,

294
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,250
an unprecedented change happens.

295
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,030
It’s indeed weird.

296
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,490
When developing the antidote for Poison Gu,

297
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,200
I added a little Heartbroken Herb

298
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,130
and aconite from Western Regions.

299
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,280
Heartbroken Herb is extremely toxic,

300
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,490
while aconite from Western Regions

301
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,240
can ease pain.

302
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,840
By combining the two together,

303
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,900
I thought Poison Gu would work steadily

304
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,240
in the body.

305
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,610
Turned out when two poisons mixed,

306
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,490
neither of them worked well.

307
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,280
The toxicity of these two poisons

308
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,360
also changed

309
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,740
dramatically.

310
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,950
Antidotes didn’t react with poisons.

311
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,450
Were they against each other?

312
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,250
It isn’t that the antidotes were against poisons,

313
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,190
but the antidotes were

314
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,740
against each other.

315
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,150
It was discovered

316
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,900
during my decades of research.

317
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,400
Come.

318
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,030
Have a look.

319
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,570
This is the toxic juice of

320
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,950
Love Flower.

321
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,070
These two are

322
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,990
monkshood Shili and centipede from Tianshan.

323
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,820
Both are its antidotes.

324
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,000
Poison is dissolving.

325
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,180
The antidotes didn’t work,

326
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,980
and even made it more toxic.

327
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,360
Exactly.

328
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,780
In addition,

329
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,450
when antiaris toxicaria and poison nut

330
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,490
are mixed,

331
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,280
their antidotes, Shanyin Soul Sever Herb

332
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,030
and Wushan Black,

333
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,240
don’t work anymore.

334
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,150
Instead, it will become

335
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,810
a more toxic poison, Seven-step Deadly Powder.

336
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:22,530
There's a lot of subtlety to it.

337
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,650
The antidote isn’t

338
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,820
a simple composite

339
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,900
of all the antidotes

340
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,530
of Poison Gu’s ingredients.

341
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:30,950
I haven’t figured it out

342
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,570
for decades.

343
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,650
I won’t give up,

344
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,780
even trying hundreds

345
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,500
or thousands of times.

346
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,460
I understand your feelings.

347
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,480
You think all poisons have an antidote.

348
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,630
For this antidote,

349
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,480
I’ve researched for decades,

350
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,110
but to no avail.

351
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,400
Girl.

352
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,280
You may eat first

353
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,600
and then make the antidote.

354
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,610
Although Poison Gu is unique,

355
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,740
it’s still a poison.

356
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,570
All the poisons

357
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,860
have an antidote.

358
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,110
I must have a try.

359
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,900
Feiye got infected

360
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,190
when he was a kid.

361
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,740
He’s been suffering for so many years.

362
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,340
How can I have the mood to eat?

363
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,150
Every hour I delay

364
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,270
is another hour he suffers.

365
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,580
If it goes like this,

366
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,570
you’ll collapse

367
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,500
before the antidote is made.

368
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,650
He’s your husband

369
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,310
and I’m guilty to him,

370
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,400
yet your mother scarified herself

371
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,780
to protect him.

372
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,360
I owe him.

373
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:32,950
How come

374
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,530
my wife and daughter pay my debt?

375
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:36,990
Yunxi.

376
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:38,990
Is it worthy

377
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,990
to do this?

378
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,730
I’ve never thought if it is.

379
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,200
I just know

380
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,320
the man I love is poisoned.

381
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,360
I am a poison physician.

382
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,280
I must save him.

383
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,240
Where there is a will, there is a way.

384
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,610
The reaction of antidotes

385
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:52,700
is complicated,

386
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,700
but the laws are the same.

387
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,840
I believe I can figure it out.

388
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,610
Your Highness.

389
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,990
Sorry, I can’t do the salutation.

390
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,530
Skip it, Your Highness.

391
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,150
You just recovered.

392
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,570
You need more rest.

393
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,270
His Majesty is busy lately.

394
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,010
I’m afraid he can’t come.

395
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,070
So

396
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,280
I come here

397
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,950
to see if you need anything.

398
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,780
These are

399
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,600
tonics I brought from Xiqiu

400
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,200
when I was

401
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,530
married into Tianning.

402
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,200
I’ve consulted the imperial physician.

403
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,740
It’s good for your health.

404
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,240
You can have it without worries.

405
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,490
Thank you, Your Highness.

406
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,240
You're welcome.

407
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,680
Your Highness.

408
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,450
I hope you can get well soon.

409
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,050
I want you to hang out with me.

410
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,070
Silly girl.

411
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,570
When I get recovered,

412
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,950
I’ll hang out with you.

413
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,570
It’s a deal.

414
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,990
Princess Changbing

415
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,740
has been worried about you.

416
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,410
You cried a lot, right?

417
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,070
I didn’t.

418
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,150
It’s all Second Prince’s fault.

419
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,240
He is so vicious.

420
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,400
Luckily,

421
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,740
father locked him up.

422
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:20,720
That way,

423
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,340
no one will

424
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,570
do harm to you.

425
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,060
I wish father would lock him up for good.

426
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,610
You're old enough to get married.

427
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,200
Don’t talk

428
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,240
that way again.

429
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,820
I’m looking out for you.

430
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,820
Your Highness.

431
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,190
Princess Changbing and you

432
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,150
are so close.

433
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,200
It reminds me

434
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,490
of my brother.

435
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,200
When I was little,

436
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,740
my brother and I

437
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,780
relied on each other

438
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,570
to live on like this.

439
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,640
Your Highness.

440
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,450
You may leave.

441
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:05,240
Yes.

442
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,319
It was Noble Consort Xiao

443
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,109
who poisoned the Empress and killed her.

444
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:24,700
Also,

445
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,400
Second Prince sent men

446
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,650
to intercept Prince Qin halfway

447
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,310
and meant to rob Poison Beast.

448
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,020
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

449
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,180
Your Highness.

450
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,390
Miss Mingxiang

451
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,030
lives in Bai Xiaochuan's place for now.

452
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,110
She is fine.

453
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:54,950
Also,

454
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,610
our men are ready to advance

455
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,390
to the capital as scheduled

456
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,170
with their identity hidden.

457
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,610
I wish I could take revenge

458
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,610
before I die.

459
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:15,510
Your Highness.

460
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,310
Brother.

461
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,150
I heard Crown Prince has recovered.

462
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:21,820
Tianhui released

463
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,740
the family of Han Cong’an.

464
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,990
He was just dismissed.

465
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,240
All his family are preparing

466
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,570
to move to his hometown.

467
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:28,650
Xifeng.

468
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,530
Send men to tell Princess,

469
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,490
Han Yunxi.

470
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,260
Tell her to rest assured.

471
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,360
Yes.

472
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:40,780
Brother.

473
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,950
Aren’t you going along?

474
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:47,950
No.

475
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:53,820
Yunxi.

476
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,860
In such a circumstance,

477
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,820
I don’t know

478
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,740
what to say to you.

479
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,030
But,

480
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,400
whatever,

481
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,490
thank you.

482
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,780
Lady Xu.

483
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,280
We're family.

484
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,800
Don’t be like a stranger.

485
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:13,740
Sister.

486
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,490
It was all my fault before.

487
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,820
Ruoxue.

488
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,950
I did things wrong as well.

489
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,200
But families never bear a long grudge.

490
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,280
In the future, take care of

491
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,340
father and Lady Xu.

492
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,900
I will.

493
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,530
Alright.

494
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,050
Help your mother get on the carriage.

495
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,200
We’re leaving.

496
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,610
Yunxi.

497
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,990
It’s the city gate.

498
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,710
No need to see us off. Go back.

499
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,320
Father.

500
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,800
Are the things arranged at hometown?

501
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,860
Prince Qin

502
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,990
has got everything arranged there.

503
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,400
Don't worry about it.

504
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:01,990
That’s good.

505
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,190
Is Prince Qin

506
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,150
nice to you?

507
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,530
Yunxi.

508
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,150
When will you give me a nephew?

509
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:14,820
Look at you.

510
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,570
Don’t talk nonsense.

511
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,360
Listen.

512
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,190
Don't slack off on your study.

513
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,070
I’ll test your medical skills

514
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,330
when we meet next time.

515
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,780
Got it.

516
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,400
Yunxi.

517
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,400
Yunxi.

518
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,290
You’ll be all alone in the capital.

519
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,030
Take care of yourself. Understand?

520
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,740
Don't worry.

521
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,610
I’m Han Yunxi.

522
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,740
I fear nothing.

523
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,390
Alright.

524
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:48,740
Take your mother to the carriage.

525
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,320
Mother.

526
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,690
Let me help you get on.

527
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,190
Yunxi.

528
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,610
I know you're strong-minded.

529
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,110
But remember,

530
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,740
if you have

531
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,610
any grievance in the capital,

532
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,600
you can come to hometown anytime.

533
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,570
Don’t forget

534
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,650
we’re always your family.

535
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,570
Rest assured, father.

536
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,820
All the people in Prince Qin’s Mansion

537
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,950
are kind to me.

538
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,070
Alright.

539
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,240
I feel relieved then.

540
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,530
Lady.

541
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,620
Would you like

542
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,610
to dine with me?

543
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:10,150
Go.

544
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,170
Let’s eat noodles.

545
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,680
Smells so good.

546
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,920
That’s the flavor.

547
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,150
Remember this.

548
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,070
Miss. Your noodles.

549
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:23,990
Thanks.

550
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:26,750
Are they really tasty?

551
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:27,700
Of course.

552
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,800
With the delicious noodles,

553
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,990
and a beauty

554
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,070
being my company,

555
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:32,990
I feel so happy

556
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:33,820
now.

557
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,010
Numerous girls

558
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,820
want to keep you company. Right?

559
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,750
That’s for sure.

560
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:39,410
But this place

561
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,610
is our secret base.

562
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,310
How can I bring others here?

563
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,460
By the way,

564
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:44,580
why are you here?

565
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,970
To take you back to Yaogui Valley.

566
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,530
It’s good to have a friend like you.

567
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,740
Or else, I’d be homeless

568
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,120
and have nowhere to go.

569
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,610
Thanks for taking me in.

570
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,780
I do wish

571
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,240
I could take you in all the lifetime.

572
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,240
If I spend my whole life there,

573
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,280
all your herbs

574
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,360
will be used by me.

575
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,280
No problem.

576
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,380
I can plant again if you use them up.

577
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,240
Are you so generous?

578
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:08,740
Yes.

579
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:10,490
Forget it.

580
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,530
I’ll go back to Prince Qin’s Mansion

581
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,650
as soon as I make the antidote.

582
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:13,490
I won't bother you.

583
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,190
OK.

584
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,190
Aren’t you eating?

585
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,450
I’m going back to make medicine.

586
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,280
Wait for me.

587
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,750
I’m eating some.

588
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,400
Hurry up.

589
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,990
Hurry up.

590
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,570
One bite. No more.

591
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:29,810
Your Highness.

592
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,610
I’ve investigated it.

593
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:31,610
It’s all true.

594
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,130
Since Second Prince was imprisoned,

595
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:35,660
he's been depressed

596
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,190
and dispirited.

597
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,990
Dispirited?

598
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,420
I think he's just putting on an act.

599
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,190
He and his mother will pay

600
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,450
with their blood

601
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,450
for what they did to my mother.

602
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,150
Father.

603
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,450
I’ve done so much

604
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,700
wholeheartedly for you.

605
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:35,200
Why am I

606
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,150
still inferior to Long Tianmo

607
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,820
in your eyes?

608
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,110
It’s just because

609
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,650
he is

610
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,610
your first son?

611
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,450
Long Tianmo,

612
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,190
you don’t deserve to be Crown Prince!

613
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,460
In terms of abilities,

614
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,490
how can you compare to me?

615
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,070
You’re incompetent

616
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,490
and coward.

617
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:29,030
But…

618
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,110
But father

619
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:34,900
you still care

620
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,740
about him.

621
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,530
Maid!

622
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:58,570
Give me wine!

623
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:01,990
Maid!

624
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,240
Maid!

625
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,700
It’s you!

626
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:42,820
Yes.

627
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,530
What brings you here?

628
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,150
Are you here to mock me?

629
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,490
Mock you?

630
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,700
I don’t have that time.

631
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,190
Neither do I have interest.

632
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,320
Why do you

633
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,740
come to me then?

634
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,110
I don’t like

635
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,360
mocking anyone.

636
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,450
I just like

637
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,200
watching people

638
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:19,030
struggling to die.

639
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:23,070
I’m sure that’ll be fun.

640
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,190
What did you say?

641
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,820
Are you gonna kill me?

642
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,070
Wine... Wine...

643
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:43,030
Wine... It’s poisonous.

644
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,200
You...

645
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,740
You dared to harm me.

646
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,110
Why wouldn't I dare?

647
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:49,820
Didn’t you say

648
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,320
I’m coward?

649
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,530
Let me tell you

650
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,450
what a huge mistake you've made.

651
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:03,780
Guards!

652
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,490
Help!

653
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:07,860
Help!

654
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,060
Long Tianqing.

655
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,190
I’ll never do dirty tricks

656
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:14,780
like your mother

657
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,320
who used

658
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,320
poisons on others secretly.

659
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,240
I will never forget what your mother did

660
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,780
to my mother.

661
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:30,070
Never ever.

662
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,150
What are you talking about?

663
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,360
You know

664
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,360
what she did.

665
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,400
The wine of this amount

666
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,240
won't kill you

667
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,360
so soon.

668
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,280
I said

669
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,280
I like watching people

670
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:57,320
struggling to die.

671
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:01,030
You colluded with Prince Qin secretly

672
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,230
and investigated the border accounts.

673
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,110
You killed my uncle in prison.

674
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:07,900
And your mother

675
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,320
poisoned my mother.

676
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,780
Now

677
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,110
you’re imprisoned here

678
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,190
for trying to kill me.

679
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,320
What do you think I will do?

680
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,780
All I want now is

681
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,320
killing you.

682
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:49,930
Long Tianqing.

683
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:51,820
You should thank me

684
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,030
for my mercy.

685
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:58,990
You just suffered

686
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,450
such a bit of pain.

687
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:06,810
Your Highness.

688
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,360
Second Prince killed himself last night.

689
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:11,460
What did you say?

690
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,030
Say it. Say it.

691
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:24,900
Say it!

692
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,030
The news has that

693
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:30,610
Second Prince hanged himself last night.

694
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,820
No way.

695
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,030
No way.

696
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,110
Tianqing

697
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,990
visited me not long ago.

698
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,990
He told me to wait and see.

699
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,650
He wouldn’t hang himself.

700
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:55,610
You’re lying.

701
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,400
You’re lying.

702
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,780
I dare not.

703
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,820
Second Prince attempted to kill Crown Prince

704
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,860
and ganged up for his own gain.

705
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,660
It's exposed.

706
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,570
He was dismissed

707
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:08,150
from all his posts by His Majesty

708
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,990
and imprisoned in his mansion.

709
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,700
How come I didn’t know anything?

710
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:13,490
It’s...

711
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,610
Second Prince didn’t allow me

712
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,820
to tell you.

713
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,110
Leave!

714
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,950
Leave!

715
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,150
Leave!

716
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,030
Yes. Yes. I’m leaving.

717
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:37,990
Tianqing couldn't have killed himself.

718
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,210
Tianqing couldn't have killed himself.

719
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,070
Chu Qingge.

720
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,090
It must be...

721
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,320
It must be Chu Qingge who killed him!

722
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:05,400
Mother.

723
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,900
Is it my fault?

724
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,610
No, it isn't.

725
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:15,400
Tianqing attempted to

726
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:16,910
do harm to his brother.

727
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,320
You didn’t kill him

728
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,780
but imprisoned him.

729
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,360
That was already a mercy.

730
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,240
But in my opinion,

731
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,990
it's not like Tianqing.

732
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,950
I’ve sent men to investigate it.

733
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,030
Since he was imprisoned,

734
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,280
he had drunk every day.

735
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,520
He got drunk again last night.

736
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,240
The coroner has examined

737
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,030
his corpse.

738
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,070
There isn’t

739
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,400
any injury

740
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,900
or poison in his body,

741
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:49,280
but a mark on his neck.

742
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:54,530
He was too vulnerable

743
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,280
to bear such a blow.

744
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:02,530
Back then you favored Tianqing

745
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,710
and neglected Crown Prince.

746
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,530
I

747
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,360
didn’t say anything.

748
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:17,780
It’s also my fault

749
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,320
that I didn’t remind you

750
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,150
to make a balance between them.

751
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:24,700
Or else, he wouldn't

752
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,450
have had the ulterior motive

753
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:29,240
and made the tragedy today.

754
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,300
Don’t blame yourself, mother.

755
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,900
It’s my fault.

756
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,490
It’s a result

757
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,030
of my selfishness.

758
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:42,990
If I have treated

759
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,030
Crown Prince fairly

760
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,860
and haven’t spoiled Tianqing,

761
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,650
it wouldn't have been like this.

762
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,190
I understand.

763
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,740
Don’t be too sad.

764
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:07,030
It might be Tianqing’s fate.

765
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:11,280
He was born to be a royal,

766
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,199
enjoying wealth and honor,

767
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:15,550
having few twists and turns.

768
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,820
He had

769
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:20,150
a satisfactory life, anyway.

770
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:29,780
My son.

771
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,199
Come.

772
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:36,949
Don't be too sad.

773
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:42,699
You still have state affairs to attend to.

774
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:44,949
Take care of yourself.

775
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,540
Rest assured, mother.

776
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:48,900
I understand.

777
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:54,030
I was told that

778
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:57,390
Noble Consort Xiao heard of this matter

779
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,990
and got crazy.

780
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,280
She made a scene to see you,

781
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,200
saying that it was a murder.

782
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,110
I think,

783
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,400
considering her mood,

784
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,860
she won’t listen to anyone.

785
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,110
So I picked her up

786
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,600
and let Physician Gu examine her.

787
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,700
When you're free

788
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,470
and after she calms down,

789
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,120
you may go to see her.

790
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:32,150
She ends up like this.

791
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,490
I'm half to blame.

792
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,900
Tianqing is dead now.

793
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,990
She is a poor woman.

794
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:45,630
I’m going to see her

795
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:48,070
in a few days.

796
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,450
After all,

797
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,530
she is my concubine.

798
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,530
However huge the grudge is,

799
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,860
it will be gone

800
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,030
with Tianqing’s death.

801
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,200
I only wish

802
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:10,030
the palace would be in peace.

803
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,860
No chaos anymore.

804
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,570
Your Highness.

805
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:25,630
Time for medicine.

806
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,650
Scram! Scram!

807
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,490
-You all want to kill me!
-Your Highness!

808
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,190
You killed my son!

809
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,110
Physician Gu.

810
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,250
Tianqing was killed by Chu Qingge.

811
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,320
Chu Qingge intends to kill Prince Qin.

812
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,400
Beili has allied with Xiqiu.

813
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,740
You are tricked

814
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,610
by a woman.

815
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,190
You’re all tricked

816
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,650
by a woman.

817
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,060
The millennial Poison Scripture

818
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,610
is supposed to have the antidote formula for Poison Gu.

819
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,610
Even if no complete formula is available,

820
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:36,700
there should be some

821
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,300
scattered records at least.

822
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,360
Is the bracelet helpful?

823
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,440
But Poison Scripture

824
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,030
doesn’t have any record about Poison Gu.

825
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:52,430
This bracelet is a holy article of our clan.

826
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,180
I gave it to your mother back then.

827
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,740
All the records inside are

828
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,990
the classics of my Poison Sect.

829
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:01,530
Poison Scripture

830
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,510
has been passed for a millennium.

831
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:05,820
All in all,

832
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:08,330
they’re poison skills that kill people.

833
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,820
In my opinion,

834
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,650
it should be destroyed

835
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,200
before it's too late.

836
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:17,240
What’s the use of talking about these now?

837
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,740
If you’re kind-hearted,

838
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,530
you wouldn’t have made incurable Poison Gu.

839
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,450
Poison can be harmful,

840
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,190
and can also save lives.

841
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,650
Curing poison with poison

842
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,250
has been a method ever since.

843
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:30,650
I also use poison

844
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,650
to treat patients.

845
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:34,570
Poison is feared

846
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:35,950
because they might be used

847
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,010
for evil purposes.

848
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,720
There's nothing wrong with poison itself.

849
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,680
The poisoners are guilty

850
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,230
for their evil motives.

851
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:44,400
Right.

852
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,860
If I followed your mother’s advice

853
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,240
and used poison to save lives,

854
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,640
it wouldn’t be like this.

855
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,240
What I can do now

856
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,490
is to save more people

857
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,280
and do good for you.

858
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:58,990
You said

859
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,400
you were making a new antidote.

860
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,260
How's it going?

861
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,900
It just started.

862
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,070
I hope it works.

863
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,660
Sun Muchu pays respect to Your Highness.

864
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,320
Skip it.

865
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,760
You come to the capital to report.

866
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:36,570
Is it because

867
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,440
Tianhui suspected you?

868
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,740
Rest assured, Your Highness.

869
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,190
I was meticulous.

870
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,530
His Majesty didn’t suspect

871
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:45,990
that I was your man.

872
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,900
We’ve hid for long.

873
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:50,700
The chance has come.

874
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,610
We can take actions as scheduled.

875
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,150
This is the day

876
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:55,860
I’ve been waiting for.

877
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:00,020
Armies in Southern Regions are my main force.

878
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,070
You’ll lead the troops.

879
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,240
Slip them up into three armies

880
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,320
and get into capital separately.

881
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,030
Got it?

882
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,700
Yes, Your Highness.

883
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,280
Southern Regions are bordered with Beili,

884
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,540
and adjacent to Xiqiu.

885
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,110
For so many years,

886
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,650
it’s all because of

887
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:14,820
your protection

888
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,150
that the people there can enjoy the peace.

889
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,570
I’m afraid they’ll invade

890
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:20,570
when they get

891
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,450
some information.

892
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:24,150
Rest assured, Your Highness.

893
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,570
Southern Regions have critical passes

894
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:27,240
guarded by heavy armies.

895
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:30,480
Even if the elite troops enter the capital

896
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:31,740
and these two states invade,

897
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,340
they won’t get a good result.

898
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:35,850
Xiqiu and Beili are in a good relationship.

899
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:38,120
But to pull the wool over Tianhui’s eyes,

900
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,990
they didn’t ally actually.

901
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,820
Not to mention a treaty.

902
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,740
They have different motives.

903
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,070
Each has an axe to grind.

904
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,860
They won’t make a difference.

905
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,790
I can’t agree more, Your Highness.

906
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,570
I’ll count on you, Mr. Sun.

907
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,950
You’re too kind, Your Highness.

908
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,030
If I can help you restore the kingdom

909
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,750
and be the legitimate ruler,

910
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,070
I’ll be paying back

911
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,720
for the kindness of the late king.

912
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,780
I got Long Feiye

913
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:48,330
infected by Poison Gu.

914
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,700
He will surely not forgive me

915
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,030
for such a huge grudge.

916
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,530
Yet Yunxi is my daughter.

917
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:57,530
This bad karma

918
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:00,240
will never come to a good end.

919
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,960
It’s not necessary

920
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:04,150
for her to know these things.

921
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:07,180
Love and hatred are two things.

922
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:09,010
Can you forget my mother?

923
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,150
Xiqiu has allied with Beili.

924
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,190
The purpose of Chu Qingge getting into the palace

925
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:19,110
is to kill Prince Qin!
