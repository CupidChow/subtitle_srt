Episode 20

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,490
Han Yunxi,

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,530
do you think

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,400
you’re qualified

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,490
to bargain with me?

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,380
Your Highness, I’m not in a position to do that.

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,450
But so far

9
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,210
you've only given me

10
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,870
one of my mother's bracelets.

11
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,110
Your Highness,

12
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,890
could you please

13
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,350
let me meet my mother once?

14
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,400
Just once.

15
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,650
And I’d like to die

16
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,250
for anything you ask me to do.

17
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,890
I can’t let you

18
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,740
see your mother for now.

19
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,450
But I

20
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,140
can give you

21
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,410
another thing of your mother.

22
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,090
But I really want to see my mother.

23
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:45,950
Han Yunxi,

24
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,360
don’t challenge my patience.

25
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,280
If you push your luck,

26
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,900
believe it or not,

27
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,820
I will never

28
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,360
let you see your mother in this life.

29
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,560
Please forgive me.

30
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,110
I just miss my mother so much.

31
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,650
Since that,

32
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,360
I’ll do as you said.

33
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,200
Please show me

34
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,950
that thing of my mother.

35
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,700
This is right.

36
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,650
Your mother’s stuff

37
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,110
is in her adytum.

38
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,400
You can come with me.

39
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,280
Yes.

40
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,289
An emergency at the frontier

41
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:40,250
should be reported to His Majesty.

42
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,380
Please deliver it as soon as possible.

43
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,110
Your Majesty…

44
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,070
An emergency came from the border.

45
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:57,990
Brother,

46
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,270
anything happened?

47
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,360
Nothing.

48
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,180
If you got other things to deal with,

49
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,820
I should go back now.

50
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,949
No hurry.

51
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,250
You can wait here

52
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,360
for a while.

53
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,820
I’ll come back soon.

54
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,190
The Royal Garden has a beautiful view.

55
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,240
But I’m so bored

56
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,610
to be here alone.

57
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,610
How about this?

58
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,990
You can ask someone else

59
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,530
to play Go with me.

60
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,250
Not many people in the palace

61
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,200
are qualified to play Go with you.

62
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,320
How about

63
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,360
I get Tianmo here?

64
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,630
I don’t mean you to play Go with him,

65
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,240
but to keep an eye on him.

66
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,150
Remember.

67
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,250
Don’t let him

68
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,850
be out of your sight for long.

69
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,950
Understand?

70
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,360
Yes.

71
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,750
Your skill of playing Go

72
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,650
won’t let me down, will it?

73
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,840
Father, please rest assured.

74
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,780
Uncle.

75
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,040
Your Highness.

76
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,820
Do you still remember

77
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,740
that kid?

78
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,820
And

79
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,240
the Poisoning Manual

80
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,780
that you lost?

81
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,570
You may leave now.

82
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,740
Yes.

83
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,200
Uncle, what do you want?

84
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,110
It’s boring to play Go here.

85
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,110
I want to go back home.

86
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,459
But I don’t want His Majesty to know.

87
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:18,779
You mean

88
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,320
you want me to cover for you?

89
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,570
I just don’t

90
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,750
want my brother to get me wrong.

91
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,800
Uncle, you don’t know that

92
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,650
father was angry with me

93
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,020
because of Grand Commandant.

94
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,490
If father knows that…

95
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,990
What if I give that kid

96
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,730
to your father?

97
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:38,360
You…

98
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,820
If father knows about

99
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,020
the Gu-infected kid,

100
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,890
I don’t think you

101
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,190
can benefit from it.

102
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,680
Grand Commandant’s death

103
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,570
was really a pity.

104
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:58,960
Your Highness,

105
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,240
life is impermanent.

106
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,320
You’d better think of

107
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,820
how to play this game.

108
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,820
Your Royal Highness,

109
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,650
may I ask

110
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,990
if my mother is in the palace?

111
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,070
Your mother’s whereabouts is a secret

112
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,450
and taboo.

113
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,950
If you tell anyone of it,

114
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,400
even if I don’t take actions,

115
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,490
some people else will kill her

116
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,950
if they hear about it.

117
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,450
If not for

118
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,900
my protection these years,

119
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,530
your mother can’t be alive till now.

120
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:07,960
Then why hasn’t

121
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,130
my mother showed up

122
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,260
for all these years?

123
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,300
You want to know that?

124
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,200
Do you have the courage to bear it?

125
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,570
You should pay

126
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,360
to know secrets.

127
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,110
The less you know,

128
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,690
the more likely you and your mother

129
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,900
will survive.

130
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,700
I advise you

131
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,990
not to inquire what you should not know.

132
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,820
As long as you are compliant,

133
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,700
you and your mother

134
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,360
will reunite one day.

135
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,570
Understand?

136
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,030
Yes.

137
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,240
Let’s go.

138
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,990
Those unruly people!

139
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,330
My army

140
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,730
is there to protect them!

141
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,410
How dare they attack my army at night

142
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,450
only for food?

143
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,460
Your Majesty,

144
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,570
the border is under Beili’s attack.

145
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,630
Many soldiers got killed or injured.

146
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,410
The local officials levied heavy taxes

147
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,740
on the spot to supply the army

148
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,130
under the Imperial Order.

149
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,050
But the local people don’t

150
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,580
understand your kindness.

151
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,420
Your Majesty,

152
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,930
what can we do now?

153
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,010
Decapitate all the people who attacked

154
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,070
the army at night

155
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,490
and hang them on the wall for three days

156
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:26,650
as an example!

157
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,930
I’ll pay more for the military at the border

158
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,360
and levy one more tax.

159
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,540
If the people who are afraid of Beili

160
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,370
don’t want to be conquered,

161
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,450
they should just keep

162
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,610
my army well!

163
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,150
Yes, Your Majesty!

164
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,990
Anything else?

165
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,020
Your Majesty,

166
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,340
people in the Ministry of Revenue are crafty.

167
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,700
We uncouth fellow

168
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,360
are always bullied while contacting with them.

169
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,490
Please get the Minister of Revenue here

170
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,620
to urge him in person

171
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,290
to give us

172
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,240
enough provisions in time.

173
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:10,780
Go

174
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,410
call the Minister of Revenue here.

175
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,240
Yes.

176
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:18,110
Minister of Revenue is called to meet!

177
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,860
Thanks, Your Majesty.

178
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,140
Sorry! Sorry!

179
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,330
How dare you!

180
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,730
Who dares to be in the way?

181
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,460
[Gu’s Mansion]

182
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,410
You’ve been

183
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,660
quiet for all these years.

184
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,970
You only got excited when you

185
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,500
saw Princess Qin last time.

186
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,140
What’s wrong with you today?

187
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,570
Is it…

188
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,150
You found leader?

189
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,430
Take me to there now!

190
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,110
Your Majesty,

191
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,450
to add the provisions to the border…

192
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,260
What’s wrong?

193
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,410
Should Tianning

194
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,330
even withhold the provisions

195
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,360
to the troops?

196
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,780
I don’t dare to mean that.

197
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,030
But…

198
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,540
But the National Treasury is lack of money now.

199
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,810
It’s hard to pay more provisions

200
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,490
to the army at the border.

201
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,700
Lack of money?

202
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,650
Where is the money?

203
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,450
Your Majesty,

204
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,570
wars have been launched these years,

205
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,930
the south got a flood,

206
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,330
and the former Grand Commandant corrupted

207
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,490
and concocted various pretexts

208
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,820
to levy heavy taxes.

209
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,480
The National Treasury

210
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,490
is living beyond its income.

211
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,240
Go get

212
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,410
all the account books

213
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,410
to me!

214
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,530
I need to check one by one!

215
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,360
Go now!

216
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,620
[Street Closed]

217
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,720
Stop the carriage!

218
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,060
What’s wrong?

219
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,720
Nothing happened.

220
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,740
Why did you stop the carriage?

221
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,130
I saw a man in black just now.

222
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,590
So I stopped the carriage.

223
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,570
What…

224
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,150
Guard!

225
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,410
Why is no one in the street?

226
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,140
Sir,

227
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:38,820
the road is being repaired.

228
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,500
It’s said the street is now closed.

229
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,450
Repair?

230
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,650
No! We’re in the trap!

231
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,940
The leader of the Imperial Guards

232
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,740
is really the top master of Feng.

233
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,030
His archery is superb.

234
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,960
Who is that man in black

235
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,540
which is even able to fight against him?

236
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,490
You!

237
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,950
If I’m right,

238
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,000
this is Storm Flowers Needle.

239
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,450
You want to buy time?

240
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,520
You will be disappointed.

241
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,780
You have strong martial arts skills.

242
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,640
Why don’t you work for His Majesty

243
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,860
to have a good life

244
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,550
with endless treasure?

245
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:50,900
Leader!

246
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:51,610
No.

247
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,250
The two of them are strong.

248
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,770
Only my flying skill is their match.

249
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,100
I can’t be against them.

250
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,170
I shouldn’t act rashly.

251
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,450
I’ll wait and see.

252
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,010
This place is the same

253
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:03,860
as I remember.

254
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,020
I have seen my mom’s pharmacy

255
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,130
when I was a kid.

256
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,260
It’s just like this.

257
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,900
My mom is still alive!

258
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,280
She is still alive!

259
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,090
Your Highness,

260
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,750
this is your mother’s bottle.

261
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,150
Yes, it’s her bottle.

262
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,760
My mom loves this bottle the most.

263
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,400
My father gave it to her.

264
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,820
But I broke it

265
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,110
by accident before.

266
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,320
Then my mom drew

267
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,190
an iris flower on the crack.

268
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:37,530
Do you believe me now?

269
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,400
As long as you obey my order,

270
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,820
I will fulfill your wish

271
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,780
to let you see your mother.

272
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,740
Alright.

273
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,280
That’s all today.

274
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,700
Guard.

275
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,140
Send Princess Qin out of the palace.

276
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,570
Mom,

277
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,240
don’t worry.

278
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,490
I will find you one day.

279
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:15,530
You are careful.

280
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,970
You still keep

281
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,030
Tianxin’s legacy.

282
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,950
This is my job.

283
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,290
Looks like Princess Qin

284
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,859
is touched by this.

285
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,530
I think

286
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,740
she will serve you

287
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,610
with all her heart now.

288
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,570
Who is that?

289
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,110
Me!

290
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,050
Xifeng,

291
00:17:59,050 --> 00:17:59,980
why are you here?

292
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,350
Sorry, I’m late.

293
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:04,820
Tang Li,

294
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,780
take Poison Master back to Serene Chamber first.

295
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,130
Xifeng, you came in time.

296
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,090
Go back to the palace with me.

297
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:09,700
Yes.

298
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:15,860
Leader.

299
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,480
Your Highness.

300
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,640
Your Highness, what’s wrong?

301
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,110
I don’t know why.

302
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,520
The poisonous Gu breaks out earlier.

303
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,110
But it will be fine as long as

304
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,950
I don’t use my power.

305
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,000
Your Highness,

306
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:39,650
that’s because

307
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,970
Her Highness put medicine

308
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,020
in the cakes she made.

309
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,170
And it’s the exact the opposite

310
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,630
of Mingxiang’s medicine.

311
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,090
The herbs in the paste

312
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,200
are all here.

313
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,190
No!

314
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,930
Miss Mingxiang, what’s wrong?

315
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:05,610
Go!

316
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,070
Go help Feiye now!

317
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:07,930
Han Yunxi

318
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:08,890
put medicine in the cakes

319
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:09,700
she made for Feiye.

320
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,300
That medicine

321
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,830
works against my medicine.

322
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,570
I’m worried that the poisonous Gu

323
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,340
in Feiye’s body will break out anytime.

324
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,600
Does Her Highness know

325
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,260
that His Highness is infected by poisonous Gu?

326
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,900
Maybe or maybe not.

327
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,370
I have told you that

328
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,400
she is a trouble!

329
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,030
This is the good chance!

330
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,930
Don’t let them go.

331
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:29,610
Go!

332
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,390
You leave first.

333
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,310
Brother,

334
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,390
are you alright?

335
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,100
The Gu-infected man?

336
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,380
The Gu-infected man!

337
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,150
Leave!

338
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,040
Your Highness!

339
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,110
Tang Li,

340
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,930
take Poison Master to Serene Chamber first.

341
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:27,820
Now!

342
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,240
Let’s go.

343
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,000
Your Highness,

344
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,410
the power of the Gu-infected man

345
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,870
is at the cost of your life.

346
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,030
Now you are already so weak.

347
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,030
You can’t go back to the palace.

348
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,400
If I don’t,

349
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,990
His Majesty will know that

350
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,160
Poison Master is taken away by me!

351
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,030
How dare you!

352
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,570
How dare you!

353
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,730
Where is the illicit money of Grand Commandant?

354
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,410
Why isn’t it turned in the National Treasury?

355
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,330
Your Majesty, please calm down.

356
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,490
Tell me now!

357
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:12,970
Your Majesty,

358
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,320
don’t you remember?

359
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,450
The illicit money

360
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,610
were given out to the civilians

361
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,200
by Prince Qin.

362
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,860
Take the provision

363
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,370
from my personal treasury.

364
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:39,830
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Thanks, Your Majesty.

365
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,780
But it’s not a long-term policy.

366
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,780
Minister of Revenue.

367
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,780
You should find out a way

368
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,860
to deal with it.

369
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,760
If there is still a deficit

370
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,410
next time I ask you,

371
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,290
you will be removed

372
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,420
from your position!

373
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,240
I got it.

374
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,540
You may go now.

375
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:00,400
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

376
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,490
Prince Qin,

377
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,490
you draw over all the popular support.

378
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:14,820
Let’s go.

379
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,820
To the Royal Garden.

380
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,490
I should finish the game

381
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:20,530
which is not over!

382
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,100
You stupid servants!

383
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,330
Didn’t I order you

384
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,490
to watch Prince Qin?

385
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,610
What are you doing here?

386
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:54,650
Your Majesty, sorry.

387
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:55,290
His Highness

388
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,410
asked us out.

389
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:57,740
We dare not to disobey?

390
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,690
Where is the Crown Prince?

391
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,420
His Highness is still in there.

392
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,240
Father.

393
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,830
Where is Prince Qin?

394
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,610
He went to use the toilet.

395
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,740
When did he go?

396
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,730
Not long ago.

397
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,110
How long is not long?

398
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,420
Less than the duration of a burning joss stick.

399
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,690
Li Quan.

400
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:31,530
Yes, Your Majesty.

401
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,140
Go to the toilet to find him back.

402
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:33,950
Yes.

403
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,190
Tianmo.

404
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,920
What did Prince Qin talk to you

405
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,180
when you played the Go?

406
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,400
Tell me about it.

407
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,740
Nothing special.

408
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,650
Uncle just talked with me

409
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,510
about something in my childhood.

410
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,010
You only talked those memories

411
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,340
during such a long time?

412
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,360
Yes.

413
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,650
Tell me one of it.

414
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,340
Your Majesty!

415
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,250
Prince Qin is

416
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,250
not in the toilet next to the garden.

417
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,200
Where is he?

418
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,360
Father…

419
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,200
Brother!

420
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,610
Brother.

421
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,490
I just went

422
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,740
to the toilet.

423
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,070
Why are you so angry?

424
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,180
Li Quan didn’t

425
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,700
find you in the toilet.

426
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,940
I saw the flowers are blooming well

427
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,110
on the way back here.

428
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,620
So I admired them for a while.

429
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,150
Is there anything in a hurry for me?

430
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,450
Rise.

431
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,050
Thank you, father.

432
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,510
There is nothing in hurry.

433
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,400
It just occurred to me

434
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,100
after I dealt with the matters

435
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,490
that our game

436
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,700
is not over yet.

437
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,990
So I came back in a hurry

438
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,040
to continue the game with you.

439
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,320
Please.

440
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,060
According to what Her Royal Highness said,

441
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,780
I’m afraid that my mother’s disappearance

442
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,070
is very important.

443
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,120
I can’t get it into my control.

444
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,130
Since I have decided

445
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:27,200
to protect Feiye,

446
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,290
I can’t hide what’s between I

447
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,550
and Her Royal Highness from him anymore.

448
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,020
I don’t want to leave the palace for now.

449
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,420
Take me to see Prince Qin.

450
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,030
Yes. Please.

451
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,150
Feiye,

452
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,110
it’s your turn.

453
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,860
Why don’t you move?

454
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,820
Feiye, what’s wrong?

455
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,700
You feel uncomfortable?

456
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,200
Li Quan.

457
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,140
-Yes.
-Go, call the physician here.

458
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:18,900
Yes.

459
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,030
Brother,

460
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,800
don’t bother. Thanks.

461
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,450
Just now

462
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,070
when I moved the piece,

463
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,880
I found that I made the wrong step.

464
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,200
So I dropped the piece

465
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,910
out of nervousness.

466
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,320
I thought you were

467
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,470
trying to respond quickly.

468
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,150
Feiye,

469
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,740
You don't

470
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,320
look well.

471
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,990
I’m worried.

472
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,150
I think

473
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,370
you’d better

474
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:12,230
let the physician to have a check.

475
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,570
-Li Quan.
-Yes.

476
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,030
Call the physician now.

477
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,070
-Yes.
-Princess Qin arrives!

478
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,610
Your Highness.

479
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:23,570
Your Majesty.

480
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,050
Your Highness.

481
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,030
Rise.

482
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,350
Why are you here?

483
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,400
I’m here to go back home with you.

484
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,030
Brother,

485
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,400
since Yunxi is here,

486
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,950
I don’t need other physicians now.

487
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,820
Looks like you have

488
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,740
accept her as a good wife.

489
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,450
Of course.

490
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,530
Yunxi has great medical skill.

491
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,090
Seems that

492
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,030
I don’t have to

493
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,700
worry too much about your health.

494
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,360
I’m flattered.

495
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,900
Your Majesty,

496
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,530
we have been out for long.

497
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,660
We have to have the dinner with mother.

498
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,400
Consort Yi is always too strict.

499
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,070
I won’t allow that.

500
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,190
We haven’t finished our game yet.

501
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,450
Second Prince arrives!

502
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:31,310
Bring him here.

503
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,400
Yes.

504
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,450
Second Prince is allowed in.

505
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,780
-Father.
-Your Majesty.

506
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,860
-Uncle.
-Your Highness.

507
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:45,930
Have you finished

508
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:46,990
the task I gave you?

509
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,280
Brother,

510
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,190
since Tianqing is back,

511
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,150
I will

512
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,860
go back to accompany my mother now.

513
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,320
Feiye, wait a moment.

514
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,530
My bodyguard has a mania for martial arts skills.

515
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,590
He has always wanted to fight with you.

516
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,200
I promised him.

517
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,650
There is no need to choose another day.

518
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,760
I think today is great.

519
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:42,990
Your Majesty…

520
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,590
Since my brother said that,

521
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,030
then

522
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:56,000
my obedience is better than politeness.

523
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,190
Great.

524
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,320
Please.

525
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,970
You are deeply poisoned.

526
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,530
You can’t use your power within three days.

527
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,540
Or the poison will break out anytime.

528
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,800
You have to be careful.

529
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,010
Feiye,

530
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:32,610
please don’t hurt yourself.

531
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,430
Are you alright?

532
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:19,860
Brother,

533
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,990
the fight is over.

534
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,110
I should go back now.

535
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,860
Since you are in a hurry to go back,

536
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,070
I shouldn’t stop you again.

537
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,830
-Thanks, brother.
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

538
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,130
Your Majesty,

539
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,030
I lost.

540
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,780
Was it Prince Qin?

541
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,260
Your Majesty,

542
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,100
the movements Prince Qin used just now

543
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,560
are completely different from that of the one intercepted us.

544
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,900
Where else did Prince Qin go

545
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,950
except the toilet?

546
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,650
Father,

547
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,330
uncle had indeed been playing Go with me

548
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,780
in the pavilion.

549
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,450
You didn’t lie to me?

550
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,780
I don’t dare to lie.

551
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,250
It’s my fault.

552
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,490
The hijackers are too strong.

553
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,530
And they were in black with mask.

554
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:24,530
I failed to

555
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:25,400
identify them.

556
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,860
A group of idiots!

557
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,130
And where did that Gu-infected man come from?

558
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,330
Did you get any clues?

559
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,990
Your Majesty,

560
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,490
we got no clue.

561
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:38,840
Search for him!

562
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,740
Search for him in the whole city!

563
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,150
Yes.

564
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,179
Why didn’t you

565
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:31,219
let me persuade His Majesty just now?

566
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:32,739
If I hadn't done that,

567
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,570
brother wouldn’t have let me go.

568
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:39,100
The longer we stay there,

569
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,460
the worse the situation will be.

570
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,110
Feiye!

571
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,570
Feiye!

572
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:48,530
Feiye!

573
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,570
What?

574
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,210
Han Yunxi

575
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,739
is really that woman’s spy?

576
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,500
Does Her Highness know

577
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,100
that His Highness is infected by poisonous Gu?

578
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,740
Maybe or maybe not.

579
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,610
Oh, no.

580
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,450
If she tells that

581
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:08,710
to Her Royal Highness,

582
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,500
His Highness’s identity will be given away.

583
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,100
Why should she tell this to Her Royal Highness?

584
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,610
You don’t know.

585
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,200
Her Highness

586
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,560
was Her Royal Highness’s spy before.

587
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,110
Delivered news to her secretly?

588
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,240
Looks like

589
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,300
I shouldn’t have believed her.

590
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,030
Aunt,

591
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,130
we can’t let

592
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:30,810
someone like this

593
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:31,780
to stay beside Feiye.

594
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,860
Don’t worry.

595
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,320
She won’t cause any big trouble.

596
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,580
Let’s wait and see how I will punish her

597
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,360
when she comes back.

598
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:48,780
Feiye,

599
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,780
hang in there.

600
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,360
-Feiye.
-Feiye!

601
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:52,900
Are you alright?

602
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,080
-Feiye!
-Brother!

603
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:56,650
Feiye!

604
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,610
-Feiye!
-Brother!

605
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,540
Take Feiye

606
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,380
to his room now.

607
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,120
Alright.

608
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:01,780
Let’s go.

609
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,080
What are you doing?

610
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,050
Are you insane?

611
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,070
You’re insane!

612
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,860
Feiye treats you so well.

613
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,410
But you serve the Dowager as her spy

614
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:14,240
to hurt him!

615
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,490
I’m not her spy.

616
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,700
You’re not?

617
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,250
Feiye is like this

618
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,130
because of

619
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:21,260
the cakes your made!

620
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,650
No way!

621
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,250
The cakes are the antidotes!

622
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,900
You know nothing!

623
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,010
How dare you give medicine

624
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:27,940
to Feiye at will?

625
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:28,930
Feiye

626
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:29,410
is like this now

627
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,970
all because of you!

628
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,140
I should lock you in the wood house

629
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,210
and let aunt to punish you.

630
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,130
Step aside!

631
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:34,930
I have to detoxicate him,

632
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:35,970
or he will die.

633
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,210
I can help Feiye.

634
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:38,270
It’s not your turn.

635
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,240
Mingxiang.

636
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,360
Mingxiang,

637
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,820
how is Feiye now?

638
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,900
I heard that he felt bad.

639
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,210
Aunt, don’t worry,

640
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,210
I’m here with him.

641
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,420
I won’t let anything bad happen to him.

642
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,570
That’s great.

643
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,860
How dare you come back?

644
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:00,900
Madam Gui,

645
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,650
lock her in the wood house.

646
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:03,820
I will deal with her

647
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,250
when Feiye feels better.

648
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,130
Mother,

649
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:07,390
please let me explain.

650
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,800
I don’t want to hear it.

651
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,400
Feiye.

652
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,500
-Feiye.
-Your Highness.

653
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,290
-Mother.
-Don’t stand up.

654
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:29,900
Sit down.

655
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,730
Why did you become like this

656
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,730
after you came back from the palace?

657
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,100
Did Her Royal Highness

658
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,240
and His Majesty…

659
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,240
Mother, don’t worry.

660
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,700
I’m not feeling well recently.

661
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,570
And I just

662
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:46,410
had a contest with brother’s bodyguard.

663
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:47,690
My power caused side effects.

664
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,290
That’s why I’m like this now.

665
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,150
Really?

666
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,000
Aunt, don’t worry.

667
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,090
I can take care of Feiye.

668
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:58,350
He will be better soon.

669
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,180
Her Highness,

670
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,130
please rest assured.

671
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:01,130
My brother is strong.

672
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:02,050
It’s just a little injury.

673
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,380
He will recover in days.

674
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,860
I hope so.

675
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,320
Mother, relax.

676
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,170
I have Tang Li

677
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:12,020
and Mingxiang here to take care of me.

678
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,220
Don’t worry too much.

679
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,320
You can go back and have a rest now.

680
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:16,870
Alright.

681
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,900
I won’t disturb you anymore.

682
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,450
Have enough rest.

683
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,470
Take good care of Feiye.

684
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:27,900
Yes.

685
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,950
I’ll do my best.

686
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:41,310
Feiye!

687
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:42,840
-Your Highness!
-Brother!

688
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,450
Come on!

689
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,410
Although

690
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:55,050
we failed in this task this time,

691
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:56,130
we made Tianqing

692
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,130
lose father’s trust.

693
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:58,990
Your Highness,

694
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,450
many forces

695
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,360
attended this hijack.

696
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,490
There was even

697
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:04,740
a Gu-infected man.

698
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,820
Gu-infected man?

699
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:07,890
Sir,

700
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:09,820
what did that Gu-infected man look like?

701
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,880
In black with mask.

702
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,270
Red eyes and white hair.

703
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,140
Was he a child about twelve?

704
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:14,780
No.

705
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,150
He looked like an adult.

706
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,450
Was it…

707
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,320
Feiye,

708
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:44,750
are you alright?

709
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,240
I’m fine.

710
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,770
How is it going?

711
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:10,530
Your Majesty,

712
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:11,130
we didn’t find

713
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:12,250
the Poison Master.

714
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,250
Second Prince got hurt,

715
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,450
but it’s not serious.

716
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,700
Useless idiot!

717
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,860
Lock him up!

718
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,610
Don’t let him

719
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:19,070
contact with anyone else!

720
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,570
Find out his relationship with the man

721
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:22,060
who took Poison Master away!

722
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:22,900
Yes!

723
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,400
What about the Gu-infected man?

724
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,190
Where does he come from?

725
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,190
Any clues about that?

726
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,810
Your Majesty,

727
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,200
we didn’t find any clue.

728
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,320
A bunch of crap!

729
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,450
Search for him wherever you can go!

730
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:44,950
Now!

731
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,190
Yes!

732
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:55,740
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

733
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,330
Why is Feiye

734
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:04,610
still not awake?

735
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,700
The time between this

736
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,110
and the last outbreak is too short.

737
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,760
His body is hurt seriously this time.

738
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,400
So it may need

739
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,050
more time

740
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,030
to recover.

741
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,140
It’s all because of Han Yunxi

742
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,190
that Feiye is like this.

743
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:24,730
I will go

744
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:25,690
to make the medicine for Feiye now.

745
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:26,620
Miss Mingxiang,

746
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,650
don’t get carried away.

747
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:30,360
Beauty Blood

748
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,420
is different from normal blood.

749
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,670
You have used too much of your blood

750
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,440
for His Highness’s medicine.

751
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,820
If you do that again,

752
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,790
I’m afraid your life will be in danger.

753
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,480
I have raised Beauty Blood

754
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,390
for years

755
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:48,820
only to

756
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:49,990
help Feiye.

757
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:52,880
If anything happens to him,

758
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,170
there is no point

759
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:55,170
for me to be alive.

760
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,780
Because of this,

761
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:58,780
you should take good care of yourself.

762
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,250
If anything bad happens to you,

763
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,290
no one can help my brother

764
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:02,500
to get rid of the poisonous Gu.
