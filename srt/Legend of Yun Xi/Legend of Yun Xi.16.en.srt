Episode 16

3
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,000
Aren’t you going home?

4
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,840
You want me go?

5
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:25,920
No.

6
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,230
Absolutely not.

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,820
I’m afraid mother will worry about you.

8
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,200
Really?

9
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,860
If you want to go home,

10
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,260
I’ll get the wagon ready.

11
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,320
Not necessary

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,400
I’m staying.

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,760
I’ll make up the guestroom.

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,040
I said

15
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,320
I’m staying here.

16
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,160
Sleep?

17
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,530
Not sleepy.

18
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,480
You sleep.

19
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,959
I guess you’re afraid.

20
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:06,920
I …

21
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,160
What am I afraid of?

22
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,960
Don’t tell me

23
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,280
you’re afraid I’d harass you.

24
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,280
Your Highness,

25
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,920
that’s not funny.

26
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,840
Anyhow I am a woman.

27
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:25,400
Are you?

28
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,700
You don’t take me as a woman.

29
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,090
I don’t take you as a man.

30
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:31,820
Sleep!

31
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:32,840
I’m not afraid.

32
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:38,920
Do not harass me!

33
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,000
Who do you think you are?

34
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,080
Adonis? Apollo?

35
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,440
Aunt.

36
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,930
Your Highness.

37
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:15,800
Aunt.

38
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,020
Don’t do this.

39
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,290
Just be like before.

40
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,290
That can’t do.

41
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,500
His Highness will blame me

42
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,760
if he knows this.

43
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,080
He won’t.

44
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,160
Ruoxue went too far yesterday.

45
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,040
Aunt,

46
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,080
you are the one that brought me up.

47
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:32,600
Aha,

48
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,840
where’s Yunyi?

49
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,740
He

50
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,720
went to school.

51
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,000
I saw everything.

52
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,500
His Highness

53
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,120
was protecting you.

54
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,290
He protects you

55
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,560
because he loves you.

56
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,210
Aha,

57
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,409
I gave you a conception charm.

58
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:56,360
Did you put it under your pillow?

59
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,520
A conception charm?

60
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,000
I…

61
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:03,960
Aunt,

62
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,850
we are too young

63
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:06,800
to use it.

64
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,320
You fool.

65
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,530
Keep it.

66
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,740
Keep it next to your skin.

67
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,170
Look at my Yunyi.

68
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,760
He’s tall and strong.

69
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,260
Aunt,

70
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,000
don’t worry about me.

71
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,280
I have to worry about you.

72
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,690
Look, His Highness loves you,

73
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,880
and you should give him a baby.

74
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,700
A woman with baby

75
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,810
is safe in the family.

76
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,120
Your son is your hope.

77
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,610
It’s no exception in regular families,

78
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,159
let alone Prince Qin’s.

79
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,050
Girls are dreaming to marry

80
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,560
a man like Prince Qin.

81
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,280
Aunt,

82
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,340
I come all the way

83
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,300
back home to you.

84
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,530
Don’t talk about this.

85
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,460
Silly girl,

86
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,900
you have to consider this now.

87
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,680
It’s September 17.

88
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,560
You’ve been a wife for long.

89
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,290
Even if I don’t mention this,

90
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,960
Consort Yi must be expecting.

91
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,260
Aunt,

92
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,530
what date is today?

93
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,760
September 17.

94
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,210
In ten days, right here,

95
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,410
I’ll give you a treat.

96
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,570
Aunt,

97
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,460
I must go now.

98
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,320
Goodbye.

99
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,370
Yunxi! Yunxi!

100
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,170
His Highness is waiting for you.

101
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,160
Hello,

102
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,460
did you see

103
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,370
the man that came here

104
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,330
with me last time?

105
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,360
Lady, finally.

106
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,860
That young man

107
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,720
had been waiting for a whole day.

108
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,720
Thank you.

109
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,520
What a love fool.

110
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,520
Where is Her Highness?

111
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,720
His Highness is waiting.

112
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,960
Sister.

113
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,409
Did she tell you

114
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,730
where she was going?

115
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:00,600
Her Highness just said it was urgent.

116
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,010
Your Highness,

117
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,210
I suppose

118
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,520
she is delayed by something.

119
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,000
Enough. Stop it.

120
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,560
Your Highness,

121
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,960
I advise you may go back alone.

122
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,960
When she comes back,

123
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,920
I will let her know.

124
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,080
Where were you?

125
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,460
I had an appointment

126
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,620
with a friend nearby.

127
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,960
I forgot it.

128
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,970
I went to check whether he’s there.

129
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,880
It took me a while on the way.

130
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,880
Pardon me, Your Highness.

131
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,680
Get in.

132
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,400
Your Highness,

133
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,480
I…

134
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,600
I just realized it.

135
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,230
I’m afraid he’s waiting

136
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,680
and I run to it.

137
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,400
I thought you’d be gone.

138
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,080
It’s a revisit.

139
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,120
How come I go alone?

140
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,360
I’m sorry.

141
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,960
A friend?

142
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,640
Is he important?

143
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,570
He helped me a lot.

144
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,880
I owe him a good thank you.

145
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,400
I remembered it.

146
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,850
Well, Your Highness came with me

147
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,800
and I was excited

148
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,410
and forgot it.

149
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,120
Why?

150
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,930
Don’t you want

151
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,010
me come with you?

152
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,120
No, no!

153
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,540
You came with me

154
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,640
and I’m very happy.

155
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,520
You are

156
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,000
happy leaving me there alone

157
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,650
and you run away?

158
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,520
You’re still angry at me.

159
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,080
How will you forgive me?

160
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,280
Depends on you.

161
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,200
What shall I do?

162
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,120
I’m not smart.

163
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,800
I just

164
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,880
heal poison,

165
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,320
make medicine.

166
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,690
Maybe

167
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,250
I make some invigorators

168
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,200
for you?

169
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:00,720
No.

170
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,520
Why not?

171
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,600
I did it in Mingyue Chamber.

172
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,800
The smell…

173
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,460
Mother scolded me.

174
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,200
I’d better not ask for that.

175
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,720
I’ll make you a new lab.

176
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,440
Really?

177
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,980
Throughout my life,

178
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,400
I never had my own lab.

179
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,280
I visited Han’s lab.

180
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,630
Not as good as the royal lab.

181
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,840
It has a large inventory,

182
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,440
and a large area.

183
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,040
It’s my father’s lab.

184
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,320
I am not allowed to get in.

185
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,960
Just a lab.

186
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,160
Small case.

187
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,880
Back home,

188
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,640
I’ll tell Xifeng

189
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:40,940
to make a lab

190
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,400
exclusively for you.

191
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,520
Great!

192
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,200
Thank you, Your Highness.

193
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,280
Are we free in the afternoon?

194
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,000
Let’s go buy herbs.

195
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,420
Qishao,

196
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,360
you need me?

197
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,290
Take that thing away!

198
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,690
I don’t want it in my room.

199
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,310
Didn’t you smell it?

200
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,040
I smell rabbit everywhere!

201
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,920
That’s White Ear.

202
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,800
I know it.

203
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,420
I said take it away.

204
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,610
Don’t ask why!

205
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,690
You said you wanted it in your room,

206
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,460
it’s your treasure

207
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,120
and we couldn’t even touch it.

208
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,310
I don’t treasure it anymore, alright?

209
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,330
Alright.

210
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,530
It goes to the kitchen. Meat for dinner.

211
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:43,880
As you like.

212
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,690
Qishao, where’re you going?

213
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:46,820
Leave me alone!

214
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,220
What if you’ve a visitor?

215
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,800
Reject him!

216
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,760
Where is Qishao?

217
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,810
I don’t know.

218
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:03,970
He didn’t tell me.

219
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,770
He’s flaming!

220
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,100
I wonder who burned him up.

221
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,620
He didn’t come back last night.

222
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,700
He showed up in the morning with a long face.

223
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,400
It must be because of Princess Qin.

224
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,380
That’s it.

225
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,380
He told me to take White Ear away.

226
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,290
I said we’d eat it and he said as I like.

227
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,620
Seems over the night,

228
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,560
he lost interest in Han Yunxi.

229
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,710
I’ll handle the rabbit now.

230
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,480
Use your head, you fool.

231
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,850
He didn’t mean it.

232
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,530
You’d better not hurt White Ear,

233
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,330
in case he wants it someday,

234
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,360
what do you say?

235
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,780
The Grand Commandant was neutralized.

236
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,370
His Highness

237
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,960
must find it easier in the capital.

238
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,280
Don’t take it lightly.

239
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,620
The Grand Commandant

240
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,330
was an immediate threat.

241
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,520
There are more risks.

242
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,520
The keeper.

243
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,040
General.

244
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,050
Mr. keeper,

245
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,650
why do you come here in a hurry?

246
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,580
Mingxiang

247
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,440
asked to study in school

248
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,010
and mistress approved.

249
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,570
Today Mingxiang said in her letter

250
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,210
that she’s in Prince Qin’s Mansion.

251
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,980
Mistress is anxious at home,

252
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,210
doesn’t know what to do.

253
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,720
She sent me to you, General.

254
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,120
You are the keeper!

255
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,100
When I left home,

256
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,500
I told you to watch her.

257
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,570
How come she ran away?

258
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,030
How did she leave the city?

259
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,460
She took your token.

260
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,170
The guards didn’t know.

261
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,040
So,

262
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,360
they let her through.

263
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,660
My silly daughter

264
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,320
misses Prince Qin.

265
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,640
Don’t worry, General.

266
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,360
She is emotional.

267
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,530
Besides,

268
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,170
she and Prince Qin

269
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,000
grew up together.

270
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,880
If they could be together,

271
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,120
it’s a happy ending.

272
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,090
Not the time.

273
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,810
I know Prince Qin well.

274
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,060
He’s not in the mood

275
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,720
to fancy a woman.

276
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,020
I’m worrying that,

277
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,410
at this critical moment,

278
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,340
if His Majesty knows

279
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,100
Mingxiang is in Prince Qin’s Mansion,

280
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,850
he will doubt it.

281
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,010
If he checks out the relation

282
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,500
between Saibei and Prince Qin,

283
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,960
he might find something.

284
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,050
If this hampers

285
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,520
His Highness’ plan,

286
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,320
it’d be a disaster.

287
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,400
That’s not the point, General.

288
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,970
Mingxiang’s letter says

289
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:33,860
she alone sneaked in

290
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,680
Prince Qin’s Mansion.

291
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,640
Nobody noticed her.

292
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,160
Alright.

293
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,640
Hope so.

294
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,490
But Prince Qin just got married,

295
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,210
if Mingxiang goes to him,

296
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,520
she’ll cause trouble.

297
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,780
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

298
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,000
You’re so sweet.

299
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,880
Feiye.

300
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,700
[Baili Mingxiang, Tianning State]

301
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,620
Brother.

302
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,730
There you are.

303
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:57,960
Mingxiang is here.

304
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,480
Feiye.

305
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,330
Feiye.

306
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,480
You’re back.

307
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,000
Mother.

308
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,300
It just came to my head

309
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,690
that I miss aunt.

310
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,680
I didn’t tell anyone.

311
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,200
Don’t blame me, Feiye.

312
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,480
How could I blame

313
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,120
since you are here?

314
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,810
Sweet girl.

315
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,360
You’re so sweet.

316
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,580
It’s nice that

317
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,440
you’ve had a safe trip.

318
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,570
You should have let me know.

319
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,370
I would have sent Feiye

320
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,800
to pick you up.

321
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,960
Aunt.

322
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,800
Am I not fine?

323
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,320
Besides,

324
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,330
Feiye is too busy.

325
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,850
I won’t take his time.

326
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,770
Mingxiang,

327
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:39,580
I’ve been expecting you

328
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,800
for a long time.

329
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,420
Brother is always busy,

330
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,370
but has the time

331
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,170
to pick you up.

332
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,280
Mingxiang,

333
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,830
are you staying in General’s Mansion?

334
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,210
Actually

335
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,880
I sneaked into the capital.

336
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,090
If His Majesty knows,

337
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:53,770
I’m afraid

338
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,100
it will cause troubles.

339
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,370
So,

340
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,100
aunt, please give me a shelter.

341
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,880
Certainly I will.

342
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,290
You came to me

343
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,050
and will stay with me.

344
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,480
It was too long.

345
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,460
Aunt misses you.

346
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,160
I miss aunt, too.

347
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,680
And…

348
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,119
and Feiye.

349
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,359
Stay as long as you like.

350
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,440
Yes.

351
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,880
Is this Feiye’s…?

352
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,560
Feiye,

353
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,319
Mingxiang is tired.

354
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,640
Show her the bedroom.

355
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,410
Mingxiang,

356
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,960
Dress up,

357
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,970
they will prepare you

358
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,090
a welcome supper.

359
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,360
Thank you, aunt.

360
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,920
You know who she is?

361
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,880
Who is she?

362
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,810
She is the one that

363
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,370
grew up with my brother.

364
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:08,040
Her name is Mingxiang.

365
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,930
So what?

366
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,480
I am Princess Qin!

367
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,600
Han Yunxi.

368
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,540
Don't get

369
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,420
carried away by my brother’s

370
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,550
escorting you home.

371
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,410
Mingxiang is back now.

372
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,860
She is the woman

373
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,320
that deserves my brother.

374
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,320
Beautiful and virtuous.

375
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,680
Not like you.

376
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,200
Who the hell…

377
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,610
Mr. Gu,

378
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,340
it’s urgent.

379
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,320
I need your help.

380
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,010
Leave us.

381
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:46,760
Yes.

382
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,340
Mr. Gu,

383
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,520
I got information.

384
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,950
Long Tianqing aims at Concubine Qing.

385
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,170
Should I report

386
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,250
father and get

387
00:18:59,250 --> 00:18:59,940
Long Tianqing and

388
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,610
Noble Consort Xiao condemned?

389
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,500
Is your information reliable?

390
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,440
Absolutely.

391
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,530
It came from

392
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,010
my uncle’s spy.

393
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,280
And I learned that

394
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,100
Long Tianqing was involved in

395
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,080
the book case.

396
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,480
I see.

397
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,770
May I ask

398
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,090
why you are shillyshally?

399
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,460
Father is cold with me

400
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,720
because of uncle.

401
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:18,850
And he

402
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:19,890
has Long Tianqing

403
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,440
handle all court affairs.

404
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,320
I’ve got information that

405
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,300
Long Tianqing hasn’t acted yet.

406
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,080
I’d like to

407
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,520
consult Mr. Gu.

408
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,480
I see.

409
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,320
I advise

410
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,720
Your Highness hold back for now.

411
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,090
First of all, you don’t have hard evidence

412
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,040
that Prince Tianqing will do it.

413
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,100
And,

414
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,520
even if he does,

415
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,410
the harem is a forbidden area

416
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,410
and only his mother gets involved.

417
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,180
If Noble Consort Xiao is beaten,

418
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,330
it does not bring You Highness

419
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,840
any actual benefits.

420
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,170
Should I throw away

421
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,170
the opportunity?

422
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,640
No, I shouldn’t.

423
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,440
Your Highness, you don’t have to.

424
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,600
You will take the opportunity

425
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,710
to do Concubine Qing a favor

426
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,960
and maximize your benefits.

427
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,480
What do you mean?

428
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,020
Prince Tianqing

429
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,680
is setting up Concubine Qing.

430
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,050
It must be a harem war

431
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,640
between the two women.

432
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,370
Noble Consort Xiao

433
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,120
is now at the disadvantage.

434
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,370
Am I right?

435
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,720
Mr. Gu,

436
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,000
you’re right.

437
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,980
The harem rumor goes that

438
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,660
father gives Concubine Qing exclusive favor.

439
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,850
Concubine Qing

440
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,480
is the princess of Xiqiu,

441
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,640
but is alone in Tianning.

442
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,060
Your Highness, you may

443
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,440
bribe her as the crown prince.

444
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,380
Concubine Qing

445
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,090
has too much favor.

446
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:42,980
She will

447
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,560
give you great help.

448
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,440
You need each other.

449
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,690
Xiqiu

450
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,520
is indeed home to beauties.

451
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,660
Concubine Qing’s gifts

452
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,060
are indeed fascinating.

453
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,410
Concubine Qing is so good to you.

454
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,300
She came to visit you

455
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,530
and then sent a big case of

456
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,720
Xiqiu dresses.

457
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,680
You look gorgeous, princess.

458
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,920
Really?

459
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,980
Yes.

460
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,860
And your face

461
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,170
is healed and

462
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,530
the facial cream

463
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,580
makes it rosy.

464
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,600
You look even more beautiful.

465
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,940
I hope

466
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,850
Qingwu could soon come

467
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:27,840
to the palace.

468
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:28,970
I want him

469
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,560
take a look at me.

470
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,170
Are you laughing at me?

471
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,660
Are you laughing at me?

472
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,050
General Mu will like it.

473
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:37,850
Who

474
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,710
will like my beautiful princess?

475
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,760
Brother.

476
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,740
What brings you here, brother?

477
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,380
My beautiful princess is ill,

478
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,910
his brother must visit her.

479
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,530
You’re always so sweet to me.

480
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,440
Come over, let me check.

481
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:53,840
See?

482
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,420
Brother,

483
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,360
am I beautiful in this?

484
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,560
Even more beautiful.

485
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,290
But the dress does not

486
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:03,730
look like

487
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,160
from Tianning.

488
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,770
You’ve got sharp eyes.

489
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,410
It’s a gift from Concubine Qing.

490
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,600
She’s so good.

491
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,610
She gave me many gifts

492
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,340
and came to accompany me often.

493
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,800
I’ve heard it.

494
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,420
Your face was hurt

495
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,500
and Concubine Qing’s Blood Jade

496
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,570
healed it.

497
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:20,740
I’ve got you

498
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,500
some presents.

499
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,640
You will need them.

500
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,420
You will visit her

501
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,940
and extend your appreciation.

502
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,960
Thank you.

503
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,580
They are local products

504
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,410
of Xiqiu.

505
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,090
Concubine Qing

506
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,750
has too many valuable things.

507
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,170
These may help

508
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,680
to cure her homesick.

509
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,170
You’re so considerate.

510
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,210
I was wondering

511
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,530
what I could give her.

512
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:39,770
Your messenger came to me

513
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:40,970
asking what products Xiqiu has.

514
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,120
I figured it out.

515
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,120
I have a brilliant brother.

516
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,780
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

517
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,880
We’re going to buy herbs,

518
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,150
and you are infatuated with a girl.

519
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,640
Han Yunxi,

520
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,880
I advise you not wait.

521
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:17,900
My brother

522
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,420
doesn’t have time for you today.

523
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,280
You’d better be aware of the fact.

524
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:25,200
What fact? I’m reading a book.

525
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,500
You have amazing eyesight,

526
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,100
reading a book upside-down.

527
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,370
Know which way the wind blows.

528
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,460
Be aware of the fact.

529
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,090
I advise

530
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,550
you go back to the Hans now.

531
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,370
Yunxi is your brother’s

532
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,660
lawfully wedded wife.

533
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,700
You and Baili Mingxiang

534
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,200
shall be aware of the fact.

535
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,850
Wedded or not wedded,

536
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:48,530
my brother did not

537
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,720
want to wed her.

538
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,320
Say it again!

539
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,860
Say it again!

540
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,500
Believe or not believe,

541
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,370
I’ll beat you to the ground.

542
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,170
Let me go!

543
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:56,730
No.

544
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:57,680
-Let go!
-No.

545
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,810
She is lawfully wedded.

546
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:00,810
You and your brother

547
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,010
should know the fact.

548
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,050
That hurts!

549
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,210
Let me go!

550
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:04,880
Let me go!

551
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,680
Enough!

552
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,500
Look at you two.

553
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,560
Again?

554
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,250
Listen up!

555
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,420
Do not harass Yunxi again!

556
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,700
Or I’ll punch you in the nose.

557
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,660
No one knows who will be punched!

558
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,360
You…

559
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,230
Worrying about him?

560
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,090
If you worry about him,

561
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,940
then why are you waiting here alone?

562
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,280
Here came your enemy.

563
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,500
You should stick like

564
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,520
a glue to him.

565
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,050
You are his

566
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,720
lawfully wedded wife.

567
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,460
Baili Mingxiang

568
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,000
is just a relative,

569
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,610
daughter of his officer.

570
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,800
Don’t give in.

571
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,060
Seems that

572
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,440
mother likes Miss Baili.

573
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,730
She’s her niece.

574
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:48,330
Consort Yi

575
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,610
has known her as a baby.

576
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,040
Certainly she likes her.

577
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,200
Seems that

578
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,420
His Highness

579
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,680
likes Miss Baili, too.

580
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,060
Seems!

581
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,680
You said seems.

582
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,170
It’s not for sure.

583
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:01,730
Don’t let

584
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,480
the “seems” bother you.

585
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,410
I think you two are getting along

586
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,600
quite well.

587
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,210
As the phrase goes,

588
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,520
first come first served.

589
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,280
You live with him every day.

590
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,030
You have the advantage.

591
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,600
I bet on you.

592
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,460
Since you worry,

593
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,200
go have a look.

594
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,920
I’d better not.

595
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,250
Why?

596
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:30,930
My room

597
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,200
is right there.

598
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,480
I’m going to my own room.

599
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:36,960
Right.

600
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,010
Your Highness, the room’s ready.

601
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:44,840
Leave us.

602
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,360
-Yes.
-Yes.

603
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,640
Whatever you need,

604
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,160
tell the maids.

605
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,490
Feiye,

606
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:00,840
I’m not a stranger.

607
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,720
Why do you come to the capital?

608
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,900
You’ve sent me

609
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,780
an infected kid.

610
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,480
The kid died.

611
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,930
It’s urgent.

612
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,170
I have to come

613
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:16,800
and let you know.

614
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,560
You just need

615
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,080
to send a coded message.

616
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,440
You’re not well.

617
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,140
You shouldn’t have come.

618
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,770
Because

619
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:25,460
you gave him

620
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,200
the Gu-poison suppressor.

621
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,850
I worry about your health.

622
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,440
I must come.

623
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,010
Feiye,

624
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:33,280
Don’t worry about me.

625
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,520
Mingxiang,

626
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,560
how is your health?

627
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,160
I’m fine.

628
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,420
The Beauty Blood

629
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,930
will be ready in two months.

630
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,320
I can save you.

631
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,490
The Beauty Blood cures poisons.

632
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:47,800
Anyway it’s a tale.

633
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,560
Han Yunxi is a good healer.

634
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,920
I will

635
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,530
ask her to diagnose you.

636
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,480
No!

637
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,530
I’ve taken so many pains

638
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,050
to heal your poison.

639
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,760
I’ll never give up.

640
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,480
Feiye,

641
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,120
I’ll heal you.

642
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,010
That’s what I’m living for.

643
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:05,780
You will let me

644
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,920
heal your poison.

645
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:10,840
Mingxiang,

646
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,520
calm down.

647
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,820
Or the poison will break out.

648
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,200
Promise me! Promise me!

649
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,520
Yunxi,

650
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,830
there must be something wrong.

651
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,480
Terrible show.

652
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,640
Yunxi, Yunxi.

653
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,040
He…

654
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,520
He messed it up. He always does.

655
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,160
Brother,

656
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,800
I can’t help you.

657
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,400
Good luck.

658
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,350
You broke your word.

659
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,290
That’s alright.

660
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,890
You took a girl in your arms

661
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,220
and didn’t explain why.

662
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,380
Forget it.

663
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,200
I do not care.

664
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,640
Sleep.

665
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,400
Sleep.

666
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,200
Mingxiang,

667
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,300
my brother

668
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,450
always mentioned you.

669
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,720
He misses you.

670
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,690
Come on.

671
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:22,820
You’re pleasing me.

672
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,410
That was true.

673
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:25,530
Ask him.

674
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,050
Brother,

675
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,200
am I right?

676
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,100
Feiye,

677
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,410
Tang Li was lying.

678
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:31,520
Punish him.

679
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,050
It was true.

680
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,280
I didn’t tell a lie.

681
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,080
How come you don’t believe me!

682
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,720
Noisy!

683
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,440
Wake up?

684
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,680
Ningjing,

685
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,080
why are you here?

686
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,060
Your enemy is there

687
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,680
and you’re sleeping.

688
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,420
Men or women

689
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,770
-have to sleep.
-Hey!

690
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,760
Are you telling me you give up?

691
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,520
What can I do?

692
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,570
Shall I kick her out?

693
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:05,890
Mother would know it

694
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:07,440
and I would be kicked out.

695
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,410
You can’t watch it happen,

696
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,280
can you?

697
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,500
Take it.

698
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,440
Wash yourself.

699
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,230
Listen to me.

700
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,700
That Baili Mingxiang

701
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:20,080
is not pretty at all.

702
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,640
You’re prettier.

703
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:23,140
But she makes up herself.

704
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:23,870
Listen to me.

705
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,400
You need just a little makeup

706
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,740
and you’ll overshadow her.

707
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,690
And brother will

708
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,020
neglect her existence.

709
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,420
You are a princess.

710
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,040
Are these all your jewelry?

711
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,480
Fortunately I knew it.

712
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,280
You…

713
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,770
These…

714
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,520
You have so many jewelries.

715
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,720
I have a rich father.

716
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,330
My father does nothing

717
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:56,250
but making money.

718
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:56,930
Every year

719
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:57,650
he pays huge money

720
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,800
for my tuition.

721
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,460
You come here for Tang Li

722
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,880
and take so many jewelries with you?

723
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,210
Before you make it,

724
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,330
get prepared for it.

725
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,680
Maybe I have to tempt him.

726
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,640
You know what tempt mean?

727
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,880
Are you an idiot?

728
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,410
To tempt means to make up,

729
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,610
make yourself pretty,

730
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:23,880
and attractive.

731
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,210
Idiot!

732
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,450
Get up!

733
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:31,160
Come over.

734
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,800
Take time.

735
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,040
Listen to me.

736
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,400
Sit down.

737
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,400
Come on!

738
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,280
Come on!

739
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,730
Miss Han,

740
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:20,720
good morning.

741
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,780
Would you like to join us?

742
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,760
We’ve had breakfast.

743
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,640
Would you like some?

744
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,520
She’s not Miss Han.

745
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,970
Yunxi is

746
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:34,460
Princess Qin.

747
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,370
Why?

748
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,000
Are you her maid?

749
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,280
Ningjing, stop it.

750
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,460
Mingxiang,

751
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,800
you’ll take my seat.

752
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,760
Tang Li,

753
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,200
sit down.

754
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:53,770
Ningjing,

755
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:54,720
I didn’t mean it.

756
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,650
I thought Yunxi

757
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:57,580
might be hungry.

758
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,050
If Miss Han doesn’t like,

759
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:01,480
I won’t mention it.

760
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,410
What’s more,

761
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,420
aunt says again and again

762
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,080
that I can take here as home.

763
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,120
This is my style.

764
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,730
Miss Han,

765
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,200
hope you don’t mind.

766
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,600
Miss Baili, I don’t.

767
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,040
Anyway,

768
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,790
Ningjing was right.

769
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,840
I have married Prince Qin

770
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,000
and I am not Miss Han.

771
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,320
Since His Highness is your brother,

772
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,410
you may call me sister-in-law.

773
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,610
Yes.

774
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:29,800
Sister-in-law sounds good.

775
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,250
Shame on you!

776
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,860
Brother hasn’t accepted you.

777
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,790
Accepted or not, I’m Princess Qin.

778
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,280
Your Highness,

779
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,690
you and I have to bear each other

780
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,280
for the rest of our lives.

781
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,480
Hey, Tang Li,

782
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,420
my father sent a letter.

783
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,960
He and I will write back.

784
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,060
I’m not going.

785
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,000
Yes, you are.

786
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,050
-I, I, I’m not.
-You are.

787
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,120
I… You…

788
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,570
Tang Li and Ningjing

789
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,960
are as usual.

790
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,480
Feiye,

791
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,530
I guess Tang Li

792
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,190
still doesn’t like Ningjing.

793
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,980
He doesn’t want to marry her.

794
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:10,770
The two of them

795
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,170
don’t love each other.

796
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:13,650
Putting them together

797
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:15,090
will make them hate each other.

798
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,520
They won’t be happy.

799
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,210
Happy or not happy,

800
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:20,610
they will make a choice.

801
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:21,460
Happy or not happy,

802
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,080
it’s their own choice.

803
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:24,760
It’s none of your business.

804
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,770
Yunxi

805
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,080
did make some sense.

806
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,889
Feiye,

807
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:31,840
what do you say?

808
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,469
Where are you going?

809
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:43,070
We made an appointment to buy herbs today.

810
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,500
Nice, I’m buying herbs, too.

811
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,560
Let’s go together.

812
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,800
No.

813
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,160
Yunxi… what’s wrong?

814
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,890
We had an appointment first.

815
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:13,730
She comes

816
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,260
and you forget everything.

817
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,880
I hate you, Long Feiye.

818
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,280
Han Yunxi,

819
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,290
you marry him for your purpose.

820
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:23,090
Are you qualified to be jealous?

821
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,480
You can’t say that.

822
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,280
With or without purpose,

823
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,120
she’s Long Feiye’s wife.

824
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,730
A wife is jealous for her husband.

825
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,960
It’s natural!

826
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,810
I don’t think

827
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:35,330
he takes her as his wife.

828
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:36,990
He may divorce her at any time.

829
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,760
I don’t agree.

830
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:39,890
Remember when

831
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:41,220
they were in Han’s Mansion?

832
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,760
He protected Han Yunxi.

833
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,560
He protected the dignity of a prince.

834
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,090
If he doesn’t care about her,

835
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,210
he may not have gone there.

836
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:50,420
Why did he go after her?

837
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,090
For show?

838
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:53,770
It was so real.

839
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:55,500
Why hasn’t he been a performer?

840
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,960
I can’t do this.

841
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,990
I need a walk around.

842
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,400
Or I will go crazy.

843
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:05,520
Right,

844
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,080
Gu Qishao.

845
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,570
I haven’t apologized for

846
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:10,100
breaking the appointment.

847
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,480
Private property!

848
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,370
Sisters,

849
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:24,220
I’ve had an appointment with Qishao

850
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,570
but I missed it.

851
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:27,810
I come to say sorry to Qishao.

852
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,000
I owe him an apology.

853
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,500
Who knows if you’re not coming

854
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,560
to steal the herbs?

855
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,610
I’m not!

856
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,760
Private property!

857
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,600
Intruders die!

858
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,960
Stop!

859
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,720
-Qishao.
-Qishao.

860
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,080
I don’t want to see this again.

861
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,840
Or you should just go home.

862
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,720
Leave us.

863
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,600
Qishao,

864
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,720
are you angry?

865
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,880
Who could be angry at you?

866
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,610
I went there yesterday.

867
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,000
But you were gone.

868
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,560
I’m sorry. Sorry.

869
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,700
Alright. I may not be angry,

870
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,570
but,

871
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:10,680
it depends on you.

872
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,360
Me?

873
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,970
You want me to

874
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:16,170
give you a good treat,

875
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,680
or buy you some gift?

876
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,210
Tie up your purse.

877
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,290
Show sincerity.

878
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:21,040
Sincerity?

879
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,040
I have. I have plenty.

880
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,320
Follow me.

881
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,840
White Ear!

882
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,120
You grow up.

883
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:42,880
This way.

884
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,930
You won’t make me

885
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:49,730
cook for you, will you?

886
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:50,790
I know you can cook.

887
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:51,520
Come on,

888
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,760
show me your sincerity.

889
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,800
Alright.

890
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,080
Just a meal.

891
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,160
Make a good meal.

892
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,600
I’m a picky eater.

893
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,170
If it’s not good,

894
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:04,210
I won’t buy it.

895
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,210
Sure.

896
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,890
I’m making my favorite dishes.

897
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,200
You’ll love them.

898
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,110
Light the fire, please.

899
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,890
You make meal for me

900
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:13,890
and I have to work?

901
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,620
Be a part of it.

902
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,850
You’ll get bored watching.

903
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:18,520
Go.

904
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,280
Baisu, see it?

905
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,370
In his life, Qishao never

906
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,840
goes to the kitchen.

907
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,800
He’s lighting the fire.

908
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,370
Princess Qin

909
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,600
has an huge effect on him.

910
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,480
Hope it’s a good effect.

911
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,940
Thanks heaven I didn’t kill the rabbit.

912
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,360
Done.

913
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,680
Your face.

914
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,570
You…

915
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,280
It’s just lighting a fire.

916
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,650
No wonder

917
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:04,810
a noble gentleman

918
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,120
never works.

919
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,990
Don’t make fun of me.

920
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,720
You’re doing well.

921
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,320
You always cook?

922
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,440
Of course.

923
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,200
For Prince Qin?

924
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,400
No.

925
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:18,810
He has plenty of

926
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,170
maids and servants.

927
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,410
I don’t have to.

928
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:22,400
Besides,

929
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,410
everyone in his mansion

930
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,410
doesn’t like me.

931
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:25,410
And someone I don’t like

932
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,610
just came.

933
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,760
So I escape to here.

934
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,280
How do you know Prince Qin?

935
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,370
Everyone in the capital

936
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:38,440
knows Prince Qin,

937
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,440
and Princess Qin, Han Yunxi.

938
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,050
It’s said Han Yunxi

939
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,570
had a terrible sore on her face before,

940
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,520
and now is a beautiful woman.

941
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:50,760
Thank you.

942
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,660
[Qinghui Hall]

943
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,050
Your Grace.

944
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,370
I was bored.

945
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:02,500
It’s nice to have you,

946
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,960
princess, to kill my time.

947
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:04,840
My time, too.

948
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,680
Lyuluo,

949
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,690
bring the case

950
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:08,880
to Her Highness.

951
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,570
The crown prince

952
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:15,690
helped me choose the gift.

953
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:17,050
Your Highness,

954
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:17,980
do you like them?

955
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,660
They’re the products

956
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,520
from Xiqiu.

957
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,620
My appreciation to the crown prince.

958
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,280
It’s good you like them.

959
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,250
Actually

960
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,650
I don’t have a decent gift,

961
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,540
I have to ask help from the crown prince.

962
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,770
He said that

963
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:36,720
Xiqiu has superb craftsmanship.

964
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,150
They can be dismantled and assembled.

965
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,850
He said they may

966
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:42,330
help Your Highness

967
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:43,320
kill time.

968
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,730
Thank you, princess.

969
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:45,850
Please send my regards

970
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:46,980
to the crown prince.

971
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,770
I haven’t seen you for long.

972
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:50,450
Princess,

973
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:51,910
would you like a meal here?

974
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,760
Great.

975
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,280
Come on,

976
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,520
cheers!

977
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,560
Good wine.

978
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,440
Qishao,

979
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,410
people say

980
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:09,090
you’ll find all herbs

981
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:10,090
in Yaogui Valley.

982
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:10,840
Qishao,

983
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,610
look at your herbs.

984
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:14,200
I am jealous.

985
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,570
You like them?

986
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:16,810
Of course.

987
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:18,690
This is really a paradise.

988
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:19,280
Come on.

989
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,880
To you.

990
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:26,490
Poison girl,

991
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:27,890
I’ll show you something.

992
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,410
I made a special

993
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:31,410
container

994
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:32,840
of facial lotion.

995
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,200
How is it?

996
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,890
Looks special.

997
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:36,920
Any implication?

998
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,200
Yes, of course.

999
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:39,810
The idea

1000
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:41,120
comes from you.

1001
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,930
You were an ugly duckling before,

1002
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:44,130
now a beautiful swan.

1003
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:44,970
So,

1004
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:45,770
I asked the craftsmen

1005
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,250
to make the facial brush

1006
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,400
in the shape of a swan.

1007
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,850
It implies

1008
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:54,040
the magnificent, graceful transformation

1009
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,440
of a woman.

1010
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,160
It’ll be a best seller.

1011
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,730
If it is,

1012
00:41:58,730 --> 00:41:59,680
I ask for a share.

1013
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,530
You’ll have it.

1014
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:02,720
To you.

1015
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,360
Watch it.

1016
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,440
It has strong aftereffect.

1017
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,320
I won’t carry you back.

1018
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:10,810
Don’t underestimate me.

1019
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:11,890
I’m a good drinker.

1020
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:12,520
Cheers!
