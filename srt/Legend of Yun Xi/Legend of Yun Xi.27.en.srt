Candy.

00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,300
Good, good.

5
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,220
He needs the cure now

6
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,390
or he’ll die.

[Qinzheng Hall]

8
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,500
Father!

9
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:16,850
Father!

10
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,010
Father, please show mercy!

11
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,550
Mother was just confusing!

12
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,280
Father!

13
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,200
Confusing?

14
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,570
That’s one way to say it!

15
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,820
She took this palace as a slaughterhouse!

16
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,570
She sacrificed my children!

17
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,570
And you just told me

18
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,240
it was a moment of confusion?

19
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,650
No, no!

20
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,610
It was a slip of the tongue.

21
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,360
I know

22
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,180
she committed a heinous crime.

23
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:42,990
But father,

24
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,820
she did it because she

25
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,990
loves you too much

26
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,990
and was too afraid of losing you.

27
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,110
I beg you to go easy on her.

28
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,740
I'm willing to take the blame for mother.

29
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,800
Please show mercy!

30
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,240
You know

31
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,450
if it wasn’t

32
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,150
for the sake of giving birth to you,

33
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,410
Noble Consort Xiao now

34
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,070
would be dead!

35
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,900
You would never get the chance

36
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,280
to plead with me here!

37
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,449
Father.

38
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,030
Just as you love me,

39
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,650
I'm too afraid

40
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,540
to lose you and my mother as well.

41
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,110
Please show mercy!

42
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,320
Please show mercy!

43
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,990
Please show mercy!

44
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,950
Please show mercy!

45
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,200
Please show mercy!

46
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,079
Your Majesty.

47
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,360
Second Prince's forehead

48
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,610
is about to get hurt.

49
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,610
Please show mercy!

50
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,650
-Enough.
-Please show mercy!

51
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,530
Stand up.

52
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,360
Second Prince.

53
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,670
Please stand up.

54
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,990
Listen to me.

55
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,600
Your mother is your mother.

56
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,320
You are you.

57
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,030
I

58
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,320
am not going to

59
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,510
blame you for your mother’s mistake.

60
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,150
From now on,

61
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,190
do what you should do.

62
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,360
Stop begging for

63
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,150
your mother.

64
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,630
Understand?

65
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:25,820
Mother should not

66
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,700
be in danger.

67
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,480
I can’t be impulsive.

68
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,320
When I make my contribution,

69
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,110
mother will be out

70
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,990
of Cold Palace.

71
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,280
Thank you, father.

72
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,460
How is it going with Poison Master?

73
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,530
I’ve increased men power.

74
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,150
It's all going very well.

75
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:49,820
Come here.

76
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,610
Yes.

77
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,900
Listen up, everyone.

78
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:58,950
From today,

79
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,900
my brother is going to practice in seclusion.

80
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,450
You shall enhance the guard.

81
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,190
Yes!

82
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,570
You're the only ones here?

83
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:22,860
To kill Tianning men

84
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,320
is like stepping on an ant.

85
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,150
We are

86
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,530
selected warriors.

87
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,450
One can against one hundred.

88
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,530
We’re not cowards

89
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,700
like you.

90
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,470
How dare you!

91
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,190
You are so rude!

92
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,320
They are warriors.

93
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,570
So they must be good at martial arts.

94
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,700
Behave yourself.

95
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,600
Glad you can read the air.

96
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,190
Did you find Poison Master?

97
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,330
Right on time.

98
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,400
Prince Qin is in seclusion.

99
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,070
I can lead you there to get Poison Master now.

100
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,860
Good!

101
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,110
How is it?

102
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,030
Same old.

103
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,480
Not getting any better.

104
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,860
Didn’t we order them to pretend to loosen up,

105
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,700
lure the spies in

106
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,780
and then take them all?

107
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,360
Looks like they are not spies.

108
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,150
Someone can’t hold

109
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:29,990
any longer.

110
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,010
Tang Li and Xifeng.

111
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,280
Come with me.

112
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:34,780
Yes.

113
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,130
I’m coming, too.

114
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,280
The most important job for you now

115
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,200
is to cure him.

116
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,820
What if they use poison?

117
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,060
You bring me with you.

118
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,740
Listen to me. Stay here.

119
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,060
It’s a trap!

120
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,150
If it wasn’t for you,

121
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,860
His Highness wouldn’t become a Gu-infected man.

122
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,190
It’s all because of you!

123
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,400
How did you get this bracelet?

124
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,150
You’re awake.

125
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,360
Who is Lady Tianxin to you?

126
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,920
So you really were faking it.

127
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:18,860
No.

128
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,050
Someone gets here first.

129
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:30,960
Watch out!

130
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,320
Baisu!

131
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,070
Baisu! Baisu!

132
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,110
-Let’s go!
-Go!

133
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,490
-Take them!
-Yes!

134
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,530
Uncle.

135
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,250
Tianqing.

136
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,220
I heard you were assassinated.

137
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,150
So I came here to capture the assassins

138
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,200
and protect you.

139
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,480
Brother.

140
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,040
The assassins have all been eliminated.

141
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,490
You heard the man.

142
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,170
The assassins have all been slain.

143
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,290
You don't have to worry about it.

144
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,610
Just now I saw

145
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,240
several assassins running out.

146
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,320
I guess

147
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,990
you didn't catch them all.

148
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,110
Let me help you with that.

149
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,400
Search it.

150
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,990
Brother.

151
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:51,860
Tianqing.

152
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:58,990
That's where I keep

153
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,650
my most important prisoners.

154
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:02,530
Really?

155
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,070
Well, I'd like to see.

156
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,400
Yunxi!

157
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,780
Yunxi!

158
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,740
Yunxi.

159
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:03,490
Yunxi!

160
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,360
Uncle.

161
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,430
Your Highness.

162
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,600
Your Highness.

163
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,110
This is where Her Highness

164
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,310
treats her patients.

165
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,650
Excuse me.

166
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,230
Baisu, it’s alright.

167
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,560
You’ll be fine.

168
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,110
Qishao.

169
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,240
I’m dying.

170
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,490
Baisu! Baisu! Baisu!

171
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,400
I failed you.

172
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,780
I thought

173
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,780
after this is done,

174
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,970
I would find a good family for you.

175
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,150
I didn’t protect you.

176
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,240
I’m sorry.

177
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,030
I’m sorry.

178
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,860
Don’t beat yourself up.

179
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,670
You can’t bring the dead back to life.

180
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,080
I promise you.

181
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,200
I'll avenge you.

182
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,950
Long Tianqing.

183
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,360
Wait for it!

184
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,070
Good thing is it’s just some knockout drops.

185
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,400
No other effect.

186
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,780
[Yujing Chamber]

187
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,390
Your Highness.

188
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,560
Your Highness.

189
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,780
What’s wrong?

190
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,830
They say a man chose wife over his mother.

191
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,280
Look at Feiye,

192
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,160
he’s so worried about Han Yunxi.

193
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,360
He has never worried about

194
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,700
me that much.

195
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:08,390
Your Highness.

196
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,530
Don’t be jealous like that.

197
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,320
You’re noble.

198
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,950
Since His Highness has grown up,

199
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,610
he has never let you suffered.

200
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,900
The way you put it,

201
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,000
I feel aggrieved for His Highness.

202
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,190
Do you think Feiye

203
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,820
really likes Han Yunxi?

204
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,140
His Highness has never been

205
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,070
the same close

206
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,070
to other women.

207
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:33,230
Never mind.

208
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,860
I’m not satisfied

209
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,110
with Han Yunxi.

210
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,400
But it’s fine as long as Feiye likes her.

211
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:42,650
It’s hard

212
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,780
to find someone you like

213
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,030
who likes you back.

214
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,400
It’s harder to love each other

215
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,740
for the rest of life.

216
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,400
I’ll leave them alone.

217
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,400
Baisu.

218
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,650
I’m sorry.

219
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,190
I let you die in a foreign land.

220
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,500
I promise you,

221
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,610
I’ll avenge you.

222
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,320
When we got there,

223
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,820
the Poison Master was taken away.

224
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,070
What a clever trick!

225
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,240
He got away with it after all.

226
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,060
Your Highness.

227
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,800
Now is not the time to complain.

228
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,070
Our priority

229
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,530
is to keep this quiet.

230
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
We can’t let His Majesty

231
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,860
know about this.

232
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,280
Otherwise,

233
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,570
we’ll risk losing

234
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,610
the trust we've just earned.

235
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,660
Pass the word.

236
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,030
Everyone keeps their mouths shut about this.

237
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,320
Anyone who talks

238
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,900
will be killed!

239
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,070
And,

240
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,190
I want every man I've got.

241
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,570
I’m going to level the Yaogui Valley.

242
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:01,630
No, Your Highness!

243
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,030
Yaogui Valley is also

244
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:05,950
looking into the whereabouts of Poison Master.

245
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,069
We could use them.

246
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:07,950
All we need then

247
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,319
is to put an extra set of eyes

248
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,190
on them.

249
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:11,450
And that way,

250
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,240
we could have one more crew

251
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,030
to help us find Poison Master.

252
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,490
That's a good point.

253
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,859
I'll leave the matter to you.

254
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:21,450
Yes.

255
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,700
I must find Poison Master

256
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,860
to regain my father's trust,

257
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,820
and trample all those

258
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,150
who despise me!

259
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:13,780
I made

260
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,030
the better medicine myself.

261
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:18,740
Leader.

262
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,450
Why did you want me

263
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,770
to take Princess Qin?

264
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,320
Back then,

265
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,820
in the dungeon, I met Tianxin again,

266
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:28,950
and she told me

267
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,190
we had a daughter.

268
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,570
That day,

269
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,240
I saw

270
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,900
the bracelet of Han Yunxi

271
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,740
which is exactly the love token

272
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,780
of us.

273
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,990
There's a good chance

274
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,440
that she's my daughter.

275
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,740
Princess Qin

276
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,020
is indeed the daughter of Lady Tianxin.

277
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,900
But she is the daughter of Lady Tianxin

278
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,430
and Physician Han Cong'an.

279
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,030
Is she

280
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,990
really your daughter?

281
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,220
You had contact with her?

282
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,010
We know each other.

283
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:00,950
Good.

284
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,340
Bring her back to Heaven Pit,

285
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,530
and test her with Poison Beast,

286
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,900
then we shall know if she is my daughter.

287
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,200
Yes.

288
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,950
It’s just

289
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,240
the Prince Qin’s Mansion is heavily guarded.

290
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,170
And Princess Qin

291
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,650
is always with Prince Qin.

292
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,240
I think

293
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,050
we should wait and plan this well.

294
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:28,070
I’ve been waiting for more than ten years.

295
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,180
I don’t mind waiting more days.

296
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,190
Leader,

297
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,610
there is another thing.

298
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,900
The spies of Prince Qin

299
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,230
are getting close to us.

300
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,740
Leader,

301
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,900
shall we consider give the Heaven Pit up

302
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,630
and find another hiding place?

303
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:44,900
Heaven Pit

304
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,540
has been my life's work for over a decade.

305
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,190
They can’t get in for now.

306
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,030
Bring Han Yunxi

307
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,360
and test her.

308
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:56,030
We’ll think about others later.

309
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:58,820
Yes.

310
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,610
Your Majesty, why do you look worried?

311
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,450
It’s because my

312
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,150
two stupid sons.

313
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,610
They worry Your Majesty again.

314
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,150
The Crown Prince is indecisive

315
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,800
and cannot shoulder big job.

316
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,150
The Second Prince is too selfish.

317
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,120
He is even keeping me in the dark.

318
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,110
Hasn't Tianqing

319
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,450
been working very hard

320
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,240
to help Your Majesty?

321
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,990
The one to blame

322
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,490
is his evil mother.

323
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,930
You don’t know the story.

324
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,200
A few days ago,

325
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,200
Prince Qin had a fight with an unknown master

326
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,780
in Serene Chamber.

327
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,950
Such a big matter,

328
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,950
yet he was afraid I would blame him,

329
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,320
so he kept it a secret.

330
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,900
At the end of the day,

331
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,700
Your Majesty is worried about Prince Qin.

332
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,450
Prince Qin’s parentage is uncertain.

333
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,860
How can I rest easy?

334
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:33,280
There's one person who knows

335
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:37,280
his identity is real or not.

336
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,900
Consort Yi?

337
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,030
Qishao.

338
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,030
Any word

339
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,040
from Chu Qingge?

340
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,280
You are clever.

341
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,220
I just got a tip from the source.

342
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,240
Chu Qingge has made her move

343
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,500
on Noble Consort Xiao.

344
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,490
Good.

345
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,320
Then tell Chu Qingge

346
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,200
to find a way

347
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,200
to kill Long Tianqing.

348
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,030
I must

349
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,790
avenge Baisu’s death.

350
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,230
Where is Poison Master?

351
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,450
We didn’t make it.

352
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,530
Didn’t make it?

353
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,460
What about the men I sent you?

354
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,150
They're all dead.

355
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,240
They're all dead?

356
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,200
I sent you

357
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,900
the best warriors of Beili,

358
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,700
how can they die so easily?

359
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,360
You can believe whatever you want.

360
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,240
If you can,

361
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,920
go find Long Feiye yourself.

362
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,620
You are so incompetent

363
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:58,110
that you can't handle such a trifle.

364
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,150
What good are you?

365
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:00,950
Guards!

366
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,430
Take him.

367
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,280
Let me tell you something.

368
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,780
This is my Yaogui Valley.

369
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,370
I can easily poison you

370
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,900
to death.

371
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,070
Don’t you dare!

372
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:22,740
Try me.

373
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:28,990
Fine.

374
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,370
I’ll wait for one more month in Tianning.

375
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:33,900
By then,

376
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,920
if you don’t give me Poison Master,

377
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,320
I’ll bring you back

378
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,060
and bury you with your mother.

379
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,320
You can

380
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,650
forget about clear your mother’s name.

381
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:44,780
Let’s go.

382
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:55,190
Qishao.

383
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,240
We should have him killed.

384
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,360
Otherwise, we’ll never clear your mother’s name.

385
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,110
I really want to

386
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,570
make him into fertilizer.

387
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,030
Make him into fertilizer?

388
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:07,090
I don’t want him to get my place dirty.

389
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,680
Your Highness.

390
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,240
We've located

391
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,110
these people

392
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,920
that came out of Yaogui Valley.

393
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:54,850
Your Highness.

394
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:26,180
You are a royal member of Beili?

395
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,250
I’m Jun Yizheng.

396
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,200
The Crown Prince of Beili.

397
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,390
I catch the Crown Prince of Beili.

398
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:34,870
If I send you to father,

399
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,650
I will gain a credit.

400
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,530
Good.

401
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:39,990
Guards!

402
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:41,200
Take him!

403
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:41,900
Yes!

404
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:43,860
Wait!

405
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:46,990
What?

406
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:48,320
I know you.

407
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,030
You are the Second Prince of Tianning,

408
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,030
Long Tianqing.

409
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,650
You know my name, so what?

410
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,490
I know you're ambitious.

411
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,450
You're not going

412
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:00,530
to be a prince all your life, are you?

413
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,270
You're already fighting with

414
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,950
Crown Prince of Tianning.

415
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,740
If he takes the throne,

416
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,170
what do you think

417
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,860
will happen to you?

418
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,450
Go on.

419
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,360
Taking me to your father

420
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,280
won’t make you

421
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,070
a crown prince.

422
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,070
And I

423
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,150
will be the king of Beili.

424
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,990
If you let me go today,

425
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,150
we'll be friends.

426
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:29,900
I can be of assistance

427
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,740
to Your Highness

428
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,700
in many matters.

429
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,640
Your Highness.

430
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,150
I think he's got a point.

431
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,070
Now the enemy of the Crown Prince

432
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,900
is our friend.

433
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,110
Your biggest enemy

434
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,450
is still the Crown Prince.

435
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:45,530
If we can get

436
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:46,950
a prince of Beili’s support,

437
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,150
we'll have more help.

438
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,820
That's what we need right now.

439
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,540
[Palace of Benevolence and Longevity]

440
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,350
-Your Royal Highness.
-Your Royal Highness.

441
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,150
Stand up.

442
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,190
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

443
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,320
Have a seat, sister.

444
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,900
I invited you two here

445
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:48,030
to watch a play.

446
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,820
You did come,

447
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,110
that means

448
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,900
I did the right thing.

449
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:55,850
Your Royal Highness.

450
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,410
The play's about to start.

451
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,610
Let's go to the stage.

452
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,650
Sure.

453
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,740
Your Royal Highness, what’s wrong?

454
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,070
What happened, sister?

455
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,280
I suddenly feel sick

456
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,190
and dizzy.

457
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,950
Do you want me to summon physicians?

458
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,950
Isn’t Yunxi here?

459
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:25,200
Let Yunxi check for me.

460
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,200
Yunxi is

461
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,900
from our Prince Qin’s Mansion.

462
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,990
She is not some physician

463
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,530
that everyone can use.

464
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:34,450
Are these imperial physicians

465
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,530
for nothing?

466
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,110
Mother.

467
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,570
Her Royal Highness is noble.

468
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,820
It’s my honor

469
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,400
to check her pulse.

470
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,770
It's just that I'm new at this,

471
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,190
and if I'm wrong,

472
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:49,900
please don't blame me.

473
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,280
How could I?

474
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:53,610
Well.

475
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,740
Sister.

476
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,590
Why don’t you go watch the play?

477
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,110
Guards.

478
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,110
Yunxi.

479
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,820
You must treat my sister properly.

480
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,030
Don’t make any mistakes.

481
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,980
Don't worry, mother.

482
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,780
Then, excuse me.

483
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:45,740
Wait.

484
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,490
I thought we were going to watch the play.

485
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,950
What is all this?

486
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,820
Forgive me, Your Highness.

487
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,350
I’m just following orders…

488
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:58,070
It’s me who invited you here.

489
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,070
Your Majesty.

490
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:09,200
Rise.

491
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,630
If Your Majesty wants to see me,

492
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,030
then just send someone,

493
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,780
and I will come.

494
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,150
I heard that mother

495
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:18,700
invited you

496
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,040
and Princess Qin here,

497
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,490
so I came to check.

498
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,200
I wonder if

499
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,730
you two get along in Prince Qin’s Mansion.

500
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,740
Yunxi is a good girl.

501
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:37,030
And she has great medical skills.

502
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,900
I really like her.

503
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,410
That’s good to know.

504
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,780
Let me

505
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,110
walk with you.

506
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,280
Do you ever hear

507
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,030
the rumor

508
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,070
about Prince Qin?

509
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,360
Really?

510
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,280
About what?

511
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:09,780
It’s said

512
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,190
Prince Qin

513
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,850
is not a royal member of Tianning.

514
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,110
Someone took his identity

515
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,730
and became an imposter.

516
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:21,320
Ridiculous!

517
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,150
That's ridiculous!

518
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,580
This rumor has spread to the court.

519
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,280
Officials are talking about it.

520
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:33,570
I'm afraid my brother will be upset.

521
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:37,950
Feiye knew about it?

522
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:38,950
Of course.

523
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:42,780
It seems that Prince Qin

524
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,700
was afraid that you

525
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,280
would be afraid,

526
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,860
so he deliberately covered it up.

527
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,070
Your Highness.

528
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,200
My biggest fear is

529
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,070
that if the rumor is true,

530
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,110
and he is not my real brother,

531
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:03,820
then there's

532
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:06,210
a whole conspiracy going on.

533
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:07,820
Tianning

534
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,820
would really be feeding a snake.

535
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:15,860
I know you

536
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,860
and my brother

537
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,030
are very close.

538
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:21,360
But I am

539
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,450
not only his brother,

540
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,280
but also the king of Tianning.

541
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,450
I can’t ruin the state

542
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,240
that my ancestors gave me.

543
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,700
I will not stand by and watch

544
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,650
a plot brought to the palace

545
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,150
and to me.

546
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,280
If someone really wants

547
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,320
to overthrow Tianning

548
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,650
with this,

549
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,900
the most painful is the common people.

550
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,200
Your Highness.

551
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:49,990
You don't want people

552
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,740
to die, do you?

553
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,530
For the sake of

554
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,610
both Tianning

555
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,610
and the late king,

556
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:00,990
help me.

557
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,850
What can I do for Your Majesty?

558
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,110
Please help me find out

559
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,030
the true identity of Feiye.

560
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,570
If he is really

561
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,450
a member of our family,

562
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:20,860
then rumor

563
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,110
will break,

564
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,000
and his name will be cleared.

565
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,570
What do you think?

566
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:41,990
Han Yunxi.

567
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,200
Why haven’t you sent

568
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,990
any message back for so long?

569
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,360
Lately,

570
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:49,700
the Prince Qin’s Mansion was

571
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,700
surrounded by troops led by General Mu.

572
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,360
The message couldn't get out.

573
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,190
Prince Qin was busy with politics.

574
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:55,520
I couldn’t get near him.

575
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,610
Nonsense!

576
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:00,110
You think I don't know

577
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,300
that you didn't do anything!

578
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,860
Don't you

579
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,570
want to see your mother again?

580
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,570
Please, Your Royal Highness, enlighten me.

581
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:13,570
How to bring

582
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:15,110
the dead back to life?

583
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,610
Or

584
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:19,510
Your Royal Highness can really make that happen?

585
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:20,610
If that's the case,

586
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,400
you don’t need me to treat

587
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:23,860
your little dizziness.

588
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,530
Then excuse me.

589
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:27,699
Stop!

590
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,190
My place

591
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:29,780
is not for you

592
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,239
to come and go easily!

593
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,239
Your Royal Highness wants to imprison me,

594
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,150
or kill me?

595
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:47,989
Rebel!

596
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,489
You are a rebel!

597
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:51,280
Guards!

598
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:53,150
Fine.

599
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,320
Kill me now.

600
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:56,739
I've already

601
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,740
told Prince Qin

602
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,150
everything.

603
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,780
And when I'm dead,

604
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,110
he will tell the world.

605
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:06,070
Princess Qin died in your palace.

606
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:07,450
I wonder

607
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,900
how you will explain it to the world.

608
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,650
You!

609
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,280
Consort Yi arrives!

610
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,030
What

611
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,570
makes you so angry?

612
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,400
I’ve already told you

613
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,320
that Yunxi is new to this.

614
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,590
You shall call the physicians.

615
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,280
It’s you

616
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,460
who wanted Yunxi to check your pause.

617
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:36,820
Now she’s wrong

618
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,410
and you want to punish her.

619
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,780
Yunxi

620
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,650
is our people.

621
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,640
If you want to punish her,

622
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,030
you need to give the Prince Qin’s Mansion

623
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,190
an explanation.

624
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,400
Han Yunxi was rude

625
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:50,490
to me

626
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:51,280
and broke

627
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,130
the vase given by the late king!

628
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:55,280
Consort Yi.

629
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,400
Are you

630
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,110
trying to cover her?

631
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,320
It’s just a vase.

632
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,030
What a big deal!

633
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,530
It doesn’t worth your anger.

634
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:10,510
How about this?

635
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,990
Later, I’ll ask Prince Qin

636
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:16,030
to send a good vase to Your Royal Highness.

637
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,990
Today, I

638
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,780
am going to punish her!

639
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,360
Consort Yi.

640
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,030
This is the Palace of Benevolence and Longevity,

641
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,760
not your Prince Qin’s Mansion.

642
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,210
If you have something to say,

643
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,610
let Prince Qin talk to His Majesty.

644
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,320
His Majesty has just

645
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,700
complimented Yunxi.

646
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:49,580
If, at this time,

647
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,190
you want to punish her,

648
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,690
wouldn’t that put His Majesty

649
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,450
in a dilemma?

650
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,320
Good.

651
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,070
Very good.

652
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:12,320
If there isn’t anything else,

653
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:15,860
we shall leave.

654
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,320
Yunxi, let’s go.

655
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:49,650
Consort Yi.

656
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:52,490
This is the Palace of Benevolence and Longevity,

657
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:54,220
not your Prince Qin’s Mansion.

658
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:54,900
I won’t

659
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:57,050
let you two get away with everything.

660
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:58,860
Old witch.

661
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:04,650
Mother.

662
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,780
It's a good thing that you were there today,

663
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,610
or that old witch

664
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:09,010
wouldn't have spared me.

665
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,680
You called her old witch?

666
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,700
I wouldn't dare.

667
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,820
But you made old witch

668
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,030
mad like that today,

669
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,030
you've got some skills.

670
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:21,920
Thank you, mother.

671
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,490
As Princess Qin,

672
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,980
you need to be steady.

673
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,910
You're right about everything.

674
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,160
Why are you so happy today?

675
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,190
Mother has been

676
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,700
defending me today.

677
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,310
You're her daughter-in-law.

678
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,530
Isn't that what she's supposed to do?

679
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:50,240
I think mother is

680
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,500
starting to accept me.

681
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,900
[Hongfu Inn]

682
00:38:58,530 --> 00:38:59,650
Relax a little bit.

683
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,030
Don't be so nervous.

684
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,950
Self-discipline and hard work.

685
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,740
That's a shame.

686
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,030
You'll always be

687
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,860
the Second Prince of Tianning.

688
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,560
That's unfortunate.

689
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,070
I heard there's

690
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,190
more than one prince in Beili.

691
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:25,860
Yes.

692
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,660
My father does

693
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,900
have another son.

694
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,990
But he's just a bastard.

695
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:34,190
His mother is a maid.

696
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,650
So it's

697
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,150
no threat to me.

698
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,820
Well, then you're in luck.

699
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:40,490
Unlike me,

700
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,400
no matter how hard I try,

701
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,650
my father will not depose

702
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,780
that stupid and incompetent Crown Prince.

703
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,280
Then kill him.

704
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,660
It’s easy to say than done.

705
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,400
As long as you

706
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,240
can sign a treaty with me

707
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,490
that when you take the crown,

708
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,360
give me two cities

709
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,950
and do not invade

710
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,400
Beili in your life time,

711
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:13,110
I can help you

712
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,030
kill that incompetent

713
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,570
Crown Prince.

714
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:17,710
How can I trust you?

715
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:19,030
It's up to

716
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,740
you to decide.

717
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:29,990
Fine.

718
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:31,690
I can sign the treaty.

719
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,840
But you must stay in Tianning

720
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:35,280
until Long Tianmo dies.

721
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:37,470
I'll send someone to protect you.

722
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:38,700
Are you trying

723
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:39,700
to keep me here?

724
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,420
That's where I draw the line.

725
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:44,530
Fine.

726
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:46,580
You have my word.

727
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,060
Your Highness.

728
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,730
This is my jujube and yam cake.

729
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:00,960
You want a taste?

730
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:14,960
Are you free today?

731
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,630
What’s going on?

732
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:24,050
It's the anniversary of my parents’ death.

733
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,220
I want to take you to worship them.

734
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:27,990
Yes!

735
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,280
Let's go to the market and get some supplies.

736
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,780
I'll just have someone

737
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,700
get these ready.

738
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,900
Don't worry about it.

739
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:36,900
You have to buy

740
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,230
these things yourself.

741
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,030
Let's go.

742
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,860
Let's go.
