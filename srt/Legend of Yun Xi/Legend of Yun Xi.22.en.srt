2
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,020
Episode 22

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:07,390
Should I tell her

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,390
that her mother died?

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,850
If I tell her the truth,

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,180
everything happened in that year

7
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,050
will be exposed.

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,300
Living with hope

9
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,720
is better than living hopelessly.

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:29,680
Feiye.

11
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:35,890
Yes?

12
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,010
I came to

13
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,850
ask you something.

14
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,350
Obviously, Han Yunxi

15
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,350
is a spy sent by Her Royal Highness.

16
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,600
Why do you keep her secret?

17
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,390
Do you remember

18
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,510
the one who saved me in the prison

19
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:52,930
that I told you?

20
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:55,510
Yes.

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,890
Does that woman

22
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,180
have something to do with Han Yunxi?

23
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:00,890
That woman

24
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,090
is Han Yunxi’s mother.

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,100
So coincidental.

26
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,720
Was that a trick of Her Royal Highness?

27
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,140
Her Royal Highness and Han Yunxi

28
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,350
don’t know my identity.

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,720
How could they do that?

30
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,890
Though what you said is the truth,

31
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,260
you shouldn’t protect someone

32
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,970
who wanted to hurt you.

33
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:22,850
Feiye.

34
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,600
You always did things

35
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,720
rationally.

36
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,050
Do you really have affection to her?

37
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,350
So

38
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,100
Long Feiye went back to the imperial palace

39
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,350
fifteen years ago.

40
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,180
Yes.

41
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:52,550
Poison Master became delirious

42
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,470
and Gu-infected man disappeared

43
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,800
fifteen years ago.

44
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,009
It’s very coincidental.

45
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,430
So you mean

46
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,220
maybe it was not Prince Qin

47
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,430
who came back to the palace.

48
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,050
It was Gu-infected man
who has been disappeared for years.

49
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,090
Don’t say it

50
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,509
without evidence.

51
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,680
Qishao, where are you going?

52
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:15,720
Go to find evidence.

53
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,620
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

54
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,350
Long Feiye slept at late night,

55
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,600
and he’ll attend the meeting before dawn.

56
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,970
Won’t he feel tired?

57
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,050
Overfatigue

58
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,850
is harmful to health.

59
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,350
These days, I found a secret of him.

60
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,600
He loves a tea named Nanshanhong very much.

61
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,010
I really want to tell him

62
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,640
that drinking too much tea at night

63
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,260
will affect his sleep.

64
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:13,680
Poison girl.

65
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,470
It’s not easy

66
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,850
for me to come in.

67
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,100
Why are you here?

68
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,510
I risked my life

69
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,300
to come here and give you something.

70
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,180
What’s this?

71
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:33,760
Open it.

72
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:43,800
Dragon Spice?

73
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,050
Yes,

74
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,390
last time you looked for Moon Vine.

75
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,600
Do you know?

76
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,640
With Dragon Spice,

77
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,930
the effect of Moon Vine

78
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,890
can be maximized.

79
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,010
Gu Qishao,

80
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,470
you are really a good friend.

81
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,430
Of course.

82
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,930
How will you reward me?

83
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,890
How dare you rush into my mansion! Who are you?

84
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,180
Your Highness.

85
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,800
I’m chatting with my friend.

86
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:16,930
Yes.

87
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,260
Poison girl.

88
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,680
Sorry for making trouble for you.

89
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:25,800
I’ll leave.

90
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,430
Your Highness.

91
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,300
Are you jealous?

92
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,470
From now on,

93
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,350
Princess Qin will be imprisoned.

94
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,140
Without my order,

95
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,550
she can’t go out of Pavilion of Leisure.

96
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:28,890
Yunxi.

97
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,430
What happened to you?

98
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,100
Your Highness.

99
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,010
Your Highness, are you all right?

100
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:08,850
Fine.

101
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,470
What’s the matter?

102
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,140
It’s fine that you’re all right.

103
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,850
I come to report something.

104
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:16,510
Last time,

105
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,930
another party kidnapped Poison Master.

106
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:18,890
We’ve found out who did it.

107
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:20,930
As what we guessed,

108
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,930
it’s the master of Yaogui Valley, Gu Qishao.

109
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:28,680
Also...

110
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,220
Also,

111
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,220
Gu Qishao has

112
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,300
another identity now.

113
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,510
He’s the adviser of the Crown Prince.

114
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,800
I know him.

115
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,220
With his wealth and power,

116
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,390
he won’t just

117
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,050
want to

118
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,090
be an adviser.

119
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,260
So,

120
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,470
he must have other purpose for this journey.

121
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,390
I’ll keep investigating.

122
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,140
Got it.

123
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,010
Also,

124
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,680
ask the guards to reinforce protection.

125
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:00,800
Yes.

126
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,180
Your Highness,

127
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,800
take care of yourself.

128
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:29,890
Ningjing.

129
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,550
Don’t you think Long Feiye

130
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,430
was out of line?

131
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,640
Gu Qishao is my friend.

132
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,180
Though it’s not right

133
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,140
that he slipped into the mansion at night,

134
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,050
Long Feiye

135
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,430
shouldn’t be so fierce.

136
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,510
It’s wrong for Feiye to be so fierce,

137
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,680
but it’s forgivable.

138
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,720
Why?

139
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,010
Look.

140
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,100
You are Feiye’s wife.

141
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,050
Your husband found

142
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,550
a man

143
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,510
in his wife’s room.

144
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,390
Don’t you think it’s weird?

145
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,600
It makes sense.

146
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:15,890
Does he think

147
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,350
there’s affection between Gu Qishao and me?

148
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,390
Though

149
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,430
Feiye looks cold,

150
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,760
he

151
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,510
really cares about you.

152
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:28,760
No.

153
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,260
I need to explain it to him.

154
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,760
Calm down.

155
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,549
It’s late.

156
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,299
Feiye is still angry.

157
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,679
If you go now,

158
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,970
this will be more messy.

159
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,179
Sleep now.

160
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,800
The message that His Majesty
made a Gu-infected man

161
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,600
has spread not only in the capital city.

162
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:11,720
Even people in south of the Yangtze River

163
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,930
know about it.

164
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,390
The public

165
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,100
is more and more

166
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,260
unsatisfied with His Majesty.

167
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,680
Pretend to be pitiful.

168
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,220
Good luck.

169
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,090
I’ll continue.

170
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,680
The Crown Prince’s recent track

171
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,800
is very weird.

172
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,010
So I investigated it secretly.

173
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,260
I found

174
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,010
he is doing the study of the Gu-infected man.

175
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,430
Send some men to the Crown Prince’s place

176
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,300
to warn him

177
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,050
not to do

178
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,390
immoral things.

179
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:54,350
Also,

180
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,430
keep the Crown Prince’s stronghold

181
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,180
for now.

182
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,180
Yes.

183
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,060
[Qinghui Hall]

184
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:42,510
Your Highness.

185
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,720
This is a letter from the Crown Prince.

186
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,010
I see.

187
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,010
What happened?

188
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:00,510
Madam.

189
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,470
The Crown Prince asked Gu Qishao

190
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,260
to investigate the powder which was changed.

191
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,970
Do you know what’s in it?

192
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,600
Your Highness, you look very happy.

193
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,800
Have you gotten the result?

194
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,350
Noble Consort Xiao didn’t give me

195
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,100
poison,

196
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,300
but infertility drug.

197
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,850
Because of the dose and its effect,

198
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,510
the imperial physicians don’t know what it is.

199
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,090
But Noble Consort Xiao is smart.

200
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,010
The dose in my snacks

201
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,510
is a little.

202
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,470
So it won’t hurt me much.

203
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,390
At the beginning,

204
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,970
no symptom will be shown.

205
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,050
Noble Consort Xiao is very cruel.

206
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:36,550
I thought

207
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,050
she used a smart trick.

208
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,760
But I thought too much.

209
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,090
No wonder she did this.

210
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,640
In the imperial harem,

211
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,430
offspring is the best guarantee.

212
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:48,640
Your Highness,

213
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,010
what should we do?

214
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:54,140
How about telling His Majesty?

215
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,100
No, we can’t.

216
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,600
If we do so,

217
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,430
we can’t clearly explain

218
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,470
that we changed the medicine.

219
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,260
I’ll always give you

220
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,100
various kinds

221
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,470
of snacks.

222
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:14,760
Madam.

223
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,090
Do you remember that Noble Consort Xiao

224
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,180
said that she’ll snacks

225
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,260
to every concubine?

226
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,510
You mean...

227
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,050
Your Royal Highness,

228
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,680
please help me.

229
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,390
I don’t know why

230
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,760
His Majesty imprisoned Tianqing.

231
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,550
I went to beg him.

232
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,220
But he didn’t want to see me.

233
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,390
I am really worried.

234
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,300
His Majesty did so

235
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,970
must because of politics.

236
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,550
But concubines can’t interfere with politics.

237
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,350
So,

238
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,100
as a concubine,

239
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,720
you should know the rule.

240
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,640
Also,

241
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,760
Tianqing is His Majesty’s son.

242
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,970
How can he

243
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:00,970
hurt his son?

244
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:02,680
Your Royal Highness.

245
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,470
I don’t mean it.

246
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,760
I just...

247
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,930
Concubine Qing is here!

248
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:10,320
Princess Changbing is here!

249
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:15,930
Your Royal Highness.

250
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,470
Your Royal Highness.

251
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,760
Stand up.

252
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,050
-Thanks, Your Royal Highness.
-Thanks, Your Royal Highness.

253
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,140
Noble Consort Xiao.

254
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,050
Noble Consort Xiao.

255
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,090
Stand up.

256
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,430
Concubine Qing, come here.

257
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,300
Your Royal Highness.

258
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,850
I heard that you were poisoned several days ago.

259
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,680
I don’t know what happened.

260
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,100
I wanted to see you.

261
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,090
But His Majesty said that you were too weak

262
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,760
to see anyone.

263
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,890
Are you unhappy for it?

264
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,550
Your Royal Highness, thanks for caring me.

265
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,090
How come I am unhappy?

266
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,760
Now I have recovered.

267
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,970
It must be done by someone evil

268
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,140
who framed Noble Consort Xiao.

269
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,890
Right, Noble Consort Xiao?

270
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:06,970
Of course.

271
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,760
You know

272
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,260
me well.

273
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,100
Grandmother, don’t worry.

274
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,430
Father

275
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,390
will find that evil guy.

276
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,850
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

277
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,890
Noble Consort Xiao is good.

278
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,850
She always gives snacks

279
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,010
to us.

280
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,260
Your Royal Highness, I'm sure you've had some.

281
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,470
Everyone praises the skill

282
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,100
of the cooks in Noble Consort Xiao’s hall.

283
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,550
An evil guy put poison in it.

284
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,220
But Noble Consort Xiao knows that

285
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,510
I love to eat,

286
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,090
so she still brings me some time to time.

287
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:36,970
Snacks?

288
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,430
What snacks?

289
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,220
I never had that.

290
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:41,890
Grandmother, did you eat that?

291
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,470
It’s my fault

292
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,010
that I forgot the princess.

293
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,390
I’ll bring you

294
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,640
some later.

295
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:50,680
Don’t bother.

296
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,970
I don’t dare to

297
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,180
eat your things.

298
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,510
What if I am poisoned

299
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,720
like Concubine Qing?

300
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,470
Look at you.

301
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,680
Think before you speak.

302
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,510
Yes, princess.

303
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:02,890
No one is stupid

304
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,800
to add poison into snacks.

305
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:06,510
Your Royal Highness,

306
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,680
I think

307
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,720
Noble Consort Xiao is wronged.

308
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,300
Fine.

309
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:12,720
You are right.

310
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,680
In the stories,

311
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,050
evil guys always

312
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,090
put infertility drugs into food.

313
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,510
How come it’s poison?

314
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,300
Changbing!

315
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,100
Yes, grandmother.

316
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:31,850
Noble Consort Xiao.

317
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,090
Are you all right?

318
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:33,970
All right.

319
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,050
I’m just worried about Tianqing.

320
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,600
So I didn’t sleep well yesterday.

321
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,680
Tianqing?

322
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:39,970
What happened to him?

323
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:41,470
He was just

324
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,890
blamed by His Majesty.

325
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,300
His Majesty doesn’t let him go out
to reflect his mistakes.

326
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,510
I see.

327
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:51,720
Your Royal Highness,

328
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,470
I’m not well.

329
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,140
Now that Concubine Qing is here,

330
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,510
let her stay with you.

331
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,300
I see.

332
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,970
You may go.

333
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,180
Thanks, Your Royal Highness.

334
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,350
What happened to her?

335
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,090
She was well just now.

336
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,010
She must have been faking it.

337
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,350
Look at you.

338
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,260
Go back to reflect your mistakes.

339
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,930
You are a princess.

340
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,550
How come you read these stories?

341
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,220
Do you know

342
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,300
what you said?

343
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,470
Yes, grandmother.

344
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,260
Concubine Qing.

345
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,220
You just recovered.

346
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,550
Don’t need to visit me now.

347
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:46,090
I know that you caught a cold several days ago.

348
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,850
You are so weak.

349
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,260
Rest is the most important now.

350
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:51,800
Otherwise,

351
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,680
how can you give His Majesty a baby?

352
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,720
Maybe I’m not used to the life here.

353
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,140
My period is not regular.

354
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,760
And I don’t have appetite these days.

355
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,089
I don’t know why.

356
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,180
I only want to eat

357
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,930
the snacks brought by Noble Consort Xiao.

358
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:11,010
Look at you.

359
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,599
You are still immature.

360
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,760
You just experienced a disaster.

361
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,140
You want snacks again?

362
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,800
Is it something wrong?

363
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,260
Eating is a gift given by the god.

364
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:36,640
Madam Li.

365
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,800
Yes.

366
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,430
Send secret guardians

367
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,090
to spy

368
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,180
Noble Consort Xiao

369
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:45,760
and record

370
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,550
the concubines

371
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,760
who received

372
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,470
her snacks.

373
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,510
Tell me when they finish.

374
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:57,930
Your Royal Highness,

375
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,220
you....

376
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:04,850
Hope

377
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,970
what I guessed is wrong.

378
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,850
So you mean

379
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,220
Her Royal Highness

380
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,220
has suspected Noble Consort Xiao?

381
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,800
It’s very likely.

382
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,720
Like His Majesty,

383
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,390
Her Royal Highness is also suspicious.

384
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,090
She tends to believe what she guessed.

385
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:29,720
Also,

386
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:30,550
it’s related to the offspring

387
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,140
of the royal family.

388
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,800
Now that she has

389
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,220
suspected it,

390
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,470
she will investigate it.

391
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,260
As long as she wants to check it,

392
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,220
the result will be shown in front of her.

393
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,550
It’s so nice

394
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,300
if you are right.

395
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,090
It cost you

396
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,720
much time to tell

397
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,350
the stories

398
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,970
to Princess Changbing.

399
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,800
Now, it plays the role.

400
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:08,350
Let’s wait and see.

401
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,700
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

402
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,600
What’s in it?

403
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,890
Your Highness.

404
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:56,850
In the cases,

405
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:57,300
it’s precious

406
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,510
herbal medicine.

407
00:19:58,890 --> 00:19:59,890
Herbal medicine?

408
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,300
Are you sure?

409
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,550
I didn’t buy herbal medicine.

410
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:04,600
Your Highness.

411
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,100
Someone asked us to give you.

412
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,430
Someone asked you?

413
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,640
It can’t be Gu Qishao.

414
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,010
Is it His Highness?

415
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,390
He isn’t jealous? Liar.

416
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,220
Feiye.

417
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,350
I wonder

418
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,100
what happened to Poison Master over the years.

419
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:48,930
He’s severely mad.

420
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,350
Should I find

421
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,760
a highly skilled physician

422
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:52,600
for him?

423
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,010
Let Han Yunxi have a try.

424
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:57,550
No…

425
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,350
I object.

426
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,640
Though Han Yunxi is good at

427
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,090
detoxification,

428
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,720
the Poison Master’s madness

429
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,100
is not because of poison.

430
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,470
It’s too risky

431
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,350
to let her know

432
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,800
Poison Master.

433
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:10,300
I know what I should do.

434
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:11,930
But

435
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,480
Han Yunxi is a spy

436
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,430
of Her Royal Highness.

437
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,680
In case...

438
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,720
-If...
-It’s done.

439
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,190
Your Highness,

440
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,360
look.

441
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,900
Someone sent

442
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,860
a lot of precious herbal medicine.

443
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,650
Gu Qishao sent it?

444
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,190
You are sick?

445
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:17,740
I’m fine.

446
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,150
Go out with me.

447
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:21,820
Where will we go?

448
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,190
You’ll know it later.

449
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,820
Meet Tang Li at the door.

450
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,190
We’ll go together.

451
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,700
Keep a secret?

452
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,030
He is the one I need to treat?

453
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,030
Yes.

454
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,200
This man is very important

455
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,110
to me.

456
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,360
But he is delirious.

457
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,360
Cure him.

458
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:17,240
Don’t worry.

459
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:36,990
It’s fine.

460
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:38,070
It’s fine.

461
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,900
It’s fine. It’s fine.

462
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:25,740
Feiye.

463
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,030
Can she do it?

464
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:47,780
How is he?

465
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,490
I need to go back to study.

466
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,280
Are you sure you can cure him?

467
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,400
I’ll try my best.

468
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:57,740
Feiye.

469
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,110
Are you okay?

470
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,030
Did you catch a cold?

471
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,490
He has martial arts skills.

472
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,110
How can he

473
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,200
catch a cold easily?

474
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,240
Maybe here is too airless

475
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,280
and with too much dust.

476
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,200
Let’s go back.

White Ear.

479

Long time no see.

00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:33,240
Poison girl.

Long time no see.

-I miss you so...
-No, no, no.

484
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,740
I have a husband.

485
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,400
I can’t bear

486
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,450
your warm embrace.

487
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,780
You haven’t seen me for long.

488
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:44,990
Don’t you miss me?

489
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:48,900
I miss your medicine field.

490
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,610
You are so heartless.

491
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,530
Look at you.

492
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:56,740
You are so smooth-tongued.

493
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,400
Who will marry you?

494
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,110
You are wrong.

495
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,820
Many girls love me.

496

Their line is from Yaogui Valley to the capital city.

498
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,240
love one girl.

Who?

500
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,860
You.

501
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:13,610
Just a joke.

502
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:15,780
The girl I love

503
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,240
is smart

504
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:18,450
and beautiful.

505
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:19,280
She’s way different

506
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,740
from the ordinary ones.

507
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:23,070
She’s

508
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,650
similar to you.

509
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,950
But in this world,

510
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,070
only she is my match.

511
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,650
Such a unique girl?

512
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,200
I want to see her.

513
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,530
I’ll introduce her to you if there’s chance.

514
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:40,860
By the way,

515
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,360
how did you use

516
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:43,150
that Dragon Spice that I gave you?

517
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,570
I...

518
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,150
I lost it carelessly.

519
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:47,990
I’m sorry.

520
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,860
It doesn’t matter.

521
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,450
I’ll find some for you

522
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:51,900
when I have a chance.

523
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,070
No, no, no.

524
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,400
This is a good medicine.

525
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:55,700
Keep it for yourself.

526
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,700
I’m already happy

527
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,150
as long as your medicine field is open to me.

528
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:01,240
Don’t worry.

in my medicine field.

I really appreciate it.

Calm down.

It’s weird.

538
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,740
It’s not like poison,

539
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,990
but like medicine to cure delirium

540
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,200
or epilepsy.

541
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:31,700
Beside poison,

542
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,110
I also need to study medicine.

543
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:33,740
So

544
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,860
I won’t call you “poison girl”.

545
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,240
I’ll call you miracle-working physician.

546
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,740
Thanks, thanks.

547
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,190
Please be modest.

548
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,110
Let me see the second paper.

549
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,070
It’s medicine for cold.

550
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,150
Did you get a cold?

551
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,240
No.

You are a good girl.

555
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,900
It’s too unreasonable

556
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,240
that you are taken by Prince Qin.

557
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,320
My Prince Qin is good.

What’s your expression?

559
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:02,950
Take it.

560
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,150
Go to take medicine.

Your Highness.

570
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,190
You only told me

571
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,200
to send guardians to watch Yaogui Valley.

572
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:37,190
You didn’t object Princess Qin to go in.

If my memory is right,

574

you still can’t go out.

575

Didn’t you ask me to the boudoir?

576

you can’t leave Mingyue Chamber and the boudoir.

need any medicine.

Yes.

How?

Dragon Spice

606

is a special medicine.

it can cure every kind of disease.

that the poisoned people will get cold

that Long Feiye has been infected.

As long as we have chance

to do acupuncture at his certain acupoint

and twist his tendons,

618
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,070
he will show his true color

and Han Yunxi

705
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,700
spies in Prince Qin’s Mansion?

706
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,030
Not now.

707
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:59,110
At my birthday feast,

708
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:01,030
make Han Yunxi prove

709
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,360
that Prince Qin is the Gu-infected man.

710
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,860
It’s not late to say it out

711
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:08,950
when we have evidence.

712
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:09,820
Your Royal Highness,

713
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,530
I’m afraid

714
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:14,030
that it’s too risky

715
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,740
to let Han Yunxi do

716
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,990
the most important part.

717
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:20,450
After all,

718
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:21,570
she hasn’t sent us any

719
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,860
useful information.

720
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,190
You worry that

721
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,070
Han Yunxi

722
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,030
has been standing by Prince Qin’s side.

723
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:28,860
Yes.

724
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:30,490
Don’t worry.

725
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:33,650
I

726
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,150
have an idea to make her

727
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,650
listen to me.

728
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,380
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

729
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,610
Han Yunxi.

730
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:59,150
Mother.

731
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,610
Look at

732
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,240
what you’re wearing.

733
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:15,400
Mind your manner

734
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:16,820
as a princess.

735
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:19,950
Yes, mother.

736
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,900
Did you go out today?

737
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,110
As Princess Qin,

738
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,200
you always go out to see others.

739
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:31,950
Have you realized your mistake?

740
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:33,950
Mother.

741
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,950
This time, I went out

742
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,900
to do things for Prince Qin.

743
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,070
I wear these clothes

744
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,740
to go out to do things conveniently.

745
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,400
Also,

746
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,110
I only have the title

747
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,700
of Princess Qin,

748
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,360
but I don’t have the real power.

749
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,320
And I am not enjoying

750
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:51,490
the service for a princess.

751
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,240
Mother, if you really

752
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,650
care the reputation of Prince Qin’s Mansion,

753
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,620
please give me

754
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:57,500
the right of Princess Qin.

755
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,280
You...

756
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,200
How dare you!

757
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,240
I just blamed you

758
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,610
that you embarrassed Prince Qin’s Mansion,

759
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,780
but you said rude words to me.

760
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,110
Mother.

761
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:12,150
I said the truth.

762
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:14,200
Fine.

763
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,200
What a rude girl.

764
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,990
I’ll see whether Feiye

765
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,900
will protect you forever.

766
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,900
Did what I wear

767
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,070
really make the family embarrassed?

768
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,320
Of course.

769
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,190
Princess Qin

770
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,320
should wear like Princess Qin.

771
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:41,240
You represent

772
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,360
the whole Prince Qin’s Mansion.

773
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,360
Look at your clothes.

774
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:45,610
This is rude.

775
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,990
Do you know it’s embarrassing?

776
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,280
So what?

777
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,400
I can’t ask Prince Qin

778
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:50,740
to buy me jewelries.

779
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,200
Don’t flatter yourself.

780
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,650
He doesn’t have time for you.

781
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,700
So weird.

782
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,190
I think it’s good.

783
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:21,400
Feiye.

784
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:23,740
It’s late.

785
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,780
Why haven’t you slept?

786
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,280
I couldn’t sleep.

787
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,070
So I went out to have a walk.

788
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,030
Feiye,

789
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:34,110
do you remember when we were kids,

790
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,240
we climbed tree?

791
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,110
I couldn’t make it every time.

792
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,190
You lifted me to the tree.

793
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,070
Aunt always blamed us

794
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,360
for our naughtiness.

795
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,820
Of course I remember.

796
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,280
You were very happy

797
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:48,950
when you saw

798
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,450
aunt worried.

799
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:53,740
So,

800
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,150
Feiye,

801
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,780
will you always treat me well?

802
00:39:58,650 --> 00:39:59,190
Of course.

803
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,360
Mingxiang.

804
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,530
In my heart,

805
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,990
you are like my real sister.

806
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,950
Sister?

807
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,070
It’s late.

808
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:19,320
You’ll catch a cold.

809
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,700
You just recovered.

810
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,530
It’s better to go back to rest.

811
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,150
I have something to deal with.

812
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:28,490
So I won’t send you to your room.

813
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:45,990
How do you feel, aunt?

814
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,200
So comfortable.

815
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,320
Did Han Yunxi

816
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:56,820
go out today?

817
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,150
Prince Qin took her

818
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,530
to the fair.

819
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,240
Fair?

820
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,990
Feiye doesn’t like

821
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,320
crowded places.

822
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:07,990
Your Highness

823
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:10,110
blamed Princess Qin for

824
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,950
what she wore embarrassed Prince Qin’s Mansion.

825
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,190
So Prince Qin took her to the fair

826
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,900
and bought a lot of jewelries for her.

827
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,150
Yunxi.

828
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,400
Congratulations.

829
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,820
Look,

830
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,400
you and Feiye

831
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,610
have married.

832
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,190
Are... Are you sure

833
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,280
he likes me?

834
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,110
Yes.

835
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:41,650
Really?

836
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,280
Look.

837
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,360
When you were in danger,

838
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:47,950
he was the first one who came

839
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:48,650
to protect you.

840
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:51,070
When you were bullied,

841
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,030
he supported you.

842
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,240
When you got close

843
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,190
to Gu Qishao,

844
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,030
he’s jealous.

845
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,780
But he’s usually indifferent

846
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,070
to everything.

847
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,700
Based on these,

848
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,320
he likes you.

849
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:05,900
Really?

850
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:07,490
Yes. Yes. Yes.
