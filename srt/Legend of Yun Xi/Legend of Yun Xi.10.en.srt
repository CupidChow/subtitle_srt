Episode 10

3
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,489
Your Majesty.

4
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,190
Concubine Qing.

5
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,300
Darling, your dance

6
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,530
is quite charming.

7
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,280
I’m impressed.

8
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,670
Thank you, Your Majesty.

9
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,470
It’s just why did you want to

10
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,000
dance in this Royal Garden?

11
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,539
That’s because

12
00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:25,039
in our Xiqiu, dancing and praying for blessings

13
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,570
is a tradition.

14
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,320
Your Majesty, you just get well.

15
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,610
I want to do something for you.

16
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,070
So,

17
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,990
I chose to dance here.

18
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,070
And I wish Your Majesty live long.

19
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,110
Good.

20
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,530
I’m quite busy these days.

21
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,060
So, tonight, darling,

22
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:45,250
do the dance for me again,

23
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,530
would you?

24
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:48,320
Yes.

25
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:05,220
[Highest Judiciary]

26
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,860
Your Highness.

27
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,110
Your Highness.

28
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,620
Physician Li of Taihe Pharmacy

29
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,500
misplaced the poisonous Kuigeng

30
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,840
into the prescription of cold

31
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,110
and killed the patient.

32
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,830
Although it’s a mistake,

33
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,900
it’s still a life.

34
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:20,240
Now the evidence is all here.

35
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,900
This case…

36
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,700
Sir Beigong.

37
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,450
Where is the evidence?

38
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,990
Evidence, evidence.

39
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,570
Your Highness.

40
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:47,860
Your Highness.

41
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,750
If Taihe Pharmacy thinks they’re wronged,

42
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
it should provide

43
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,260
evidence to prove they’ve been done injustice.

44
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,240
Evidence?

45
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,400
These three things of yours

46
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,640
are the evidence.

47
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:03,900
Your Highness.

48
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:04,970
These…

49
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:05,970
These three things

50
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,180
should be the evidence that

51
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,000
prove Physician Li killed people.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,410
How could they be

53
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,940
the evidence of injustice?

54
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,530
Your Highness.

55
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,530
You can’t say whatever you want

56
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,910
in this place.

57
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,350
Sir Beigong.

58
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,680
Please ask the forensic physician

59
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,890
and Physician Lin here.

60
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:23,910
I would like to ask them something.

61
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,700
Well…

62
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:27,930
Alright.

63
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,430
At your service.

64
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,390
Summon Forensic Physician Xia and Physician Lin.

65
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,850
-Greetings to
-Greetings to

66
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,200
-Your Highnesses.
-Your Highnesses.

67
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:38,950
Stand up.

68
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,510
-Thank you, Your Highnesses.
-Thank you, Your Highnesses.

69
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,780
-Forensic Physician Xia.
-Yes.

70
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,420
Are you sure Mrs. Chen’s mother-in-law

71
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,700
was killed by Kuigeng?

72
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,700
Yes.

73
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,650
Time of death?

74
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,990
Yesterday, between 7 pm to 9 pm.

75
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,340
After drinking the medicine,

76
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,540
she was poisoned to death immediately.

77
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,120
Physician Lin,

78
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,180
for these medicines Mrs. Chen gave you,

79
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,840
have you fully examined them?

80
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,740
I have.

81
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,540
A total of eleven kinds of medicines.

82
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,020
They matched the prescription

83
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,350
that Physician Li gave.

84
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:17,790
Including the Kuigeng.

85
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,490
Physician Lin.

86
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,260
Physician Li wrote all the dosages

87
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,490
in his prescription.

88
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,900
Why didn’t you?

89
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,600
You measured them all?

90
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,240
Your Highness.

91
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,150
Kuigeng is both poisonous and medicinal.

92
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,170
But,

93
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,700
in Physician Li’s prescription,

94
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,990
it must be poisonous.

95
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,860
And it’s acute poison.

96
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,200
It has nothing to do with dosages.

97
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,070
Kuigeng is acute poison.

98
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,730
But the dosages

99
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,440
determine the time of strike.

100
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,340
Forensic Physician Xia just said

101
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,460
that the victim was killed

102
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,300
immediately after using the medicine.

103
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,060
But even if she used all these medicines,

104
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,060
it would take three days to kill her.

105
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,990
Then why did the victim

106
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,070
die immediately?

107
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,790
Well, about this, we should ask Mrs. Chen.

108
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,200
Sir Beigong.

109
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,900
Yes.

110
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,240
Now we can have Mrs. Chen here, right?

111
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,110
Bring Mrs. Chen.

112
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,950
Bring Mrs. Chen!

113
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,780
Don’t get ahead of yourself.

114
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,860
What do you mean?

115
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:03,820
It’s alright.

116
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,570
Relax.

117
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,730
Your Highnesses.

118
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,660
I was going to bring Mrs. Chen here.

119
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,420
But the residence of Chen was empty.

120
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,170
Any sign of struggle?

121
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,610
Your Highness, none.

122
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,400
Your Highness.

123
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,210
Without Mrs. Chen here,

124
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,790
there’s no way to confront.

125
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,110
In my humble opinion,

126
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,740
the case will have to be put on hold.

127
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,409
When we find Chen,

128
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,570
we'll reopen the case.

129
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:39,780
No rush.

130
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,640
Your Highness.

131
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,740
Mrs. Chen is here.

132
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,530
You may proceed.

133
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,030
Mrs. Chen!

134
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,170
How dare you falsely accuse Taihe Pharmacy!

135
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,240
Will you confess?

136
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,820
I am wronged!

137
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,050
I know nothing!

138
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,100
If you don’t know anything,

139
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,980
why would someone want to kill you?

140
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,090
Now no one is

141
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,070
protecting you.

142
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,020
I suggest you

143
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,190
speak honestly.

144
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,840
Your Highness.

145
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,030
I confess!

146
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,240
Please spare my life!

147
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,020
The day before yesterday,

148
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,950
someone gave me 500 taels of silver

149
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,060
and asked me to take my mother-in-law

150
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:27,820
to Taihe Pharmacy

151
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,200
and see Physician Li.

152
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,530
That night, after

153
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,260
my mother-in-law drank the medicine,

154
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,060
I was asked to feed my mother-in-law

155
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,950
the medicine someone gave me.

156
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,240
I was told that’s a cure.

157
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,740
But later…

158
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,700
Later after my mother-in-law

159
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,240
drank the medicine, she…

160
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,200
I was terrified.

161
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,930
So I went to Shuntian Prefecture

162
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,180
and made a complaint.

163
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,200
Your Highness.

164
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,330
I’m telling the truth.

165
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,110
There’s no lie in this at all.

166
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,130
You killed Physician Li!

167
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,909
You murdered people for money!

168
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,820
Spare me, Your Highness!

169
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,460
Mrs. Chen.

170
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,650
Do you know

171
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,700
who gave you the money?

172
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,450
I don’t know.

173
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,130
I don’t know. I don’t know.

174
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,190
Chen!

175
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,420
You got your mother-in-law killed.

176
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,170
And to get away with it,

177
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,750
you framed Taihe Pharmacy!

178
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,320
You deserve to die!

179
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,150
Taihe Pharmacy was wrongly accused.

180
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,360
Now I hereby find

181
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,410
Taihe Pharmacy

182
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,460
not guilty of any crime in this case!

183
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,570
-Sir Beigong.
-Yunxi!

184
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,419
Your Highness.

185
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,500
This case is full of doubts.

186
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,760
We can't just let it go.

187
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:39,280
Go back with me.

188
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,320
Thank you, Your Highness.

189
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,190
It’s alright.

190
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,040
Why don’t you go back home?

191
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,190
But,

192
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,420
this thing will eventually

193
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,350
get to my father.

194
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,340
Maybe you can tell him ahead,

195
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,800
so he won’t be mad about it.

196
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,860
Let’s go back.

197
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:20,820
Sir.

198
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,860
How are we going to

199
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,520
report to Her Royal Highness?

200
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,070
Prince Qin was here,

201
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,110
if I didn’t judge the case as the way he wanted,

202
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,570
I would lose my official post.

203
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,610
I’m…sorry…sorry.

204
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,610
I didn’t mean to.

205
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,200
Did your family

206
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,450
offend someone?

207
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,070
Why would you say that?

208
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,530
This case

209
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,240
was supposed to be handled

210
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,220
by Shuntian Prefecture.

211
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,710
But it was given to the Highest Judiciary.

212
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,430
From what I know about Mrs. Han,

213
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,670
she shouldn’t offend any high powers.

214
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,320
But the Highest Judiciary

215
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,360
was eager to close the case.

216
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,240
And the one who behind this

217
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,030
is someone big.

218
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:24,920
Number one,

219
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,700
this person can control the Highest Judiciary.

220
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,240
Number two,

221
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,710
this person isn’t afraid of offending me.

222
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,190
Maybe you are

223
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,700
overthinking this.

224
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,900
Isn’t it Her Royal Highness?

225
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,580
How is that possible?

226
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,100
Her Royal Highness just

227
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,530
summoned me yesterday.

228
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,420
If she wanted to do me harm,

229
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,300
why would she make me

230
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,650
marry you?

231
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,650
Your Highnesses.

232
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,450
Hang on.

233
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,320
Hurts.

234
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,740
You’re not healed yet so clumsy.

235
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,190
Here.

236
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,590
White Jade Plaster!

237
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,310
It’s really hard to get.

238
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,360
How did you find it?

239
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,720
Your Highness.

240
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,300
Our Prince specially went to

241
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,700
His Majesty and got this.

242
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,700
You talk too much.

243
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,300
Why are you laughing?

244
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,110
You are so nice to me.

245
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,780
Your Royal Highness.

246
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,910
You can’t even get this small job done.

247
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,400
Sir Beigong.

248
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,250
You’re a disgrace

249
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,400
to your position.

250
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,220
Your Royal Highness.

251
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,150
Princess Qin is such a bully.

252
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,940
If I hadn't taken the opportunity

253
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,210
to pin the crime

254
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,200
on Chen,

255
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,100
I'm afraid that Princess Qin

256
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,890
would not give up

257
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,610
on this matter.

258
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,900
Looks like

259
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,780
I underestimated

260
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,280
that girl Han.

261
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,660
Your Royal Highness.

262
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,650
Should we

263
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,030
think of something

264
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,330
and teach that girl a lesson?

265
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,320
No need.

266
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,030
As long as

267
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,200
she received my warning.

268
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,400
I just want her to read the sign.

269
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,530
In case

270
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,360
she thought she can rely on Prince Qin

271
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,490
and forget her limit.

272
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:12,020
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

273
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,950
What should I do?

274
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,880
The Dowager is pushing me harder,

275
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,610
while Prince Qin is nicer to me.

276
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,650
Mother,

277
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,200
could you tell me

278
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,150
what I should do?

279
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,700
Fall asleep?

280
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,780
You and Ningjing

281
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,980
poisoned me last time,

282
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,420
and I haven’t repaid the debt.

283
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,490
Now is

284
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,110
the best time.

285
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,320
Who is it?

286
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,030
Ghost! Ghost!

287
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,820
Ghost!

288
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,460
You are my princess.

289
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,660
How inappropriate this is!

290
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,370
Get down.

291
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,030
No.

292
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,150
There is a ghost.

293
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:47,980
It’s too ugly.

294
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,550
Who are you saying ugly?

295
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,190
It’s you?

296
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,940
Who are you trying to scare in the middle

297
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,670
of night by dressing like this?

298
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,820
You evil woman!

299
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,620
I haven’t blamed you for poisoning me,

300
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,020
and you accused me first.

301
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,400
You…behave yourself.

302
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,270
You are a master of Tang family.

303
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,620
Where is your manner?

304
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,730
I’m your brother’s

305
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,130
wife, Princess Qin,

306
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,340
your sister-in-law,

307
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,360
-how could you call me evil?
-You!

308
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:19,950
Tang Li.

309
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,320
Go change your clothes first.

310
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,210
Brother.

311
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,520
You’re defending her?

312
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,780
Of course, he is my husband.

313
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,060
I’m so pissed! I’m so pissed!

314
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,070
I’m so pissed!

315
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,200
Follow me.

316
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,320
Yes!

317
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,900
This is not a good time for being boy-crazy.

318
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,350
I need to be serious.

319
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,460
This time, I must see it.

I was bathing

345
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,310
and dressing His Highness.

346
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,510
Although he has many scars on his body,

347
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,010
one burn is the most

348
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,030
serious.

349
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,340
How did he get that wound?

350
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,490
His Highness's scar

351
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,740
is a long story.

352
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,450
Your Majesty.

353
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,210
I've already divined

354
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,290
the fate of His Highness,

355
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,540
which will impact the fate of the state.

356
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,150
How dare you!

357
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,150
Forgive me.

358
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,320
Since Feiye was born,

359
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,500
six counties of south are suffering from drought,

360
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,610
which is a bad omen.

361
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,910
Please, Your Majesty, decree an order

362
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,780
and send Feiye out of the palace.

363
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,700
But he

364
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,190
is my son after all.

365
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,990
I know

366
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,280
you love your son.

367
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,110
But the astrologer

368
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,320
wouldn’t dare to joke about state’s fate.

369
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,680
Please, Your Majesty,

370
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,660
consider it.

371
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,990
♫ There's no cure for parting ♫

372
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,940
♫ Man has a heart while heaven doesn’t ♫

373
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,610
♫ When the clouds are gone ♫

374
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:48,130
♫ Leave the moon sighing ♫

375
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,030
Pass my will.

376
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,610
Send Feiye

377
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,650
out of the palace tonight.

378
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,780
♫ Listen to the wind crying in the night ♫

379
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,650
♫ Every flower turns to mud ♫

380
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,060
♫ Even the rain is soft ♫

381
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:27,030
♫ Singing what day again with a lonely shadow ♫

382
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,400
♫ One can do nothing but yearning ♫

383
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,530
♫ Listening to wind and drowning in memories♫

384
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,950
♫ Grew a wisp of gray hair ♫

385
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,740
♫ All these years later ♫

♫ I wish you could ♫

387
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,700
♫ Remember it all ♫

388
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:49,530
♫ It keeps raining and my eyes get blurred ♫

389
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,740
♫ While the past gets clearer ♫

390

♫ A good physician can’t change destiny ♫

392
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:03,740
Feiye.

393
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,780
I’m useless.

394
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,970
They blamed the drought

395
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:12,610
on a

396
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,110
newborn child.

397
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,530
Ridiculous.

398
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,130
Born in a royal family,

399
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,180
there aren’t a lot of alternatives.

400
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,650
It’s just Her Highness and Prince Qin

401
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:23,990
had to

402
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,610
be parted

403
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,610
for more than ten years.

404
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,130
Before the late king died,

405
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,950
Her Highness got an edict

406
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,780
to let Prince Qin come back.

407
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,820
But on the day he got back,

408
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,450
the palace was on fire.

409
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,570
And it’s a dry day.

410
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,320
The fire was unable to be controlled.

411
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,320
Except Prince Qin,

412
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,740
the rest people were all burned to death.

413
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,570
As soon as the edict was there,

414
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,650
the palace was on fire.

415
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,180
Don’t you think that’s

416
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,240
very suspicious?

417
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,200
Is there any possibility that

418
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,020
Her Royal Highness set the fire?

419
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,570
There is no evidence

420
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,070
to support that.

421
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,070
The Dowager

422
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,820
may be the one behind the fire.

423
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,150
If so,

424
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,420
it makes a lot of sense she wants me

425
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,950
to find the windclan tattoo

426
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,740
on Prince Qin’s body.

427
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,020
She must want to

428
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,810
do something

429
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,520
about Prince Qin’s identity.

430
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,700
No way.

431
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,620
The Dowager may have already suspected

432
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,280
the windclan tattoo was gone.

433
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,380
She wants to use me

434
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,580
to find the evidence.

435
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,950
And then accuses Prince Qin

436
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,420
for not being the bloodline of royal family.

437
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,180
This evil old woman,

438
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,150
so vicious!

439
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,300
Her son is already

440
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,450
the king now.

441
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,560
And she’s still thinking about
slandering Prince Qin.

442
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,200
But if I keep avoiding her

443
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,190
and not going to meet her,

444
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,450
she might

445
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,780
use more vicious moves

446
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,110
to against my family

447
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,650
and Prince Qin.

448
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,280
Yunxi, wake up.

449
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,320
Yunxi.

450
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,490
Yunxi.

451
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,360
Look at you now.

452
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,780
Hideous.

453
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,530
I know, I know.

454
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,780
Yunxi, wake up.

455
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,530
Wake up!

456
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,100
Laying down here and thinking about him

457
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,290
is useless.

458
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,030
You need to move.

459
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,320
Get up!

460
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,010
If I were you,

461
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,330
I would move now.

462
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,700
Make yourself pretty.

463
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,570
Wherever he shows up,

464
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,220
you should be there and shine.

465
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,580
You need to make his heart and eyes

466
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,900
focus on you only.

467
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,050
I’m sleepy.

468
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,630
You have fun with yourself.

469
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,280
Yunxi.

470
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,320
Ningjing.

471
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,580
His Highness

472
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,210
isn’t like

473
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,240
Tang Li.

474
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,210
If I keep

475
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:14,860
showing up in front

476
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,290
of him,

477
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,540
he will feel annoyed.

478
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,050
These men.

479
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:20,860
Why can’t they

480
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,990
be nice to us?

481
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,740
Is it going to kill them?

482
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,700
Maybe it is.

483
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,150
Yunxi.

484
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,820
Don’t worry.

485
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,490
If you

486
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,570
get cast out,

487
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,220
you can come to Yunkong with me.

488
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,170
I’m telling you.

489
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:37,810
You’re

490
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,190
smart and pretty.

491
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,540
All my senior and junior brothers

492
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,740
will like you a lot.

493
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:42,930
Trust me.

494
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,690
By then,

495
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,540
all my brothers,

496
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,980
no matter tall or short, fat or thin,

497
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,040
they are all yours.

498
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:48,930
Quit it.

499
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,780
You think this is like

500
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,710
selecting cabbages in the market?

501
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,110
Ningjing.

502
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,270
I want to ask you a question.

503
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,650
If you have someone you like,

504
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:02,810
but

505
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,810
you have

506
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,250
your reasons

507
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,400
to lie to him,

508
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,210
however, you don’t want to

509
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,370
lie to him,

510
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,350
what will you do?

511
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,170
Wait.

512
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:11,990
Let me think.

513
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,400
I have someone I like a lot.

514
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,360
That should be Tang Li.

515
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,490
I really like him.

516
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,820
But I have to lie to him.

517
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,240
Yunxi.

518
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,030
Why are you so kind?

519
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,370
I know

520
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,250
you are trying

521
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,730
to persuade me

522
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,540
and telling me

523
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,020
that Tang Li ran away from our wedding

524
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,700
was because he had his reasons,

525
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,240
right?

526
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,240
But,

527
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,130
he did wrong thing first

528
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,060
and he hurt my feelings.

529
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:43,700
That’s his mistake.

530
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,460
No matter what reasons he has,

531
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,720
I will not forgive him.

532
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,600
He really does have a compelling reason?

533
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:02,740
Does he

534
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,480
have terminally illness?

535
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:20,820
Ningjing.

536
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,190
I’m sorry.

537
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,750
I don’t have much time left.

538
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,340
I can't go on spoiling your life any longer.

539
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,530
But do remember.

540
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,490
I love you.

541
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,320
In afterlife,

542
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,240
let’s get married.

543
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,570
No way.

544
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,020
He is in perfect health.

545
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,150
He can run that fast.

546
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,130
Is it because

547
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,450
he has some serious enemies?

548
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:10,940
Ningjing.

549
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,320
I'm sorry.

550
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,140
I can't take care of you anymore.

551
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,150
From now on,

552
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,820
I have to be on the run by myself.

553
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,610
But do remember.

554
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,700
I love you.

555
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,190
In afterlife, let’s get married.

556
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,900
No way.

557
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,290
If that’s the case,

558
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,940
my father would have told me.

559
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,700
Forget it. Whatever.

560
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,650
Go.

561
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,860
Tang Li.

562
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,410
Why are you

563
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,030
looking so pathetic?

564
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,650
It's a long story.

565
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,360
Is there something wrong?

566
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:58,900
Of course.

567
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,140
Otherwise, why

568
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,400
would I not stay at home

569
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,400
but come here?

570
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,090
If you have any problem,

571
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,490
I hope you can tell me.

572
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,990
When it comes to you,

573
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,200
I will do everything I can to help you.

574
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,860
Anything?

575
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,610
We're practically married,

576
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,740
so we should help each other.

577
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:20,900
We...we…

578
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,360
We are not married.

579
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,010
You…

580
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,990
It’s not up to you.

581
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,140
What is it?

582
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,320
Just tell me.

583
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,650
Well…

584
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,200
Can you

585
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,030
just leave me alone?

586
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,860
What do you mean?

587
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,570
Wait.

588
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,650
Don’t cry. Don’t cry.

589
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,780
I’ll stop it.

590
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,570
I respect your decision.

591
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,250
And I hope

592
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,950
you can respect mine too.

593
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,650
I’ve decided

594
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,590
that I will be with you forever.

595
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:57,890
No, no, no.

596
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,540
Alright, I’ll just be frank.

597
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,700
Go ahead.

598
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,360
Ningjing.

599
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,690
My betrothal to you

600
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,280
is the will of the elders.

601
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,140
We just go about our lives,

602
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,110
isn’t it better?

603
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,530
To be honest,

604
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,820
when I look at you, I get scared.

605
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,610
Look at my shaking hands.

606
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,780
Do you really hate me that much?

607
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,900
It's not hate; it's fear.

608
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,180
That's not possible.

609
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,100
You must have unspeakable reasons.

610
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:29,820
Otherwise,

611
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,570
you shouldn’t cry.

612
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,890
I just

613
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,050
got sand in my eyes.

614
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,430
That’s why I was crying.

615
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,490
Tang Li.

616
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,820
You jerk!

617
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,900
You bully me.

618
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,610
Stop!

619
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,540
If you leave,

620
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,980
I’ll never talk to you again!

621
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,770
Thank you!

622
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,740
Tang Li!

623
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,940
[Palace of Benevolence and Longevity]

624
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,380
Your Royal Highness.

625
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,860
Finally, you decided to show up.

626
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,740
Your Royal Highness.

627
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,890
I was badly hurt

628
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,190
and got cold.

629
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,030
Although, I was delayed,

630
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,990
I got Prince Qin’s trust.

631
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:17,780
And I found out

632
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,030
the thing you want.

633
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,200
Keep talking.

634
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,730
I did see

635
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,510
Prince Qin’s windclan tattoo.

636
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,490
Where is it?

637
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,500
Left side of lower back.

638
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,030
What does it look like?

639
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,720
Like the wings of an eagle,

640
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,190
soaring in the sky.

641
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,780
Good.

642
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,180
Fortunately, I am resourceful

643
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,240
and well prepared.

644
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,190
Yunxi.

645
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,930
This time,

646
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,200
I’m satisfied with your work.

647
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,190
Come here.

648
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,070
You may sit.

649
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,060
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

650
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,370
It’s just

651
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,820
I wonder

652
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,000
where is my mother, Lady Tianxin?

653
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,900
Can I see her?

654
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,530
All I have is your word.

655
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,990
How am I supposed to know

656
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,400
you’re telling the truth or not?

657
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,420
Your Royal Highness.

658
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,250
That’s not

659
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,190
our deal.

660
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,070
How dare you!

661
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,400
You

662
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,400
little Princess Qin

663
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,400
dare to confront me?

664
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:22,970
Do you think

665
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,880
you have the position to bargain?

666
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:28,330
You spy on Prince Qin

667
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,740
and work for me.

668
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,320
If Prince Qin knows about it,

669
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,770
how long

670
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,700
do you think you can stay there?

671
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,580
And about your mother-in-law,

672
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,170
I know her a lot.

673
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,490
She can’t tolerate such thing.

674
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,370
If she knows her baby boy

675
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,900
is being set up like this,

676
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,450
you’ll be dead.

677
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,070
I was impatient.

678
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,780
Please forgive me.

679
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,570
Relax.

680
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:02,070
When I find out you’re right,

681
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,610
I'll give you

682
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,720
the information about Lady Tianxin.

683
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,400
However,

684
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,860
you’re not going to

685
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,510
leave Prince Qin’s Mansion any time soon,

686
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,050
so, you just

687
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,780
stay there well

688
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,770
and

689
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,400
report to me about Prince Qin’s moves.

690
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,280
Yes.

691
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,450
Remember.

692
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,950
Your mother’s life

693
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,990
is on my hand.

694
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,650
I want you to die,

695
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,450
you die.

696
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,950
I want you to live,

697
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,150
then you may live.

698
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,700
Understand?

699
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,030
Yes.

700
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,500
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

701
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,570
Long Feiye got up before 5 am.

702
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,550
Practiced skills between 5 to 7 am.

703
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,650
Went to court after breakfast.

704
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,070
Ate lunch between 9 to 11 am.

705
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,780
Fell asleep after 7 pm.

706
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,570
Nothing unusual.

707
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,340
Long Feiye got back from the court

708
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,470
and went to Fushou Restaurant for tea.

709
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,950
He came back after 9 am

710
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,670
and brought a box of cakes with him.

711
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,380
He gave five pieces of cake to Consort Yi

712
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,490
and two to me.

713
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,700
I miss Long Feiye.

714
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,300
I haven’t seen him

715
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,900
the whole day.

716
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,190
Whatever.

717
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,400
I can just make things up.

718
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,080
Your Highness.

719
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,239
Our princess

720
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,949
is quite a story teller.

721
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:31,449
But she is not

722
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,610
a good spy.

723
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,150
Send it.

724
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,190
Yes.

725
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,740
I’m sending the message.

726
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,810
This is the

727
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,860
message from Prince Qin’s Mansion.

728
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,990
Tell Han Yunxi,

729
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,490
if there isn’t

730
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,740
anything important,

731
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,900
then no need to send the message.

732
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,030
Yes.

733
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,950
Your Royal Highness.

734
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,210
Stand up.

735
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,320
Thank you.

736
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:45,950
Concubine Qing.

737
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,570
What are you reading?

738
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,290
While I am not

739
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,860
servicing my king,

740
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,750
I copy this sutra for blessing.

741
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,410
I pray for your

742
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,860
long and healthy life.

743
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,210
This is a tradition

744
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,530
of Xiqiu women.

745
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,000
Although I am married to Tianning State,

746
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,050
the rules

747
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,280
still apply.

748
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:17,070
I've been chanting for more than ten days.

749
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,710
And I plan to chant for a year

750
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,190
to get blessings for you.

751
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,270
You are so considerate.

752
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,860
Are you used to

753
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,910
living in this Qinghui Palace?

754
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,780
With your blessing,

755
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,450
I am good here.

756
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,700
If you need anything,

757
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,400
you can tell me.

758
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,990
You are married here.

759
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,860
This is your home.

760
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,900
Don't be too formal.

761
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,530
Tianning isn’t like Xiqiu.

762
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,950
It’s cold here.

763
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,570
Take care of yourself.

764
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,890
I’ll send

765
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,610
some clothes here.

766
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,820
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

767
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,370
I’m just passing by.

768
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,500
Nothing important.

769
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,900
Go back to your business.

770
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,360
Your Royal Highness.

771
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:20,720
Your Highness.

772
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,740
Her Royal Highness suddenly came here,

773
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,360
was she testing us?

774
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,800
Only with Her Royal Highness's trust

775
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,110
can we make a stand in this place.

776
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:34,860
Well,

777
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,110
doing superficial effort

778
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,150
is not enough.

779
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,190
Concubine Qing is clever.

780
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,860
Looks like she’s sincerely

781
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,070
making peace.

782
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,190
I hope so.

783
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,820
If she’s disloyal

784
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,320
and still could act like this,

785
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,740
then she is terrible.

786
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,190
Uncle.

787
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,880
What's the matter with calling me urgently?

788
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,860
[General Baili Yuanlong already secretly went to the tavern
that we did business. Waiting for your instruction.]

789
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,030
Uncle.

790
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,970
Did Prince Qin

791
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,170
find the evidence

792
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,820
about us with the officials?

793
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,740
No, he didn’t.

794
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,130
It just

795
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,110
proved my speculation.

796
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:31,990
Tianmo.

797
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,930
I've been dealing with

798
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,360
account books lately.

799
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,110
I called you here

800
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,860
to tell you

801
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,820
that Prince Qin is very cautious.

802
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,930
He has got

803
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:42,950
his eye on us now.

804
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,410
Do not

805
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,900
make any sudden big moves

806
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,830
and make him suspicious

807
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,820
about the murders.

808
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:57,500
[Prince Qin]

809
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,700
[Long Feiye gets up early and falls asleep late.
Does he ever feel tired or sleepy? It’s bad for health.]

♫If this world fades♫

811
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,820

On the court after 3 am tomorrow.

Who are you to look at my things?

822
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,350
Give it back.

823
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,320
Who am I?

824
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,520
The whole mansion is mine.

825

You are mine as well.

826
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,620
And you’re asking me who I am.

827
