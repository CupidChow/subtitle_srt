00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,020
Episode 40

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,070
Archers! Listen!

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:08,820
Release!

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,080
I’m asking you to release.

6
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,290
Your Highness.

7
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,360
We are trapped.

8
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,950
It really is Long Feiye.

9
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:45,990
Long Feiye.

10
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,190
You finally appear.

11
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,070
Tianhui,

12
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,450
tell me your request.

13
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,530
It’s simple.

14
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,360
You retreat

15
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,400
and I let her go.

16
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,290
Feiye,

17
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,530
go on without me.

18
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,150
Mother!

19
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,110
Long Feiye,

20
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,450
think it clearly.

21
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,280
Your mother is in my hands.

22
00:01:10,539 --> 00:01:11,950
If you dare to hurt her,

23
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,670
I promise you will come to a bad end.

24
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,950
If you dare to act rashly,

25
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,700
I will kill your mother.

26
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:31,990
Retreat!

27
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,660
-Your Majesty.
-Consort Yi.

28
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,650
Don’t come.

29
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,200
Feiye,

30
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,700
do as you wish.

31
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,030
Leave me alone.

32
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,780
Mother!

33
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,320
Consort Yi

34
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:09,360
Mother!

35
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:15,900
Mother!

36
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:19,740
Mother!

37
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,490
Mother!

38
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,610
Feiye,

39
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,860
I’m satisfied.

40
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,400
I have you

41
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,240
with me these years.

42
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,700
That’s enough.

43
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:50,950
Mother.

44
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,320
Mother.

45
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,570
Long Feiye.

46
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,740
So you are the infected.

47
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,340
Your Majesty.

48
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:32,730
Qingwu,

49
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,530
take His Majesty away from here.

50
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,660
-Your Majesty.
-Come on.

51
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,290
Your Majesty.

52
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,150
-Go.
-Hurry!

53
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,070
Yunxi.

54
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,740
Physician Gu.

55
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,280
Yunxi.

56
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,700
Come with me. Quickly.

57
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,510
I’ll wait for my mother.

58
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,649
Consort Yi already died.

59
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,030
Yunxi, listen.

60
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,650
Prince Qin is at war

61
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,570
with the guards.

62
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,690
The palace is in chaos.

63
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,550
We have to find some way to get out.

64
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,440
Your Highness.

65
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,400
It’s terrible.

66
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,180
Prince Qin has taken his men

67
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,450
into Shenwumen.

68
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:53,930
You said

69
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,330
it's the crown prince, didn’t you?

70
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,060
It’s the crown prince at the beginning.

71
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,150
But later it became Prince Qin.

72
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,690
It’s Prince Qin.

73
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,100
He used Crown Prince as a guise.

74
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,890
Your Highness.

75
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,540
I’m afraid the king will be another person.

76
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,860
What should we do?

77
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,940
Your Highness.

78
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,740
Rise.

79
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,410
At the command of His Majesty,

80
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,330
I’m here taking Your Highness

81
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,460
to meet His Majesty.

82
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,340
Your Majesty.

83
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,740
Prince Qin and his men keep pressing on.

84
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,280
We can’t stop them.

85
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,090
Now they are outside Qinzheng Hall.

86
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,090
Your Majesty, Your Highnesses,

87
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,750
Princess, please withdraw as soon as possible.

88
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:42,940
Your Majesty.

89
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,700
Her Royal Highness

90
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,180
is unwilling to leave with me.

91
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,050
Your Majesty.

92
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,380
I’m really sorry for it.

93
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,240
Mother is unwilling to leave.

94
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,130
Your Majesty.

95
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,060
Just leave them alone.

96
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,540
We have to leave now. Your Majesty.

97
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,860
Yes, Your Majesty.

98
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,190
Come on.

99
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,510
Or it’ll be too late.

100
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

101
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,050
Your Majesty. Bad news.

102
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,290
Her Royal Highness passes away.

103
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,200
Grandmother.

104
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,390
What should we do?

105
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,450
Your Majesty.

106
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,360
Mother.

107
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,320
My son,

108
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,990
I am a sinful person.

109
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,360
I set fire to the temporary palace

110
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,840
to make sure you could ascend the throne.

111
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,190
The real Long Feiye died in the fire.

112
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,290
This fake one

113
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,110
is for revenge.

114
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,860
That’s my punishment.

115
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,490
Tianning’s rule ends.

116
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,450
I am too ashamed to live.

117
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,820
So I have to leave

118
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:46,340
[Last Words of Dowager]

119
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,360
to apologize to your father.

120
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,700
Last words from mother.

121
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,240
Mother.

122
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,650
Why did you do that?

123
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:03,940
Your Majesty.

124
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,450
Prince Qin’s forces

125
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,260
are breaking through the inner city.

126
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,570
Leaving

127
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,150
is our only choice.

128
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,580
Your Majesty.

129
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,460
Your Majesty.

130
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,240
Please take care.

131
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,260
Your Majesty,

132
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,820
only if we are alive,

133
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,320
we’ll

134
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,400
have the chance to revenge.

135
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,450
Your Majesty.

136
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,450
Go! Go!

137
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,440
Your Highness.

138
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,170
Tianhui

139
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,320
ran away to Xijing.

140
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,280
Your Highness.

141
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,130
I’d like to take my men

142
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,010
to attack Xijing

143
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,780
and kill Tianhui

144
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,860
for you.

145
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:46,650
Report!

146
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,000
Your Highness.

147
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,530
Our forces in the Southern Regions have controlled

148
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,940
all entrances of the capital.

149
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,220
When I took my men

150
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,810
to pursue the rest forces of Tianhui,

151
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:54,700
they even used

152
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,010
the children and women to threaten us.

153
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,820
I dared not to act rashly.

154
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,740
So I have to

155
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,740
let them go.

156
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,700
But in this case,

157
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,530
it’ll be very hard for us

158
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,030
to catch Tianhui again.

159
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,570
Our aim

160
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,530
is to overthrow the tyranny of Tianhui,

161
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,180
so that the ordinary people

162
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,650
can live a peaceful life.

163
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,990
Sun, you are right.

164
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,600
Your Highness.

165
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,710
It’s time to take medicine.

166
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,680
Be careful.

167
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,400
Your Highness,

168
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,070
everything is generally settled.

169
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,130
Don't make yourself

170
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,190
as hard as before.

171
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,090
If your poison

172
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,250
attacks again,

173
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,700
the consequences would be unimaginable.

174
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,960
You’d better

175
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,530
take a good rest now.

176
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,430
I have to go

177
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,870
to worship the ancestors

178
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,420
of Qinxi and mother

179
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,930
tomorrow morning.

180
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,450
Yes.

181
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,820
Father, mother,

182
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,130
I didn’t disappoint

183
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,460
the ancestors of Qinxi .

184
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,860
How about

185
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,480
the funeral of Consort Yi?

186
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,550
Mother has been loyal to Tianning even at the end.

187
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,700
I believe she’s more willing

188
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,350
to be with the late king.

189
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,280
Bury her

190
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,980
in the imperial mausoleum of Tianning.

191
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,530
Okay.

192
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,910
We will deal with it.

193
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,030
Remember.

194
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,600
An elaborate funeral.

195
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,060
Write down on the gravestone

196
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,320
“Deceased mother Consort Yi.

197
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,610
Son Long Feiye.”

198
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,110
25 years ago,

199
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,260
the traitor usurped the throne.

200
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,110
Qinxi collapsed.

201
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,650
Today,

202
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,570
as the descendants of Qinxi, we drove the usurpers

203
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,590
and the empire is recovered

204
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,240
It goes with the nature

205
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,740
as well as the people.

206
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:27,740
Our royal family of Qinxi will rise.

207
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,860
Long live the empire.

208
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,130
Your Highness,

209
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:43,930
after the information

210
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,370
“Tianhui is creating the infected

211
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,370
by using common people” spread,

212
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,410
the common people all support you.

213
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,570
I think you should

214
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,610
comply with the aspirations of the people

215
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,420
and take the opportunity to ascend the throne.

216
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,650
I second that!

217
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:55,950
I second that!

218
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,950
Tianhui escaped

219
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,920
to Xijing and made it the capital.

220
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,470
Qinxi is still not unified.

221
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,490
It’s too early to ascend the throne.

222
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,610
Feiye.

223
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,090
You can ascend the throne

224
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,210
when you have a great many supporters.

225
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,330
Xijing is just a small place.

226
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,140
We can regain it

227
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,070
some day.

228
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,610
I have my plan.

229
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,820
No more discussion.

230
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,280
Your Highness.

231
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:21,770
Feiye.

232
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,380
-Call the physician.
-Are you alright?

233
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,950
Call the physician.

234
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,400
Han Yunxi.

235
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,500
Physician Gu.

236
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,560
Where is Han Yunxi?

237
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,370
She is not in.

238
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,130
Not in?

239
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,060
Where did she go?

240
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,370
She seemed to

241
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,820
gather herbs in the mountain.

242
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,110
Gather herbs?

243
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,470
Which mountain?

244
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,650
I have no idea.

245
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,740
She lives in your house.

246
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,470
How can’t you know where she is?

247
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,450
Right.

248
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,890
You are from Poison Master’s family too.

249
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,100
You also should be helpful.

250
00:14:59,100 --> 00:14:59,650
Come with me.

251
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,290
Mr. Tang.

252
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,010
What’s wrong?

253
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:01,780
Save a life.

254
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:20,950
How is he?

255
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,300
According to His Highness’s situation,

256
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,290
I can only find a way

257
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,290
to make him awake.

258
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,610
I can do nothing else.

259
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,260
It’s all my fault.

260
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:32,970
He’s poisoned

261
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,170
in the marrow.

262
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:34,930
But he still kept working

263
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:35,740
without rest.

264
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,210
I shouldn’t have listened to him.

265
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,070
I should force him to take a break.

266
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,490
He’s awake.

267
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,360
Feiye.

268
00:15:59,140 --> 00:15:59,820
Feiye.

269
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,960
You are finally awake.

270
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,400
Your Highness.

271
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,240
Physician Gu.

272
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,180
Why are you still in the capital?

273
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,820
Where is Yunxi?

274
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,880
Your Highness.

275
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,610
We heard Consort Yi

276
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:18,930
was taken away

277
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,130
on our way out of town.

278
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,260
Yunxi was trying to save Consort Yi,

279
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,530
so we returned.

280
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,740
But we failed.

281
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,050
The capital is now

282
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,500
under the rule of Your Highness.

283
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,330
There should be no place

284
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,650
safer than the capital.

285
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,780
So Yunxi and I

286
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,700
chose to stay.

287
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:34,650
Why are you

288
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:35,700
getting worse?

289
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,360
I can make it.

290
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,110
No big deal.

291
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,340
Your Highness, you should take care

292
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,460
and have a good rest.

293
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,120
Don’t hurt yourself anymore.

294
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,450
Thank you.

295
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,900
Actually I need you

296
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,820
to do one thing for me.

297
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,000
Your Highness,

298
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,090
please just go ahead.

299
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,200
What is it?

300
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,200
After the war,

301
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,550
many soldiers get injured.

302
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,410
But now I don’t have reliable people

303
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,069
in Imperial Hospital.

304
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:12,609
So I’d like to invite you

305
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:14,210
to work in Imperial Hospital

306
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,859
and cure them.

307
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:20,060
Your Highness, you show solicitude for the people.

308
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,490
We are really lucky.

309
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,190
I will take it as my bounden duty.

310
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,900
Thank you.

311
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,240
I’m leaving.

312
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,400
By the way,

313
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,090
Yunxi is trying to find a way

314
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,240
to detoxify you.

315
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,450
Maybe there is a way.

316
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,820
There are too many affairs to do.

317
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,860
But I’m afraid

318
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,950
I can’t care about everything.

319
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,200
You need to learn

320
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,060
how to deal with the affairs.

321
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:08,780
Feiye.

322
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,650
Don’t worry.

323
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:10,210
I will help you

324
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,200
for some time.

325
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,260
Anyway, you have to recover early.

326
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,290
I’m inexperienced

327
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,620
in handling government affairs,

328
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,820
you know?

329
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,100
As the descendants of the Xuanyuan family,

330
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,490
we have to

331
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:24,420
make contribution to the peace of the common people.

332
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,460
Just because you are inexperienced,

333
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,260
you need to put greater efforts.

334
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,200
It’s been years.

335
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,220
You should concentrate on working.

336
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,170
Feiye,

337
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,450
only if you can get better,

338
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,050
I can do anything as you wish.

339
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,700
At your leisure, huh?

340
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,870
Find a moment of leisure in a busy life.

341
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,950
I’ve promised Prince Qin

342
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,720
to work in Imperial Hospital from tomorrow.

343
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,570
He asked me to cure

344
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,070
the injured soldiers.

345
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,490
I’m a physician.

346
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,590
I didn’t have any excuse to refuse.

347
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,330
What’s more,

348
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,900
we need money to afford

349
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,400
our daily demands.

350
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,770
Gu.

351
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,260
You don’t need to explain it to me.

352
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,130
I told you

353
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,210
we are friends

354
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,940

to leave. Enjoy your rest.

530
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,780
Take care.

531
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,320
Your Majesty.

532
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,780
Poisoning Manual.

533
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,070
Your Majesty.

534
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,900
Since Baili Mingxiang

535
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,700
lived in my old house,

536
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,490
she has been studying this

537
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:08,740
all the time.

538
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,570
I thought

539
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:11,900
Baili Mingxiang

540
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,190
would probably be useful.

541
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:17,240
So I couldn’t take it forcibly.

542
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,650
And on her moving,

543
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,030
I copied one.

544
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,570
I believe there is a great secret

545
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,490
in the Manual.

546
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,320
You did a good job.

547
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,490
I can’t believe

548
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,740
the last Poisoning Manual

549
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,990
is in Baili Mingxiang’s hand.

550
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,990
We finally have it.

551
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:40,860
Li Quan.

552
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

553
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,700
Call in

554
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,420
all the talented and skillful physicians

555
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,610
you can gather.

556
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,410
Do a thorough research

557
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:50,130
on all the manuals

558
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,180
including those Poison Master left.

559
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,450
I believe

560
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:54,700
we can find a way

561
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,530
to create the infected.

562
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,070
Even making

563
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,650
a half infected

564
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:00,910
like the guy Qinxi left

565
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,030
will be enough for us to defeat them.

566
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,570
Yes. Your Majesty.

567
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,650
Hold on.

568
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,320
Any information about Crown Prince?

569
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,950
Your Majesty,

570
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,260
General Mu Qingwu is still looking for him.

571
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,110
I believe

572
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,280
we will find His Highness soon.

573
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,280
Hurry.

574
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,780
Let me go.

575
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,410
Let me go.

576
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,270
Your Highness.

577
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,180
His Majesty ordered me to take you to him.

578
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,030
No, I won’t go.

579
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,770
General Mu,

580
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,090
please let me go.

581
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:42,950
Your Highness.

582
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,230
Sorry, I can’t obey your order.

583
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,030
No.

584
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:46,860
I won’t go.

585
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,480
He’s gonna kill me.

586
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,170
Please, General Mu.

587
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,050
-Your Highness.
-Please.

588
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:52,930
Please let me go.

589
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:54,260
You are the crown prince

590
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,320
of a state.

591
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,290
How can you be so cowardly

592
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,700
without responsibility?

593
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,280
It’s ridiculous.

594
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,180
Take him away.

595
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,380
I’m the crown prince.

596
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,580
I’m the crown prince.

597
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,260
I’m the crown prince.

598
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,380
I’m the crown prince.

599
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,320
Let go of me.

600
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,950
Let me go.

601
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,150
Let me go.

602
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,100
Your Majesty.

603
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,540
Crown Prince is here.

604
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,860
You can leave now.

605
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,360
You bastard.

606
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,150
I can just forgive you

607
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,430
for all that you did before.

608
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,780
But how can you betray me?

609
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,660
You even cooperated with others to fight against me.

610
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,890
Why did you do that?

611
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:03,650
Tell me!

612
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,240
Why?

613
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,070
You forced me to do so.

614
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,170
You knew

615
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:14,700
Han Yunxi could save me.

616
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,930
But why did you send people

617
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,820
to kill Long Feiye and Han Yunxi?

618
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,660
No one is capable of hurting his own children.

619
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,320
But you are really ruthless.

620
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,070
I was dying

621
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,410
while you used me

622
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:29,070
to fight against your enemy.

623
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:30,860
Father.

624
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,650
If you were me,

625
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,400
what would you do?

626
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,900
That’s your excuse?

627
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,110
Why are you so stupid?

628
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,650
Since I’ve

629
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,740
known how to save you,

630
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,330
why do you think I have to keep

631
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,060
Long Feiye and Han Yunxi alive?

632
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,640
Even if I may be in a slight danger,

633
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,860
as a father,

634
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,200
you shouldn’t take the risk.

635
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,610
Our relationship

636
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:57,070
becomes like this.

637
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,030
It’s not others’ fault.

638
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,130
You can only blame we both were born

639
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:06,110
as a traitor.

640
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:09,929
Grandfather got the thorn in the same way

641
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:11,590
by betraying the king, right?

642
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,820
You bastard!

643
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:22,650
As long as you’re not stupid,

644
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:23,570
you wouldn’t

645
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,449
be led by the nose by Long Feiye.

646
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:26,940
Retribution.

647
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,030
That’s retribution.

648
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,449
What did you say?

649
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,370
It’s you who defeated Qinxi

650
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,780
and made them lose the home.

651
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,280
Now

652
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,330
we got the punishment.

653
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:38,360
Shut up!

654
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:42,239
It’s all because you showed partiality.

655
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,580
It’s already been like this.

656
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:47,650
I’d like to tell you a secret.

657
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,530
Long Tianqing.

658
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:54,239
I killed him with my own hands.

659
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,400
You killed Tianqing?

660
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,490
Father.

661
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,880
You are disappointed, right?

662
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,570
Noble Consort Xiao

663
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,860
murdered my mother.

664
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,680
And Long Tianqing murdered my uncle.

665
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,230
After that he even tried to kill me.

666
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,910
I’ve tolerated for a long time.

667
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,190
The only thing I feel regret is

668
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,030
I let Long Tianqing die so easily.

669
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,360
Why

670
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,360
did all these happen?

671
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,450
I still remember

672
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:48,070
you were very smart when you were a kid.

673
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:54,610
Your mother is my beloved in my lifetime.

674
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,780
We loved each other very much.

675
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,530
The reason

676
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,060
why I didn’t appoint a queen

677
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,650
is because I have great hopes on you.

678
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:05,780
You know?

679
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,610
Now,

680
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,070
what's the point of saying that?

681
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,450
It’s meaningless.

682
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,130
But you

683
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,790
still need to give an explanation to the people.

684
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,450
Father.

685
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,650
Hope

686
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,570
we won’t be born in a royal family

687
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:50,740
the next life.

688
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,320
Mo.

689
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,150
No.

690
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,570
Help!

691
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,410
Physician.

692
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,860
Hurry.

693
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:06,780
Yes.

694
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:09,820
Mo.

695
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,780
Father.

696
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,610
Please forgive me.

697
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,700
Mo.

698
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,360
Qishao, look.

699
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,890
We haven’t seen

700
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:07,170
so many rare medical herbs

701
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,780
even in Yaogui Valley.

702
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,110
It’s really rare to see.

703
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,700
The root of Traceless Herb

704
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,500
will release unique nutrients,

705
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,090
which will produce many rare herbs

706
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:18,240
around it.

707
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,820
If my guess is right,

708
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,650
Traceless Herb

709
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,310
will absorb the drug property

710
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,530
of other herbs around it

711
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:26,950
before sun rising.

712
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:27,990
If so,

713
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,530
we can stay here tonight.

714
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:30,180
Maybe

715
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,500
we can see it tomorrow morning.

716
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,890
I will go find some firewood

717
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:33,950
and food.

718
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:34,780
Yuze.

719
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,220
You are no longer

720
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:36,940
my subordinate.

721
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,220
You don’t need to take care of me.

722
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:38,770
But…

723
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:39,490
I’m a man.

724
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,980
Let man do this kind of things.

725
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,110
Stay here.

726
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,280
Father.

727
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,140
Crown Prince died

728
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,260
by taking poison.

729
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,610
I always feel Crown Prince died

730
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,860
because His Majesty forced him.

731
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,700
It’s impossible.

732
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,160
Crown Prince must have died for fear of punishment.

733
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:17,870
There is hearsay

734
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,140
that the plague in the Southern Regions

735
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,200
was caused by His Majesty for developing the infected.

736
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,030
Father.

737
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,360
Is it worthy of supporting

738
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,780
such a tyrant?

739
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,110
Qingwu.

740
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,650
You are now

741
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:32,020
the General of Tianning.

742
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,570
You can’t trust the rumors

743
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,430
and shake the morale of our men.

744
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:36,860
Fine.

745
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,880
The thing about the plague is a rumor.

746
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,610
But when we retreated,

747
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:42,740
in order to avoid

748
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,030
Prince Qin’s forces,

749
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,890
His Majesty used thousands of women and children

750
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:47,890
to threaten them.

751
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,240
That’s not a rumor.

752
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,900
Our Mu family have been the subjects

753
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,990
of the Long family for generations.

754
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,570
How do they treat others

755
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,320
is beyond our control.

756
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,010
But His Majesty

757
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,900
is good to us.

758
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,530
We can’t be ungrateful.

759
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,110
What’s more,

760
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,200
you will marry

761
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:11,530
Princess Changbing soon.

762
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,280
We will be of one family.

763
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,400
You have to be faithful.

764
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,490
Let’s go.

765
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,820
[Hall of Virtue]

766
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:43,810
Feiye.

767
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:45,210
Why don’t you take a rest?

768
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,250
You’ve kept reading the documents overnight

769
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,490
or been in a daze with this thing.

770
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:50,290
If you go on like this,

771
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:51,690
you'll wear yourself out

772
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,100
It’s all because of Han Yunxi.

773
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,430
I will take her back now.

774
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:55,950
Stop.

775
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:58,650
Don’t go.

776
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,420
You don’t take a rest but thinking of her

777
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,620
even when you are ill.

778
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,770
I will take her back

779
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:06,340
so that you two can make it clear.

780
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,730
You didn’t kill Poison Master.

781
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:08,610
Why do you bear the charge

782
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:09,810
and make her hate you?

783
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,240
If you go,

784
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,510
I will send you back to Tangmen.

785
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,500
Why can’t you let her know it?

786
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,280
Poison Master has harmed our family.

787
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,360
Let her believe

788
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,560
I’m the one who killed Poison Master.

789
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:23,970
She will feel

790
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:25,110
we are even now.

791
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,780
You really can let her go?

792
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,200
I have to do that.

793
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,620
It’s better than delaying her.

794
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,860
Why did you say so?

795
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:38,570
It’s her

796
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:39,530
who is not good enough for you.

797
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,260
-You don’t delay her.
-Enough.

798
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,280
Your Highness,

799
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:46,650
Bai Xiaochuan and his men

800
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:47,980
already arrived in Xijing.

801
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,650
They are now planning

802
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:49,820
to save Miss Baili.

803
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:51,780
One more thing,

804
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,570
Crown Prince killed himself.
