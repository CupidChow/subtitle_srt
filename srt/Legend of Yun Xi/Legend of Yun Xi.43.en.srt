00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,350
Your Highness? Your Highness?

00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,800
Your Highness? Your Highness?

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,800
Stop looking for him.

Baili Mingxiang?

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:38,970
Why are you here?

10
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,300
Han Yunxi,

11
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,410
you didn’t think it’s me, did you?

12
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,220
The letter was from you?

13
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,090
Yeah.

14
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,220
I could imitate

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,600
Feiye’s handwriting

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,510
a long time ago.

17
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,260
Let go of me!

18
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,110
Come here!

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,680
Let go of me!

20
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,300
Feiye.

21
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,640
What are you doing here?

22
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,120
Your Highness.

23
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:41,740
Princess…

24
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,259
Why are you wearing

25
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:46,259
Yunxi’s clothes?

26
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,160
Your Highness,

27
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:50,970
the guards

28
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,509
we arranged in Physician Gu’s mansion said

29
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:54,759
that Her Highness was back to the palace.

30
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,509
Ningjing.

31
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,680
It’s you?

32
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,140
All the guards

33
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,200
returned with you?

34
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,690
Where is Her Highness?

35
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,490
What’s on earth going on?

36
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,680
Feiye,

37
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,509
it wasn’t you writing a letter to Yunxi

38
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:11,510
and asking her to meet in Xuanyuan Temple?

39
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,100
I thought you would give her a surprise,

40
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,300
so I managed to get rid of the guards.

[Xuanyuan Temple]

Baili Mingxiang.

43
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,300
There was no enmity between you and my father.

44
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,430
Why did you kill him?

45
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:30,930
The evil he did to Feiye

46
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:31,970
is enough for me

47
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,390
to kill him a thousand times.

48
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,270
Long Feiye never belongs to you.

49
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,260
You are disqualified

50
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,520
to do anything for him.

51
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,260
Yeah.

52
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,510
He never belongs to me.

53
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,430
He’s never been touched

54
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,480
even I suffered from great pains for him.

55
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,470
But why can you

56
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,300
gain his love

57
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,300
that easily?

58
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,100
I can’t accept it!

59
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,050
Then why

60
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,140
didn't you just kill me?

61
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,540
You think I don't want to?

62
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,050
But if I kill you,

63
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,300
Feiye won’t let me go.

64
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,600
And he will even hate me.

65
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,500
I’d better die in that case.

66
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,870
But it’s different by killing your father.

67
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,760
Your father was his enemy.

68
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,930
Even if I killed your father,

69
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:11,390
Feiye

70
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,510
won't blame me,

71
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:13,760
but it will

72
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,220
make you painful.

73
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,170
Is that your purpose?

74
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,890
I feel sorry for you.

75
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,490
You can’t have Long Feiye

76
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,680
even without me.

77
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,010
If I can’t have it,

78
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,840
you won’t get it either.

79
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,060
You are wrong.

80
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,950
Long Feiye will come to save me.

81
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,110
We won’t be separated again.

82
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,180
It’s not that simple.

83
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,800
Only one

84
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,720
between you two can live.

85
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:53,780
What do you mean?

86
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,090
Take it easy.

87
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,950
I won’t kill you straightly.

88
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,890
Because I have a better way

89
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,640
to torture you.

90
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:04,930
My question is what you mean

91
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:05,800
by saying that.

92
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,610
Your father was worthy of Poison Master.

93
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,040
He’s really so venomous.

94
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,950
If he hadn't told the others,

95
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,300
nobody in the world would have known

96
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,550
that only the antidote

97
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,890
with the heart blood

98
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,430
of Poison Master’s family

99
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,280
can detoxify the poisonous Gu.

100
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,940
Now Poison Master has been dead.

101
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,180
You are the only one

102
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,090
in the world who can save Feiye.

103
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,600
But if your heart blood

104
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,800
is taken away,

105
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,850
you will die.

106
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,390
So will you sacrifice yourself

107
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,140
to save Feiye

108
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,220
or live on in degradation?

109
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,810
That’s why you killed my father?

110
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,300
Once he is dead,

111
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,220
Long Feiye

112
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,630
can only live by killing me.

113
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,640
I’ve told you

114
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,180
if I can’t have it,

115
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,260
you won’t get it either.

116
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,390
If Poison Master

117
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,640
had sacrificed himself to save Feiye,

118
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,590
there would have been nothing

119
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,860
between you and Feiye.

120
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:14,550
See?

121
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,050
Han Yunxi,

122
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,470
I was forced to do so.

123
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,220
Baili Mingxiang.

124
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,510
You are a devil!

125
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,600
If becoming a devil

126
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,350
can separate you, so what?

127
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,010
Nothing can break us up.

128
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,090
Even if I die,

129
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,510
I will live in his mind.

130
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,970
We will never separate.

131
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:56,970
Now I will

132
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,930
take your heart blood

133
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,640
and you will never see him.

134
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:34,470
Eunuch Li?

135
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,220
What are you doing here?

136
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,800
If I hadn't followed you,

137
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:41,930
how would I have known

138
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,090
such a big secret?

139
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:46,820
What do you want?

140
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,390
As long as Han Yunxi dies,

141
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,440
the traitor from the Xuanyuan’s

142

What do you think

144
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,680
what I want?

145
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:58,760
No.

146
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,720
You can’t kill Han Yunxi.

147
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,090
Only her blood

148
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,180
can cure Feiye.

149
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,280
I won’t allow you to kill her!

150
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,600
I’ve seen countless vicious women

151

in the palace.

152
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,100

Why?

155

I’m not helping you

156

but saving Feiye.

157
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,550
Do save him.

158
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,890
Otherwise I won’t let you go

Don’t worry.

161

I will surely save him.

No big deal.

00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,050
really

179
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,300
put every effort in loving you.

180
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,090
I’m really lucky

181
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,890
to meet you in my life.

182
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,800
I’ve never regretted it.

183
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,890
Unfortunately,

184
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,510
I can’t

185
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,050
see you or accompany you

186
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,850
any longer.

187
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,140
Feiye,

188
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,890
I lived for you

189
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,140
all my life.

190
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,890
But you cast me aside like an old shoe.

191
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,930
Honestly,

192
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,450
I’ve been tired of living long since.

193
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,930
This is a good ending.

194
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,470
A good ending.

195
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,350
I failed to be a good father

196
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,350
and put Prince and Princess Qin

197
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,430
in danger.

198
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,350
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

199
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,210
General Baili.

200
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,930
Let’s get out first.

201
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,140
Mingxiang,

202
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,010
sorry.

203
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:07,930
Mingxiang.

204
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,090
I’m late.

205
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,730
Thank you for saving me just now.

206
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,380
The dart is poisoned.

207
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,390
It’s lucky that I had the sachet you gave me.

208
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,430
Yunxi.

209
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,550
You don’t have to be grateful.

210
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,930
You never owe me.

211
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,660
Will General Baili be mad

212
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,690
about Baili Mingxiang’s death?

213
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,350
General Baili is loyal to Qinxi all his life,

214
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,090
and he didn’t change his mind

215
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,310
even after Qinxi died out.

216
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,830
We don’t need to doubt his loyalty to Qinxi.

217
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,340
It’s my fault about Mingxiang’s death.

218
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:51,760
If I could deal with it well

219
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,020
at the very beginning,

220
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,640
it won’t become like this.

221
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,470
Everyone

222
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,300
makes his own choice.

223
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,260
You don’t have to

224
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,790
put the burden on yourself.

225
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,700
If it’s necessary,

226
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,730
I will explain to General Baili.

227
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,510
Not necessary.

228
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,180
I will handle it.

229
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,210
Your Highness.

230
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,660
You are always like this.

231
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,260
Keep refusing me.

232
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:36,680
Tang Li.

233
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,490
Will you come to a place with me?

234
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:40,750
Where is it?

235
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:42,800
I’d like to see

236
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,180
Feiye and Yunxi.

237
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,370
I beg you to stop causing trouble!

238
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,220
Do you think I’m willing to?

239
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,010
How could I know

240
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,260
Baili Mingxiang and Li Quan

241
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,970
plotted together to murder Yunxi?

242
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,490
If it hadn't been for you,

243
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,760
Han Yunxi wouldn’t have been caught,

244
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,820
Feiye wouldn’t have gone
to the dangerous place alone,

245
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,150
and Baili Mingxiang wouldn’t have died.

246
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,490
You still don’t reflect on yourself,

247
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,180
but go causing trouble.

248
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,510
Baili Mingxiang died?

249
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,220
I was wrong.

250
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,740
I will find a way to make it up.

251
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,470
Make up?

252
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,550
If you really want to make it up,

253
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,260
stay here!

254
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,410
Don’t go anywhere!

255
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,430
Don’t just do

256
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,090
whatever you want

257
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,690
without thinking of others.

258
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,890
Do you know what the consequence

259
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,660
will be if you just do it at will?

260
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:45,850
I did all that

261
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,350
for Feiye and Yunxi.

262
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:49,860
If you keep

263
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:50,890
doing as you wish,

264
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,480
please go back to Yunkong Academy.

265
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,050
He must hate me very much.

266
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,099
I’m not as gentle and polite as the ladies

267
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,349
of the eminent families

268
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:16,680
and always bullied him.

269
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,079
Now I even caused a great trouble.

270
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,010
If I keep staying at his side,

271
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,640
he will hate me even more.

272
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,250
Your Highness.

273
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,970
How is General Baili?

274
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,450
General Baili said

275
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,350
the general can’t leave the forces
even for one day.

276
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,760
So he took Miss Baili back

277
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,430
overnight.

278
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,270
Bury her elaborately.

279
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,110
Bury her elaborately.

280
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,510
Except this,

281
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,070
I don’t know

282
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,260
what else I can do.

283
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,970
My mother died.

284
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,300
Now Mingxiang died too.

285
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,040
Your Highness,

286
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,800
I remember that

287
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,080
you often persuaded Tang Li

288
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,260
and Miss Ningjing

289
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,560
to cherish the present

290
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,110
and not feel regret

291
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,550
after missing.

292
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,090
Now it seems

293
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,090
that that’s the word

294
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,020
you should remind yourself often.

295
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,090
Where is she?

296
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:38,970
Xifeng told me

297
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,050
General Baili took

298
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,210
Miss Baili away overnight.

299
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,960
Before her death, Baili Mingxiang said

300
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,930
my father told her

301
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,180
about the way to detoxify the poisonous Gu.

302
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,580
I know how to detoxify it.

303
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:52,530
It’s true.

304
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,390
So you can stop

305
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,000
considering other things.

306
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:57,640
Tell me,

307
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,660
you really don’t want me anymore?

308
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,690
If you can no longer accept me

309
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:03,470
because my father

310
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,600
harmed your family,

311
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,470
I will stay far away

312
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,950
without disturbing you.

313
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,960
After creating the antidote,

314
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,230
I will have people send it to you.

315
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,560
I’ve never thought about leaving you.

316
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,070
I was just afraid

317
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,350
that

318
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,370
I couldn’t give you the future.

319
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,990
I thought you didn’t want me anymore.

320
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,510
I won’t give you up

321
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,760
even if I don’t become the king

322
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,510
Promise me,

323
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,010
don’t leave me

324
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,890
no matter what happens.

325
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,510
We will live a happy life

326
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,390
forever.

327
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:15,510
Okay.

328
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,430
I promise.

329
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:23,470
♫ Watch the world changes with you ♫

330

338
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,180
This place and Yaogui Valley

339
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,300
are exactly alike!

340
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,300
It’s yours from now on.

341
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,220
Really?

342
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,260
Then I can do whatever I want.

343
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:01,970
I knew

344
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,350
you like Yaogui Valley very much.

345
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,800
So you can

346
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:05,800
plant some

347
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,050
flowers

348
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,600
or herbs you like.

349
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,220
Thanks to Zhuyu.

350

How could she go home just because I scolded her?

We had an engagement.

520

00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,360
I was wrong.

526
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,610
I thought I didn’t like you

527
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,700
so I refused you and hurt you again and again.

528
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,860
Now I am clear about it.

529
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:21,650
I…

530
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,450
I don’t want you to marry another man.

531
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,200
You can only

532
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,780
marry me.

533
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,860
Congratulations.

534
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,200
You always played

535
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,870
with other seniors and juniors,

536
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,820
but never took me into consideration

537
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,860
nor looked at me.

538
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,860
So I always played tricks

539
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:44,480
to attract your attention.

Ningjing.

541
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,700
I like you.

542
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,150
Don’t marry him, okay?

543
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:04,430
It seems that the bastard

544
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:06,010
is causing trouble here.

545
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,070
Guards!

547
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:14,900
Ningjing, don’t bow!

548
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:18,190
Ningjing, don’t be stupid!

549
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:23,570
Ningjing!

Ningjing! Ningjing!

552
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,280
Ningjing! Come out!

553
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,070
You can’t marry him!

554
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,400
We still haven’t broken the engagement!

555
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,900
You are still my fiancée!

556
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:38,200
Ningjing.

557
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,150
You can’t marry him.

558
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,240
I will be good to you.

559
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:45,490
I won’t hit back

560
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,900
or scold you.

561
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,990
I will never quarrel with you.

562
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,360
You are always right.

563
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:51,900
Ningjing.

564
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,300
Ningjing! Come out! Ningjing!

565
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,400
Come out! Ningjing!

566
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:00,780
Ningjing.

567
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,320
I’m right forever?

568
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,110
Ningjing.

569
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,530
Ningjing.

570
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,070
It’s improper.

571
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:41,610
You didn’t bow?

572
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:42,490
How

573
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:44,990
could I bow?

574
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,680
You’ve scared the bridegroom.

575
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,220
Nobody is bowing with me.

576
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:50,820
Moreover,

577
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,450
It’s really hard for me.

578
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,740
I got married twice.

579
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,360
But both bridegrooms

580
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,110
ran away during bowing.

581
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,450
I will never run away in the future.

582
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:02,990
It’s none of my business.

583
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,530
I won’t marry you.

584
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,190
Who will you marry?

585
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,400
No matter who marries you,

586
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,070
I will cause trouble in the wedding.

587
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,900
-Don’t you dare!
-You may try!

588
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:13,570
You…

589
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,510
I messed up your wedding.

590
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:18,230
I will give you another one.

591
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,940
I’m bowing with you right now.

592
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,449
Now?

593
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:22,190
Yeah.

594
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:23,780
Right now.

595
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:29,489
Bridegroom.

596
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,239
Stop laughing foolishly.

597
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:34,190
It’s time to bow.

598
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,449
The new couple bows down!

599
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,780
Bow to Heaven and Earth!

600
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:57,450
Bow to parents!

601
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:10,400
Bow to each other!

602
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:57,900
Darling!

603
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,320
Let’s start!

604
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,530
Darling!

605
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,570
Why don’t you come?

606
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,240
I feel something is wrong.

607
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,360
I just bowed with you.

608
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:11,360
It’s like

609
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,200
I was trapped.

610
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,780
The bridegroom changed.

611
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,570
But Master and all other people

612
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:18,900
didn’t feel surprised.

613
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:19,900
And

614
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,550
Xie wasn’t angry either.

615
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:22,900
What’s more,

616
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:23,860
my

617
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,150
clothes

618
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,360
fit me well.

619
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,490
It seems

620
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,810
that it's exactly made for me.

621
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,280
And

622
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,050
your mother didn’t come.

623
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,360
Feiye didn’t know about it.

624
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,240
It’s a wedding should be held

625
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,150
in the palace.

626
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:38,530
But it’s just held

627
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,660
in this restaurant.

628
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:41,950
Don’t you feel

629
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,110
our wedding

630
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,260
is held too rashly?

631
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,570
It’s you who asked me to bow with you.

632
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:54,110
It’s you who caused trouble during my wedding.

633
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:56,110
Now it’s you who is saying I trapped you.

634
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:56,910
What’s wrong?

635
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,070
You just married me.

636
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,400
But now you feel regret?

637
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,490
No regret. Not that.

638
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:02,950
Then

639
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,670
what are you thinking about?

640
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:05,610
Nothing.

641
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:07,790
Ningjing.

642
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:08,400
Oh no.

643
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:09,240
Darling.

644
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,700
It’s our

645
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,740
wedding night.

646
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:12,950
Let’s drink.

647
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,930
How about the cross-cupped wine?

648
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,280
Why are you laughing?

649
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,820
I just feel

650
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:02,150
we may quarrel the next second.

651
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,860
Nobody will quarrel with you.

652
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,990
Tang Li, can you be serious?

653
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,070
Okay.

654
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,200
I will be serious.

655
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,190
Seriously.

656
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,950
The candle.

657
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,880
Take the medicine.

658
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,740
You will be alright after resting for a few days.

659
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,780
Does it hurt?

660
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:09,240
No.

661
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:14,700
Lie down.

662
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,200
Lie down.

663
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,110
You always wanted

664
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,710
to have a baby with me, right?

665
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,110
I’m not ready for it.

666
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,320
Hurt!

667
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:36,740
Are you okay?

668
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:39,060
You haven't recovered yet.

669
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,030
It will hurt if you do this.

670
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,190
It’s been cured.

671
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,090
Now it won’t break.

672
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,490
Feiye, lie down.

673
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:54,090
I will take the medicine out.

674
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:23,990
Gu.

675
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,010
You are here.

676
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:26,190
I’ve finished my work.

677
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,450
Now I’m here to see you.

678
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,150
You look great!

679
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,110
Maybe it’s because of the fresh air

680
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,030
and beautiful scenery.

681
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,150
I feel much better.

682
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:37,320
This is really a

683
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,580
good place for living.

684
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,400
Since you live a good life,

685
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,600
I will feel relieved.

686
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:44,200
Gu,

687
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:46,270
I’d like to ask you something.

688
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,650
Come with me.

689
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,190
Here.

690
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:56,320
Look.

691
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:00,400
Look.

692
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,030
Prince Qin built it

693
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:06,280
for Princess Qin.

694
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:07,990
I was helping here before.

695
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,320
Now I’m living here.

696
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:10,750
Qishao, are you happy?

697
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:11,820
This place

698
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,420
is exactly the same as Yaogui Valley.

699
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:23,900
Qishao.

700
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,450
