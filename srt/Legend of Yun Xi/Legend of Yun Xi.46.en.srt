Episode 46

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:05,820
Brother,

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:07,730
my future

5
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:08,950
should be in my hands.

6
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,650
It’s your business to claim the throne

7
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,850
and govern the state.

8
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,450
Now all the officials are asking me

9
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,110
why you don’t take the throne.

10
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:15,770
I don’t know

11
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:16,740
what to answer.

12
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,670
I’m infected with poisonous Gu

13
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,280
and will die in months.

14
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,660
I won’t see the day when Qinxi

15
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,590
is united again.

16
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,560
It’s on your shoulders

17
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,570
to end the war

18
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,030
and revive Qinxi.

19
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,140
When could you

20
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,780
understand me?

21
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,150
Brother.

22
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:39,430
Brother.

23
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,610
Calm down.

24
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,540
Once the poisonous Gu in your body is cured…

25
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,950
It’s incurable.

26
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,490
You must be lying.

27
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,550
Didn’t Han Yunxi say there was a cure?

28
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,050
Han Yunxi has been

29
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,400
trying to find a cure.

30
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,780
But there’s no way

31
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,950
she can cure it.

32
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,150
She wants to die with me.

33
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,570
So I drove her away.

34
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,820
Don’t go to her.

35
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,360
You drove Han Yunxi away?

36
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,820
What about you?

37
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,940
I’ve been infected with poisonous Gu
since I was little.

38
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,140
There were life-threatening moments.

39
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,900
I fear not death.

40
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,280
Don’t be sad.

41
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:23,950
The future of Qinxi

42
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,450
is in your hands now.

43
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:29,200
Don’t let me die with worries.

44
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:30,570
No.

45
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,590
I will find a way to save you.

46
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:35,870
Don’t worry.

47
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:36,970
I’ll read these

48
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,030
today.

49
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,070
Tang Li.

50
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,320
I have big news.

51
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,930
I’m talking to you.

52
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:55,990
What are you doing?

53
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,560
A Collection of Poisonous Herbs?

54
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,840
Why are you studying poisons?

55
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,870
Ningjing, give me a moment.

56
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,740
Is it because of Feiye?

57
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,890
But Feiye and Yunxi

58
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,990
have split up.

59
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,210
You agree that Feiye

60
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,360
was mean, right?

61
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,110
Yunxi must be so sad.

62
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,460
I need to comfort her.

63
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,280
In fact,

64
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,350
my brother has his reasons.

65
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,930
What reasons?

66
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,200
He has everything now.

67
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,230
The poisonous Gu in his body is incurable.

68
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,900
He only has months to live.

69
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,030
Han Yunxi wants to die with him.

70
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,280
He won’t let her.

71
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:45,950
So,

72
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,700
he drove Yunxi away on purpose.

73
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,490
No.

74
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,700
I have to go to Yunxi.

75
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,940
What would you say when you meet her?

76
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,660
That my brother still loves her?

77
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,520
Then she’ll kill herself for him.

78
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,190
Since Dowager promised her to him,

79
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,530
their love journey

80
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,060
has been bumpier than ours.

81
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,700
Yunxi is such a poor girl.

82
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,270
Poor my brother is, too.

83
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,100
He was infected with poisonous Gu and carried the duty

84
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,960
to revive Qinxi since he was a boy.

85
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,700
Finally,

86
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,030
he met the girl he likes,

87
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:35,310
but now he has to drive her away.

88
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,110
As his brother,

89
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,320
my recklessness

90
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,030
worries him.

91
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,610
I…

92
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,240
I’m such a bad brother.

93
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,170
Tang Li,

94
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,360
don’t be sorry.

95
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,450
Look,

96
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,600
let’s consult the physicians

97
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,490
and see

98
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,380
if there are hidden medical talent

99
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,490
who can cure

100
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,350
the poisonous Gu in Feiye’s body.

101
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,670
Are you alright?

102
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,450
You look pale.

103
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,860
Are you ill?

104
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,330
Many men in the garrison

105
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,580
have caught cold lately.

106
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,280
I might have been infected.

107
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,530
How come it’s so widespread?

108
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,380
Don’t worry, young general.

109
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,700
Your father invited

110
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,409
royal physicians

111
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:41,490
to treat them.

112
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,720
If you don’t feel well,

113
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,400
go back and have some rest.

114
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,140
I’ll ask someone to fill in for you.

115
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,600
Thank you, young general.

116
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,190
Go.

117
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,450
Your Majesty,

118
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,370
half men of Mu’s troops

119
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,780
have been plagued.

120
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,370
They have been dispatched

121
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,430
from the garrison.

122
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,190
As Your Majesty’s order,

123
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,620
I put infected blood on the cut I made

124
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,490
when they were asleep.

125
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,820
Everything goes well.

126
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,200
Good.

127
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,610
Very good.

128
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,530
As long as I have a Gu-infected men army,

129
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,700
I’ll march them to the capital

130
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,280
and take it back.

131
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,660
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

132
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,720
Within three days,

133
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,900
you can lead the army.

134
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:37,650
Now,

135
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,780
take the soup to the physicians

136
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,820
and see if it’s drugged.

137
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,190
Yes, Your Majesty.

138
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,570
Qishao.

139
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,980
Give the Noxious Herb back.

140
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,700
Yunxi,

141
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,090
you do come here

142
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,290
for the Noxious Herb.

143
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,530
I noticed something was wrong

144
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,330
from your eyes yesterday.

145
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,460
Why did you lie to me?

146
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,150
Why?

147
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,570
Why is it him that you care?

148
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,610
Him alone?

149
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,240
He abandoned you.

150
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,860
Is it worth to die

151
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,240
for him?

152
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:16,950
Qishao,

153
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,240
did you tell Long Feiye

154
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,290
that only the blood from my heart

155
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,190
can save him?

156
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,490
Yes,

157
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,780
I did.

158
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,860
I knew it was you.

159
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,180
No wonder he said

160
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,440
those mean words to me.

161
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,270
Why did you tell him?

162
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,490
I trusted you.

163
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,820
He has the right to know.

164
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,010
When a woman

165
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,050
is about to sacrifice her life

166
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,050
to save him,

167
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,250
how could he allow it?

168
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,110
Besides,

169
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,810
I don’t allow you

170
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:41,740
to die.

171
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,650
I can’t.

172
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,400
Qishao,

173
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,500
I’m the master of my life.

174
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,350
Give the Noxious Herb back.

175
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:49,700
No.

176
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,700
Poison girl, go.

177
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,930
Yunxi, run.

178
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:28,780
Qishao!

179
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,280
Qishao!

180
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:39,190
Qishao! Qishao!

181
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,900
Kill her!

182
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,550
Are you alright?

183
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,110
Move!

184
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,450
Run! Run!

185
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,450
Qishao!

186
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,860
Qishao! Qishao!

187
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,280
Qishao!

188
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,030
Qishao!

189
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,150
How are you?

190
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:19,950
Long Feiye,

191
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,210
you didn’t realize

192
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,070
-that she deceived you.
-Qishao.

193
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,530
Xifeng,

194
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,660
take Gu Qishao for treatment.

195
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,240
Yes.

196
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,420
[Glory Hall]

197
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,280
Your Majesty.

198
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,700
Speak.

199
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,400
According to the physicians,

200
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,030
the lotus-seed

201
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,900
is drugged.

202
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,900
You may go.

203
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:05,860
Yes.

204
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,320
Chu Qingge,

205
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,280
don’t you have

206
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,400
the slightest affection for me?

207
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,000
Your Highness,

208
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,030
the last dose

209
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,310
has been delivered to His Majesty.

210
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,320
Your Highness, we can’t go back.

211
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,070
Ma’am,

212
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,650
do you know?

213
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,280
No one has ever

214
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,570
been so nice to me like His Majesty is.

215
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,400
He loves me and spoils me.

216
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,990
Before I married to him,

217
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,820
I never thought

218
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,420
I would fall in love with him.

219
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,950
But now,

220
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,410
I think I’m

221
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,820
deeply in love.

222
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,160
Your Highness,

223
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,360
you can’t go back.

224
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,530
We haven’t had messages from Xiqiu

225
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,820
for a long time.

226
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,410
For Xiqiu

227
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,610
and the young prince,

228
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,240
you have to do it.

229
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,490
I know.

230
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,240
I know all this.

231
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:39,950
I’m just

232
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,990
tired.

233
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,200
My heart aches for it.

234
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,610
Your Highness,

235
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,210
His Majesty wants to see you.

236
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,120
Your Highness, His Majesty wants to see you.

237
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,860
Please.

238
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,900
Your Highness.

239
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,110
Your Majesty.

240
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,060
Your Majesty,

241
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,650
the lotus-seed soup

242
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,140
is already cold.

243
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,940
Why didn’t you drink it earlier?

244
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,150
Is there something troubling you?

245
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,140
Neither of the Gu-infected men

246
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,660
came back from the assassination.

247
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,660
That means Han Yunxi is still alive.

248
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,990
Do you know

249
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,240
Han Yunxi is a hot potato?

250
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,360
She also wants me dead.

251
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,820
But I won’t let that happen.

252
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,150
Tianyin!

253
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,650
I brought

254
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,790
these Gu-infected men specially for you.

255
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,420
Are you happy to see them?

256
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,490
Your Majesty.

257
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,280
It’s my fault.

258
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,240
I’m sorry.

259
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:42,890
I shouldn’t have

260
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,570
worked with Beili people.

261
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,190
I shouldn’t have poisoned you.

262
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,580
Your Majesty,

263
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,370
it has nothing

264
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,820
to do with my brother.

265
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,530
Please help my brother.

266
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,030
That’s not what I’m angry with.

267
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,130
I’m angry because I gave you

268
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,110
so many chances

269
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,980
and you didn’t seize any of them.

270
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,450
I told you

271
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,490
not to worry about Xiqiu.

272
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,020
I would settle everything.

273
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,860
I also told you

274
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,250
Xiqiu can

275
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,910
be Tianning’s partner state.

276
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,320
I wanted to melt you with love.

277
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,860
But you drugged me.

278
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,920
I didn’t realize until now

279
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,540
that you didn’t lie about the promises,

280
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,490
that everything

281
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,700
is under your control.

282
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,820
Do you know?

283
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,640
If you didn’t drug the soup this time,

284
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,300
I would have forgiven you

285
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,140
and pretended that none of these happened.

286
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,360
But once again, you let me down.

287
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,490
I’m so sorry.

288
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,240
I betrayed your trust, Your Majesty.

289
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,090
Do you know how painful

290
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:57,950
it is?

291
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,900
Have you never

292
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,290
really loved me?

293
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:03,900
No.

294
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,700
I do love Your Majesty.

295
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,110
But I had no choice.

296
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,950
It’s like a path with no return.

297
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,030
I made one mistake after another.

298
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:23,980
Your Majesty,

299
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,150
I ask for death to atone my crime.

300
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,950
But please save my brother.

301
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,150
Your Majesty.

302
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,650
You wanna die?

303
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,150
Not so fast.

304
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,450
Li Quan.

305
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,220
Lock Consort Qing up.

306
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,860
I’ll deal with her

307
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,070
after I win the war.

308
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,360
Guards!

309
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,570
Take Consort Qing away.

310
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,320
Yes.

311
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,110
Your Majesty.

312
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,450
Tianyin.

313
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,360
Yunxi, will Qishao die?

314
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,030
Technically,

315
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,170
a small cut

316
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,410
wouldn’t have led to this.

317
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,010
Why is he still unconscious?

318
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,730
Don’t worry.

319
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,130
His life isn’t in danger.

320
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,030
What are you doing?

321
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,490
Get some blood

322
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,270
and check what poison it is.

323
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,360
My mind won’t rest until the traitor is dead.

324
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,200
Fortunately, I’m blessed

325
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:07,109
to have built an army of Gu-infected men.

326
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,609
I know

327
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,240
some of you

328
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,319
fear these creatures.

329
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,030
I’d like to assure you

330
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,160
as long as your loyalty is with me,

331
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,180
they will be your brothers

332
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,450
in the battlefield.

333
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:19,650
With their help,

334
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,859
you’ll be invincible.

335
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,099
Your Majesty,

336
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:28,650
a victory at the price of the lives

337
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:29,990
of innocent people

338
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,450
will cost you their trust

339
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,490
even if you take the throne.

340
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:38,740
Please give it a second thought.

341
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,990
Every war takes its toll.

342
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,860
This is the price we have to pay.

343
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,010
Those people

344
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,740
who don’t understand me

345
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,360
are as lowly as ants to me.

346
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,490
I’m the almighty king.

347
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,320
Those ants under my feet

348
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,280
have no choices

349
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,200
but to die in silence.

350
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,240
Here is my order. March out

351
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,570
and bring a toll on those traitors.

352
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:09,650
Yes.

353
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

354
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,200
It will cause heavy casualty

355
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,390
to fight the Gu-infected men army head on.

356
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,360
Prepare yourselves

357
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,300
according to my plan.

358
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,190
-Yes.
-Yes.

359
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,570
Brother.

360
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:35,610
Report from the border.

361
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,780
King Tianhui has launched attacks

362
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,940
with his Gu-infected men army.

363
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,330
The Gu-infected men struck hard.

364
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,900
Lieutenant General lost the front.

365
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,410
And the Gu-infected men are bloodthirsty.

366
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,290
They kill every one

367
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,360
on their way.

368
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,490
Where are General Baili

369
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,030
and General Sun?

370
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,530
General Baili is still one hundred kilometers

371
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,410
north of the capital.

372
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,570
General Sun heads south

373
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,300
and is ninety kilometers away.

374
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,730
A big war with Gu-infected men army

375
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:57,650
is at break.

376
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,180
Assemble the capital and palace guards.

377
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,130
Get ready to fight.

378
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:01,740
Yes.

379
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,610
Xifeng,

380
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,210
take all the medicines away.

381
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:13,820
Yes.

382
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,280
Take it down.

383
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:20,720
Be careful.

384
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,150
What are you doing?

385
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,240
Your Highness.

386
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,510
Don’t you say you like stories?

387
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,490
I’ll ask Xifeng

388
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,700
to buy all the story books

389
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,700
for you.

390
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,110
Xifeng, from now on,

391
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,110
Her Highness stays in the Plum Sea.

392
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,200
Yes.

393
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:45,920
Your Highness,

394
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,420
don’t lock me up here.

395
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,280
Let me go with you.

396
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,330
I won’t do anything

397
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,460
that you don’t like.

398
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,820
King Tianhui is studying

399
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,750
to make an army of Gu-infected men.

400
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,360
If I don’t stop him,

401
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,160
there will be disastrous consequences.

402
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,490
All lives are at risk in a war.

403
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,540
How could I put yours at risk?

404
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:09,820
I promise

405
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,500
that I’ll come back to you

406
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,620
as soon as I defeat King Tianhui.

407
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,220
All right?

408
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,590
Then you have to keep your promise.

409
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,650
I live or die

410
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,240
together with you.

411
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:25,700
All right.

412
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,560
Your Highness,

413
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,110
is everything alright?

414
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:11,860
I was

415
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,400
infected back then.

416
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,610
Why haven’t I

417
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:30,740
lost my mind?

418
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,490
How are you?

419
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,910
Couldn’t be better.

420
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,140
Poison girl has promised me

421
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,020
to travel around the world with me.

422
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:49,740
How could I

423
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,340
get myself killed so easily?

424
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,200
Worry about yourself.

425
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,350
Have you held on to poison girl?

426
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,560
How much do you love Han Yunxi?

427
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,070
More than you do.

428
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,740
Even if she doesn’t like you?

429
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,140
If she can’t forget me

430
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,190
after I die,

431
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,430
will you love her as always?

432
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,560
Long Feiye,

433
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,070
you’re so full of it.

434
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,110
Don’t worry.

435
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,900
If you die,

436
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:27,780
I

437
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,860
will let poison girl forget you.

438
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,530
It’s possible

439
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,670
that I’ll die in the war.

440
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,630
I hope you keep a close eye on Han Yunxi.

441
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,180
Don’t let her do anything stupid for me.

442
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,540
Don’t lecture me on that.

443
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,200
Even if I have to go through fire and flames,

444
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,010
I’ll protect her

445
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:51,860
with my life.

446
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,030
Good.

447
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,150
Keep your promise.

448
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,400
Mother,

449
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,860
give me your bless.

450
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,040
Let me maintain clear-minded

451
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,590
and protect poison girl

452
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,490
before it’s all over.

453
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,200
So many goodies.

454
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,620
Why don’t you eat?

455
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,220
You’re awake so soon?

456
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,280
It’s not a big deal.

457
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,610
Look at you.

458
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,410
None of these goodies

459
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:43,610
are appealing to you?

460
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,660
You have never been starved, have you?

461
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,490
You know

462
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,320
it’s our nature to eat.

463
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,610
When people are too hungry

464
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:50,890
to keep their head straight,

465
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:51,930
no one would turn away

466
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,020
from so many goodies

467
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,110
in front of them.

468
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,150
His Highness didn’t drive you out?

469
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,950
Long Feiye…

470
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,240
He left.

471
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,530
He assembled his army

472
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,180
to engage King Tianhui in battlefield.

473
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,200
So from now on,

474
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,610
I’ll look after you.

475
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,500
I have to go to him.

476
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,240
Calm down.

477
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,570
No rush.

478
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,150
Poison girl,

479
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,130
I know

480
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,620
details about Gu-infected men in Xijing.

481
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,370
I went to the cellar

482
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,740
where they created Gu-infected men.

483
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,470
Do you want to know the details?

484
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,820
Will we win the war?

485
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,620
The army with Gu-infected men

486
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,170
isn’t easy to defeat.

487
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,780
One more reason I have to go to him.

488
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,950
What difference can you make?

489
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,140
Can you defeat the Gu-infected men?

490
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,050
You can only

491
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,510
be a burden for Long Feiye.

492
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,260
You have to believe Long Feiye.

493
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,260
He will defeat the Gu-infected men.

494
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,190
Therefore,

495
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,890
don’t risk your life.

496
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:42,570
All right?

497
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,200
All you need to do

498
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,330
is to have a decent meal

499
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:47,330
and get some rest.

500
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,820
You see?

501
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,170
The tyrant, Tianhui,

502
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,820
turns the world into a hell.

503
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,900
Is that what you want?

504
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,250
Do you deserve the armors on you?

505
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,370
You have become killers

506
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:31,730
who help the tyrant

507
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,150
to kill innocent people.

508
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,700
Stop!

509
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,530
Move.

510
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:48,900
How dare you

511
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,970
burst in

512
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,200
without a report!

513
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,910
Doesn’t matter.

514
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,860
Hail Your Majesty.

515
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:57,940
Your Majesty,

516
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,760
the people should be kept outside of the war.

517
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,820
Please show them your mercy

518
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,790
and leave the people unharmed.

519
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,570
General Mu,

520
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,110
why are you as weak as a lady?

521
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,400
This is my strategy.

522
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,050
Our army has broken through

523
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,070
five of Long Feiye’s cities.

524
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,530
The Gu-infected men have killed

525
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:22,650
lots of citizens.

526
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,360
Doesn’t Long Feiye

527
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,570
boast his love to the people?

528
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,130
He won’t stay put for long.

529
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,900
When our soldiers

530
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,860
kill everyone in the city,

531
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,610
the Gu-infected men

532
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,780
and our soldiers will dress up like citizens.

533
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,180
We’ll lure Long Feiye in.

534
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,820
However powerful Long Feiye is,

535
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,580
he will have no way to escape.

536
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,570
You and your son

537
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,820
just do your job

538
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,970
and keep your post.

539
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:52,970
But Your Majesty…

540
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

541
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,620
Your Majesty,

542
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,970
Han Yunxi’s assassins

543
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,030
missed the target.

544
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,150
Shall I send out more men?

545
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,360
No need to.

546
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,110
When I take the capital,

547
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,320
everyone who betrayed

548
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,110
and challenged me

549
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,990
will die.

550
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,280
Look,

551
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,400
listen to me.

552
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,110
Don’t waste your time here.

553
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,370
Isn’t it nice

554
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,900
to travel the world with me?

555
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,810
All right. I’ll stop.

556
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:39,700
Let’s eat.

557
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:40,990
Look,

558
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,690
how could you resist the tempt

559
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,700
of so many goodies?

560
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,370
I’m not the only

561
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,530
weak person here.

562
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:46,990
You’re also weak.

563
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,170
So you have to have more

564
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,700
and build up your strength.

565
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,240
Look,

566
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,550
they’re all delicious.

567
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:03,900
Qishao,

568
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,150
are you alright?

569
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,190
I’m fine.

570
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,130
The original poisonous Gu in Your Highness’s body

571
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,770
has been contained for now.

572
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,900
Any slight negligence will set it off.

573
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,890
I guess

574
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:32,810
your mind has been overloaded lately

575
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,870
which advances the symptoms to show.

576
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,300
Your Highness’s situation is critical.

577
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,690
We don’t know

578
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,890
what will happen when it strikes again.

579
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,410
For the sake of your health,

580
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:46,860
don’t wear yourself out.

581
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,440
You may leave, physician.

582
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,320
Yes.

583
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,800
People live by the borders

584
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,150
are in critical danger.

585
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,400
One more minute I stall

586
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,700
will cost hundreds of people’s lives.

587
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,360
Xifeng,

588
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,420
don’t slow down the march

589
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,360
for the sake of my health.

590
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,740
Pass my order.

591
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,690
We move out now.

592
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:17,360
But,

593
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,570
Your Highness…

594
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:19,530
Do it!

595
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,400
Yes.

596
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,620
I have no choice but to disobey His Highness

597
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,080
and get the princess here.

598
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,600
Only she can convince him.

599
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,740
It’s not far from the Plum Sea.

600
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,740
If I ride nonstop,

601
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,620
I can make it back in two days.

602
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,960
What are you doing?

603
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,280
Qishao,

604
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,990
this is your blood.

605
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,650
There is a poison in your body

606
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,700
that’s similar to the poisonous plague.

607
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,410
But there is another poison

608
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:09,530
holding it back.

609
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,210
Well,

610
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,730
I was carelessly poisoned

611
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,620
by Traceless Herb when I picked it.

612
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,610
And I ate

613
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,210
the leaves on its lower stem.

614
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,770
I have plenty of poisons

615
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:20,820
in my system.

616
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,570
Besides, Traceless Herb

617
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:24,100
is the most poisonous herb.

618
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,770
So I’m not curious

619
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:26,980
it’s like the poisonous plague.

620
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,690
And I found

621
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,770
something bizarre.

622
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:29,570
Look,

623
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,780
this is the poison that leads to the plague.

624
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,840
This is your blood.

625
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,240
See?

626
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,190
Something in your body

627
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,540
fuses with the poisonous plague

628
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,110
and destroys it.

629
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:48,990
Qishao,

630
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,040
do you have more Traceless Herbs?

631
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:51,810
I gave

632
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,410
all Traceless Herbs to Yuze.

633
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,130
What’s more, your presumption

634
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:56,200
is groundless.

635
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,290
Why don’t you

636
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,210
give the Noxious Herb to me

637
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,320
so I can study it?

638
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,160
Perhaps I can find something.

639
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,570
In the end,

640
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,500
it’s the Noxious Herb that you want.

641
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,370
Listen.

642
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:06,570
I won’t give it to you.

643
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:07,880
Your Highness!

644
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,600
Your Highness!

645
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:10,900
Xifeng.

646
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,760
Your Highness,

647
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,370
His Highness is in danger.

648
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:15,700
Come to the camp with me.

649
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:16,950
Poison girl,

650
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,090
you can’t go.

651
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:18,950
Qishao,

652
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,690
His Highness would lose his life.

653
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,070
I said you can’t go.

654
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,130
Besides,

655
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,390
I promised Long Feiye.

656
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,200
I’m Princess Qin.

657
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,820
Let me see

658
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,570
who has the guts to stop me

659
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:32,330
from saving my husband.

660
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:33,320
Listen to this.

661
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,180
I, Gu Qishao, will keep you here.

662
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,640
Let’s see if you can leave.

663
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:42,590
Let’s go.

664
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,090
Your Majesty.

665
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:51,770
All right.

666
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:52,570
Your Majesty.

667
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,100
The regional army is marching towards us.

668
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,230
In the next morning,

669
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,820
they’ll arrive.

670
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,320
Long Feiye,

671
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:08,190
you’re going to die tomorrow.

672
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:13,220
[Tianning]

673
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:20,750
Poison girl!

674
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:22,750
Poison girl!

675
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,070
What are you doing here?

676
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,610
Who let you out?

677
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,570
Why didn’t you keep her there?

678
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,570
I wanted to come.

679
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,360
Gu Qishao,

680
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,400
take her back now.

681
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,700
Are you ordering me?

682
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,330
Poison girl, listen to me.

683
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:45,200
Let’s go back.

684
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,860
Are you my friend or not?

685
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,620
Leave us, please.

686
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,900
I want a few words with His Highness.

687
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,110
Qishao.

688
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,570
Please.

689
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,860
Han Yunxi,

690
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,620
I have nothing to talk to you.

691
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:17,860
Leave.

692
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:20,820
I don’t want to see you again.

693
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:21,949
No, I won’t.

694
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,909
Even if I have to die.

695
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,360
We stand together. We die together.

696
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,530
Just go!

697
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:41,820
I have been

698
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:45,239
worried about you for every second.

699
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,199
I couldn’t eat

700
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,530
or sleep.

701
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,070
Any slightest sound

702
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,070
would wake me up.

703
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,810
But once I met you,

704
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:02,860
I was at ease.

705
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:08,070
I thought even if a disaster struck,

706
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,400
our life would continue.

707
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,490
Do you know why?

708
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,740
Because you’re by my side.

709
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:21,920
Your Highness,

710
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,110
don’t send me away.

711
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,960
Otherwise, I would die of missing you

712
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,450
before the disaster comes to us.

713
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,030
Yunxi.

714
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,500
The Noxious Herb is in Gu Qishao’s possession.

715
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,360
The blood from my heart

716
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,180
can’t make a cure without it.

717
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:50,970
So, let’s

718
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,700
not try to convince each other.

719
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,680
Just let me stay to look after you.

720
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,400
All right?

721
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,280
Your Highness,

722
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,050
do you remember the first time

723
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,450
when I made cakes for you?

724
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,490
How could I forget?

725
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,130
The poisonous Gu was triggered

726
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,240
because I ate

727
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,570
the cake you made.

728
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,320
I will never forget it.

729
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,650
I had no idea of it.

730
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,200
But the cakes you made

731
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,240
were delicious.

732
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,570
Really?

733
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,200
Then I’ll make some next time.

734
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:57,740
All right.

735
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,520
Are you happy now, Your Highness?

736
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,760
Of course, I am.

737
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,990
Is it because I’m by your side?

738
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,110
Yes.

739
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,500
When I was in Plum Sea,

740
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,190
I worried every day

741
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,490
about your health.

742
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,650
I wasn’t happy at all.

743
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:27,960
Your Highness,

744
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,690
we won’t spend much time

745
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:31,490
together.

746
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,030
Why don’t we

747
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,710
leave some good memories in the last days?

748
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:44,990
Come here.

749
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,670
I haven’t held you in my arm like this for long.

750
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,530
Yunxi,

751
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:07,990
you’re right.

752
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,630
We won’t spend much time together.

753
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,070
Why don’t we cherish

754
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,820
the last days?

755
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:23,890
Even if today

756
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,400
is the last day of my life,

757
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,860
we’ll spend it together.

758
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,360
Your Highness.

759
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,980
[Qingshan Town]

760
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,530
Orderly.

761
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,030
Sir.

762
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,340
Go tell His Highness.

763
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,070
Yes.

764
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,530
It’s too quiet here.

765
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,990
Kind of creepy.

766
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,720
This is a huge village.

767
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,190
But we saw no one farming.

768
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,610
Is it an ambush?

769
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,110
If this is an ambush

770
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,570
and our enemies are ordinary soldiers,

771
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:21,030
we may have a chance to win.

772
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,610
But the Gu-infected fighters

773
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,010
are hundreds or thousands times stronger.

774
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:25,690
Without scouting,

775
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:27,290
we could walk into their trap

776
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,320
and get surrounded.

777
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:30,890
By then we become

778
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,490
the sheep in a pack of wolves.

779
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,570
His Highness’s order,

780
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:36,330
fall back and set up the camp

781
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,590
five kilometers away.

782
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:41,360
Fall back five kilometers away.

783
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:48,860
Your Majesty.

784
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,530
How is it going?

785
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:53,100
Has the enemies fallen into our trap?

786
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,330
They didn’t march in the village,

787
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:55,330
but withdrew five kilometers

788
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:56,530
and set up camp there.

789
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,030
You idiot!

790
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,500
You can’t even set up a trap.

791
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,370
The enemies found the loopholes

792
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:01,450
so soon.

793
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:02,410
Forgive me.

794
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:03,400
Your Majesty.

795
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,610
Loser!

796
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:05,950
Leave us.

797
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,190
Yes.

798
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,240
Long Feiye.

799
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,900
You force me to attack.

800
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,130
Are the fifty thousand Gu-infected soldiers

801
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:22,190
in Xijing ready?

802
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:23,990
Your Majesty,

803
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,190
they await your order.

804
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,970
Tell the Gu-infected men troops

805
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,740
and the Mus’ troops to get ready

806
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,820
to box up

807
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,610
Long Feiye’s camp

808
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:37,810
from two directions.

809
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

810
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:40,900
Long Feiye,

811
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:43,190
you won’t get away this time.

812
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,500
Your Highness,

813
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,200
the tents have been pitched.

814
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,490
Your Highness,

815
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:57,150
villagers along the route have been evacuated.

816
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,700
This place we camp

817
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,500
is easy to be surrounded.

818
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,740
Pass my order.

819
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,870
All units abandon the tents

820
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,740
and withdraw fast with light packs.

821
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,870
Yes, Your Highness.

822
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,560
Your Highness,

823
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,650
you knew it wasn’t

824
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:19,710
the ideal location to set up the camp,

825
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,370
but why did you still order them to set it here?

826
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:22,630
We defend and withdraw

827
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:23,980
to stall the time

828
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,240
King Tianhui attacks,

829
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:26,990
so that

830
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,200
the villagers can be evacuated.

831
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,610
The people is so lucky to have

832
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:33,140
such a considerate leader.

833
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,260
If I leave the people behind

834
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,820
to suffer,

835
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,890
it’s meaningless

836
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:40,220
even if I reunite Qinxi.

837
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,250
You have the people in your heart.

838
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,500
The righteous party always prevails.

839
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,560
An army with decent purpose will win.

840
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,820
King Tianhui’s Gu-infected men

841
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,350
are not to be belittled.

842
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,140
He has gathered all military forces

843
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,240
to engage us in one last battle.

844
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,490
I didn’t tell you

845
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:01,150
for fear of information leak.

846
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,150
This is the combat plan for the future.

847
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,980
If I couldn’t make it to the last battle,

848
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,250
give it to Xifeng.

849
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:17,980
Your Highness, you’ll be fine.

850
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,010
The soldiers hope you

851
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:21,740
to fight side by side with them.

852
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,570
You have to be fine.
