Episode 14

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,310
King Tianhui assigned the Ministries of Revenue

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,580
and Personnel to the confiscation.

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,990
He didn’t know

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,360
they’re under my control.

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:15,740
Now

8
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,260
the Grand Commandant was neutralized,

9
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,800
the Crown Prince is a fool,

10
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,390
and three of his courtiers were executed.

11
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,570
I doubt

12
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,150
who dares to serve him.

13
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:27,950
Well,

14
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,210
people are singing the name

15
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,670
of Tianning’s Prince Qin.

16
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,030
When could we

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,020
rise in the name of

18
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,700
the bloodline of former Qin?

19
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,090
Brother,

20
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,210
when could we get out of here?

21
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,900
I miss mother.

22
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,110
Don’t be afraid.

23
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,240
Mother left the signs.

24
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,410
The Tangs

25
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:36,490
will save us.

26
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:37,650
Don’t cry.

27
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:52,740
Go!

28
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,860
-Go!
-Go!

29
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:55,750
Go with them.

30
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,490
No!

31
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,820
I’ll stay with mother.

32
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,610
Feiye,

33
00:01:59,020 --> 00:01:59,780
be good.

34
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:00,650
Go!

35
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,200
I won’t!

36
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,290
I won’t go!

37
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,740
I’ll stay with mother.

38
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,280
Your Highness, go!

39
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:09,490
Alright. Go!

40
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,010
One more

41
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,010
Gu-infected man.

42
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,860
Trust me.

43
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,400
One day,

44
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,180
the world

45
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,570
will know we are Qinxi’s

46
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,900
royal blood.

47
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,610
Where is Gu Qishao?

48
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:12,650
Why doesn’t

49
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,910
he come to say goodbye.

50
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,180
He’s got new information.

51
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,300
It’s about Poison Master.

52
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,770
He went for it.

53
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,030
New information?

54
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,210
He should have

55
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,340
come to report to me.

56
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,570
It’s urgent.

57
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,150
Qishao had to take time.

58
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,240
He’s gone.

59
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,530
Zhuyu,

60
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,450
tell Gu Qishao

61
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,810
that do not play games

62
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:32,950
with me.

63
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,370
If he finds Poison Master,

64
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,370
he must report to me immediately.

65
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,110
You heard me?

66
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,360
Otherwise,

67
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,610
your best days

68
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,650
will end!

69
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:43,950
Yes.

70
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,200
He’ll learn it.

71
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,100
[Wangyou Palace]

72
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,760
Lyuluo,

73
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,780
come over.

74
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,290
Check my face.

75
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,750
Is there something wrong?

76
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,860
It’s fine.

77
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:06,700
Here.

78
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,720
Check here.

79
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,280
A red spot.

80
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,860
What’s that?

81
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,370
Did I touch anything

82
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,610
in the prison?

83
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,610
I don’t think so.

84
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,740
It’s internal heat.

85
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:18,089
I’ll get you some paste.

86
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:19,360
You’ll be fine soon.

87
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,529
Go get it.

88
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,700
I hate it.

89
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,140
How come I have

90
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,070
an acne?

91
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,780
Qingwu

92
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,970
will dislike me because of it,

93
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:29,990
won’t he?

94
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,610
Who the hell?

95
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,900
How dare you!

96
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,290
Sister,

97
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,220
are you alright?

98
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,400
It’s you.

99
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,860
Go away!

100
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,700
Sister,

101
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,950
you should walk and watch.

102
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,190
Sister, are you alright?

103
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,110
Of course I am.

104
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,350
Why are you here?

105
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,740
Her Royal Highness

106
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,210
told me to serve

107
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,650
His Majesty with dessert every day.

108
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,280
Great honor!

109
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,530
As proud as a peacock.

110
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,610
Her Royal Highness

111
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,360
is backing you back.

112
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,490
I have a son, a prince,

113
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,150
and I don’t look like a savage.

114
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,520
You overreacted, sister.

115
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,190
That’s not

116
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,900
what I meant to say.

117
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,240
Hurry up.

118
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,130
Noble Consort Xiao

119
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,530
is wicked and complains.

120
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,200
Negligible.

121
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,110
She is

122
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,860
getting mad.

123
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,990
Noble Consort Xiao

124
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,740
annoyed you again?

125
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:09,780
No,

126
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,110
Noble Consort Xiao didn’t.

127
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,860
Don’t defend her.

128
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,740
I know that woman.

129
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,570
I know what she is.

130
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,990
She embarrassed you.

131
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,650
There’re guards in the palace.

132
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,900
They saw it.

133
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,450
Listen,

134
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,360
you will ignore her.

135
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,130
I saw Noble Consort Xiao

136
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,140
wrathfully

137
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,030
got out your office.

138
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,110
Did you make her unhappy?

139
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,860
She thought her dessert and sorry

140
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,860
could trade my forgiveness.

141
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,290
No!

142
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,610
She failed me

143
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,950
and my favor on her.

144
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,700
It was life-and-death,

145
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,820
and she shilly-shallied.

146
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,610
I suppose

147
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,140
she had a good excuse.

148
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,600
Do not defend her any more.

149
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,200
I hate it!

150
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:00,990
Yes,

151
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,360
Your Majesty.

152
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,020
Your Majesty,

153
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,450
in my room,

154
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,330
you are free

155
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,990
from annoyance.

156
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,200
Anyway,

157
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,110
it takes time

158
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,530
to root out

159
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,780
Long Feiye.

160
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,700
Woman,

161
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,820
how dare you!

162
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,610
You can’t

163
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,570
root out Prince Qin.

164
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,280
I was kidding.

165
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,900
Kidding?

166
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,520
You’re doing the right thing, Your Majesty.

167
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,900
It seems

168
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,950
you know what I’m doing.

169
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,740
Yes, I do.

170
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,280
Prince Qin killed my father.

171
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,820
I hate him.

172
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,970
I can’t help hating

173
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,780
Prince Qin.

174
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,650
I’ve been in Tianning for long.

175
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,400
I stay myself in the palace.

176
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:07,820
I didn’t know

177
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,400
Grand Commandant’s case was so serious.

178
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,780
You

179
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,660
haven't been sleeping well lately.

180
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,610
I know it.

181
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:17,890
Prince Qin is getting

182
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:18,890
too strong.

183
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,490
He’s threatening the court.

184
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,030
I hate him,

185
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,410
Your Majesty.

186
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,610
Prince Qin killed my father

187
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,320
and threatens my husband.

188
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,650
Don’t you fear

189
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,700
I’d punish you?

190
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,650
No, I don’t.

191
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:38,860
I swore that

192
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,890
I’d never tell a lie

193
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,190
before Your Majesty.

194
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,150
I believe in you.

195
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,990
Rooting out Prince Qin

196
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,530
takes a long time.

197
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,700
[Ally with other princes, and the plan will succeed.]

198
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,360
Madam,

199
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,290
His Majesty has promised to let you out

200
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,250
of the palace to pray for me.

201
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:26,930
Get a chance

202
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,030
to contact Beili.

203
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,050
This letter

204
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,860
must be sent to Gu Qishao.

205
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,470
Yes, Your Highness.

206
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,150
That’s too much.

207
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,570
It’s cheap,

208
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,650
cheap enough.

209
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,490
Hello,

210
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,570
how much is the flower?

211
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,700
Five coins.

212
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,200
Fine.

213
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,370
Here you are.

214
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,070
Thank you.

215
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,450
How much is it?

216
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,410
-May I have a look?
-It’s cheap.

217
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,540
Find your favorite.

218
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,780
Please feel free.

219
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,330
Qishao.

220
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,200
You are back.

221
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,200
Do I surprise you?

222
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,490
It was just one day.

223
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,140
I got something for you

224
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,340
but you were not here.

225
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,190
What’s it?

226
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,780
A Madam

227
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,180
asked me to give you this.

228
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,130
I assigned you a mission.

229
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:22,990
How is it?

230
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,450
I sent her the message.

231
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,730
She will spy Tianhui’s plan

232
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,490
for moving Poison Master.

233
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,320
What’s up?

234
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,490
Chu Qingge asks

235
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,410
if we have resources

236
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,220
that can support her from the palace.

237
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,150
We don’t.

238
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,170
Apart from spies,

239
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,300
we have no more resources in the court.

240
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,810
Now,

241
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,940
the Crown Prince is the only resource.

242
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,610
But she is in the harem.

243
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,450
The Crown Prince may not

244
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,400
meet her.

245
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,700
If we refer to

246
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,700
the Crown Prince now,

247
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,650
it may alert him.

248
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,780
Put this aside.

249
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,070
I’ll consider it.

250
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,300
You may leave.

251
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,280
Yes.

252
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,130
Qishao,

253
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,130
your new dresses

254
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,260
are in the wardrobe.

255
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:13,700
Fine.

256
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,740
And, put White Ear down.

257
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,950
It smells.

258
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,400
I just love it.

259
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,400
Your Highness.

260
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,610
Leave us.

261
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,250
Message from Beili?

262
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,290
Beili requests

263
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,330
His Majesty’s

264
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,890
next move

265
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,570
of Poison Master.

266
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,650
Beili’s Crown Prince is in Tianning.

267
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,370
Seems they’re hunger for

268
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,610
Poison Master.

269
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,120
Your Highness,

270
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,360
Poison Master

271
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,090
makes army,

272
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:15,150
terrible infected army.

273
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,610
If we share the information

274
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,780
with Beili,

275
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,490
they gain too much.

276
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,430
When shepherds quarrel,
the wolf has a winning game.

277
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,610
Xiqiu is the weakest.

278
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,360
We have to create

279
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,820
the right moment.

280
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,180
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

281
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,280
The wife of Prince Qin

282
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,570
was put into prison

283
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,360
and involved in a murder.

284
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,290
You made the mansion

285
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,090
a laughingstock

286
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,740
of the whole world.

287
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,770
Do you deserve

288
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,970
your title of princess?

289
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,250
Blaming me

290
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,450
when he’s not here.

291
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,530
But she’s Prince Qin’s mother.

292
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,820
In the beginning,

293
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,990
I knew you’re a jinx.

294
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,400
Shameless!

295
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,820
You kicked the sedan

296
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,860
and thrust into the mansion.

297
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,400
I thought

298
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,450
you were less educated

299
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,070
and needed instructions

300
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,530
to act as a fair lady.

301
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,860
And you

302
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,490
poisoned General Mu.

303
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,100
Feiye turned against Princess Changbing

304
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,280
and the Crown Prince to save you.

305
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,030
Besides,

306
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,180
Grand Commandant was executed.

307
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,860
Do you know

308
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,860
how the rumors go?

309
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,180
I don’t know.

310
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,280
A jinx.

311
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,400
Doomed her mother

312
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,180
and then the pharmacy

313
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,950
of her poor aunt.

314
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,530
Look,

315
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,360
all these, one after another,

316
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,450
happened since you married into

317
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:55,570
this mansion.

318
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,490
It must be stopped.

319
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,200
I won’t let you

320
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,530
doom Prince Qin’s Mansion!

321
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,050
Mother, I’m afraid

322
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,400
I don’t agree with you.

323
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,610
If I am

324
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:06,700
really a jinx,

325
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,240
I’d run a business,

326
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,930
the doom business.

327
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,010
I’d be rich.

328
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:11,700
You…

329
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,320
Maid!

330
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,810
Lock her up in the wood shed.

331
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:17,950
Let her reflect.

332
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,770
Don’t feed her.

333
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:20,950
Let her starve,

334
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,450
till she learns not to

335
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,690
crack me back!

336
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:24,360
Yes.

337
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,950
Your Highness, please.

338
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,200
He’s sober and smart,

339
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,610
why she is so…

340
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,610
Are they mother and son?

341
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,820
She’s hot-headed

342
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,780
and irritable.

343
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,360
He’s like the deep sea,

344
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,320
too profound to know.

345
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,240
It’s about the time.

346
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,420
I don’t have to wait for him.

347
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,280
Someone will come to save me.

348
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,280
My… My face!

349
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,730
-My face!
-Princess.

350
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,370
Princess.

351
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,290
Qingwu will abandon me!

352
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,650
Princess, he will not.

353
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,280
I’ll bring the physician.

354
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:38,990
Physician,

355
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,240
what’s wrong with princess?

356
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,150
I’m sorry.

357
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,990
It’s so weird.

358
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,740
I have to say

359
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,650
it’s not ringworm.

360
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,650
But I can’t tell

361
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,780
what exactly it is.

362
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,530
My apology, princess.

363
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:05,950
You…

364
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:08,900
Princess!

365
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,610
Physician Gu,

366
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,410
what’s wrong

367
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,900
with princess?

368
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,700
To my knowledge,

369
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,190
princess is not ill.

370
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,070
She’s poisoned.

371
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,610
Poisoned?

372
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,490
Please heal her, now!

373
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,030
I’m sorry.

374
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,320
I’m afraid I can’t.

375
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,240
But I know who can.

376
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,400
She’s a superb healer.

377
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,740
Maybe she can help.

378
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:47,780
Who is she?

379
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,030
She’s

380
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,490
Princess Qin.

381
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,360
She…

382
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,410
Princess,

383
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,010
I get you tea.

384
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,140
Are you getting me drowned?

385
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,450
I had three cups already!

386
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,240
Where is she?

387
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:05,530
I have been waiting

388
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,609
for too long!

389
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,069
Where the hell is she?

390
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,180
Her Highness

391
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,290
left home in the morning.

392
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,609
She’s not back yet.

393
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:12,410
I don’t know

394
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,690
where she is.

395
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,900
Han Yunxi, who do you think you are?

396
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,900
I’ll find you.

397
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,150
Dare you hide from me?

398
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,030
Is he back?

399
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,200
If he doesn’t come back,

400
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,700
will I spend the night here?

401
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,530
I’m hungry.

402
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:44,900
It can’t be.

403
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,170
In the prison,

404
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,570
I powdered Changbing.

405
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,780
It should work now.

406
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,450
Is she coming?

407
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,780
Your Highness,

408
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,800
you got an important visitor.

409
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:04,860
I’m not going.

410
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,290
I’m reflecting.

411
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,150
Busy.

412
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,040
Your Highness,

413
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,210
your mother asks you to meet her.

414
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,130
She says you’ve shown repentance.

415
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,740
She says you are free.

416
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,130
Really?

417
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,030
Yes.

418
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,280
Shall we leave here?

419
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,130
My stomach.

420
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,970
I suddenly got hungry.

421
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,170
I need food

422
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,930
before meeting the important visitor.

423
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,150
Alright.

424
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,860
Your Highness,

425
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,990
you had enough?

426
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,190
Not yet.

427
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,090
Your Highness,

428
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,330
please hurry.

429
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,730
They’re waiting for you.

430
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,450
Relax.

431
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,610
I’m hungry.

432
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,950
Her Highness’s here.

433
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,780
Your Royal Highness. Mother.

434
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,070
Rise.

435
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,690
It seems

436
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,650
the Dowager rivals Consort Yi.

437
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,930
Your Royal Highness

438
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,730
and Princess Changbing,

439
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,150
how may I serve you?

440
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,110
Your Highness,

441
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,730
I was offensive

442
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:49,780
to my aunt.

443
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,330
My guilt tortured me

444
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,400
back in the palace.

445
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,990
And father blamed me.

446
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,370
Please do me a favor.

447
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,770
Let aunt go to the palace.

448
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,400
I will make it up to her.

449
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,490
Yunxi,

450
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,280
are you alright?

451
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,970
The ice water

452
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:09,810
princess splashed

453
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,110
on me in the prison

454
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,690
gave me a cold.

455
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,220
It has become a stubborn illness

456
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,750
and I will never get better.

457
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,450
Changbing,

458
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,150
you can see it.

459
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,690
Your aunt would like

460
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,070
to go with you.

461
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,200
But she’s weak and sick.

462
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,130
She can’t help you in the palace.

463
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,610
She may get you sick

464
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,490
and hurt you.

465
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,610
I can’t afford

466
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,610
to apologize to your father

467
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,820
and Her Royal Highness.

468
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,010
Your Highness.

469
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,210
It doesn’t matter.

470
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,130
I want aunt in the palace.

471
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,900
I’m just…

472
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,200
Sister,

473
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,360
look,

474
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,030
it’s between the youngsters.

475
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,330
We’re old women.

476
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,650
Don’t cut in.

477
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,280
Yes, sister.

478
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,820
Yunxi,

479
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,320
you’re too weak

480
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,320
to go to the palace.

481
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,990
If you get cold in the way

482
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,190
and get worse,

483
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,490
I can’t afford

484
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,860
to apologize to Feiye.

485
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,050
He would blame me

486
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,610
for not

487
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:20,950
taking good care of you.

488
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,130
It’s between you.

489
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,820
Don’t take me in.

490
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,530
Mother knows who she is.

491
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,400
She’s on my side, anyway.

492
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,700
You’re kidding, mother.

493
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,130
I know His Highness

494
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,070
very well.

495
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,930
He listens to you and His Majesty.

496
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,410
He loves you so much.

497
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,470
He won’t blame you.

498
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,370
Thank you, mother.

499
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,700
I appreciate your care.

500
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,320
Changbing,

501
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,690
I just

502
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,530
can’t help you.

503
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,100
Thank you for your cares.

504
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,330
When I get well,

505
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,280
I’ll go to you.

506
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,530
I’m afraid

507
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:59,970
Her Royal Highness and you

508
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:00,970
have to go back.

509
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:01,700
You…

510
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,560
Your Highness,

511
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,610
if aunt goes worse,

512
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:08,410
I’ll…

513
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,980
I’ll take the responsibility!

514
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,900
Let aunt go with me, please!

515
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,360
Well…

516
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,090
Grandmother,

517
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,140
please say something, grandmother.

518
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,240
Sister.

519
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,010
Changbing

520
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,240
is a pepperbox.

521
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,530
If Princess Qin

522
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,190
doesn’t go to the palace,

523
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,730
I’m afraid she will

524
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,820
keep annoying me

525
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,190
and her father.

526
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,110
Sister,

527
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,150
it’s their business.

528
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,030
We’d better stay away.

529
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,990
Grandmother.

530
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,950
Sister,

531
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,570
I beg you.

532
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,860
Poor Changbing

533
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,840
lost her mother in her childhood.

534
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,930
I love her so much,

535
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,360
nobody else does.

536
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,400
Please do her a favor.

537
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,050
Our wagons

538
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,530
are waiting at the gate.

539
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,370
Physician Gu

540
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:03,700
is in the palace.

541
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,170
He will

542
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:07,490
nurse Yunxi’s health.

543
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,950
Please let her go.

544
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,530
Your Highness,

545
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,900
please.

546
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,610
Alright.

547
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,490
Yunxi,

548
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,240
go to the palace.

549
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,280
Yes.

550
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,650
Thank you, Your Highness.

551
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,110
Thank you, Your Highness.

552
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,860
Stop! Stop!

553
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,570
Changbing!

554
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:25,970
Han Yunxi.

555
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,150
Changbing,

556
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,530
you…

557
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,410
How come you look like a ghost!

558
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,970
How dare you!

559
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:34,820
-No, no.
-You…

560
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,890
I feel dizzy.

561
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:38,950
Han Yunxi, come on.

562
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,130
Physician Gu said you’re good at detoxification.

563
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,700
Heal me, now!

564
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,930
You just said

565
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,320
you were sorry to me.

566
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,740
It turns out

567
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,130
that you want me to heal you.

568
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,180
Don’t waste time!

569
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,030
Heal me. Heal me now!

570
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,610
Princess,

571
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,280
I’d like to, but I can’t.

572
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,190
I’m too weak.

573
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:04,770
Princess,

574
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,530
you’d better stay away.

575
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,010
If I cough up blood

576
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:08,950
and spill on you,

577
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,290
it’ll be embarrassing.

578
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,690
Even if you’re dying,

579
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:13,570
before you die,

580
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:14,290
you have to heal

581
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:15,110
me.

582
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,190
Do it, Han Yunxi!

583
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,320
On your feet.

584
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,700
-Princess!
-Changbing!

585
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,730
You bitch!

586
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,900
You can’t pass out!

587
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,120
Don’t play tricks!

588
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,450
Han Yunxi, stand up!

589
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,450
Princess, don’t!

590
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,200
-Don’t!
-Princess!

591
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,700
Get off me!

592
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,650
-Don’t, Princess!
-Get off me!

593
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:38,490
Get off me!

594
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,610
Get off me!

595
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:42,360
Princess.

596
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,950
-Get her in.
-Yes.

597
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,980
Your Royal Highness.

598
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:43,150
Princess Qin got a cold,

599
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,530
a very serious cold.

600
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,010
She’s very weak.

601
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:48,870
She needs rest.

602
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,490
If you wake her up now

603
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:52,860
to heal the princess,

604
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,860
I’m afraid…

605
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,200
Afraid of what?

606
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,370
I’m afraid

607
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,900
she can’t heal the princess

608
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,240
and she will die.

609
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,530
Heal her first.

610
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,700
How long will it take?

611
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:15,970
Three days.

612
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,090
Princess Qin will be fine

613
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:17,900
in three days.

614
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,780
Maid!

615
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,450
Bring Princess Qin

616
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:24,490
to the annex chamber.

617
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,400
Yes.

618
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,900
Physician Gu,

619
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,490
use your best medicine

620
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,620
and heal her as soon as possible.

621
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,520
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

622
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:47,890
Your Highness.

623
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,190
You’re a bit weak.

624
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,450
I prescribed you

625
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,020
some restorative medicine.

626
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,150
It will help.

627
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,360
Thank you for that, Physician Gu.

628
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,450
A physician has a soft heart.

629
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,490
Princess is poisoned

630
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:59,780
and she suffers.

631
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,730
Your Highness

632
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:02,860
should help her.

633
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,330
I will.

634
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:05,700
I will heal her.

635
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,490
She’s just too rude.

636
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,150
I’ll manage it.

637
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,070
She needs a lesson.

638
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,810
Princess.

639
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,130
Lyuluo, scratch it.

640
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:21,770
-I can’t.
-Do it!

641
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:22,370
It’ll damage your face.

642
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:23,050
Do it!

643
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,090
General Mu won’t like it.

644
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,190
It’s too itchy!

645
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,530
-Too itchy!
-Calm down, princess!

646
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,490
Princess!

647
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:31,110
Damn it!

648
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,820
Your Royal Highness.

649
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,050
Grandmother!

650
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,370
Grandmother, help me.

651
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:38,150
It kills me!

652
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,450
Grandmother! Grandmother!

653
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,530
Aunt!

654
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,130
Aunt! Help me!

655
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,450
It kills me!

656
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:45,400
It kills me!

657
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,070
What happened to my face, aunt?

658
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,290
Your Royal Highness,

659
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:56,610
please stand away.

660
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:57,820
Why?

661
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,780
It’s the poison

662
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,140
on princess’s face.

663
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,290
It’s dangerous

664
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,320
and infectious.

665
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:04,860
Aunt.

666
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,450
It’s infectious!

667
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,730
Block up

668
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,280
Wangyou Palace, now.

669
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,240
Princess Qin,

670
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,610
you’ll stay here

671
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:13,700
with the princess.

672
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,490
I’ll tell His Majesty.

673
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,190
Physician Gu,

674
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,530
thank you.

675
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,530
Yes.

676
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,130
Grandmother!

677
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,260
Grandmother, don’t go. Grandmother!

678
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,250
Aunt!

679
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,690
Aunt, save me, please.

680
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,330
I don’t want to be blocked up.

681
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,030
Aunt!

682
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:31,970
Aunt!

683
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,280
Is it healable?

684
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,570
Yes, it is.

685
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,030
I’ll use paste to suppress it,

686
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,740
then make the cure.

687
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,810
But…

688
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:42,490
What?

689
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,730
You need an Thousand Years’ Blood Jade

690
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,170
to rub your face,

691
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,610
or you’ll heal slowly.

692
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:47,450
Thousand Years’ Blood Jade?

693
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,410
We have it.

694
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:49,650
Father’s Concubine Qing

695
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:50,690
presented grandmother

696
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:51,450
with an Thousand Years’ Blood Jade.

697
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,490
Everyone knows it.

698
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,730
Tell Lyuluo to take it.

699
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:54,410
I always take her

700
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:55,330
to grandmother’s chamber.

701
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,650
She knows where it is.

702
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,030
You’ve seen it.

703
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,410
Your grandmother

704
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,810
is afraid of you and avoids you.

705
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:02,700
You can’t take the jade.

706
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,810
What if something happens…

707
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:04,730
I’m responsible.

708
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,460
I’ll take the responsibility.

709
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,860
Aunt, please.

710
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,280
Lyuluo, go.

711
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,530
Alright.

712
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,100
Wait a moment, princess.

713
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,030
Aunt, come back soon.

714
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,190
Physician Gu.

715
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,160
Please take care of the princess.

716
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,200
Aunt, please go!

717
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:26,990
It’s yours.

718
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,830
Thanks, Your Highness.

719
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,330
Why is she

720
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,300
going to Her Royal Highness’s place

721
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,070
in excuse of the Blood Jade?

722
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,320
Thank you, Your Highness.

723
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,290
Not at all.

724
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:50,190
It’s alright.

725
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,180
Your Royal Highness.

726
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,740
It’s a rare chance.

727
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,610
It may be risky,

728
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,610
but I’ll check the palace.

729
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,050
Maybe I will

730
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,150
find something.

731
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,810
What brings you here, Lyuluo?

732
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:33,870
It’s the princess.

733
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,900
There is something wrong on her face.

734
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,290
We need something

735
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,210
from Her Royal Highness.

736
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:42,110
Could you let us in?

737
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,110
Certainly, sister.

738
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,250
Her Royal Highness loves the princess.

739
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,780
She’d give her everything.

740
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,210
Go get it.

741
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,650
But remember to return it

742
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:51,860
as soon as possible.

743
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:08,950
Lyuluo,

744
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,450
I will check here.

745
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:11,570
You may go there.

746
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:12,240
Yes.

747
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,180
Your Royal Highness.

748
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,700
Was Princess Qin

749
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,860
telling the truth?

750
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,900
Truth or not truth.

751
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,490
Anyway, keep an eye

752
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:55,450
on her.

753
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,480
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

754
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,740
That Han Yunxi

755
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,240
fawned on her mother.

756
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,610
She embarrassed me

757
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,030
before that woman.

758
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,320
Wasn’t it for Changbing,

759
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,820
how

760
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,400
could I bow to that bitch!

761
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:18,070
You love the princess.

762
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,650
My son rules the nation.

763
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,490
In her life,

764
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,320
she’s lower than me.

765
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,110
Her tricks…

766
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,610
I take her for nothing.

767
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,590
Her Royal Highness is back.

768
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,320
Your Royal Highness.

769
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,400
You look panicked.

770
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,620
Your Royal Highness.

771
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,780
Your Royal Highness.

772
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,280
Han Yunxi,

773
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,139
what are you doing here?

774
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:14,889
Your Royal Highness.

775
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:15,929
The princess sent me

776
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:17,770
and Princess Qin to borrow the Blood Jade.

777
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:19,280
She needs it.

778
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,699
Borrow?

779
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,730
Why didn’t you mention it

780
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:27,989
in Wangyou Palace?

781
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,929
I wanted to.

782
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:30,780
But…

783
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:35,330
Leave us.

784
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,190
Yes.

785
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,699
Han Yunxi.

786
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:44,699
Do you think

787
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:46,610
I don’t know

788
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,130
what you want

789
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:49,610
from here?

790
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:51,900
Your Royal Highness.

791
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,409
I need the jade

792
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:55,070
to heal the princess.

793
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,780
Everyone knows

794
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,330
Your Royal Highness loves your granddaughter

795
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,940
and will give her anything she needs.

796
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,970
You won’t

797
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,090
abandon the princess

798
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:03,550
because of the infection.

799
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,780
Are you threatening me?

800
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,610
No.

801
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,610
Remember.

802
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:15,030
I have your mother.

803
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,030
Save your tricks.

804
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,400
Yes.

805
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:22,990
Pardon me.

806
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,820
Your Royal Highness.

807
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,210
Han Yunxi

808
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,290
bribed the maid

809
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,280
and got in.

810
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,200
Cut her hands off!

811
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,320
Yes.

812
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,240
I feel better.

813
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,170
Aunt,

814
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,320
give me more.

815
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,700
I feel much better.

816
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:22,890
Lyuluo,

817
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:23,780
you can do it.

818
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,650
Yes.

819
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,780
Lyuluo, do it.

820
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:28,900
Do it.

821
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:42,240
Her Royal Highness arrives!

822
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,740
I knew she’d check it.

823
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,940
-Your Royal Highness!
-Your Royal Highness!

824
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,150
Rise.

825
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,490
-Yes, Your Royal Highness!
-Yes, Your Royal Highness!

826
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:53,130
It’s said the princess’s getting better.

827
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,090
Grandmother.

828
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,950
Grandmother, I feel much better.

829
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,900
Good.

830
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,450
Your Blood Jade works.

831
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,110
The princess will get better.

832
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,200
What is that poison?

833
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,370
Poisonous ringworm.

834
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:09,070
It must be from the prison.

835
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,370
The prison is foul

836
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:12,450
and poisonous.

837
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:13,250
Common people

838
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,610
may resist the poison.

839
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:15,930
But Changbing

840
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:16,990
is a princess.

841
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,200
She can’t.

842
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,660
Your Royal Highness.

843
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,650
Changbing belongs to the palace.

844
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,240
She can’t go to the prison.

845
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,820
Got it.

846
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,730
Physician Gu.

847
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:30,900
This is the prescription.

848
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,820
Thank you.

849
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,380
[Ten-sect cicada exuviation]

850
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:37,990
Physician Gu,

851
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,820
is it alright?

852
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,380
Your Royal Highness.

853
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,170
Most of the ingredients

854
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,330
on the prescription

855
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,540
can be found in the palace.

856
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:48,400
But we don’t have the ten-sect cicada exuviation.

857
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,070
Not in the palace?

858
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,610
I’m sure

859
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,270
we don’t have it in the palace.

860
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,730
It is

861
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,740
the exuviation of black cicada,

862
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,490
a common crude drug.

863
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,210
But a regular exuviation

864
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,400
has nine sects.

865
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,400
The ten-sect one is quite rare.

866
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,030
We don’t have it.

867
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,110
Find from drug stores.

868
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,300
Your Royal Highness.

869
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,330
The ten-sect cicada exuviation

870
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,810
is god-blessed treasure.

871
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,540
There are only two in the world.

872
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,280
One goes to the queen of Beili,

873
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,070
the other…

874
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,190
Who has it?

875
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,290
The other…

876
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:25,220
The late King gave it to Consort Yi.

877
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,650
I don’t know whether

878
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:27,910
she consumed it or not.

879
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,200
Mother has it?

880
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,530
Yunxi,

881
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,400
can we just skip it?

882
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,950
Does the paste

883
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:43,740
alone work?

884
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,320
Well,

885
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,730
the exuviation is the dominating drug.

886
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,530
It is indispensable.

887
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,940
The paste cures the symptoms, not the cause.

888
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,890
And,

889
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,290
the more paste we use,

890
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,650
the less it helps.

891
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:57,280
It is not the solution.

892
00:38:58,980 --> 00:38:59,650
Well,

893
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,900
please, Physician Gu,

894
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,740
pay a visit to Prince Qin’s Mansion.

895
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,580
Your Royal Highness.

896
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,810
The ten-sect cicada exuviation

897
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,610
is a rare treasure

898
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:12,130
and a gift from the late King.

899
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,570
I’m afraid

900
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:15,110
Consort Yi won’t give me.

901
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,450
May I ask

902
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,650
Your Royal Highness

903
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,900
to go with me to Prince Qin’s Mansion?

904
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,320
Well,

905
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,410
Yunxi,

906
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,530
could you, please?

907
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,090
Princess’s poison

908
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,770
may recur at any time.

909
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,070
I have to watch her.

910
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,660
Your Royal Highness,

911
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,030
if it takes too long,

912
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,010
I don’t know

913
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:38,240
what will happen.

914
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,730
Princess is a pepperbox.

915
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,610
She will shake the entire palace.

916
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:44,870
It's not good for outsiders to know this.

917
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:52,990
Fine.

918
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,200
It seems

919
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,530
I have to pay her a visit.

920
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:00,860
Mother,

921
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,370
this is a gift

922
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,970
from your daughter-in-law.

923
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:04,810
Hope

924
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,490
you could appreciate it.

925
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,740
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

926
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14,440
It’s about the ten-sect cicada exuviation.

927
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,030
Hope you could give me.

928
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,200
Changbing

929
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,990
will always remember your favor.

930
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,030
Sister.

931
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,110
It’s not a small case.

932
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,280
You shouldn’t have held back.

933
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,890
I thought

934
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,090
Changbing wanted Yunxi

935
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,240
to accompany her.

936
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:34,780
She went to heal her!

937
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,070
It’s not serious.

938
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,280
I just

939
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,450
didn’t want to bother you.

940
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,330
So I didn’t tell you.

941
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:43,860
She needs my precious

942
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,780
ten-sect cicada exuviation.

943
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,280
It is serious.

944
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,290
If I knew she was going to heal her,

945
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:55,110
I wouldn’t let her go.

946
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,840
Yunxi knows nothing about medicine.

947
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,450
She might give wrong diagnosis

948
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,350
and Changbing might get worse.

949
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,900
She won’t.

950
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,030
Look,

951
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,700
Physician Gu is helping her.

952
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,360
Physician Gu?

953
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,360
Let Physician Gu heal her.

954
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,740
It’s safe.

955
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,200
If Yunxi could heal,

956
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,240
the Hans wouldn’t have

957
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,110
called her rubbish.

958
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,740
Days ago

959
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,070
she was thrown to the prison.

960
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,360
She can’t heal people.

961
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,820
Sister,

962
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,030
you underestimated her.

963
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,450
If Yunxi is rubbish,

964
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,810
I wouldn’t have married her

965
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:36,280
to Prince Qin.

966
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,740
We misunderstood each other about General Mu.

967
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,190
Misunderstood?

968
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,690
Changbing

969
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:45,210
is young, innocent,

970
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,250
and messes around.

971
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,030
Look,

972
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,490
her father

973
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:50,110
has taught her a lesson.

974
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,280
Sister,

975
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,570
do not get mad

976
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,650
at a girl.

977
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:59,240
Everyone knows her.

978
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,340
You indulge her too much.

979
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,070
Yes, yes.

980
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,200
My apology,

981
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,610
Your Highness.
