Episode 31

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,450
Greetings, Prince Qin.

4
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,910
Greetings, Princess Qin.

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,780
-Greetings, brother.
-Greetings, Your Majesty.

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,240
Prince Qin and Princess Qin come here along.

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,420
What is the matter?

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,030
Your Majesty, my father’s been devoted

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,290
to treating the royals

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,860
for so many years.

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,810
We beg you to spare his life.

12
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,530
Han Cong’an violated the law.

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,790
The evidence is solid.

14
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,040
He must be killed

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,530
to convince the masses.

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,220
But you can rest assured.

17
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,280
You’ve married my brother,

18
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,050
so you’ve become a royal.

19
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,010
You won’t be implicated.

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,660
If I can cure Crown Prince,

21
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,700
could you please

22
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,760
let go of my father?

23
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:58,990
Princess Qin.

24
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,840
I know you’re a good physician.

25
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,489
But are you better than your father?

26
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:05,700
Even your father

27
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,230
failed to cure Crown Prince

28
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,470
and get the treatment delayed,

29
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,030
making him at stake.

30
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,070
How can I trust you

31
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,740
that you can cure him?

32
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,030
If I fail,

33
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,950
I’m willing to take all the consequences.

34
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,320
All the consequences?

35
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,570
But how?

36
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,450
Shall I kill you?

37
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,110
In that case,

38
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,740
my brother will hate my guts.

39
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:29,900
Right?

40
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,900
If Yunxi fails to cure Crown Prince,

41
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,650
I’ll take the penalty in her stead.

42
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:36,610
Penalty?

43
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,160
How will you take penalty for her?

44
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:40,720
I’ll go to the southern

45
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,600
barren states as an emissary,

46
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,509
establish diplomatic relations with them,

47
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:45,850
conquer them,

48
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,300
and open up new territory for Tianning.

49
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,910
That’s an empty promise.

50
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,470
Are you willing to

51
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,039
sign a military warrant?

52
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,600
I’ve prepared it.

53
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,660
[Military Warrant]

54
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,050
Good.

55
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,100
Since he’ll vouch for you,

56
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,470
Princess Qin,

57
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,850
you may go to treat Crown Prince.

58
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,260
Han Cong’an is in custody for now.

59
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,430
If you cure Crown Prince,

60
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,260
I’ll pardon all your family’s

61
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,390
guilt.

62
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,390
If you fail,

63
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,140
Han Cong’an will die.

64
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,100
My brother will

65
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,110
help me conquer the southern states.

66
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,400
Thanks, Your Majesty.

67
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,390
To cure Crown Prince,

68
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,010
Poison Beast’s blood is needed.

69
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:54,970
We’re gonna look for it

70
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,370
in Heaven Pit right away.

71
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,240
Poison Beast?

72
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:06,800
I forgot it.

73
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,100
In Heaven Pit,

74
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,510
there is Poison Beast which can cure

75
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,600
weird poisons.

76
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,790
Crown Prince is delayed too long.

77
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,880
Be back as soon as possible.

78
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,050
-Yes.
-Yes.

79
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,660
[Written by Prince Qin Long Feiye]

80
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:50,750
Your Highness.

81
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,470
Your Highness.

82
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,760
Princess Qin intends to save Han Cong’an.

83
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,820
Prince Qin signed a military warrant

84
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,140
with His Majesty.

85
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,550
Military warrant?

86
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,260
What is it about?

87
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:03,850
It’s said that

88
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,430
if Princess Qin

89
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,130
fails to cure Crown Prince,

90
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,510
Prince Qin will go to southern states

91
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,640
as an emissary

92
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,640
and won’t go back until these states

93
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,210
succumb to Tianning.

94
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,100
No wonder His Majesty agreed.

95
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,010
If Prince Qin goes there as an emissary,

96
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:23,720
he’ll be farther away from

97
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,060
the political center.

98
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,260
By that time, His Majesty

99
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,430
will be able to get back the power

100
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,510
one by one.

101
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,550
If he secretly

102
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,800
left the south,

103
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,430
that would breach the edict.

104
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,800
His Majesty will have a proper reason

105
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:40,930
to punish him.

106
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,050
Your Highness.

107
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,930
There’s another thing

108
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,140
confusing me.

109
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:47,800
What is it?

110
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,640
Although our situation in the palace

111
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,010
is getting better,

112
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,890
with the Second Prince here,

113
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,850
we still have concerns.

114
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,510
In this case,

115
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:00,550
why did you

116
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,100
poison Crown Prince?

117
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,640
He is

118
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,910
the only ally we’ve got at the moment.

119
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,450
Madam, you don’t know it.

120
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,850
Beili sent an emissary to me last time.

121
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,180
In fact, they were discontented

122
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,390
that the court didn’t have

123
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,050
much change since we came.

124
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,850
So,

125
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,090
they threatened me with my brother.

126
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:24,930
What?

127
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,050
How come?

128
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,390
In Xiqiu, His Majesty is well protected

129
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,320
by officials and imperial armies.

130
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,300
How come

131
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,680
Beili is so arrogant?

132
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,290
In the court of Xiqiu,

133
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,850
only the old ministers

134
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,630
have been helping my brother.

135
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,659
My uncle’s power is weakening,

136
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:40,760
but

137
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,430
he’s still covetous.

138
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,390
Hadn’t I married into Tianning,

139
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,380
and been backed by Beili

140
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,220
and Tianning,

141
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,470
my uncle

142
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,800
could have had Xiqiu in his control.

143
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,890
But Beili is also ambitious.

144
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,640
What should we do?

145
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,180
I’ve thought that it would be

146
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,470
like this.

147
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,140
But the situation

148
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,860
was too dangerous back then.

149
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,430
Xiqiu is too weak,

150
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,980
striving to survive among the powers.

151
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:15,600
So,

152
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,350
I hope Tianning and Beili

153
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,680
can fight each other now

154
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,110
so that they have no time for Xiqiu.

155
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,100
We can wait.

156
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,800
When Tianyin is old enough

157
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,730
to take the reins

158
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,260
and suppress my uncle,

159
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,600
I’ll take advantage of Tianning

160
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,340
to fight against Beili.

161
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,440
You suffer so much, Your Highness.

162
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,550
As for Crown Prince,

163
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,680
what should we do?

164
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,800
I think it’s a shame

165
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,800
to give up now.

166
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,520
Rest assured, Madam.

167
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,220
His Majesty will surely

168
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,350
handle it properly.

169
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,100
After all, Crown Prince is his son.

170
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,210
Your Highness.

171
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,390
Can Princess Qin

172
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,260
cure Crown Prince?

173
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,050
How can she miss

174
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,430
such a good opportunity?

175
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,140
Looks like Tianning is gonna be chaotic.

176
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:21,550
Madam.

177
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,100
Go to tell Gu Qishao.

178
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,430
Let him

179
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,130
make plans beforehand.

180
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,050
Yes.

181
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:28,970
I’m going now.

182
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,580
Your Highness.

183
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,159
Crown Prince can live for four days at most.

184
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,390
But Prince Qin

185
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,970
signed a military warrant with His Majesty

186
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,890
to get Poison Beast in Heaven Pit,

187
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,430
using its blood to cure Crown Prince.

188
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,090
How can I miss

189
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,640
such a good chance?

190
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,350
If necessary,

191
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,510
I can help him go to Hell.

192
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,250
Your Highness.

193
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
Prince Qin has signed

194
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,900
the military warrant.

195
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,350
Given his capability,

196
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,010
I’m afraid

197
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,680
he can really get the cure.

198
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,600
So, should we have men

199
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,050
kill him halfway?

200
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,140
This isn’t that simple.

201
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,530
My father has been afraid of my uncle.

202
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,550
He won’t miss

203
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,160
such a good chance.

204
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,720
My father

205
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,640
will not risk

206
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,850
Long Tianmo’s life.

207
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,470
So,

208
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,299
we must be very careful.

209
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,600
Well,

210
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,750
by your knowledge of His Majesty,

211
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:39,890
what do you think

212
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,429
His Majesty will do?

213
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,300
It means

214
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:52,640
if Prince Qin fails

215
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,550
to return to the palace within four days,

216
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,680
Long Tianmo will surely die.

217
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:58,760
Exactly.

218
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,600
I don’t know

219
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,300
what my father thinks, either.

220
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,360
But he will not risk

221
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,990
Long Tianmo’s life for sure.

222
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,670
Prince Qin is highly skilled.

223
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,660
If we attack them halfway

224
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,100
and get found out,

225
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,860
the consequence is too huge.

226
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,050
Your Highness.

227
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,400
What do you think then?

228
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:19,800
Well.

229
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,260
Send men to tail Prince Qin.

230
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,140
Remember.

231
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,470
Tail him from a distance.

232
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,600
Don’t get caught.

233
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,510
If I guess it right,

234
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,850
father has already sent men

235
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,750
to assassinate Prince Qin.

236
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,720
My uncle is a good fighter,

237
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,480
but if he is attacked

238
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,640
from the dark,

239
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,050
he won’t be able to hide.

240
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,010
This way,

241
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,640
when the two sides fight

242
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,600
and badly hurt each other,

243
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,350
we can take the advantage

244
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,220
and take away Poison Beast

245
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,930
effortlessly.

246
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,920
It’s said that Poison Beast

247
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,680
can detoxify any poison.

248
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,390
In this way,

249
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,440
not only can I get

250
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,760
a treasure,

251
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,930
but also can get Long Tianmo...

252
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,120
Your Highness.

253
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,890
What if His Majesty wouldn’t go to

254
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,550
kill Prince Qin halfway

255
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,140
as you said?

256
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,190
What do you think, sir?

257
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,280
As the saying goes,

258
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,420
you can’t have your cake

259
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,640
and eat it.

260
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:48,750
Your Highness,

261
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,100
I’m sorry.

262
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,220
It’s all because of me

263
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,550
that you got in trouble.

264
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,250
You shouldn’t be blamed.

265
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,430
It’s my fault

266
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,800
if any.

267
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,600
It’s me who took you,

268
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:10,760
Han Cong’an,

269
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,500
even the whole Han family

270
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:15,930
into desperation.

271
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,930
You don’t have to comfort me.

272
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:20,800
All in all,

273
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,140
no matter what happens,

274
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,740
let’s deal with it together.

275
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,680
Have you packed up?

276
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,080
Your Highness,

277
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,930
if we fail to find Poison Beast,

278
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,680
will you really go to the barren land

279
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,080
at the south of Tianning?

280
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:42,600
I won’t do

281
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,880
anything uncertain.

282
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,210
I know what I’m doing.

283
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,360
What do you mean?

284
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,510
Most of my force

285
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,750
is in the Southern Regions.

286
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,550
Now His Majesty

287
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,640
sent me there,

288
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,800
it’s more convenient for me

289
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,680
to get rid of His Majesty’s surveillance,

290
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,300
which is good for me

291
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,560
to dispatch and deploy

292
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,640
my armies.

293
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,960
No wonder you like playing Go.

294
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,300
You’re always one move ahead

295
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,560
to gain the advantage.

296
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,470
Have you recovered?

297
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,010
Thanks for your concern, Your Majesty.

298
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,340
I’ve almost recovered.

299
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,510
Now that you failed

300
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,800
both the two missions about Poison Master

301
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,930
and Poison Puppets,

302
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:51,720
I will

303
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,470
give you

304
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,430
a new mission

305
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,140
to redeem yourselves.

306
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,550
If you fail this mission again,

307
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,050
I will spare no mercy.

308
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,020
Thanks, Your Majesty.

309
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:17,330
Prince Qin will go to Heaven Pit to get Poison Beast.

310
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,930
You’ll wait at the gate.

311
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,220
Kill him

312
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,550
when he is out

313
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,470
and take Poison Beast back

314
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,550
to cure Crown Prince.

315
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:31,930
You understand?

316
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,260
I’m all yours, Your Majesty.

317
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,390
Go ahead.

318
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:54,830
Your Highness.

319
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:55,870
Your Highness.

320
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:02,180
Crown Prince orders you to leave.

321
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,460
Your Highness.

322
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,010
His Majesty said to forsake you.

323
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:13,600
So,

324
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,250
the Second Prince will win.

325
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:19,850
Father.

326
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,120
In order to wipe out Prince Qin,

327
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,510
you really don’t care about my life?

328
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,220
[Prince Qin’s Mansion]

329
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,030
Come, Poison Girl.

330
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:33,720
These are

331
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,350
all the medicines I prepared for you.

332
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,050
The first

333
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,740
is to be applied on your body.

334
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:38,690
The second

335
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,400
are the pills for you to take.

336
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,600
The third

337
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,780
is the powder countering Poison Sha.

338
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:45,680
I really appreciate

339
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,550
what you did

340
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,550
for me.

341
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,690
You’re welcome, Your Highness.

342
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,350
We’ll have been gone

343
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,880
before you can repay us.

344
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,390
Any flaws

345
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,680
of your medicines?

346
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,720
Flaws?

347
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,170
My medicines are all perfect.

348
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,090
That said,

349
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,470
shall I go to Heaven Pit

350
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,220
with you

351
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,550
to catch Poison Beast?

352
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,300
No.

353
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:10,510
Why?

354
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,200
Heaven Pit is too dangerous.

355
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,970
I’m not afraid at all.

356
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,400
Qishao.

357
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,070
You’ve helped me so much.

358
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:19,990
If you get in danger,

359
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,200
I’ll blame myself.

360
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:22,180
Poison Girl.

361
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,180
We’re friends.

362
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,860
Shouldn’t we help each other?

363
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,950
-I see.
-You...

364
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,190
What did I just say?

365
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,700
We can never wait for her

366
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,860
to repay us.

367
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,700
I’m sorry.

368
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:33,950
Alright.

369
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,370
I won’t make fun of you.

370
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,190
Go ahead.

371
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,450
Be sure to take care.

372
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,780
Now that it’s done,

373
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,450
I’ll take my leave.

374
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,480
Good day, Physician Gu.

375
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,500
Farewell.

376
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:48,650
Bye.

377
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,190
Shall I...

378
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,740
You may go back.

379
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,190
I’m gonna pack up.

380
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,320
How can you be

381
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,400
so ungrateful?

382
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,450
You always

383
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,490
order me around.

384
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,390
Li Quan.

385
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

386
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,260
Is my throne more important

387
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,680
or my son?

388
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,680
Your Majesty,

389
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,010
no worries.

390
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,470
His Highness will surely get better.

391
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,720
I’m asking you

392
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:48,220
which is more important, my throne or my son?

393
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,430
In my view,

394
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,640
both are important.

395
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:17,609
Apply more on them all.

396
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:18,720
Be careful.

397
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,599
Understand?

398
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:21,720
Yes.

399
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,390
Are you sure Prince Qin and others

400
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,600
will pass by?

401
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,510
Rest assured, Your Highness.

402
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,680
This is the only path

403
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:33,930
to Heaven Pit.

404
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,950
Apply all hidden weapons

405
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,830
with poison completely.

406
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,920
I’ve given my orders.

407
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,930
Good.

408
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:47,930
Even if I delay

409
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,720
the treatment of Long Tianmo,

410
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,050
as long as I kill Prince Qin,

411
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,600
my father won’t

412
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,680
blame me.

413
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,060
Yes, Your Highness.

414
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,430
At the Tianquan Inn,

415
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,930
I’ll exchange clothes with Tang Li.

416
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,930
Yunxi will exchange with Ningjing.

417
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,570
Exchange clothes?

418
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,400
Only Yunxi and I will go

419
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,300
to meet Bai Xiaochuan.

420
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,260
All the rest of you

421
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,620
shall regard Tang Li and Ningjing

422
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:19,720
as me

423
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,800
and the Princess,

424
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,590
escorting them to Heaven Pit.

425
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,530
If you run into any danger halfway,

426
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,820
return to Tianquan Inn immediately.

427
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:29,640
Yes.

428
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,510
What are you laughing at?

429
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,510
I’m laughing

430
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,760
you’re not like Prince Qin at all,

431
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,220
but like

432
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,970
a pretentious guard.

433
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,220
You imitate Han Yunxi then.

434
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,220
No problem.

435
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:49,680
Let me think.

436
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,100
Feiye.

437
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,640
My dress is beautiful,

438
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,430
isn’t it?

439
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,720
You’re like a maid.

440
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,510
Excuse me?

441
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,310
No, not at all.

442
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,390
You’re like a lady,

443
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,100
not a maid.

444
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,220
Not at all.

445
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,180
Tang Li.

446
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,890
You said I’m like a maid.

447
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,400
You’re taunting me, aren’t you?

448
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,640
What are you doing?

449
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,900
you wanna hit me again?

450
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,640
You got it.

451
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:23,780
I’m hitting you!

452
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,180
Sorry.

453
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:25,890
Sorry.

454
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:26,680
Don’t run!

455
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,320
Yah!

456
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,230
Here they are.

457
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,210
This is indeed the only path

458
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,020
to Heaven Pit.

459
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,010
Go.

460
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:05,960
Let’s go there.

461
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,510
-Go.
-Go.

462
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:15,890
Stay still.

463
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:22,760
Stay still.

464
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,720
The horse...

465
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,390
The horse is unsteady.

466
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,140
Don’t move around.

467
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,050
Stay still.

468
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,970
I said sit still!

469
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:36,450
Whoa!

470
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:37,820
Whoa!

471
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:43,930
Come.

472
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:47,970
Go.

473
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,220
Prince Qin and the Princess

474
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,150
are on their own.

475
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,680
What if they got ambushed?

476
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,600
Rest assured.

477
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,300
They’ll take

478
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,480
a very safe shortcut.

479
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,050
Also,

480
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,510
we aim to confuse Tianhui

481
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,050
and the Second Prince’s men.

482
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:15,140
They’ll be fine.

483
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,240
I’m still worried.

484
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,510
I’ll order the best guards

485
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,140
to

486
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,390
protect

487
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,510
the Princess and His Highness.

488
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,170
That would be more dangerous.

489
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,030
They said they’d travel light.

490
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:27,760
You just need to protect

491
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,970
Ningjing and me.

492
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,690
The more defensive you are,

493
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,550
the more convinced

494
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,470
the enemies will be.

495
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,000
That way,

496
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,390
my brother and Han Yunxi

497
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,190
will be safer.

498
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,600
Also,

499
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,820
so many bodyguards are with us.

500
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,900
Enemies will surely take the bait.

501
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:41,660
Don’t worry.

502
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:43,430
Alright.

503
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:46,710
Yah!

504
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:50,680
Yah!

505
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,190
Whoa.

506
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,450
Whoa.

507
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,140
What’s the matter, Your Highness?

508
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,850
This is a good place for ambush.

509
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:09,970
We should slow down

510
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,270
and be more careful.

511
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,140
Yes.

512
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,240
Yah!

513
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:17,550
Who are you?

514
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,210
Your Highness.

515
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,110
I’m the imperial guard, Lei,

516
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,810
and ordered by His Majesty

517
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,450
to tail Prince Qin secretly.

518
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:30,950
Your Highness,

519
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:33,430
we kill so many men of His Majesty’s.

520
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,430
Will His Majesty blame us?

521
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,220
Looks like

522
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,680
we have to silence them.

523
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,430
Kill them all!

524
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:55,840
Whoa.

525
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,280
An ambush ahead.

526
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,940
Protect His Highness.

527
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:02,550
Retreat.

528
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:08,870
Your Highness,

529
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:09,870
in this case,

530
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,180
we have to kill Prince Qin

531
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,440
to gain the advantage.

532
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,010
Go after Prince Qin first!

533
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,090
You two, hold on.

534
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:17,640
You, come with me.

535
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,180
Go.

536
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,310
What took you guys so long?

537
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,600
Your men have been here for long.

538
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,950
The shortcut is right ahead.

539
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,090
Let’s go in first.

540
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,010
Qishao.

541
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,350
Didn’t I tell you not to come?

542
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,210
Why do you come?

543
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,010
You didn’t let me come

544
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:55,390
for you were afraid that I’d get hurt.

545
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:56,220
You’re here with me.

546
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,090
What am I afraid of?

547
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:57,720
Moreover,

548
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,180
I’m here to protect you.

549
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,470
I don’t need your protection.

550
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,390
You may go back.

551
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,140
I’m joking.

552
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,890
I meant to

553
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,350
kill somebody here.

554
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:14,550
Badly,

555
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,720
I didn’t get him.

556
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,050
What’s more,

557
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,140
you didn’t take the artery, either.

[Tianquan Inn]

559
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,510
Your Highness,

560
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,550
according to Dark Guard,

561
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,180
Prince Qin is right inside.

562
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,140
Come.

563
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,680
Massage my shoulder.

564
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,260
Why?

565
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,050
I’m playing Han Yunxi.

566
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,050
I’m tired.

567
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:46,220
Well,

568
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,720
I’m playing my brother...

569
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,180
He is

570
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,140
like a stake.

571
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,180
You want to

572
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,160
keep your body stiff all day long?

573
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:54,090
I take care of you

574
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,480
and mother every day.

575
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,390
I bustle around every day.

576
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,550
Massage my leg.

577
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,010
Don’t I bustle around every day?

578
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,070
I also have to clean up your messes.

579
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,850
You give me a massage first.

580
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,970
You clean up the messes for me?

581
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,680
Who irresponsibly avoided the marriage

582
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,140
and left me the messes?

583
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,430
You’re Han Yunxi now.

584
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,140
I don’t care.

585
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,390
You should treat me

586
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,040
as Long Feiye treats Yunxi.

587
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,430
Massage my shoulder.

588
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,600
In your dreams.

589

Han Yunxi washed

590

my brother’s feet.

Come on. Wash my feet.

592
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,360
Come on. Wash them.

593

Hey, listen.

594
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:32,940
Are you two done?

His Highness and Princess

[Tianquan Inn]

598
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:49,600
Go.

599
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:55,550
Why are His Majesty’s men here?

600
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,260
Good.

601
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,400
We can kill them once for all.

602
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,810
Only the two of them?

603
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,020
Wait a while longer.

604
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,890
These two guards

605
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,140
are so capable.

606
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,620
Your Highness,

607
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,090
looks like Prince Qin

608
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,350
has many talents.

609
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,090
Luckily, we didn’t act.

610
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,410
Or we’d have lost the whole thing.

611
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,090
Prince Qin

612
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,390
seems to be a handful.

613
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,370
Your Highness,

614
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,300
how about

615
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,180
taking it by wit?

616
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:34,100
[Tianquan Inn]

618
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:41,720
Feng, what exactly happened?

619
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,360
Why are you alone?

620
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:44,490
Yu is dead.

621
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:46,320
Yu is dead.

622
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,320
Prince Qin’s Dark Guards

623
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,250
are formidable.

624
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,140
I was unable to get close.

625
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:52,780
Only three days left.

626
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,970
If Long Feiye still doesn’t go to Heave Pit

627
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:56,100
to get Poison Beast,

628
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:57,900
Crown Prince will definitely die.

629
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,760
How come he still stays in the inn?

630
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,860
Isn’t he afraid to be punished by His Majesty?

631
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,030
The Second Prince’s men

632
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,490
have been outside the inn.

633
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:05,320
Long Feiye

634
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,730
dares not to act rashly.

635
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,520
Whoa.

636
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,650
Your Highness.

637
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,450
One of your men has been killed

638
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:24,710
before the operation.

639
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,510
You’d better work with me

640
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,070
to kill Prince Qin.

641
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:31,190
But

642
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,500
His Majesty said

643
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,320
we shouldn’t kill him

644
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:36,050
before he gets Poison Beast.

645
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:37,530
By you guys?

646
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:40,190
Long Feiye has many skilled guards.

647
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,030
You’re unable to kill him.

648
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,820
Even if he gets Poison Beast,

649
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,780
it’s unlikely for you three

650
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,240
to kill him, isn’t it?

651
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,160
If you fail to kill him,

652
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,450
my father won’t let you off.

653
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,150
So,

654
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,150
the best option for you now

655
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:58,860
is to work with me

656
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,650
and kill him with one blow.

657
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,780
Maybe

658
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,650
you’ll still have a chance.

659
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:05,800
That said,

660
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,400
if Crown Prince dies,

661
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,370
we can’t live, either.

662
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:11,280
Excuse me.

663
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,650
Think about it. If Crown Prince is dead,

664
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:14,650
who

665
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,570
will take over the throne?

666
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,610
By that time,

667
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,570
His Majesty will confer the Second Prince

668
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:21,500
as Crown Prince.

669
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,530
You won’t have to

670
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,080
worry about your life.

671
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,450
Rather than death,

672
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,110
we can still

673
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,110
give you a slim hope. Right?

674
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:31,950
Well,

675
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:33,810
Your Highness,

676
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,400
what should we do next?

677
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:36,700
You only need to

678
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,860
fight with

679
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,360
the guards in the room

680
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,360
while I take my men in.

681
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,780
Then they’ll

682
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,650
all be eliminated.

683
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,280
Your Highness,

684
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,200
you also admitted

685
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,200
Long Feiye has many skilled guards.

686
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,570
Even Feng and Yu were...

687
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,530
Long Feiye’s martial arts

688
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:54,780
are even better.

689
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:55,860
Even if we distract

690
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,110
the guards around him,

691
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:59,320
I don’t think it’s easy to kill him.

692
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,110
This isn’t

693
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,740
your concern.

694
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,320
We’re at your disposal, Your Highness.

695
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:01,570
Be vigilant.

696

Traps are everywhere here.

697
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,630
Be very careful.

-Yes.
-Yes.

[Tianquan Inn]

700
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:09,310
Your Highness,

701
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,780
The archers are ready.

702
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,900
It’s surely foolproof this time.

703
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,650
Your trick

704
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,820
is indeed vicious.

705
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,530
What I think and I do

706
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,110
are all for Your Highness.

707
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,290
Don’t mistake it, sir.

708
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,949
I’m praising you

709
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,110
sincerely.

710
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:29,610
I’m flattered, Your Highness.

711
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,940
I’m not flattering you.

712
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:33,030
You asked Feng and the others

713
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,820
to distract Prince Qin

714
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,400
so that they could be silenced

715
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:38,960
by Prince Qin’s hands.

716
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:45,360
If they

717
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:46,780
come back alive,

718
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,650
I can

719
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,820
just get them cornered

720
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,199
and shoot them to death.

721
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:59,610
Your Highness is insightful.

722
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,070
You’ve seen through

723
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,950
all my moves.

724
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,280
Now we just need to

725
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,490
trap Prince Qin in the inn. Tomorrow,

726
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:09,190
even if he gets Poison Beast,

727
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,740
he can’t get to the palace timely

728
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,660
to detoxify Crown Prince.

729
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,360
Tang Li.

730
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:21,710
-What?
-Come here.

731
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:22,990
Come.

732
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,090
Listen to me.

733
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,610
Let go.

734
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,490
Feiye specially told me

735
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,990
someone would definitely come

736
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,190
to check out tonight.

737
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,490
We must make it real

738
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,780
flawlessly.

739
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,570
We don’t have to be

740
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:41,490
so close, do we?

741
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:43,450
It’s all for

742
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:44,740
Feiye and Yunxi.

743
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,340
If we are not close,

744
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,600
who would believe it?

745
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,800
You always have a reason.

746
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:54,660
I’m doing all of this

747
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:56,450
for my brother.

748
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,630
What do you mean?

749
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,820
You’re taking advantage of me.

750
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,900
I’m unmarried,

751
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:01,990
staying with a man

752
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:04,190
in a room at midnight,

753
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,610
cuddling and flirting.

754
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,760
Isn’t it indecent?

755
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,110
If someone finds out,

756
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,200
My reputation will all be ruined.

757
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,860
Keep it down.

758
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,110
But,

759
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,530
I’ve never seen my brother

760
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,200
makes out with Han Yunxi like that

761
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,460
in front of outsiders.

762
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,740
Outsiders must believe

763
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,160
they’ve consummated.

764
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,990
They love each other

765
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,240
and live in harmony.

766
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:30,950
Right?

767
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:34,820
Tang Li.

768
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,400
You punk!

769
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,310
Where is Poison Girl?

770
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:00,880
Poison Girl!

771
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,070
Poison Girl is missing.

772
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:18,400
Anybody here?

773
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,070
Hello?

774
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,400
Hello?

775
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,280
Anybody here?

776
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:38,570
It’s weird.

777
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,150
Someone did pull me.

778
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,070
Where is it?

779
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:55,780
Where am I?

780
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:35,400
Sir.

781
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:39,820
Poisoning Manual

782
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:42,200
was originally in Long Feiye’s hands.

783
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:47,970
I can’t believe

784
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,820
even you can’t cure her.

785
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,150
Her Beauty Blood

786
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,110
reacted with Poison Sha

787
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,110
and produced a new toxin

788
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,570
I’ve never seen before.

789
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,320
It intrigued me so much.

790
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,150
I have to research it.

791
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,280
What kind of toxin is it?

792
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,200
Rather than a toxin,

793
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,240
it’s more like evil power

794
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:12,320
that invades her body,

795
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:13,450
bewildering

796
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:15,320
and even controlling her mind,

797
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:17,490
making her violent and evil.

798
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:21,200
I haven’t got a cure yet,

799
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,700
so I let her sleep for now

800
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,960
and be controlled for my research.

801
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,360
Sir.

802
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:32,150
I’ve led Han Yunxi

803
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:33,650
to Poison Beast.

804
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,110
Good.

805
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,190
Stick to the plan.

806
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:38,950
Got it.

807
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,860
Take her

808
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,320
to a safe place.
