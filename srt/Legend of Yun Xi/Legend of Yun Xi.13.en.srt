Episode 13

3
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,280
Xifeng.

4
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:32,630
My steed.

5
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:33,700
Yes.

6
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:34,650
Steed.

7
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,030
Xifeng.

8
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:13,240
Where is he?

9
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,039
Your Highness.

10
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,650
He went to Yuze.

11
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,310
He’s gone to the palace.

12
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,570
After him!

13
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,530
He needs something important

14
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:21,930
before getting in there.

15
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:22,650
Yes.

16
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,039
Your Highness.

17
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:02,960
Your Highness.

18
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,229
Why are you here?

19
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,250
In case she makes trouble,

20
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,070
I come to help.

21
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,500
What are you doing here?

22
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,250
Nothing.

23
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,070
Let me out!

24
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,490
Let me out!

25
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,190
What was that?

26
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,190
The Truth Pill.

27
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,370
In this day,

28
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,329
if you tell a lie,

29
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:35,700
your pulse will run not smoothly

30
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,760
and it’ll kill you.

31
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,360
If I were you,

32
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,360
I’d play no tricks

33
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,410
and tell whatever

34
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,410
they want to know.

35
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,110
You are a snake!

36
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,570
You are a serpent.

37
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,150
You…

38
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,280
Your Highness, I’m done here.

39
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,280
Come back!

40
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,650
Come back!

41
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,600
Your Highness.

42
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,490
Your Highness.

43
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,850
What did you

44
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,030
feed that woman?

45
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,470
Something lets her tell the truth.

46
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,030
Is that real?

47
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,360
You’re awesome!

48
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,180
Thank you, Your Highness,

49
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,650
or His Highness

50
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,180
would have been in trouble.

51
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:13,990
He’s lucky.

52
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,570
I’m his lucky star.

53
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,780
It was the Crown Prince.

54
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,570
He let me,

55
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,400
or how could a whore

56
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:28,250
commit such a

57
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,240
big crime.

58
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:30,320
Guards!

59
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,100
Throw her into the condemned cell!

60
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,650
Yes.

61
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,610
You deserve it!

62
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,820
Leave us.

63
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,190
Yes.

64
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,910
She gave away the Crown Prince.

65
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,440
But I don’t believe

66
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,570
she told everything.

67
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,150
She’s good at Kung Fu

68
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,740
and poisoning.

69
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,360
She murdered your officials,

70
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,610
set me up,

71
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,450
and trapped my wife and I

72
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,900
in Mosquitoes Valley.

73
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,070
I had her captured

74
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,610
and wanted to

75
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,070
unveil who was behind her.

76
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,320
General Mu and I

77
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,610
planned a show,

78
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,820
but

79
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,030
General Mu nearly got killed.

80
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,950
I think

81
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,320
the Crown Prince is kindhearted,

82
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,190
and the poisoner is heartless.

83
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,780
He can’t be the Crown Prince.

84
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,530
Feiye,

85
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,190
don’t defend him.

86
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,780
He was used.

87
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,190
He’s stupid.

88
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,070
My reign

89
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,530
can’t be passed

90
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,190
to a stupid fool.

91
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,530
It’d be a nightmare.

92
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,580
I’ve got another report.

93
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,100
He’s a rat!

94
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,360
It was him!

95
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,750
It was all him!

96
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,570
He corrupted the Crown Prince!

97
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:26,990
Guards!

98
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,190
Bring him!

99
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,530
Yes.

100
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,780
I’d ask for a leave.

101
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,700
Feiye.

102
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,190
I’ve heard Changbing

103
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,590
is a headache

104
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,750
of you and your wife.

105
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,570
She’s too young.

106
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,280
Please forgive her.

107
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,500
Your Majesty said

108
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,070
she’s just young.

109
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,320
I won’t blame her.

110
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,450
Long Feiye,

111
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,570
you slipped through again!

112
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,860
Uncle, save me!

113
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,570
Mu Qingwu woke up

114
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,450
and Yuze’s in the palace.

115
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,070
Uncle,

116
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,020
they’re coming to me!

117
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,950
Father will kill me!

118
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,320
Brother,

119
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,320
here you come!

120
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,320
I’m with you.

121
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,950
Your Majesty, I’m listening.

122
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,650
My

123
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,240
only concern

124
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,860
is Tianmo.

125
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,650
He’s too young.

126
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,900
Being the Crown Prince

127
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,450
in the royal palace

128
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,200
is too hard for him.

129
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:35,530
Brother, please protect

130
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,280
my poor little boy.

131
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,360
Your Majesty,

132
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,450
I promise,

133
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,780
no one can set

134
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,030
a finger on Tianmo.

135
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,530
It’s my fault.

136
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,670
I shouldn’t have let her go.

137
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,070
I should have killed Princess Qin.

138
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,150
Stay calm.

139
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,820
I’ll protect your safety,

140
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,360
even the price is mine.

141
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,450
When Prince Qin accused

142
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,210
the Assistant Minister of Revenue in the court,

143
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,150
I knew it.

144
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,240
Someday

145
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,280
he will prove my corruption

146
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,130
and buying for your favors

147
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:16,930
and supports.

148
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,570
I took precautions.

149
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,950
You have nothing to do with the books.

150
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,570
Your mother died early.

151
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,030
You are the hope

152
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,150
of our bloodline.

153
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:37,820
I am expendable.

154
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,990
You are not.

155
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:41,240
You

156
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,900
will carry on

157
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,530
our bloodline.

158
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,900
Uncle!

159
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,740
After I go,

160
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,320
stay alert and smart.

161
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,070
His Majesty is in his prime.

162
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,070
Prince Qin is strong.

163
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,140
They’re like tigers.

164
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,990
You have to survive in between.

165
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,150
Keep low profile.

166
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,610
Do not rise up

167
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,900
until it’s your time.

168
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,030
Wait for your chance.

169
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,400
His Majesty summons you, Lord.

170
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,700
Remember

171
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,280
the duty put on

172
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,570
the Crown Prince.

173
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,400
You are the next king of Tianning.

174
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,200
Uncle!

175
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,450
Uncle!

176
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,030
Lord.

177
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,400
This way, please.

178
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,260
Your Majesty.

179
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,400
Forgive me.

180
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,280
You know who I am

181
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,590
and didn’t restrain your perversity.

182
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,150
It seems

183
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,860
I am too good

184
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,860
to her relatives.

185
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,650
I failed your trust.

186
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,570
I’m guilty.

187
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,740
You

188
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,340
committed guilty before asking

189
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,530
what’s going on.

190
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,360
You

191
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,740
are so insightful.

192
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,610
Why Prince Qin had you

193
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,990
on the ropes?

194
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,150
You really let me down.

195
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,150
Your Majesty.

196
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,860
The Crown Prince and I

197
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,860
did all these for you.

198
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,740
Prince Qin’s

199
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,530
strength is growing,

200
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,030
so is his prestige.

201
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,860
He threatens your authority.

202
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,280
The Crown Prince tried to put him down.

203
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,320
He did it for you.

204
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,990
He’s too young,

205
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,110
and too rash.

206
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,990
He did it for me!

207
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,310
You put the war funds

208
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,900
into your pocket.

209
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,190
You did it for me?

210
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,820
I have no excuse.

211
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,860
But I risk my life

212
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,070
to give a word of advice.

213
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,860
Prince Qin visited Poison Master’s

214
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,570
prison at midnight.

215
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,030
His wild scheme

216
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,700
is uncovered.

217
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,030
Did he?

218
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,740
Why didn’t you report?

219
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,150
He’s as crafty as a fox.

220
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,780
The Crown Prince and I

221
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,280
have no evidence.

222
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,450
We spied on him.

223
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,400
We didn’t expect

224
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,110
he noticed we were

225
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,900
in his way.

226
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,530
The Crown Prince

227
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,900
had to take my advices

228
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,860
and did the wrongdoings.

229
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,070
Let my humble life

230
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,190
be taken for this.

231
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,610
Your Majesty.

232
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,070
It’s all my fault.

233
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,400
I had the only sister.

234
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,030
She married Your Majesty

235
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,200
and had your favor,

236
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,990
though died young.

237
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,030
You’ve been giving

238
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,570
so much to my clan.

239
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,110
I’m effusive in my gratitude.

240
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,190
I beg you,

241
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,070
Your Majesty.

242
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,530
Give more love

243
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,400
to the Crown Prince

244
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,570
for the sake of his mother.

245
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,650
Guards!

246
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,490
Yes!

247
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,950
Put him into prison,

248
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,670
waiting for a sentence.

249
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,860
Your mercy!

250
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,070
Uncle,

251
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,030
I failed you!

252
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,320
Do not tear.

253
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,570
A Crown Prince

254
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,690
keeps his countenance

255
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,020
in face of catastrophe.

256
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,400
Tianmo,

257
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,730
Long Feiye took Poison Master.

258
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:47,900
That is treason.

259
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,190
He will conceal the infected

260
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,770
and the Poisoning Manual

261
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:53,770
from His Majesty.

262
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,650
He has valor and strategy.

263
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,190
Learn from this lesson.

264
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,410
Unless

265
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,290
you have incontestable evidence

266
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,030
against Long Feiye,

267
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,740
do not take action.

268
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,900
Yes, uncle.

269
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,110
In this situation,

270
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,110
you will work harder.

271
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,320
Your father expects

272
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,570
more than what you are.

273
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,190
Hone and improve,

274
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,430
do not make terrible mistakes.

275
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,280
His Majesty will not abandon his eldest son.

276
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,450
Remember,

277
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,900
think before act.

278
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,110
Tianmo,

279
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,700
you will go on your own.

280
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,770
I love my garden.

281
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,230
The flowers are blooming.

282
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,290
Feiye,

283
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,150
I hope you enjoy it.

284
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,490
Look at that path.

285
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,450
Many people think

286
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,110
it’s but a small path.

287
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,360
They don’t know

288
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,650
the path leads

289
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,650
to a large lawn.

290
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,400
So,

291
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,069
many things

292
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:13,109
are more than

293
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,109
what they look like.

294
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

295
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,940
In the case of My brother-in-law

296
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,490
and General Mu,

297
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,530
the Crown Prince is innocent.

298
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,150
My brother-in-law planned it.

299
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,480
He confessed everything.

300
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,190
I put him into prison.

301
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,280
I always believe

302
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,800
the Crown Prince is innocent.

303
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,860
Dictation.

304
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,450
The Grand Commandant

305
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,580
is convicted of murdering an court official,

306
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,420
attempting to murder Mu Qingwu, and

307
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,490
malfeasance,

308
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,610
to whom the sentence

309
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:54,940
shall be decapitation.

310
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,260
In consideration of his contributions to the state,

311
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,860
he is granted poisonous wine

312
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,440
and death in one piece.

313
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,900
Yes.

314
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,030
Long Feiye.

315
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,450
Your Majesty.

316
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,240
My dictation will be

317
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,200
executed by Prince Qin.

318
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

319
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:20,820
Go.

320
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,070
He deserves a decent death.

321
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,070
Long Feiye.

322
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,400
Does it make you happy?

323
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,280
Not until

324
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,640
the Crown Prince dies.

325
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,150
In your dreams.

326
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,610
The Crown Prince

327
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,010
will succeed the throne.

328
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,400
His Majesty will not let you.

329
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,610
In your dreams,

330
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,990
have you ever seen today?

331
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,150
Long Feiye,

332
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,280
you’re killing your own clan,

333
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,210
shaking the state of Tianning.

334
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,650
You’re the son of Tianning.

335
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,400
Do you know

336
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,360
what you are doing?

337
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,820
My clan?

338
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,370
You are already

339
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,280
a dead man.

340
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,400
I’d like to share my secret

341
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,330
and you’ll carry the secret

342
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,490
to your grave.

343
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,400
My clan is Qin Xi.

344
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,400
Tianning,

345
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,650
Xiqiu

346
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,050
and Beili betrayed my clan

347
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,780
and took the lands from my clan.

348
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,950
My state was perished.

349
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,670
I haven’t revenged yet.

350
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,700
Does it make me happy?

351
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,990
Each and every sin

352
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:23,980
you’ve done

353
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,530
will be paid off.

354
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:29,950
You…

355
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,650
You’re Qin Xi’s clan?

356
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,320
Surprise?

357
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,650
Men of Qin Xi

358
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,030
were killed in battles

359
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,330
or taken by you

360
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,610
and made the infected.

361
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,570
How could I survive?

362
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,450
You…

363
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,280
You…

364
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:51,820
You…

365
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,360
You are

366
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,860
the boy escaped!

367
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,610
You are infected!

368
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,110
Does it hurt?

369
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,780
It hurts once

370
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,110
and you die.

371
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,780
You’re lucky enough.

372
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,150
Every year,

373
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:26,850
every month

374
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,240
I have to suffer the pain

375
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,990
thousands of times worse than this.

376
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,150
The pain reminds me

377
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,200
of the enmity.

378
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,650
My family was slaughtered.

379
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,730
My people

380
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,570
are suffering the misery.

381
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,070
Tianning feeds its army

382
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,150
at the price of the people.

383
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,030
Listen up.

384
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,530
One day

385
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,010
I will take back

386
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,400
all that were mine.

387
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,580
I will revenge for my family,

388
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,450
and my people will

389
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:04,950
live in peace.

390
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,610
Yuze betrayed me.

391
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,810
My uncle drank

392
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:30,940
the poisonous wine.

393
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,990
What do you say?

394
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,220
Could you listen to me, Your Highness?

395
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,680
If you don’t agree with it,

396
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,700
I’m in your hand.

397
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:40,740
Say it!

398
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,070
His Lord did the wrong doings

399
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,050
to buy you favors

400
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:46,950
and supports.

401
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,820
Didn’t you know?

402
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,740
How could I know?

403
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,050
Uncle did it.

404
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:54,780
He did it.

405
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,780
If I knew,

406
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,740
father would not pardon me.

407
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,330
To be honest,

408
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,610
actually I knew

409
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,650
this would happen someday.

410
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,490
So,

411
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,150
I told Yuze that

412
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,690
if this happens

413
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:11,570
in the end,

414
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,590
she will put everything

415
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,320
on the Crown Prince.

416
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,400
What?

417
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,860
Why did you do that?

418
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,740
You’re the Crown Prince.

419
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,070
Don’t you know your father?

420
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,990
He’s paranoid.

421
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,410
You’re his son.

422
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,700
You should know him.

423
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,940
Too many things happened.

424
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,950
There must be

425
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,470
someone who helped you.

426
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,780
Yuze must give away someone,

427
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,700
or His Majesty would suspect you.

428
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,430
Think about it, Your Highness,

429
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,410
His Majesty

430
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,530
watches you.

431
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,990
Prince Qin

432
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,820
or anyone else

433
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:54,850
wants to use you

434
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,200
and your soft heart.

435
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,320
They want you to do wrongs.

436
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,020
You are the successor of the throne

437
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,820
and the weakness of His Majesty.

438
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,700
Everyone knows that.

439
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,700
And do you know

440
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:13,690
who His Majesty’s

441
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:14,900
worst enemy is?

442
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,610
Prince Qin.

443
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:19,700
Yes,

444
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,030
Prince Qin.

445
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,700
This is a war.

446
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,790
Before fighting his enemy,

447
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,400
who would kill his own man?

448
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,550
Even that’s Grand Commandant.

449
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,040
That was the last thing

450
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,400
His Majesty would do.

451
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,200
Are you telling me that

452
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,900
father had to do it?

453
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,280
Absolutely.

454
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,370
His Lord was dead.

455
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:41,090
Your Highness

456
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,320
needs a good helper.

457
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,820
I recommend myself as an advisor

458
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,570
of the Crown Prince.

459
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:49,780
Great!

460
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,190
Great!

461

Uncle was dead.

464
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,460
I confined myself in this house thinking,

465
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,530
and worked out

466
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:00,990
a plan against Prince Qin.

467
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,330
However, it is

468
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:03,450
far from perfect.

469
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,950
I’d like to ask you for advices.

470

had plundered

the entire state.

strong as it seems to be.

478

What shall we do with these?

488
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,070
They’re the relief,

all of them.

490

Shall we report His Majesty?

You report

492

and they go to the treasury.

493
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,170

Here you are.

00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,190
Thank you.

Come on.

Put it on.

Ningjing and I

543
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,190
were shopping there

544
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,610
when General Mu

545
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,860
escorted Yuze.

546
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:12,820
I thought

547
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,110
she was kidnapped.

548
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,490
I thought we’d never

549
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,530
vindicate you.

550
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:17,730
And I went after them.

551
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,660
If I hadn’t gone after them,

552
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,410
there wouldn’t have been

553

so many troubles.

You have a kind heart.

555
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,310
Beg your pardon?

556
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,030
I said it was not your fault.

557
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,760
You had a good purpose.

558
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,250
No, no.

559

Say it again!

561
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,740
Say it again!

Say it again!

563
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:44,730
I have something.

564
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,400

to help me.

His price is Yuze.

He asked me to feed her the pill.

604

the life of a gardener.

ask father

to let you spy Tianning.

714
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,030
about Poison Master.

715
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,320
Father

716
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,530
is losing his patience.

717
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,300
Tianning’s Crown Prince is under my control.

718
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,700
Tianning’s court will be

719
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,710
unsettled soon.

720
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,060
And I’ve got verified information.

721
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,140
Poison Master was moved

722
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,270
to Prince Tianqing,

723
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,650
and may be moved again.

724
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,110
If this is verified,

725
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,140
it’s a good chance

726
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,400
to take Poison Master.

727
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,200
Is the information credible?

728
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:54,900
Yes, it is.

729
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,360
My spy to the palace

730
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,360
has got Tianning’s plan

731
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,740
for moving Poison Master.

732
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,610
Good.

733
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,110
If we have Poison Master,

734
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,780
Beili

735
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,610
will develop the infected.

736
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,780
The world will

737
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,190
be ruled by us.

738
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,530
I came for noodle

739
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,950
and come across you.

740
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,450
Don’t tell me

741
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,980
you love this noodle store.

742
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,450
I came to buy herbs.

743
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:51,780
Great.

744
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,850
Wait a moment.

745
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:53,570
I’ll finish the noodle

746
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:54,370
and escort you back.

747
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,400
No, thank you.

748
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,490
I came here

749
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,900
because it’s quiet.

750
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,400
Have a good time.

751
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,190
Enjoy your loneliness.

752
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,030
Poison girl.

753
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,610
Each time I meet you,

754
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,820
you are in a hurry.

755
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:06,820
You said

756
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,940
I saved your life.

757
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,250
I am expecting

758
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,200
you pay me back.

759
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,110
Next time.

760
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,230
Next time I’ll give you a treat.

761
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,070
Wait.

762
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,570
Always next time.

763
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:17,610
When is next time?

764
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,100
Too many next times

765
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,200
between you and me.

766
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,320
Is it because

767
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,070
I came to your life

768
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,310
a bit later than him?

769
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,650
Too serious!

770
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,190
I’ve got to go now.

771
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,200
In ten days,

772
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,110
right here

773
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,460
I’ll give you a treat.

774
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:42,650
Alright.

775
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,740
Ten days,

776
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:44,920
I will wait for you.

777
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,400
It’s time.

778
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,360
Execute!

779
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,610
Great! Great! Great!

780
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,340
[Chief Justice’s Mansion]

781
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,650
People adore Prince Qin.

782
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,510
Brother,

783
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,450
you’re now

784
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:04,860
an idol of the people.

785
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,330
You acted on your discretion.

786
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,530
You used the money he stole

787
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:08,660
as the relief funds.

788
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,490
King Tianhui couldn’t say no.

789
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:13,400
It pleases everyone.

790
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,610
King Tianhui

791
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,660
assigned the Ministries of Revenue

792
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,660
and Personnel to the confiscation.

793
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,030
He didn’t know

794
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,400
they’re under my control.

795
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:26,780
Now

796
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,540
the Grand Commandant was neutralized,

797
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,040
the Crown Prince is a fool,

798
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,470
and three of his courtiers were executed.

799
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,740
I doubt

800
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,240
who dares to serve him.

801
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,910
Fill the offices with your men.

802
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,570
Well,

803
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,870
people are singing the name

804
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,440
of Tianning’s Prince Qin.

805
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,740
When could we

806
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:50,730
rise in the name of

807
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:52,610
the bloodline of former Qin?
