1
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,655
You didn't have to walk me back
to my dorm.

2
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,534
Get home safely.

3
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,995
Okay. I'll text you when I get home.

4
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:38,621
-Okay.
-Good night.

5
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:39,789
You too.

6
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,249
-Bye.
-Bye.

7
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,511
Hey. Where are you going?

8
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,973
Se-wan should be back by now,
but she's not here.

9
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:03,021
Hey. Who's that? Isn't that Se-wan?

10
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,232
Thank you for tonight.

11
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,193
You didn't have to drive me home.

12
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,154
What do you mean? Of course, I should.

13
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,156
Go on in.

14
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,157
You go first.

15
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,658
Okay.

16
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,163
What's going on there?

17
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,582
She looks like
she doesn't want to say goodbye.

18
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:25,043
I didn't recognize him at first.
It's been so long.

19
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,378
-I never even imagined.
-Really?

20
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,047
He runs a plastic surgery clinic?

21
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,215
Awesome.

22
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:34,219
Your ninth grade tutor showed up
as a plastic surgeon.

23
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,221
Of course, you didn't recognize him.

24
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,181
How did you meet him?

25
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,557
Well…

26
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:43,103
I was guiding foreigners
who came to Korea for plastic surgery.

27
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,814
He was at this new clinic in Cheongdam,

28
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:48,566
and he recognized me right away.

29
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,736
You know I look young.
He said I look the same.

30
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,989
Still. Ninth grade is a bit of a stretch.

31
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,033
Jamie.

32
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,993
I hear bitterness in your voice.

33
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,829
Are you jealous?

34
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:02,956
No. Me?

35
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,291
He's just an old tutor.

36
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,797
Former jealousy expert-turned-appraiser.

37
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,924
Sam. What do you think?

38
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,095
Okay. Her ninth grade tutor showed up.

39
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,264
He's now a plastic surgeon
with his own clinic.

40
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:20,723
I would say

41
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,852
it's past 50 points on the jealousy scale.

42
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,603
He drove her home, so 60?

43
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,190
But look at Se-wan.

44
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,860
That's not the look of someone
who ran into her old tutor.

45
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:36,197
Right? Her face is all red,
she can't close her mouth,

46
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,657
and she can't stop smiling.

47
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,868
You're being suspicious.

48
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,953
What's this? There must be something else.

49
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,830
It's a secret.

50
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,790
Spill it! Now!

51
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,333
-Must we torture you?
-He was…

52
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,545
my first love.

53
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,090
He broke the chicken bone.

54
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,134
You broke 70 on the jealousy scale.

55
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,678
Was that first love mutual?
Or was it just you?

56
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,597
Just me, of course.

57
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,892
He was a hot med student,
so he was famous.

58
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,895
He was called Gong Yoo of Daechi-dong.
He was insanely popular.

59
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,521
He didn't even notice me.

60
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:14,194
I even baked him a chocolate cake.

61
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,404
What? You baked him a cake?

62
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,697
Hello? Hi.

63
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,575
Yes. I got home safely thanks to you.

64
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,702
Tomorrow? Lunch?

65
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,246
Sure, I'd love to. Yes.

66
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,500
Yes. Is that so?

67
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,836
How lucky.

68
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,465
She met her first love again,
and he was upgraded several levels.

69
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,551
I think her tutor
is interested in her too.

70
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,220
He even drove her here.

71
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,264
A tutor can drive his former student home.

72
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,266
-It's just good manners.
-No way.

73
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,060
He's buying her lunch tomorrow too.

74
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,144
Babe. Stop.

75
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,313
Jamie broke 90 on the jealousy scale

76
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:53,107
once he heard about the chocolate cake.
He'll explode.

77
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,444
Shit. Who ordered them with bones?

78
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,154
You should order boneless!

79
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,659
This is getting out of hand.

80
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:06,120
Why do you keep wearing my socks?

81
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,248
Our laundry gets mixed up,

82
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,375
so I wear your socks once in a while.

83
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,961
What? Once in a while?

84
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,213
Then where are all my underwear and socks?

85
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,715
I only have half of what I had
at the start of the semester.

86
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:21,678
I did borrow your underwear once,
but it was too old, so I threw it away.

87
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,055
That's why I bought you new ones
a few days ago.

88
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,015
I wouldn't complain if that was all.

89
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,475
You're too much.

90
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:30,019
You're already a nuisance
living in our room.

91
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,354
I won't take it anymore.

92
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:34,274
Fine. The semester's almost over.
Please be patient.

93
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,401
What was that? He lives here?

94
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:39,821
I heard someone was secretly living
in the dorm.

95
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,407
I didn't want to believe it,
but it was you.

96
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,784
Get out of the dorm now!

97
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,205
The person you have called
is currently unavailable…

98
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,917
Do they know already?
No one is answering their phone.

99
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,586
Where will I live starting tomorrow?

100
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,755
I can't commute from Jirisan.

101
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,426
Where will I sleep tonight?

102
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,012
Hey. Hyun-min, is that you?

103
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:07,348
Hey. Jun-yeong. What are you doing here?

104
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,564
So you got kicked out of the dorm
and have nowhere to go?

105
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,733
I'm ashamed to face you.

106
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,695
When the rice cooker blew out the power
at the subway station,

107
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,405
your mom paid for it all.

108
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,407
I'm so sorry.

109
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,408
It's fine.

110
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,996
Actually, there's something
I need to tell you.

111
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,624
I'm going out with your sister Hyun-a.

112
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,376
What? With Hyun-a?

113
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,378
How do you know her?

114
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,465
I met her by chance last time
when she was in Seoul.

115
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,258
I even went to Jirisan.

116
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,012
Anyway, you may end up
becoming my brother-in-law,

117
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,680
so I'll take care of you.

118
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,475
If you have nowhere to go,
why don't you stay with me?

119
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,143
What? Really?

120
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,615
I can't believe my useless sister Hyun-a
was actually useful.

121
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:09,202
You never know
what life will throw at you.

122
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,289
My mom said okay.

123
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,208
Make yourself at home.

124
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,709
Thanks, Jun-yeong.

125
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,087
Where should I sleep?

126
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,964
In this corner? This corner?

127
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,759
No. You take the bed.

128
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,886
I prefer sleeping on the floor.

129
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,680
Awesome. I can sleep here?

130
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,266
This is heaven.

131
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,603
It's much nicer than the bed
at the dormitory.

132
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,231
Sorry my room is a bit messy.

133
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,858
-The housekeeper will be here tomorrow.
-No.

134
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,485
Just my two cents.

135
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,237
I think I should earn my keep.

136
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,030
I'm great at cleaning.

137
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:56,999
Who…

138
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,546
Hello. He's a close friend.
Hyun-min, she's my tutor.

139
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,797
Hello.

140
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,006
Yes, hello.

141
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,218
Don't mind me,
and carry on with your lesson.

142
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,511
I'm going to tidy up.

143
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,237
I feel so bad for Hyun-min.

144
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,822
He has nowhere to go.

145
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:31,033
The professor was really pissed off
at me yesterday.

146
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,410
There's nothing I can do.

147
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:35,163
I was against it from the start
for breaking the rule.

148
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,581
It was bound to happen.

149
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,374
You must be relieved.

150
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,085
Even still, a friend who lived with us
was kicked out.

151
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,795
How can you sleep so comfortably?

152
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,840
You were conked out and snoring.

153
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,679
I'm suspicious of Hans.
He was against it from the get-go.

154
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:55,933
The professor found out yesterday
because he fought with Hyun-min.

155
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,479
I bet it was Hans who reported him.

156
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,481
That heartless prick.

157
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,692
He could have helped poor Hyun-min out.

158
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:08,237
Right? Friends should be loyal
and protect each other.

159
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,698
How could he betray him? That jerk.

160
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:11,866
That's right.

161
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,118
Last time,
someone submitted an anonymous letter

162
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,496
that I was slacking off
and being mean to the kids.

163
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,540
The professor gave me an earful
and almost fired me.

164
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,375
That asshole.

165
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,169
That was Hyun-min.

166
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,338
What? Hyun-min?

167
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:29,008
That little jerk. Where is he?

168
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,843
I'm going to get that kid.

169
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,931
Thanks a lot.

170
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,227
Anyway, Hyun-a has a really bad temper.

171
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,728
As her brother, I'm worried.

172
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,356
Even if she acts like a brat, be patient.

173
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,524
Not at all.

174
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,902
I'm a little too indecisive,
so I need a tough girl like her.

175
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:52,740
It's Hyun-a.

176
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:53,950
Okay. Take it.

177
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,038
Hey, Hyun-a. Why weren't you
answering your phone yesterday?

178
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,708
What? You want to break up?

179
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,044
What do you mean?

180
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,965
You can't do the long-distance thing?

181
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,467
Hey, Hyun-a.

182
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,480
Wait. Hold on. Wait.

183
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,190
Just my two cents.

184
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,234
Well, this isn't my fault.

185
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:30,319
I'm sorry.

186
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:34,282
But since it's over with Hyun-a,
it's weird to live with her brother.

187
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,242
But, wait.

188
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,204
Damn it. What a letdown.

189
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,958
Hyun-a, that brat. She is utterly useless.

190
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,795
My life sucks. Where do I sleep tonight?

191
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,464
Damn it.

192
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,591
What?

193
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,634
He'll give you free plastic surgery?

194
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:57,054
Yes. I didn't like how my eyes
were so droopy.

195
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,556
I've always wanted surgery.

196
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,018
But he said he'd do it for me for free
since I was his student.

197
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,687
He said all my friends get discounts too.

198
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,189
Really? Se-wan, you have to take me.

199
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,902
Isn't it a bit risky?
He just opened his practice.

200
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,738
He was always very thorough.

201
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,198
And the reviews say he's the best.

202
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,158
You believe that?

203
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,327
-Reviews can be made up.
-They are not.

204
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,329
Carson! Come with us tomorrow.

205
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,747
Why would I get surgery?

206
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,665
I'm going to live as I am.

207
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,500
You should cherish your body.

208
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,919
It is a gift from your parents.

209
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,172
What's your problem? Did we ask?

210
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,382
Don't act high and mighty, you traitor.

211
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,344
It isn't only about
making your face prettier.

212
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,847
By eliminating my complex,
it increases my happiness.

213
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,724
It's like a surgery for life.

214
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,809
But Koreans are excessive.

215
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,646
How is being ugly a sin?

216
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,357
We have plenty of sinners here. Repent.

217
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,441
-Seriously.
-Why you…

218
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,610
You need to repent the most.

219
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:56,322
You don't have an ounce of loyalty.
You're heartless and cruel.

220
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,823
Why are you picking on me?

221
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,493
I didn't report Hyun-min.

222
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,286
Right.

223
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,707
Anyway, I'm against you
getting plastic surgery.

224
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:12,338
Do I need permission from you
to fix my own face?

225
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:15,424
What guy would like
his girlfriend getting plastic surgery?

226
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,761
Sam. What will you say
if Minnie wants to get plastic surgery?

227
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,681
Right. I'm going with Se-wan
for a consultation tomorrow.

228
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,517
If she wants to do it,
that's her business.

229
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,144
It's better
if my girlfriend gets prettier.

230
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,689
Minnie. While you're at it, do it right.

231
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,273
Get your forehead, boobs,

232
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:33,901
and butt too.

233
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,153
What the hell? Are you unhappy with me?

234
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,238
Want a new girlfriend?

235
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:40,157
You're like a cute,
unpredictable rugby ball.

236
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,909
I mean I'm happy if you're happy.

237
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,619
What's gotten into him?

238
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,371
Where did the narrow-minded Sam go?

239
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,624
Hey. I've already
been through the wringer.

240
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,502
I even defeated the mighty Eoksour.

241
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:56,424
You can't compare us
to that insecure couple. Am I right?

242
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,342
Where does he get this confidence?

243
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,678
Even I'm nervous that I may cheat.

244
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,763
What makes him so confident?

245
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,641
Still, I appreciate that he trusts me.

246
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,687
See that?
It's because I'm a confident adult

247
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,356
that Minnie chose me over Eoksour.

248
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,444
Jamie. A man must be confident.
That's all.

249
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,570
Leave Se-wan alone.

250
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,321
He still thinks Eoksour is--

251
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,826
Anyway, I just don't get it.

252
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,995
You're pretty now, so why?

253
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,830
Jamie…

254
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:31,083
Are you that against plastic surgery?
Why are you trying to stop me?

255
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,837
Se-wan. Let me, the jealous appraiser,
summarize it for you.

256
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,842
Jamie isn't upset about you
getting plastic surgery.

257
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,679
He doesn't want you getting it
from your first love.

258
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,432
Jamie, is that really it?

259
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,435
My gosh. How adorable.

260
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,897
Fine. It's both the surgery
and the first love.

261
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:57,693
What guy would like another guy staring
and touching the face of his girlfriend?

262
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,154
Goodness. Is that right?

263
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,406
Don't worry.

264
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,117
He was just my first love.
I have no feelings for him now.

265
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,495
He was your first love.
How could you feel nothing?

266
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,831
For girls, it's all about their last love,
not their first love.

267
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,083
And my last love is you.

268
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:15,419
What?

269
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,216
How cute.

270
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,635
Getting jealous and arguing. Right?

271
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:26,138
You're right. You need to go through
all this for it to be real love.

272
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,974
Try taking your own advice.

273
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,100
Whatever.

274
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,978
IL-SEOB

275
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:34,730
Hello?

276
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,024
Hey.

277
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,114
My gosh. Where do I go today?

278
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,910
How long do you plan to stay?

279
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,870
You've been here for hours.

280
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,872
I haven't finished eating.

281
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,207
I'll leave once I finish.

282
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,050
It looks really cold out.

283
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,595
I'll freeze to death
if I sleep outdoors today.

284
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,349
-Excuse me.
-Listen. I'm not done eating. Look.

285
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,311
Hello. I'm Jun-yeong's tutor.

286
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,105
Yes. Hello.

287
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,858
What are you doing here so late?

288
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,568
Well, I…

289
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:25,656
I overheard you just now.
Did you say you're sleeping outside?

290
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:26,949
In this cold?

291
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:31,036
Yes. Something happened,
and I have nowhere to go.

292
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,914
Gosh. But it's so cold out.

293
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,336
Do you want to come to my place?

294
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,590
My roommate just moved out,
so there's an empty room.

295
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,009
What? Do you mean it?

296
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,728
It's done. Come eat.

297
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:56,770
Okay.

298
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,529
Those pajamas look good on you.

299
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,240
You look cute.

300
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,658
Not at all.

301
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:13,203
But can I really sleep here?

302
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:14,663
Yes.

303
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,500
But my place is a bit messy.

304
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,836
I've been busy lately.

305
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,463
Not at all.

306
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,050
I just feel bad being such a nuisance.

307
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,552
Eat up. The noodles will get soggy.

308
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,511
Okay.

309
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,504
I have to go to the clinic early.
I have to work tonight.

310
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,381
Okay. I'll go as early as I can.

311
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,007
Do your consultation first,

312
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,802
make the introduction when I get there,
and you can leave.

313
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:10,970
Don't be late.

314
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,226
I don't know why
Jamie is being so difficult.

315
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,269
You should be glad.

316
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:22,606
He says you're pretty and likes you
as you are. How nice is that?

317
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,275
Jamie is so immature. What a baby.

318
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,405
A man should be broadminded,
understanding, and accepting.

319
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,615
How nice is that? He's a baby.

320
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,867
Se-wan. Be understanding.

321
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,369
I'm speechless.

322
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,872
Who would've known
we'd see this side of Sam in one season?

323
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,249
Exactly.

324
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,500
It's all thanks to me.

325
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,545
If he hadn't met me,
he'd still be the petty pissy pants.

326
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:48,298
Now, he'll be fine with any girl he meets.

327
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,592
Right. Thanks.

328
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,761
I've become a manly man thanks to you.

329
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,389
I love you, Minnie.

330
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,478
Anyway, it's so inconvenient
without Hyun-min.

331
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:05,691
He did all the cleaning, laundry,
and everything.

332
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:06,984
I have no clean clothes.

333
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:10,237
I know. Hyun-min always
sorted my recyclables for me.

334
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,074
It's such a pain doing it myself now.

335
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,660
I didn't realize it when he was here,

336
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,288
but he did a lot for us.

337
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,833
I wonder where he is and how he's doing.

338
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,209
Good morning.

339
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,056
When will you be home?

340
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:42,352
I have a group tutoring session
after I tutor Jun-yeong, so around nine.

341
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:46,148
Is there anything you want to eat?
I'm a really good cook.

342
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,860
Tteokbokki. I can have it every day
and not get sick of it.

343
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,195
With ramyeon noodles.

344
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,531
Okay. I'll wait for you
with tteokbokki waiting.

345
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,033
Come home quickly.

346
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,501
How did this happen to me?

347
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,503
Is this a dream?

348
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,332
MOM

349
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,042
Why is she calling again?

350
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,129
It's obvious.
She wants to make me work again.

351
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,510
Gosh. How annoying.

352
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,351
What's this?

353
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,479
My military draft letter?

354
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:11,233
What? I'm supposed to report for duty
the day after tomorrow.

355
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,152
Damn it.

356
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:17,656
Mom.

357
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,784
How could you tell me
something this important only now?

358
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,786
It says to report for duty in two days!

359
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,581
When did I ever ghost you?

360
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:30,085
Whatever. I'll stay in the army forever
and never see you again!

361
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,505
That figures.

362
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,841
I thought things were going
too well for me.

363
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,427
I finally met a pretty girl
who thinks I'm cute

364
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,722
and is super nice to me,
but I have to start military service.

365
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,975
This is too cruel!

366
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,810
You're getting a boob job? Are you--

367
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,315
Keep it down.

368
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,943
You only said
you were getting your eyes done.

369
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,987
What's the difference?

370
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,531
Might as well get them both done
while I'm under.

371
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,408
He says he'll do it all for free.

372
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,452
How are your eyes and breasts the same?

373
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,287
Wait.

374
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:09,041
Then did that guy look there too?
You took off your clothes--

375
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,125
Gosh!

376
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,628
That's enough. I'm embarrassed too.

377
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,631
And the nurse did everything.

378
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,550
Why would you do something embarrassing?
Just don't do it.

379
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:19,468
I'm baffled.

380
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,011
So am I.

381
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,930
It wasn't easy for me to decide.

382
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,098
I mean…

383
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,101
It was hard for me to decide.

384
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,271
So even if you don't like it,
can't you trust me and be understanding?

385
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,773
Would you if you were me?

386
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,566
Yes, totally.

387
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,568
-Really?
-Yes.

388
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,070
Fine, then. I'll go first then.

389
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,405
-What?
-I'll get plastic surgery first.

390
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,324
What are you talking about? Why?

391
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,452
I've had a complex about my looks
since I was young too.

392
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:49,248
I told you. I was teased
for looking different from my friends.

393
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,792
So what? You'll get plastic surgery too?

394
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:52,751
Yes.

395
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:56,797
It worries me that a clinic
that just opened will give you

396
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,216
major surgeries like that for free.

397
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,510
I'll see if it turns out
like the simulation,

398
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:05,055
if the surgery is safe, and if there are
any side effects. You get it after.

399
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,892
Jamie. Stop being unreasonable.

400
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,979
No, I'm not being unreasonable.
I gave it a lot of thought.

401
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:16,066
Be honest. It's not the plastic surgery.
You hate my tutor.

402
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,986
I told you. It's both.
The surgery and I don't trust him.

403
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,196
Fine. Do as you wish.

404
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,406
Redo your entire face.

405
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,323
Move.

406
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,830
How do I tell her
I have to go to the army?

407
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,583
We only just started dating,
so I can't ask her to wait.

408
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,171
Wow. It looks completely different now.

409
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,674
How are you so good at housework?

410
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,719
I did all the housework instead of my mom.

411
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,305
I see. I'm hungry.

412
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,016
I skipped dinner
so that I can have your tteokbokki.

413
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,064
What? The army?

414
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,983
Don't you have citizenship
from your father?

415
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,193
I told you. I was born
and raised in Korea.

416
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,737
I'm a Korean citizen.

417
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,572
I see.

418
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,115
When do you leave?

419
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,533
The day after tomorrow.

420
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:07,451
What?

421
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,411
What do I do?

422
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:10,871
I know.

423
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,417
Why would you get double eyelid surgery?

424
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,586
What if they mess up your pretty eyes?

425
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,004
That's why I'm going first.

426
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,256
If they mess up my face,
Se-wan won't get surgery.

427
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,009
Is your face a sample?
Why are you using it like that?

428
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:27,471
Then what? Let my girlfriend get surgery
from someone I don't trust?

429
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,598
I can't do that.

430
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,309
I'll prove with my face
that Se-wan doesn't need surgery.

431
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:35,562
Why are you being so unreasonable
and stubborn?

432
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:39,816
Your jealousy made you lose your mind.
Hey, I'm embarrassed for you.

433
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,027
Stop it, you petty pissy pants.

434
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,695
Was I that bad?

435
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:46,490
How embarrassing.

436
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,909
Confident manly man Sam.

437
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,286
Worry about your girlfriend.

438
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,955
Something may happen if you're too lax.

439
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,000
Minnie isn't back yet
after her consultation?

440
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,503
She'll come home when she's done.

441
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,547
She gave up the mighty Eoksour for me.

442
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,091
Why should I worry?

443
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,218
Thanks.

444
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:12,432
Right.
I'll get coffee since you got dinner.

445
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:15,477
Okay. I guess it really is winter now.

446
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,520
Hold on.

447
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,409
I'll order the coffee.

448
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,368
Okay.

449
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,339
Isn't that Se-wan's tutor?

450
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,301
What? That's Minnie.

451
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,096
Why is he driving her home?

452
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,516
Hey. What's going on there?

453
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,561
Hi, Terris. What's up?

454
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,062
I'm in front of the campus,

455
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:03,066
and Minnie came in Se-wan's tutor's car.
That plastic surgeon.

456
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,652
Oh, that? She went in for a consultation.

457
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:06,987
So, he gave her a ride.

458
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,699
No. They're hugging now.

459
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,909
You know Minnie's open about those things.

460
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,454
She's just hugging him goodbye.

461
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,997
No. What?

462
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,540
Hey. They're kissing now.

463
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,208
Gosh, stop being so lame.

464
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,087
It's a Western-style goodbye.

465
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,756
Hey. It's way too long
for a friendly goodbye kiss.

466
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,051
Minnie likes long goodbyes.

467
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,762
Sam. She's getting back into his car.

468
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,014
Something's not right.

469
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,891
Maybe she left something in the car.

470
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,143
They're going somewhere.

471
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:41,146
Maybe she left something at the clinic
and is going back for it.

472
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:44,357
Still, I'll pretend to be a little jealous
when she gets home

473
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,985
and scold her. My sweet Minnie.

474
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,454
Shave it all off please.

475
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:58,580
Hold on.

476
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,876
Your hair is very rough.
This won't be easy.

477
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,337
Hold on.

478
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,635
I've finished my assessment.

479
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:15,388
Your face is egg-shaped. It'll look best
if I start shaving at the center.

480
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,807
Okay. I'll start at the center.

481
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,685
-Are you starting military service?
-Yes.

482
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,188
I only found out
about the draft letter yesterday.

483
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,732
I have to report for duty tomorrow.

484
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,110
I couldn't even say bye to my friends.

485
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,281
You can delay the draft then.

486
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,409
Didn't you try that?

487
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:39,037
What? I can delay it? I can do that?

488
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,830
Yes, if you have a good reason.

489
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,001
Why didn't you tell me that sooner?

490
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:49,506
I'm sorry.

491
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:52,551
But you're good looking,
so it won't hinder your daily life.

492
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,010
I won't charge you though.

493
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,307
Yes!

494
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,770
I'm not going. I don't have to go.

495
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:06,022
It's not over for me yet!

496
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:14,114
Yu-jeong! I delayed my draft!
I don't have to go to the army!

497
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,369
Oh my gosh. Who…

498
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,249
Already?

499
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,167
Already?

500
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,262
-Who was it?
-I think he had the wrong unit.

501
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,764
Anyway, aren't you ever coming home?

502
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:43,101
Never. I got sick of hearing Mom
nagging me to clean.

503
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,102
Why would I go back?

504
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,395
Jeez.

505
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,690
But your place looks clean now.

506
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:49,983
Did you clean up?

507
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,110
I can't clean this good.

508
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:55,196
I was happy that I found a guy
who's good at housework,

509
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,657
but the country snatched him away.
Damn it.

510
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,714
That was close.

511
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,508
I knew the milk tasted funky this morning.

512
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:18,637
My gosh.

513
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,098
It's a Saturday,
so there's no one at the school.

514
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:26,061
Excuse me! Is anyone out there?

515
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,861
This is the simulation for my surgery.
It's good, right?

516
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:37,113
JAMIE

517
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:38,823
Did he really go?

518
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,293
Hey…

519
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:51,920
Jamie…

520
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:57,050
I can't focus with you looking at me
with your eyes wide open like that.

521
00:27:57,133 --> 00:28:00,011
The double eyelid surgery went wrong,
and I can't close my eyes.

522
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,054
They sting so much.

523
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:03,807
No.

524
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:08,019
The person you have dialed is unavailable…

525
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,729
Damn it, no one's picking up.

526
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:13,108
I'll write in the group chat room.

527
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,901
Someone will see it.

528
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:18,238
I'm in the third floor bathroom
in the management building.

529
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,073
There's no toilet paper. Help.

530
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:23,034
You're getting what you deserve, traitor.

531
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,537
Traitor. Use your sock.

532
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:30,250
I can't. My mom knitted me these socks.

533
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,545
Hey, traitor, use your underwear.

534
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:38,633
Never. I got these with my friends
when we graduated high school.

535
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,306
Are you sure you won't regret it?

536
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:47,392
Do you really want surgery?

537
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,604
Yes. Don't worry about me.
Show me what you can do.

538
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,649
What should we do? Should we really do it?

539
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,404
She should be arriving around now.

540
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,239
-Jamie.
-There she is.

541
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,950
No! You can't get surgery!
Let's go, Jamie!

542
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,160
No. I'm going to get it.

543
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,120
I won't get it either, so don't.

544
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:09,706
You have nothing to fix, so stop it.

545
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:10,623
Let's go.

546
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,251
I keep saying you're pretty,
but you want surgery.

547
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:17,046
That should be enough for me,
but I was greedy. Don't do it.

548
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,841
Sorry to interrupt your lovers' quarrel,

549
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,427
but a patient who really needs surgery
is waiting.

550
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,053
I'm sorry.

551
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:26,139
Sorry. Let's go.

552
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,725
Thank you.

553
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:29,934
How cute.

554
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,772
She got herself a good boyfriend.

555
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,732
Let's get out of here.

556
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,401
What is this? Look at your face.

557
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,612
But what about my complex?

558
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,989
I wanted to use this chance
to turn my life around.

559
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:46,159
Forget it.
You can't get even better looking.

560
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,162
You're pretty enough in my eyes.

561
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,163
Let's go.

562
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:54,709
Excuse me. So you decided
not to get surgery, right?

563
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,211
You made the right decision.

564
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:59,672
I know. You shouldn't mess with
such a handsome face.

565
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:02,342
You could be our model as you are.

566
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:05,929
-She's right. May I have your number?
-Me too.

567
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,972
He doesn't own a cell phone.

568
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,600
You can call me if you need to reach him.

569
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:13,269
I am his manager.

570
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:18,525
His modeling rate is high
because he's extremely busy.

571
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:36,876
I did borrow your underwear once,
but it was too old, so I threw it away.

572
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,128
That's why I bought you new ones
a few days ago.

573
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,929
Dear Hans. Sorry for everything.

574
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,307
I promise I'll repay you someday. Thanks.

575
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:05,738
Hyun-min…

576
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:07,991
Fine.

577
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,325
I have no other choice.

578
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,244
Let's go home to Jirisan.

579
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,497
I'll help Mom and find a way.

580
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,917
Do I have enough for the bus fare?

581
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,631
Wait. When did I get this?

582
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,051
The result must be out.

583
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,804
Wait. You never know.

584
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,848
Life is full of ups and downs.

585
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:34,017
Who knows? I may have hit the jackpot.

586
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,268
Let's see.

587
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,731
LOTTO WINNING NUMBERS

588
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,232
What?

589
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,067
What?

590
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,577
LOTTO WINNING NUMBERS

591
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,246
I won first place.

592
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,374
Wait. How much is it?

593
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,126
It's 4.7 billion won?

594
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,802
This is why my life has been this way.

595
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,138
It's all over now.

596
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,682
I'm starting a new life now!

597
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:47,799
Yes!

598
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,335
