1
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,511
SE-WAN

2
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,476
The person you have reached
cannot answer the call right now.

3
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,276
What's going on?

4
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,785
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

5
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,787
What's going on? Did something happen?

6
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,789
Wait. Aren't you…

7
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,290
It's her.

8
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,959
Aren't you the girl in the picture
with Jamie Houston?

9
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:26,920
-It is her.
-Is it?

10
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,881
-Are you his girlfriend?
-What's your name and major?

11
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,716
-How long have you dated?
-Does Barbara know about this?

12
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,427
-Please give us a comment!
-Please, give us your name.

13
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,678
Please say a few words!

14
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,721
Give us a comment.

15
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:40,600
Jamie Houston. You're trending right now.

16
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,519
Jamie. It's such an honor.

17
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,604
I can't believe
I'm with a world star's son.

18
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,064
Can someone call Se-wan?

19
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:46,981
She won't pick up.

20
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,609
Her battery probably died again.
It's obvious.

21
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,111
Do you want to make a bet?

22
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,403
-For 10,000 won?
-I'm in.

23
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,656
But you've been in Korea for a while now.

24
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,366
Why did this just get out now?

25
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,785
I don't know.
My mom's people are looking into it.

26
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,496
Right? Whatever the reason was,

27
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,249
if we didn't know when we lived with him,

28
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,918
they must've worked hard
to keep it a secret.

29
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,044
Why did it get out now?

30
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,421
According to the news, this morning,

31
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,550
an American entertainment news agency
broke the news.

32
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,385
It spread right away in the US,

33
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,470
and Korean news agencies
are covering it now.

34
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,597
Who took that picture?

35
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,433
A paparazzi who has been following Jamie

36
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,436
learned he was in Korea, and followed him.

37
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,189
That's what the article says.
Read the news, will you?

38
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,942
The paparazzi are incredible.

39
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,902
We didn't know, and we live with him.

40
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,991
Our school became famous globally
thanks to Jamie.

41
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:41,035
We're on the news in the US and Korea,
and we're trending online.

42
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,495
Talk about publicity.

43
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:46,249
No wonder he was so quiet
about his personal life.

44
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,126
He's from a world-class rich family.

45
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,129
I called dibs on him as soon as I saw him.

46
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,173
Se-wan, that sly witch.

47
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,550
She acted all naive. I misjudged her.

48
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,970
Se-wan! There you are. Are you okay?

49
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,138
No, I'm not.

50
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,265
What's going on?

51
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,726
This is you, isn't it?
What the heck? Spill it.

52
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,227
How and when did you meet up?

53
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,271
You must've met all of Hollywood's stars.

54
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,939
Have you met Robert Downey Jr.?

55
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,108
What about Beyoncé or Lady Gaga?

56
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,235
Stop asking stupid questions.

57
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,071
I'm sure our Jamie already has
a lot on his mind.

58
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,157
"Our Jamie"?
Since when were you that close?

59
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,950
Who am I? I'm Jamie's roommate.

60
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,244
I'm officially the person he lives with.

61
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,913
Why did they pair him up with me?

62
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,289
There must've been a reason.

63
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,877
They wanted the world-class students
to live together.

64
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,754
Who is it?

65
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,800
She's finally here.
Here comes today's main star.

66
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,720
Jamie Houston! It's me. Hi.

67
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,723
Are you okay?
Why didn't you answer your phone?

68
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,267
My phone battery died.

69
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,353
See? What did I say?
I said her battery died.

70
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,771
Pay up. It's 10,000 won.

71
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:52,565
Finally, the male and female protagonists
are reunited.

72
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,276
I can't believe I get to witness
this historical moment live.

73
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:56,903
Jamie. Se-wan.

74
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,739
Can we take a group picture
to commemorate this moment?

75
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,241
This isn't the time.

76
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,701
The dorm is swamped
with reporters looking for them.

77
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:04,702
I know that.

78
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,455
I just wanted to keep it as a souvenir.

79
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,499
There are too many eyes in the dorm.

80
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,917
Rumors will spread.

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,960
We should be careful.

82
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,169
You're right.

83
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,171
I got it. One question!

84
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,090
Are you really going out?

85
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,175
-That's right.
-I wanted to ask that too.

86
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,176
Are you?

87
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,388
Hey! Whether or not
they're going out doesn't matter.

88
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,181
Hey, big news. It's huge.

89
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:29,686
You know that Hollywood actress Houston?

90
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,312
I hear her son lives here!

91
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,106
That's him.

92
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,609
What? Really? Jamie? I see.

93
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:40,989
Then those sneakers that you gave me
really were legendary.

94
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:44,409
I'm getting pissed off again.
Se-wan, you little…

95
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:49,372
Also, I hear the girl he's going out with
also lives here in the dorm.

96
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,581
That's her.

97
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,751
Are you messing with me?

98
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,254
Stop joking. Tell me. Who is she?

99
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,091
It's really her? This selfish brat?

100
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:03,428
We don't know if they're going out,
but it is her in the photo.

101
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,345
But why?

102
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,181
There are so many nice,
pretty girls in Korea. Why her?

103
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,641
Do you want to die?

104
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,727
Watch your mouths, all of you.

105
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,937
Don't say anything stupid, okay?

106
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,982
And you two.
People may get the wrong idea,

107
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,817
so you shouldn't stick so close.

108
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,154
The reporters don't seem to know
that Jamie is here yet

109
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,072
or that the girl is Se-wan,

110
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,574
so be careful, all of you.

111
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,826
They can't tell it's her
from that picture.

112
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,245
That's not true. I could tell at a glance.

113
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:33,207
We can tell because we know her.
But others won't be able to tell.

114
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,001
It's blowing up online already.

115
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,295
People online are investigating already.

116
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,547
They'll find out it's her in no time.

117
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,342
You're right.
People can be really scary online.

118
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,052
The comments are insane already.

119
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:48,264
I know this isn't the time or place,
but I'm starving because I skipped lunch.

120
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,266
You all have to eat dinner too.

121
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,517
Let's order something.

122
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,270
I got ten stamps for
the Chinese restaurant out front.

123
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,272
I can get a large tangsuyuk for free.

124
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:02,570
The entire world is focused on our dorm
because of a mega huge scandal,

125
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,781
and you want to order jjajangmyeon?

126
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,908
I'm craving jjajangmyeon.
Large gan-jjajang, please.

127
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,035
-Yusanseul with rice.
-Seafood jjamppong and fried dumplings.

128
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,453
Get the same thing!

129
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,747
Who wants jjajang over jjamppong?

130
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:14,916
Jjamppong?

131
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,502
Jamie, what do you want?

132
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,962
Yes, Mr. World Star. Jjajang or jjamppong?

133
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,714
It's on you. To commemorate the day.

134
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:22,757
I have no money.

135
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,967
What the heck?
You have a huge inheritance.

136
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,511
I get that after my mom dies.

137
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,179
What a Tallulah moment.

138
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,430
You don't need to pay.

139
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,600
Hans. You order. Call me when it's here.

140
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,687
Sorry, but could you excuse us?
I'd like to talk to Se-wan.

141
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,064
Of course. Sure.

142
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,191
Get up. Now. Get out.

143
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,193
Get out.

144
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,447
This is my room!

145
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,365
They want to talk.

146
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:50,535
Why aren't you leaving?
This isn't your room.

147
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,578
In case they come back.

148
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,663
I'll guard the door.

149
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,206
I'll be your bodyguard.

150
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,457
Sorry, but please leave.

151
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,458
Okay.

152
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,672
I wanted to tell you
when the time was right.

153
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:03,840
What happened?

154
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,843
What do we do now?

155
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,344
What the heck?

156
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,763
I don't know either.

157
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,557
I found out when Mom called earlier.

158
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,476
She's talking to the school
and looking into it,

159
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,602
so she said to wait.

160
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,604
Where did those pictures come from?

161
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,025
Was someone watching us all this time?

162
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,736
Se-wan. Sorry to interrupt,

163
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,447
but you need to see this.

164
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,614
What is it?

165
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,409
"Isn't this Park Se-wan?

166
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:34,203
She was slumming because her family
went bankrupt. Jackpot."

167
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:35,830
Here it comes.

168
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,249
Se-wan's name came out.

169
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,584
They're doxing her now.

170
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,503
I told you they'd find her in no time.
Give me 10,000 won.

171
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,714
Damn it. I just got chills.

172
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,341
People online are so scary.

173
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,177
"A gold digger"?

174
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,970
"Con-artist family.

175
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:54,390
Dad's in jail. Mom's a debtor."

176
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,641
They know everything.

177
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,396
What the hell? Look at these comments.

178
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,732
People are so mean.

179
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,734
How could they say this without proof?

180
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,235
I know.

181
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,279
These haters are having a field day.

182
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,573
Oh my gosh.

183
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,868
Hey, they even have a picture.

184
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,912
Hey.

185
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,371
These jerks.

186
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,415
Why did they use such a bad picture?

187
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,084
Give me a pretty picture of yours.

188
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,962
I'll edit it to make you look pretty
and upload it.

189
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,215
Hey! What are you talking about?

190
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,633
Read the room, will you?

191
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:31,677
What? It's everywhere already anyway.

192
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:36,349
It will be better if she looks good
while her pictures are being circulated.

193
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,392
Poor Se-wan. You must be so upset.

194
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:43,648
Her family went bankrupt and is dirt poor.
If she isn't a gold-digger, what is she?

195
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,483
She's obviously not good enough.

196
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,527
-Why the hell is Jamie dating her?
-I'm speechless.

197
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,819
Her family was going bankrupt.

198
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,531
-She's hit the jackpot.
-You should avoid gold diggers like her.

199
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,242
It's just a photograph.
Why are they so worked up?

200
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,493
What's wrong with them?

201
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,745
They're jealous, that's why.

202
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,289
I wouldn't care as much
if she was a celebrity,

203
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,083
but Se-wan isn't.

204
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,501
She's a regular person.

205
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:06,462
Jamie's mom is an international celebrity,

206
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,548
so he's famous by association.

207
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:13,261
That was to be expected somewhat
if you're going to date a celebrity.

208
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,971
Don't be ridiculous.

209
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,890
It's because of this unreasonable
and irrational attitude

210
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,601
that these ridiculous things happen.

211
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,436
We can't forgive them.

212
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,439
We'll gather evidence and report them
to the Cyber Bureau.

213
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,857
They should all be locked up.

214
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:30,611
We shouldn't be lenient
against malicious people like them.

215
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,198
We need to follow the rules
and punish them.

216
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,704
Se-wan isn't eating.

217
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,038
Neither is Jamie.

218
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,791
See? I told you they wouldn't eat. Pay up.

219
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,710
Damn it.

220
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,920
How could they eat in this situation?

221
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,672
How could you do that?

222
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,174
Who reads something that small?

223
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,678
This is a scam. I'll report you
to the Consumer Protection Agency.

224
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,763
What's wrong with him this time?

225
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,974
The coupon expired
so they won't give him the free food.

226
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,642
They took the tangsuyuk back.

227
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,894
You don't care if I report you?

228
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,146
I mean…

229
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,356
How could they be so ridiculous?

230
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,650
It says so right here

231
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,611
that you must use it within six months.

232
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,737
It expired a while ago.

233
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,114
That's not right. They shouldn't expire.

234
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,366
I got this for being a frequent customer.

235
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,076
It shouldn't matter when I use this.

236
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,244
I won't forgive them.

237
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,537
What will you do?

238
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,748
Just wait and see.

239
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,584
Let's see what they do
if I make them lose business.

240
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,086
Hey, look at this.

241
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:34,133
Someone created an SNS page,
"National Gold Digger Park Se-wan."

242
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,177
This is getting out of hand.

243
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,180
What's more ridiculous is
they even made a fan page for Jamie.

244
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,307
"Welcome, Korea's son Jamie."

245
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,601
As if.

246
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:47,396
She's the nation's gold digger
and he's the nation's son? Dagnabbit.

247
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,608
You're so immature. What is this?

248
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,986
"It tastes terrible.
It's dirty and gross."

249
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,780
"They're very unfriendly and rude."

250
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,949
Is there something better?
I mean, something worse?

251
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,118
There is. This will be a lethal blow.

252
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,496
"I found half a roach in my soup."

253
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:04,830
That's good.

254
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,123
Those are lies.

255
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,209
Saying that without proof
is cyberbullying.

256
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,418
I know.

257
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,962
It's not their fault.
You're the one who messed up.

258
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,130
Whatever.

259
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,883
I have to show them
the power of the consumer.

260
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,470
Hey. Are you going out?

261
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:23,224
Are you mad? You can't go out.
There are reporters everywhere.

262
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,725
What can I do?

263
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:28,020
If I skip class, it'll hurt my grades
and cost me my scholarship.

264
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:33,567
If I don't go to work,
I can't pay my bills. I have to go.

265
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,903
Still, I don't think you should go.

266
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,363
What are you going to do?

267
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,949
Hey. I thought of a good idea
to evade the reporters.

268
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:48,332
We must lure the reporters to 11 o'clock
for you to get to the lecture hall.

269
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,504
Okay. You run first on the count of three.

270
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,548
One.

271
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,507
Two.

272
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,967
Three!

273
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,054
Hey, Se-wan! Where are you going?

274
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,556
-It's Park Se-wan!
-Ms. Park Se-wan!

275
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,725
-Ms. Park Se-wan!
-Ms. Park Se-wan!

276
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,017
Take her picture!

277
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,270
-Ms. Park Se-wan!
-Ms. Park!

278
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,897
-Please wait! Ms. Park!
-Ms. Park Se-wan! Please stop!

279
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,357
Look over here!

280
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,151
-Ms. Park Se-wan!
-Just a minute!

281
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,736
-Ms. Park! Just a minute!
-Please wait!

282
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:17,862
Ms. Park Se-wan!

283
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,823
Hello! I'm Minnie!
Hello. I’m Nicha Yontararak.

284
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,033
Make me look pretty.

285
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,703
Where are you going? Make me look pretty.

286
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,855
Dagnabbit.

287
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,913
She's dating Jamie. She's so annoying.

288
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,706
What a disgrace to the school.

289
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,167
-She's a disgrace to the country.
-Why her?

290
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,668
Exactly. Why did she come?

291
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,629
I know. How shameless can she be?

292
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,714
How could she show her face?

293
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,219
She probably seduced him
with her pretty face.

294
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,345
Lucky her.

295
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,471
PROFESSOR

296
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,056
I did it?

297
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,392
It wasn't me, professor.

298
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,312
I told you to forget what you saw,
didn't I?

299
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,147
This is what I was afraid of.

300
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,650
Who would I tell?

301
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,570
I didn't say a peep to anyone.

302
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:45,324
Given the situation,
that's what anyone would think.

303
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:48,202
The things they're saying online
are not completely unfounded.

304
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,204
A debt collector came to the school.

305
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,872
Your family is not normal.

306
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:55,334
Why don't you believe anything I say,
but believe them?

307
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:59,088
Regardless, the school was hurt by this.
Someone must take responsibility.

308
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,049
I'm asking just in case.

309
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:08,013
You didn't sell Jamie's information
to the paparazzi, did you?

310
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:12,059
Professor. How could you even say that?

311
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:17,022
If you did, you'd be expelled
and be held liable in court.

312
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,108
Do you know how damaging it is
for our reputation

313
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,985
to say we leaked private information?

314
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,736
We'll find out once we investigate.

315
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,948
I'm giving you a chance
before things get any bigger.

316
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,783
Do what's right.

317
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,618
You want me to take responsibility?

318
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,496
What did I do wrong?

319
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,707
If it's proven that you did nothing wrong,

320
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,794
you can return to the school later
when things quiet down.

321
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,799
I'm very sorry.

322
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:48,888
We're working with your mother
on how to handle this, so don't worry.

323
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,931
How did it suddenly get out?

324
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:55,436
I'm sure it's her, but she denies it.

325
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,645
Who?

326
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,646
Who else?

327
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,440
Se-wan, who was photographed with you.

328
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:03,527
How else would the paparazzi get a picture
of the two of you together?

329
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,238
Se-wan knew about me?

330
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,199
She found out by chance
while helping me a few days ago.

331
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:13,120
She's my TA, so she's always with me.

332
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:16,415
No matter how careful I was,
it was inevitable.

333
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:21,045
That's why I warned her
to keep it a secret at all costs--

334
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,755
I doubt it was her.

335
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:26,091
You can never know
what someone else is thinking.

336
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,344
She and I were the only ones in Korea

337
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,347
who knew that you were at our school.

338
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,599
Who else could've leaked it? Me?

339
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,434
There's no proof it wasn't you either.

340
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,103
It wasn't me.

341
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,481
It was definitely not me.

342
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,442
-This was obviously--
-Please don't speak recklessly

343
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,110
until the truth is revealed.

344
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,321
Okay.

345
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,536
People are so mean.

346
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,872
How could they accuse Se-wan?

347
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,668
She's about to get
kicked out of the dorm tonight.

348
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,753
They're terrible.

349
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:06,799
She's been doxed, kicked around online,
and now she's being kicked out?

350
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,176
Exactly. This is wrong.

351
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,178
Se-wan is the biggest victim.

352
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,305
The school should protect her.

353
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:14,807
What are you up to?

354
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,725
Are you still posting nasty comments
about the restaurant?

355
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,395
There's no response. They're ignoring me.

356
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,021
Let's see who wins.

357
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,065
He's causing trouble again, isn't he?

358
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,942
Stop him.

359
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:28,195
That ass acts like he's the only one
who's intellectual and rational,

360
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,072
but he never listens to others.

361
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,116
He needs to learn a lesson. Let him be.

362
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,051
Hey, what's up?

363
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,137
LAUNDRY ROOM

364
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,389
What are you doing? Get out.

365
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,099
I have to clean and go home.

366
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,142
Out of my way!

367
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:01,145
Sorry, but your cooperation is requested
for national security.

368
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,731
I have to do my laundry.
I have no clothes.

369
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:06,150
Who are you to stop us? Move. Dagnabbit!

370
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,277
Drop this act and get out!

371
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,403
Dagnabbit.

372
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,032
So this is how you say it.

373
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,075
You say it so well.

374
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,744
Really?

375
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,830
-Dagnabbit.
-Dagnabbit.

376
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,542
Why should you have to move out?

377
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,085
I'll talk to the professor--

378
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,712
I agreed to leave.

379
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,549
I think everything will be fine
if I leave.

380
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:31,884
What do you mean?

381
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,802
I don't want to stay here anymore.

382
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,971
Se-wan.

383
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:40,350
Did you know about me already?

384
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:43,812
Yes.

385
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,230
I see.

386
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,691
Why didn't you tell me?

387
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,903
Why didn't I say something first?

388
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,738
Was I supposed to ask?

389
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,114
That's not what I meant.

390
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,700
Did you think I told the reporters
just like the professor?

391
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,951
Se-wan.

392
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,580
It's expected of someone like me.

393
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,500
I'm a con-artist's daughter.

394
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,961
I'm always strapped for cash.
What couldn't I do?

395
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,464
Se-wan, that's ridiculous. Why--

396
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,840
It's always been like this.

397
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,467
When my family was doing well,

398
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:17,262
they said I bought my grades
even if I studied hard.

399
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,723
Now that I'm poor,
no one believes a thing I say.

400
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:23,519
I was scared from the moment
I found out who you were.

401
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,687
It wasn't because you were great.

402
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,273
It was because in case this would happen.

403
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:32,653
I tried so hard…

404
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:37,699
not to get caught. I hid and fled.

405
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,452
Se-wan. I understand how you feel.

406
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,039
What do you understand?

407
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,209
Because I fled here too.

408
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,419
All my life,

409
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,339
I was always in the center of attention.

410
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,466
They didn't care who I was,

411
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,386
just whose son I was.

412
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:01,056
Everyone had an ulterior motive
when they approached me.

413
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,809
I hated it and it was too hard to endure.

414
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,146
I wanted to hide among people
who looked like me

415
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,730
and live my life as myself,

416
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,233
and not as my mom's son.

417
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,944
That's why I fled here.

418
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,280
But you can never escape from it.

419
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,282
No matter how much you flee,

420
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,325
you can't escape
from being your mom's son.

421
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,619
People will find you somehow.

422
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,579
See?

423
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,331
You got caught. Even me.

424
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,294
Sorry. It's my fault.

425
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,628
It's not your fault.

426
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:33,630
It's my fault.

427
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,802
I should've let you go home alone
that night.

428
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,888
Then we wouldn't have been photographed.

429
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:42,848
I was stupid.

430
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,476
I was punished for lying to myself.

431
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,731
Regardless, I don't think it's right
for you to take the fall.

432
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,107
I'll find a way.

433
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,650
I have to pack.

434
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,535
It happened because of me,

435
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,038
but Se-wan is the one
taking all the blame.

436
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,040
I can't just let this happen.

437
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,875
Then what will you do?

438
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,126
I'll explain everything.

439
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,045
I'll tell the reporters the truth.

440
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,172
That I liked her first, we're going out,

441
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,174
and Se-wan had nothing to do with it.

442
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,258
See? I was right.

443
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,426
Pay up.

444
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,095
How could you make bets about this?

445
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,055
You're terrible.

446
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,724
It's the first time I won. What about him?

447
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,936
Jamie, do you think that will end
the witch hunt on Se-wan?

448
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,313
Even if you tell the truth,
they won't listen.

449
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,232
When celebrities are wrapped up
in scandals,

450
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:37,152
their agencies always do the same thing.
That may be the answer.

451
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,238
-What?
-To quickly--

452
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,406
Deny and stall.

453
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,575
If you stay silent,

454
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,702
they'll keep speculating,
and it'll get worse.

455
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,538
Look at Hans. There's your answer.
Silence--

456
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,666
Silence pisses them off even more.

457
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,542
They're picking on Se-wan

458
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,670
because you've kept quiet all this time.

459
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,339
It's best to come out and deny it.

460
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,132
The truth isn't always the answer.

461
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,176
Tell them there's nothing between us?

462
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,220
No, I can't do that.

463
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:06,306
If you say you two are going out--

464
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,268
You'd be admitting
that Se-wan is a gold digger.

465
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,103
It's best to avoid the storm.

466
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:14,523
When time passes and something else
blows up, their attention will shift.

467
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,817
So, for example--

468
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,236
If you say you're dating Hans,

469
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,696
that you don't like girls,

470
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,572
no one will talk about Se-wan then.

471
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,908
No. I want to tell the truth.

472
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,660
No. The professor--

473
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,036
Let me talk, will you?

474
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,080
You've been doing all the talking,
asshole.

475
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,249
The professor and your mom said
to sit still.

476
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,542
Shouldn't you ask them?

477
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:40,215
The reporters will be all over you.
What are you thinking?

478
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,050
I'll have to get through somehow.

479
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,720
Se-wan. Why don't you just ride it out?

480
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,597
You didn't do it.
They'll realize eventually--

481
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:48,557
Forget it.

482
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:53,103
I'm so disgusted
that I don't even want to talk about it.

483
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,771
I'll just feel worse.

484
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:56,565
Hey.

485
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,318
Get in.

486
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:01,778
What is this?

487
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,989
What else? It's like a lifeboat.

488
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,824
We'll put you in it and carry you out.

489
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:08,035
She can't fit in there.

490
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,661
I tested it out.

491
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:14,082
Se-wan may be slightly fatter than I am,
but she'll fit.

492
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:45,989
Why is she so heavy?
Did she stress eat or something?

493
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,783
Quiet. We're almost at the door.

494
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,169
It's Jamie!

495
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,213
Jamie?

496
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:03,632
It really is him.

497
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,927
Hello, I'm Jamie Houston.

498
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,929
I'm in Korea right now.

499
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,098
I started this semester.

500
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,600
I live here
in the international students' dorm.

501
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,227
Why did you come secretly?

502
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,145
Is there a special reason?

503
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,939
It's nothing like that.

504
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:22,317
I just wanted to study
as an ordinary student.

505
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,820
I could have been a distraction
for the other students.

506
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,030
What's your relationship with the girl?

507
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,490
Well…

508
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,951
Are you going out?
She's your girlfriend, right?

509
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,912
Or is she just a friend?

510
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,498
No, she isn't a friend.

511
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,792
I'm dating her.

512
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,794
She is his girlfriend.

513
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,504
It's true.

514
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,506
I like her.

515
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:45,590
I liked her first,

516
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,385
and she's suffering way too much right now
because of me.

517
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:49,761
Wait! Hold on!

518
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,805
Open up. Let me out.

519
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,348
Open up.

520
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,641
-What is it?
-Someone's talking.

521
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:55,559
What is that?

522
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,311
No! That's not true!

523
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,604
It's not true.

524
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,898
I'm the one in the picture with him.

525
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,484
I was helping him as an RA
because he's an international student.

526
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,903
There's nothing between us.
We're not going out.

527
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,989
That's not true. I like her. I--

528
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,282
He doesn't mean it.

529
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,325
It's true. Look at this!

530
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:14,619
I belong to her. I belong to Park Se-wan!

531
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,247
-I belong to Park Se-wan!
-Have you gone mad?

532
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,999
Why can't you say that I'm yours?

533
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:22,210
Why can't you say that I'm yours,
that I belong to Park Se-wan?

534
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:31,261
The university says
they'll give an official statement.

535
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:34,639
They'll hold a press conference
in front of the office in ten minutes.

536
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,765
We should go there.

537
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,810
-We should hurry then.
-Let's go.

538
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:43,315
This is what we just received
from Barbara Houston in the US.

539
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:46,067
Barbara Houston's personal account
was hacked last week,

540
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:50,697
and personal photos and documents
were leaked.

541
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,536
The paparazzi who obtained these documents
found out that Jamie Houston was in Korea

542
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,623
and followed him to Korea.

543
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,807
I would like to sincerely ask all of you,

544
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:24,064
as a mother, to help my son
to live an ordinary, peaceful life.

545
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:28,652
And my gratitude to Jamie's girlfriend,
Park Se-wan,

546
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:32,739
and all the other friends
who have helped him so much. Thank you.

547
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,621
Jamie. Is that really your mom?

548
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,206
Yes, she is.

549
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:44,084
That's odd.
She's different from what I remember.

550
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:48,463
I was so touched when I saw
your mom's movie when I was young.

551
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:54,135
And I will always love you

552
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,428
That's not my mom.

553
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:56,680
It's not?

554
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,181
My mom is Barbara Houston.

555
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,267
Barbara Houston? Who's that?

556
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,394
I don't know her.

557
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,104
You don't know my mom?

558
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,689
She was in Unforgiven Woman.

559
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:08,149
It won an award
at the Berlin Film Festival.

560
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,194
The Critics Association
named her Actress of the Year

561
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:14,948
for her role as a villain
in Kingsmen and Women in 2010.

562
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,700
You really don't know her?

563
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,326
I've never heard of her.

564
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,619
Hold on.

565
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:23,790
Hi, Mom.

566
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,001
That's not his mom.

567
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,212
The one that sings "And I"
is a different Houston.

568
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:33,425
What? You put her autograph on presale?

569
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,260
Why would you do that?

570
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:36,720
Whatever!

571
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,015
Mom loves the Houston that sings…

572
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,683
And I

573
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,852
She's a huge fan of that Houston.

574
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,645
She asked me for an autograph.

575
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,188
I'll get you my mom's.

576
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,773
It's okay. Forget it.

577
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,318
Right. Jamie, Se-wan.
What's up with you two?

578
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,694
What were you doing earlier?

579
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:56,114
As someone who was there,
I don't want to think about it again.

580
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,699
It was horrible.

581
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,993
Just thinking about it
makes me want to barf.

582
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:02,704
-"I'm yours. Why can't you say I'm yours?"
-Come on.

583
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,581
-"Why can't you say I belong to you?"
-"I belong to you?"

584
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:05,665
Stop it!

585
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,334
Admit it. Are you going out?

586
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,252
Seriously! We are not!

587
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,254
You know I never date, right?

588
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,506
-No. We're not.
-Yes, we are going out.

589
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,884
-We're going out.
-We are not! No!

590
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,260
Keep it down!

591
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:19,971
I'm sorry.

592
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,599
It was just a prank. Please forgive me.

593
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:28,396
You don't forgive or give leniency
to cyberbullies?

594
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,525
I need to report to the Cyber Bureau
for questioning?

595
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,903
Please forgive me just this once.

596
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,529
I don't want to go to jail.

597
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,455
It's good that you caught him.

598
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:48,249
-Thank you for your cooperation.
-Sure. And thank you.

599
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,385
Hello, sir.

600
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,138
A student was arrested
for smuggling drugs.

601
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,433
Yes. Don't worry.

602
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,686
We made sure no one on the outside
found out.

603
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:11,731
Luckily, everyone was distracted
by Jamie Houston,

604
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,109
so it'll probably be quiet.

605
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,611
It's a big relief.

606
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,561
