1
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:34,743
Here's your coffee.

2
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,953
Thank you. Enjoy.

3
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,207
No way!

4
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,793
There's a reason why
Master Doorknob is so famous.

5
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,795
He knows everything
before you grab the doorknob.

6
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,714
Is he that good?

7
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:50,592
Yes. As soon as I walked in, he said,

8
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:55,138
"You have a rice cake in each hand,
but you can't eat either."

9
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,848
I totally got chills.

10
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,975
What? Are you seeing two guys?

11
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,603
Think, will you?
She needs to meet a guy first.

12
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:03,354
All she does is hit on them.

13
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,898
What about you?

14
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,941
You say you're bored of meeting new guys.

15
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,736
Gosh. I went, hoping he'd tell me
something good,

16
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,572
but do you know
what that fortune teller said?

17
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,118
My stomach hurts.

18
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,371
-You have an upset stomach.
-What?

19
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,499
An upset stomach? I do not.

20
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,125
Yes, you do.

21
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:27,045
You eat only instant foods
and eat out all the time.

22
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,213
Of course, you're sick.

23
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,339
What? But…

24
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:32,592
What should I do?

25
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,969
Eat at home! Don't eat out, eat at home.

26
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,846
-Eat at home?
-You have food at home!

27
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,307
What's the point if you don't eat them?

28
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,851
If you don't, they'll all spoil.

29
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,687
You have an upset stomach.

30
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,315
Does he mean she should stop dieting?

31
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:48,733
That's stupid.

32
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,610
He means don't look far for a guy.

33
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,029
Look among the guys close by.

34
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,364
Oh my gosh. You're right.

35
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,242
It means someone you're close to
is the one for you.

36
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:00,662
I'm surrounded by garbage though.

37
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,872
What do you mean? There's Jamie.

38
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,791
I don't go after my friends' boyfriends.

39
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,544
Then is he really going out with Se-wan?

40
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,670
I don't know.

41
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:11,214
One says they are,
and the other says they're not.

42
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,633
Whatever it is, they're always together.

43
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:14,968
Really?

44
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:15,969
Then…

45
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,304
Terris is a player, so he's out.

46
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,098
Hans is…

47
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:21,975
No.

48
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,935
Wait. What about Sam?

49
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,770
Hey, don't be ridiculous.

50
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,188
I'm not that desperate.

51
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,524
I'd rather grow old alone.

52
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,693
Just thinking about it is annoying!

53
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,653
You're just clueless.

54
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:37,365
Guys like Sam tend to be
surprisingly good in bed.

55
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,783
There you go again.

56
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,870
You've never dated anyone,
but you're the horniest.

57
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,496
What's Sam's deal?

58
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:44,664
Isn't he Korean?

59
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:49,294
And he always says his dad is the chairman
of a large company. Is that true?

60
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,421
He went to study in Australia
when he was a kid.

61
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,548
His parents followed after
for their business.

62
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:57,093
His dad opened a tteokbokki place
and it seems to do well.

63
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,595
Hey, then he's a good catch.

64
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,181
Hey. As I always say,

65
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,473
when it comes to guys,

66
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:06,394
their looks and money are not important.

67
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,729
It's all about…

68
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,316
strong thighs. Got that?

69
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:15,153
Sam has chicken legs.
He has no muscle at all.

70
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:18,031
But he has a big nose.

71
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:21,993
All you ever talk about are lewd things.
You naughty girls.

72
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:24,454
I meant he's good looking
because of his big nose.

73
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,164
How is that lewd?

74
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,081
Hey.

75
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,417
What were you imagining?

76
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,003
You're the lewdest
when you think about it.

77
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:35,048
She's right. You have
so much porn on your computer.

78
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,176
That's not porn!

79
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,802
Whatever. Dagnabbit.

80
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,267
-Did you wait for me?
-Yes.

81
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,686
You didn't have to.

82
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,731
We're going to work together anyway.
You didn't eat, right?

83
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,234
Ta-da.

84
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,069
You made this yourself?

85
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,279
Why waste money? It's more economical.

86
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,739
Who taught you how to make it?

87
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,783
Ms. Jung. The cleaning lady.

88
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,244
-The lady with the nasty temper?
-Yes.

89
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,329
I guess she's nice to you.

90
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:10,416
Yes. But she asked for a 1,000-won fee.
She said she learned that from you.

91
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,419
What? What's wrong with her?

92
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,712
Eat. Open up.

93
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,675
It tastes good.

94
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,637
My shoulder's all tight.

95
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,555
I'm sure. You work so many jobs.

96
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,724
-I'll give you a massage.
-It's okay.

97
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,685
You eat. I'll massage you.

98
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,561
I'm really okay.

99
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,397
-Okay?
-That tickles.

100
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,816
That tickles.

101
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:40,488
Stop it! It's annoying!
Master Doorknob, my foot.

102
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:43,908
To be honest, I always thought
you and Sam looked good together.

103
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,493
I know you don't want to hear it.

104
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:48,162
I bet Sam doesn't want to hear it either.

105
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,207
Look. It's a compatibility test
based on your blood type.

106
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,835
You and Sam are a 90 percent match.

107
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,631
"A woman with blood type O may appear
to be cheerful and tough on the outside,

108
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,843
but she's actually lonely
and is very sensitive.

109
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,928
She wants a man
who is stronger than she is."

110
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,139
See? That's you.

111
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:09,350
"A man with blood type A
is rational and honest,

112
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:12,729
so that the woman wants to trust
and rely on…"?

113
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,689
Rational and honest?

114
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:18,526
-That's the opposite of Sam.
-My point exactly. This is stupid.

115
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,946
This ridiculous concept that you can

116
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,659
categorize people's personalities
based on just four blood types

117
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,162
is pseudoscience that only exists
in Korea and Japan--

118
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,913
Be quiet.

119
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,083
Minnie! Press this.

120
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:41,299
Gross! That smells like garbage!
He's so annoying. I can't stand him.

121
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,467
Minnie, my bad.

122
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,968
That asshole just will not do.

123
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,678
Dagnabbit.

124
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,598
Terris?

125
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,059
Is there a Terris here?

126
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,101
Yes, that's me.

127
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,770
Your little sister's here.

128
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,146
My little sister?

129
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,508
Hi, Terris.

130
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,886
What the hell? Why are you here?

131
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,679
What? Do you know her?

132
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:32,183
Hi, everyone. I'm Hyun-min's sister,
Han Hyun-a.

133
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,267
What?

134
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,019
For real?

135
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:42,026
Brother-in-law, you should've told us
that you had such a sweet sister.

136
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,239
But you look nothing alike.
You don't look related at all.

137
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:49,409
As you all know,
thanks to my mom's complicated love life,

138
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,119
we have different dads.

139
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,329
How old is she? Are you still in school?

140
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,749
I'm one year younger.
I'm studying to retake the CSAT.

141
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,668
Studying, my ass.

142
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,878
You came last place
all throughout high school.

143
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,755
Hey. I wasn't last.

144
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,841
Did you cause trouble and run away
from home again?

145
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,008
I'll ask Mom.

146
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,178
I did not. I had some stuff to do here.

147
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,764
Okay. Go about your business
and hang out with me.

148
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,516
I'll buy you some good food.

149
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,059
Where are you going to sleep?

150
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,395
Don't even think about staying here.

151
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,354
Not a chance.

152
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,816
I'm already crashing here.
I won't let you be a burden too.

153
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:25,111
She came all the way to Seoul to see you.
Of course, she can stay here.

154
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:28,281
It's okay. I can just stay at a spa.

155
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,116
We can't let our friend's sister do that.

156
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,452
I'll give you my room.
You can sleep there.

157
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:36,330
Hans and I'll sleep in the storage room,
so you and Hyun-min can use our room.

158
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,749
But I don't want to sleep
in the storage room.

159
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,543
It smells like urine.

160
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,420
Why do you always decide on your own--

161
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:45,006
It's okay.
You don't need to do that for me.

162
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,383
Carson, can't you
let her sleep in your room?

163
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:51,012
I'm fine, but would Se-wan allow it?

164
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,430
No way.

165
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,474
Not even if she's family.

166
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,975
No unauthorized residents.

167
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,560
See? What did I tell you?

168
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:01,189
If they find out you're staying here,
I'll get caught for secretly living here.

169
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:04,025
Se-wan will get in trouble
for looking the other way.

170
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,443
Don't drag me into this!

171
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,069
Se-wan, come quickly. Help.

172
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,029
What? What is it?

173
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,238
Hey, I'll kill you!

174
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,290
Please catch it. Quick.

175
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:22,084
Why must an RA catch bugs?

176
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,086
Can't you guys do this?

177
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,588
You're our RA.

178
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,048
RAs are people too.

179
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,759
Hold on. I'll…

180
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,554
One. Two.

181
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,764
Three!

182
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,022
We play with bugs all the time on Jirisan.

183
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,235
Who runs away from home
because you can't get a new phone?

184
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,986
Act your age, will you?

185
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,238
Look who's talking.

186
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,949
You threw a tantrum
because you wanted a puffer coat.

187
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,700
Stay tonight, but go home tomorrow.

188
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,827
I'll tell Mom if you don't.

189
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,747
MOM

190
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,998
It's Mom.

191
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,458
Hey. Don't pick up.

192
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,920
Mom's quick. She'll know
if I don't pick up and come over.

193
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,756
Don't you dare tell her, or I'll kill you.

194
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,466
How dare you threaten me?

195
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,385
You should get on your knees and beg.

196
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,721
Hi, Mom.

197
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:16,806
I don't know.

198
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,892
If I hear from her,
drag her home by her hair?

199
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,477
Got it.

200
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,939
Hear that? Your life is in my hands.

201
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,315
Don't you dare tell her.

202
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,235
I'll tell her
you wore her designer shirt last year

203
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,821
and had it taken away by muggers.

204
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:32,863
Look who's talking.

205
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,783
If she finds out you broke
her full-length mirror, you're dead.

206
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,327
That was because you pushed me. Shit.

207
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,037
How dare you throw that at me?

208
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,957
-Hey.
-Hyun-a is so pretty and cute.

209
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,709
She's totally my dream girl.

210
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,919
Lucky you. You met your dream girl.

211
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,504
I know.

212
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,256
When a bird hatches from an egg,

213
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,259
the first animal it sees is the one
it gets the most attached to.

214
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:56,178
Whose name did Hyun-a give
when she came to the dorm?

215
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,347
-Mine.
-Give me a freaking break.

216
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,849
Our innocent Hyun-a

217
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,976
doesn't belong with a player like you.

218
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,520
You stole Hyun-min's crush.
Just tend to Ju-ri.

219
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,023
We broke up ages ago.
Why are you bringing her up?

220
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,482
You're such losers.

221
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,735
You're fighting over a kid
from the countryside.

222
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,279
A friend's sister is practically family.

223
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:16,449
How could you drool over someone
who's like your sister, you animals?

224
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,576
Hans, you finally said something right.

225
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,287
I totally agree. You animals.

226
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,372
They're not animals.

227
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,751
Hyun-a's pretty and cute.
I'm sure all the guys like her.

228
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,670
Minnie, you're jealous, aren't you?

229
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:33,257
Jealous? Me? Jealous? My gosh.

230
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,259
Do you think I have nothing better to do?

231
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,178
Oh, Hyun-a, sit here.

232
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,389
-Let's eat. You must be hungry.
-I am.

233
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,643
That looks good. Thank you.

234
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,102
Hyun-a. Do you have 500 won?

235
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:48,105
Let's see, 500 won. Hold on.

236
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,316
Here.

237
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,237
Oil from your hair and your nose.

238
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,657
Blow on it.

239
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:02,370
-Ta-da.
-Awesome. You're so good.

240
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,789
Your hair will get in your way
when you eat,

241
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,040
so tie it back with this.

242
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,459
You're so much fun.

243
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:11,128
You must be super popular
with the girls. Right?

244
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,339
Yes, of course.

245
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,383
When I was in high school in Australia,

246
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,344
the girls' moms came every day to protest.

247
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,097
They said the girls couldn't study
because of me.

248
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,891
Oh my gosh. Why are your ears so red?
Oh my gosh.

249
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,851
That's a sign that he's lying.

250
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,562
His ears are the most honest part
of his body.

251
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,897
Really?

252
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,816
That's so cool.

253
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,235
You're so innocent and cute.

254
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,778
Innocent? Cute?

255
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,406
I can't stand it.

256
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,283
Sam and Hyun-a really seem to click.

257
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,493
You're a good match.

258
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,036
How are they a good match?

259
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,746
Hyun-a's way too good for him.

260
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,039
Hyun-a! Snap out of it!

261
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,999
So, where will you sleep tonight?

262
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,168
Se-wan said she could sleep in our room

263
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,254
to thank her for catching the bug.

264
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:56,465
Hyun-min. May I sleep in Se-wan's room?

265
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,302
-Go ahead.
-Do you always listen to Hyun-min?

266
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,097
Of course.
He's my one and only big brother.

267
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,307
Of course.

268
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,646
What? A strategic alliance? What's that?

269
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,649
I'll pretend to be a good little sister

270
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,901
who listens to everything
her big brother says.

271
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,862
So don't tell Mom.

272
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,321
We'll act like we get along?

273
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,949
-Okay.
-Also,

274
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,618
I don't have to pay back
the 100,000 won I borrowed. Deal?

275
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,078
Are you nuts?

276
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,289
Get out!

277
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,670
Hyun-a will do anything I say.

278
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,255
I practically raised her.

279
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,965
Thanks, brother-in-law.

280
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,092
No wonder. Hyun-a is a lot like Hyun-min.

281
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,595
-I don't think they're alike at all.
-Oh my gosh!

282
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,597
-What the hell?
-When did you get here?

283
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,599
I was here the whole time.

284
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,226
What could I do?

285
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,604
She came to see her brother.
I can't kick her out.

286
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,774
You always say we have to follow the rules
but you do as you want.

287
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:58,027
So what? What do you want?
Should I stick to the rules?

288
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,238
Okay, let's see.

289
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,491
A few days ago, you went clubbing

290
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:06,535
and didn't come home.
How many demerits is that?

291
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,329
Sam was pretty good in front of her.

292
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,080
I guess he's a guy after all.

293
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,166
As if. He was totally childish.

294
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,418
It may seem that way to us,

295
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,295
but Hyun-a loved it.

296
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:20,466
Hey, to be honest,
Sam wasn't too bad today. He was witty.

297
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,843
If you like him so much,
you live with him.

298
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:24,553
Se-wan.

299
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,223
You skipped dinner, right?

300
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,891
Have this.

301
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,643
Thank you.

302
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,603
You are so thoughtful.

303
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:33,854
Can I help with anything?

304
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,690
I've helped my mom since I was a kid,
so I'm used to it.

305
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,067
That's right.

306
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,110
I left the cleaning supplies
in the kitchen.

307
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,738
I have to put them in storage. I forgot.

308
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,698
I'll find them and put them away.

309
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,201
Thanks, Hyun-a!

310
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,787
For real? She's as cunning as a fox.

311
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,957
I thought she was a hick,
but she's so sly.

312
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,876
"You're so innocent and cute."

313
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,378
"I did not."

314
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,880
Are you jealous?

315
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,006
What's wrong with her?

316
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,510
Right? You've been acting jealous
since earlier.

317
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:05,886
I am not!

318
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,059
Brother-in-law, here's your breakfast.

319
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,061
You even made me breakfast?

320
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:15,563
For real?

321
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,648
That's a bit much. Are you his maid?

322
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,442
Hyun-min. Did you sleep well?
The bed's comfy, right?

323
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,944
Just my two cents.

324
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:26,115
I think I'm more built for a bed
than a sleeping bag.

325
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,242
I'm doing laundry.
Do you need anything washed?

326
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:31,370
Yes. I do need to wash this, but…

327
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,081
I have nothing else to wear.

328
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,499
Really? Hyun-min.

329
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,045
Put this on.

330
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,798
It's too long on me.
It'll fit you perfectly.

331
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,758
It has a fleece lining, so it's warm.

332
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:45,968
Really?

333
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,014
Thanks. I wonder if Hyun-a's up yet.

334
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,769
I'm going to go crazy
untangling my earphone cable.

335
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,273
Only if I had Bluetooth earphones.

336
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,278
My eardrums hurt again.

337
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,573
I used these too much.
They must've killed my eardrums.

338
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,160
-I'm throwing them out. Do you want them?
-Really?

339
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,289
You wear them all the time.
I knew they'd ruin your ears.

340
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:20,878
I feel as if my eardrums are being healed.

341
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,213
Thanks, Hyun-min.

342
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,761
Why does my wrist hurt all of a sudden?

343
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:32,556
My wrist hurts too much to wear my watch.
Do you want it?

344
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,557
Really?

345
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,602
-I can have this?
-This is nothing between us.

346
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,228
Don't you agree?

347
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:43,609
I'm sure Hyun-a will be moved
to know we're this close.

348
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:48,697
The brother and the brother's friends
are all pathetic.

349
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,492
Must you do that over someone
who's like a sister?

350
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,243
You animals.

351
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,211
Hyun-a. It isn't much, but eat up.

352
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,506
Okay. I will. Thank you.

353
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,429
Here.

354
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,599
Why are you giving her the perilla leaf?

355
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,850
What's wrong with that?

356
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,104
Are you my wife or girlfriend?
What's it to you what I did?

357
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,522
Well, it's…

358
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:24,441
That's unsanitary,
using your chopsticks like that.

359
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:28,404
-You should use new ones.
-My point exactly. So gross.

360
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,739
Hans. Your fly's open.

361
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,870
Hans. Your fly's open.

362
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,835
Is there anything you want to do in Seoul?

363
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,670
Let's do them all today.

364
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,964
I want to go to a rooftop cafe
in Haebangchon.

365
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,842
I want to make perfume in Garosu-gil.

366
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,261
I want to have a souffle
at a cafe in Seongsu.

367
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,929
I want to go shopping in Hongdae.

368
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,016
Awesome. How do you know
so much about Seoul?

369
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,393
We have good Wi-Fi in Jirisan too.

370
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:03,063
I looked up all the hot places online
and memorized everything.

371
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,858
Actually, there is something
I really want to do.

372
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:06,775
What is it?

373
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,027
Convenience store recipes.

374
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,154
-What? Convenience store?
-What? Convenience store?

375
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:15,451
We don't have a convenience store
near our house in Jirisan.

376
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,162
Every time I saw
a convenience store recipe online,

377
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,663
I really wanted to try it.

378
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,499
Awesome. So this is the Mark Meal?

379
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,126
It looks so delicious.

380
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:29,089
Here. This is better than the Mark Meal.
Jeonju Bibim Spicy Chicken Fried Rice.

381
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,092
This is super hot right now too.

382
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,928
Terris, you really are the best.

383
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,805
Kimchi Carbonara Jjamppong with Tuna.

384
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,683
I created this recipe myself.
You have to try it now.

385
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,727
It'll become super hot real soon.

386
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:49,109
It looks gross, but it's delicious, Sam.

387
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,572
I invented this.

388
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,575
Seafood noodle soup with lots of seafood.

389
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,369
Do you want to try it?

390
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,288
What are you doing? What is that?

391
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,165
Why did you put chips in with noodles?

392
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,542
You shouldn't play around with food.

393
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,252
"Seafood noodle soup"?

394
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,296
Hans, you're hilarious.

395
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:13,175
Hans, you're so creative. I love it.

396
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,177
What?

397
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:17,721
What?

398
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,765
I said, you're so creative.

399
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,601
Hey. Hi, guys.

400
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,687
You're that kid who entered
the quiz show with Hyun-min.

401
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,524
The one who started a fire
in a subway station

402
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,734
and was taken by the police with Hyun-min?

403
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,403
My mom paid the fine, so they let me go.

404
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,739
I was so humiliated because of him.

405
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,617
Anyway, who's she?

406
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,160
She's Hyun-min's sister, Hyun-a.

407
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,537
What?

408
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,705
She looks nothing like him.

409
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:49,461
I walked here alone all the time.
It's nice walking with you.

410
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,547
Just the other day,
you were kissing another--

411
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,132
You're right. It's so nice.

412
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:56,176
I'm going to study hard
and come here next year.

413
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:01,807
My gosh. They're like servants
serving a princess.

414
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,143
Come to my department.
I'll show you around.

415
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,519
Okay. Sounds good.

416
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,604
Can you guarantee
you'll be here next year?

417
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,523
-If you get expelled--
-Shut up.

418
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,213
-Oh no.
-Gosh.

419
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,298
Are you okay?

420
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,178
-Oh no.
-I'm fine.

421
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,431
-I'm glad you're not hurt.
-I'm okay.

422
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,725
I'm sorry. Are you hurt?

423
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,145
Terris.

424
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,938
Hi, Il-seob. It's been a while.

425
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,691
I went to see your band a few days ago,
but you weren't there.

426
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,026
I've been busy lately.

427
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,738
My friend's sister is visiting,
so we're showing her around.

428
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:07,206
What's with the roses?
What's with the filter?

429
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,791
You idiot.
Why did you get hit in her place?

430
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:14,504
But why does that loser
suddenly look cool?

431
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,341
I must be going insane!

432
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:23,013
Hans. Your fly is open.

433
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:26,683
Hans. Your fly is open.

434
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:30,395
Hans, open your fly…

435
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,065
I must be going insane!

436
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,608
Where were you all day?

437
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:38,028
Your friends showed me around
and bought me food.

438
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,404
It was really fun.

439
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,948
Where is everyone?

440
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,659
Hans, Minnie, what are you guys doing?

441
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,586
This is the souffle
that you wanted to try.

442
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,340
Did you go to Seongsu-dong
to get this for me?

443
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,802
My gosh. I'm so moved.

444
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,389
Terris took the last souffle,

445
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:09,685
so I bought the flower
that was in the vase at the cafe.

446
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,769
Will you accept it?

447
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:14,773
You should've gotten a pancake instead.
What's with the flower?

448
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:15,691
Oh my.

449
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,654
Thank you, Sam.

450
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,698
I'm more moved by the thought

451
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,743
you put into this flower than the souffle.

452
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:31,164
We called one of our mom's ex-boyfriends
"Mr. Paper Crane."

453
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:34,042
He made 10,000 paper cranes for her once.

454
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,087
My mom threw them
right into the recycling bin,

455
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,048
but I know that
with every paper crane he folded,

456
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,801
he must've thought about my mom.

457
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:45,012
I was so moved by that.

458
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:46,972
That's right.

459
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,349
This souffle looks delicious.
Let's all share.

460
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,351
What?

461
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,103
Let's all share the souffle.

462
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,522
-What?
-Oh no.

463
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,649
You must be losing your hearing.

464
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,319
Already? You're still so young.

465
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,613
Oh, try the hearing aid
that the old women in my town use.

466
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,823
I'll find out which one.

467
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,618
-This souffle really is good.
-Oh my gosh.

468
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:09,911
When did you get here?

469
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,331
I've been here the whole time.
Can't you see me?

470
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:16,460
Jamie, you need to work on your presence.
You're practically invisible.

471
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,587
I was at the center of attention
just last week.

472
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,088
What happened to me?

473
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,508
You can't be at the center of attention
all the time. That's life.

474
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,093
You're quite an attention seeker.

475
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,057
How could you hug a guy
in front of your brother?

476
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,475
Is that how I raised you?

477
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:34,394
As if. Since when did you raise me?

478
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,813
Whatever. Give me the stuff
you got from them.

479
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,149
What do you mean?

480
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,735
You got them because of me,
so hand them over.

481
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,528
Should I tell them the truth

482
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,573
and tell them
not to kiss up to you ever again?

483
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,409
This is the last time.
You can't take them away again.

484
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:55,040
Anyway. You won't really go out
with one of them, will you?

485
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,458
Hey, I'm not stupid.

486
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,211
I thought international students
would be different,

487
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,004
but they're all stupid and tacky.

488
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:02,756
Just my two cents.

489
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,302
I think Sam-sik who lives down the street
is much better.

490
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,180
Right. Now that's my little sister.

491
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,932
But you know, just my two cents.

492
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,726
I may go around scamming people,

493
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,728
but this really tugs at my conscience.

494
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,563
The guys must have no idea

495
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,691
that you have the nastiest morning breath
and rarely shower.

496
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,652
-Since middle school--
-Why would you bring that up?

497
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:26,947
-I'll kill you!
-It hurts. Hey. Let go! I'll kill you!

498
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,157
Hey, it hurts!

499
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,410
-I'm sorry!
-Good night.

500
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:36,081
Thank you so much
for your words of advice.

501
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,669
Good night to you too, Hans.

502
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,422
Okay. Good night.

503
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,264
Hey, you. We need to talk.

504
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,433
What? What about?

505
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,439
Why aren't you leaving?

506
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,065
Why are you staying here?

507
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,234
-How long--
-Minnie. Actually…

508
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:07,028
-Actually what?
-I'm having a hard time because of Sam.

509
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,822
I know.

510
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,867
Why do you like that cunning loser?

511
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,744
Why are you such a bad judge of character?

512
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,997
I'm saying this for your sake.

513
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,415
Sam is totally a loser.

514
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:19,583
That's not it.

515
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:25,464
I think he's treating me on purpose
for someone else to see.

516
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,215
To make them jealous.

517
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,801
To make someone jealous?

518
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:33,638
I think he keeps looking at you
to see how you react.

519
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:34,973
Me?

520
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:38,477
Yes. He pretends to be nice to me

521
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,228
to agitate you.

522
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,147
Why would he do that to me?

523
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,107
It's obvious.

524
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,359
Sam likes you, Minnie.

525
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,278
So I was thinking,

526
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:51,865
I'll help you two get together.

527
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:58,288
I think your skin problem is
caused by too much direct sunlight.

528
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:02,167
You're right. The air is too clear
in Jirisan, so the sun is too strong.

529
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,462
This is mine, but you can have it.

530
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,506
Your skin will improve
if you use it daily.

531
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,424
-Oh my gosh. Can I really have it?
-Yes.

532
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,425
Thank you.

533
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,344
You can't take it while I'm using it.

534
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,471
You live in Seoul. You don't need it.

535
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,014
She lives in Jirisan.

536
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,976
I have a lot of perfume that I don't use.
Take them.

537
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,521
I have a lot of makeup too.
Take whatever you need.

538
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,606
-Let's go to my room.
-You're the best.

539
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:25,899
"You're the best."

540
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,777
Gosh. She won her over already.

541
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,861
Carson.

542
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,324
-Gosh.
-When you think about it,

543
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:37,118
Minnie is the biggest sucker.

544
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:46,753
I prefer a Korean breakfast
over a Western breakfast.

545
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:49,339
It's so simple.
All you need are rice, side dishes,

546
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,174
and freshly made soup.

547
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,759
Is that so hard?

548
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:55,554
Sorry. I'll prepare it starting tomorrow.

549
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:58,848
And Terris.
Will you wash my sneakers today?

550
00:25:58,932 --> 00:25:59,933
Sure. Okay.

551
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:07,691
Let me borrow your new sneakers
until mine are dry.

552
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:08,942
You can just keep them.

553
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:12,028
Anyway, what's Hyun-a doing today?

554
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,531
Today, Hyun-a and I are planning

555
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:17,200
to go get barbecue
at a Korean beef specialty place.

556
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,619
One of you can have the honor--

557
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,079
I'll go!

558
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,872
No! I'll go!

559
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,332
I said not to fight.

560
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,294
Why do you guys keep doing that?
You're so noisy.

561
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:34,134
Se-wan. Is my sister Hyun-a up?

562
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,512
She went home earlier.
She made up with your mom.

563
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,849
What? She went home? When?

564
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,267
Just now. Didn't you know?

565
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,562
Hey. How could you not know
that your sister went home?

566
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:49,399
You said you're close.
You said she does everything you say!

567
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,776
Hey. That's not it. Hyun-a…

568
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,404
-Stop! Get back here!
-Get back here!

569
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,949
Nice. I'm so glad I came to Seoul.

570
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,909
I got so many good things.

571
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,871
That's right. I should do what I promised.

572
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,793
I really want to see you before I leave.

573
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,549
Hey. Aren't you Hyun-min's sister?

574
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,176
-Where are you going?
-Home.

575
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,927
-Do you have a boyfriend?
-No.

576
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,846
I like you. Want to go out?

577
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,184
Sure.

578
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:25,685
Hop on. I'll take you home.

579
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,228
I live in Jirisan.

580
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,189
Jirisan? Where's that?

581
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,693
5 HOURS 25 MINUTES

582
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,987
Whatever. Let's ride.

583
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,072
Sure.

584
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:55,590
That's 8,754 cranes.

585
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,384
I'm almost there.

586
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,886
I need to make 10,000
before Hyun-a leaves.

587
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,097
Open up!

588
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,099
Wait. This is a misunderstanding.

589
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,351
Just get out, will you?

590
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:11,981
That was close. They're so persistent.

591
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,905
I really want to see you before I leave.

592
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:21,616
I'd like to meet alone secretly.

593
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,206
Sorry I'm late.

594
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,083
What? What are you doing here?

595
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,292
What else?

596
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,045
Hyun-a said you wanted to see me.

597
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,380
Me?

598
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,424
I came because she said
she wanted to see me.

599
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:42,178
Han Hyun-a. How dare you con me?

600
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,471
Damn it.

601
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,351
What the hell?

602
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:51,396
What's wrong? Are we locked in here?

603
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,313
What?

604
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,607
-Damn it.
-Damn it.

605
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,903
-Help!
-Hello! Help me!

606
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,072
-Help me!
-Let me out!

607
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,438
