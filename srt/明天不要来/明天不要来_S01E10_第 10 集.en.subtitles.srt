00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:32,115
RESIDENCE HALL
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

2
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,165
Why is she here?

3
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,252
Seriously.

4
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:52,052
-Se-wan.
-Why are you here?

5
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,179
Can't a mom visit her daughter?

6
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,348
I was just

7
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,851
wondering how you were doing.

8
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,020
What? Did you see the news or something?

9
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,231
Of course.
You're my one and only daughter.

10
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,150
-How could I not worry?
-Whatever.

11
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,069
Just say what you came to say, and go.

12
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,612
Did you cause trouble again?

13
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,280
What are you wearing?

14
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:13,782
You're still wearing this?

15
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,700
You got that in high school.

16
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,578
Forget this. Come with me.

17
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,580
Where? I don't want to go.

18
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:21,873
-Where are you--
-Just come.

19
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:25,251
-No! Stop it!
-Look at your clothes. Come on.

20
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,921
What are you doing? Who is she?

21
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,047
She's…

22
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,549
Why are you doing this?
She didn't borrow the money.

23
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,717
Actually…

24
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,678
You must be him.

25
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,889
I'm Se-wan's mom.

26
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:39,557
Excuse me?

27
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,436
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

28
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,479
It's okay.

29
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,649
Go inside. I need to talk to my mom.

30
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:48,566
Okay.

31
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,567
-I'm sorry.
-Go in.

32
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,819
Bye.

33
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,403
Go in. Okay.

34
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,446
Come with me.

35
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,036
He's much better looking in person.

36
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,163
Walk faster, will you?

37
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,124
Gosh. Your skin looks terrible too.

38
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,834
What's with this hair?

39
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,335
Gosh.

40
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,503
Stand straight!

41
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,088
That hurts! Let's go.

42
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,841
-I'll take this.
-Yes, ma'am.

43
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,175
What are you doing?

44
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,344
I don't wear things like this.

45
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,807
People are watching. Stop embarrassing me.

46
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,105
She'll try these on.

47
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,107
I don't need them.

48
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,151
What's wrong with you?

49
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,572
Why is she being so snippy today?

50
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,906
Stop causing a scene.

51
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,827
She'll try those on too.

52
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,539
If you have money, pay back your debt

53
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,500
instead of making creditors
come to the school.

54
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,296
Just give me the money
instead of buying me these things.

55
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,006
This is like two months of work.

56
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,549
Why are you working?

57
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:55,967
Have you no pride?

58
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,387
Birds of a feather flock together.
Don't you get it?

59
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,764
You need to look the part
to be treated well.

60
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:03,725
Birds of a feather?

61
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,728
Bet my life on a rich guy,

62
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,479
and if he falls, fall with him?

63
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,857
I know too well from watching you.

64
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,443
Exactly, so do a better job
at finding a guy.

65
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,777
Someone who won't fall.

66
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,905
How could you say that to your daughter?

67
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,490
You want me to wear expensive things

68
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,034
and get myself a sugar daddy?

69
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,535
Is that it?

70
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,536
That's right.

71
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,246
What's wrong with a sugar daddy?

72
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,374
He's rich enough
that it won't make a dent.

73
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,376
Why would he want someone like me?

74
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,504
What? What's wrong with you?
What do you lack?

75
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,256
Strictly put, he's an orphan.

76
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,759
He was just lucky to be adopted
by a rich family.

77
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,303
He's nothing. He doesn't compare to you.

78
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,264
We raised you with so much care.

79
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,016
You received so much love.

80
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,727
I'd rather be an orphan.

81
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,438
Then I wouldn't have a mom
who torments me.

82
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,691
You guys practically abandoned me.

83
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,736
You should've just abandoned me.
I'd have been better off.

84
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,739
Now I'm a con artist's daughter
who is chased after by creditors.

85
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,956
You don't have to be so mean.

86
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,168
It's hard enough for me.

87
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,046
Brat.

88
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,509
It's obvious why you're here.
Don't even try.

89
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,011
I have nowhere to go wearing these things.

90
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,267
You wear them or return them. Whatever.

91
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,852
Hey!

92
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,605
What are you doing?

93
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,983
Please leave.

94
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,404
Hey!

95
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,863
Mom!

96
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,450
Step on it.

97
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,417
So? You two decided to go out?

98
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,085
Yes. Today is our first day.

99
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:57,797
Did something happen during the 13 hours
and 25 minutes you were locked

100
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,132
in the storage room?

101
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,258
Of course.

102
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,427
A young, healthy man
and woman were locked in alone.

103
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,886
You can picture it, can't you?

104
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,723
With you two, it could've easily
turned into a bloody fight.

105
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,933
You're always
biting each other's head off.

106
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:09,934
But now, you're dating?

107
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:13,438
See? I told you over and over
that you were a good couple,

108
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,189
but you gave me crap and denied it.

109
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,399
I did not.

110
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,736
I just said it's awkward
for friends to date. Right?

111
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,530
Of course. My baby is shy, that's why.

112
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,032
-Right?
-Yes.

113
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,453
What's wrong? They're cute together.

114
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,538
Not as cute as we are though.
Right, Se-wan?

115
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,253
Jamie. You realize
you're getting more and more annoying.

116
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,757
I personally think he was much better
when he didn't talk.

117
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,925
I agree. He talks too much now.

118
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,471
He's so loud in the room too.
I swear it makes my ears bleed.

119
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,014
Really? Oh no.

120
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,140
Over here.

121
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,516
It's bleeding.

122
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,770
I bet 100,000 won
that they break up in a month.

123
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,774
-What? A month? I give them a week max.
-What? That long?

124
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,317
I wonder if they'll last a day.

125
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:04,655
Okay. We have to leave
early in the morning,

126
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:05,990
so go get ready.

127
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,617
Are we really going?

128
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,036
I seriously don't want to go.
Leave me out of this.

129
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:13,247
Your mom invited us over
to your house in Jirisan.

130
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,625
Exactly. This is the best season.

131
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,127
We can make kimchi
in the Korean countryside.

132
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,588
It's great
for international students like us.

133
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,048
Wait. That's tomorrow?

134
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:25,051
Oh no. I forgot
and made plans for tomorrow.

135
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,886
What? Are you meeting a girl again?

136
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,597
I'll go on your date
and you can go to my house.

137
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:31,724
Shall we go pack?

138
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:32,809
Let's go, baby.

139
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,727
Okay. Baby's coming.

140
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,648
Shall we go too, baby?

141
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,650
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

142
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,832
Who would've guessed it? Minnie and Sam,

143
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,959
and Jamie and Se-wan coupled up.

144
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,753
Minnie and Sam are different.
They won't last anyway.

145
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,004
-Do you want to die?
-Do you want to die?

146
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,881
What I really don't get is,

147
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,800
why does Jamie like Se-wan?

148
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,468
-Me too.
-I know, right?

149
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,386
I know.

150
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,347
I asked him
when they first started going out.

151
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,641
Jamie likes Se-wan because…

152
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:16,686
she's pretty.

153
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,896
-No way.
-Seriously.

154
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,107
There are so many pretty girls in Korea.

155
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,359
Jamie. You need to get your eyes examined.

156
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,194
He needs a shrink first.

157
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,487
Hey! Why you…

158
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,990
Jamie's right.

159
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,950
I really want to know.

160
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,619
How did Jamie end up liking Se-wan?

161
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,874
She was the first person in my life
who was on my side

162
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,126
other than my mom.

163
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,379
The day I passed out from constipation,

164
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,425
it was the first time someone else saw
something that embarrassing.

165
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,218
After having her see that,

166
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,679
I felt very comfortable being around her.

167
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,643
What the heck? You said that.

168
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,395
No, I didn't. You did.

169
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,605
But I really liked it.

170
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,231
Stop it already!

171
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,941
Give it a rest, will you?

172
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,861
I'm going to barf from listening to
an hour of your baby talk.

173
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:10,573
I was right, wasn't I? My ears bleed
ever since he started talking.

174
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:14,035
So it was the day you took off
during the blind date!

175
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,828
You slept together that night, right?

176
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,663
We did not! Are you nuts?

177
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,749
Anyway, what happened was--

178
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,459
-Enough!
-We've heard enough!

179
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,545
Please! Cut it out! My ears are bleeding.

180
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:28,549
Don't you guys want to know
why I like Minnie?

181
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,302
No. I really, really,
really don't want to know.

182
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,222
Really? Forget it then.

183
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,480
What is that smell?

184
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,899
-Stop the car!
-Who was that?

185
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:45,858
Sam, you punk!

186
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,652
-Get out!
-Get out!

187
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,028
It stinks! Get away!

188
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,701
Seriously. You almost made me throw up!

189
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,245
I thought I was going to die.

190
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,247
How could a human fart smell that bad?

191
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,790
I think I've been here before.

192
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,668
Right? I think I've been here before too.

193
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,378
Hey. That restaurant.

194
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,712
Oh, you're right.

195
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,923
That restaurant is famous.

196
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,967
Really? Then let's go in and eat.

197
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:16,013
Lee Hyori and Kang Ho-dong ate here too.

198
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:19,392
Lee Yeong-ja and Mr. Paik acknowledged
how good it was.

199
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,602
Look. There's a lot of autographs.

200
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:23,604
What do you want?

201
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:24,689
Red bean kalguksu.

202
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:27,608
Me too. Their red beans are amazing.

203
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,110
Kalguksu with red beans?

204
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,611
It's delicious.

205
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,655
Should I get anchovy broth or spicy?

206
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,907
Let's get one of each and share.

207
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,117
Okay.

208
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,744
Us too. Let's get two and share.

209
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,663
-One red bean, one spicy mixed.
-Okay.

210
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,624
Dagnabbit. It's so sad being single.

211
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,001
-Hey, Hyun-min.
-What?

212
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,419
Split with me.

213
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:50,381
One spicy mixed, one anchovy broth,
dumplings, and a mung bean pancake.

214
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,258
You're picking only what you want.

215
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:53,884
How is that sharing?

216
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,767
It tastes exactly the same.
It hasn't changed.

217
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,853
I know. It hasn't changed at all.

218
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:04,770
It's so delicious.

219
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,231
Have you been here before?

220
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,357
Yes, I think so.

221
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,152
A lot of foreigners came here.

222
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,654
What's this?

223
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,282
"Minnie heart Hans"?

224
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:19,035
That's right. I came here with Hans.

225
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,494
Now, I remember.

226
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,789
What? Why did you two come here?

227
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,833
Because we were going out at the time.

228
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,419
-What? You two went out?
-You didn't know?

229
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,796
I heard they went out
and broke up a long time ago.

230
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,714
Even I knew that.

231
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,216
What? Everyone knew but me?

232
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,393
Why didn't you tell me
you used to see him?

233
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,020
I didn't?

234
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,189
I assumed you knew.

235
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,357
Didn't you know?

236
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,776
Terris told everyone,
so everyone in the dorm knows.

237
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,487
-Yeah.
-Does it bother you that they went out?

238
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,280
The mighty Sam?

239
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,574
Sam is really open-minded.

240
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,327
I'm not bothered one bit.
I'm not that petty.

241
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,829
Admit it. You wonder
how they ended up going out.

242
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,122
Not at all.

243
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,874
They went out because of you.

244
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,125
What? What did I do?

245
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,544
Do you remember your hazing?

246
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,296
We dressed up to scare you.

247
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,508
Terris was Chucky, Hans was Toshio,

248
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,803
Minnie was a female ghost,
and I was the Joker.

249
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,931
That? I wasn't scared one bit.
It wasn't that fun.

250
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,187
Damn it.

251
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,861
My gosh!

252
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,991
Hans was smitten by Minnie
in a traditional mourning dress.

253
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,952
He's had that fetish ever since.

254
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,371
It's not a fetish. Stop exaggerating.

255
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,124
A fetish for a ghost in
a traditional mourning dress is sick.

256
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,544
True, I make everything look sexy.

257
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,462
How could you laugh right now?

258
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,507
It's funny. He has a fetish
for mourning dresses. No?

259
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,050
He's being petty again..

260
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,343
Pissy pants.

261
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,555
Do you think you'd be okay
if your girlfriend

262
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,098
went out with your friend?

263
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,307
Then what?

264
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,768
It's fine as long as
she's my girlfriend now.

265
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:08,728
My point exactly.

266
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,063
This is why girls like you, Terris.

267
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,399
You're understanding and you relate.

268
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:22,992
Okay.

269
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,205
Mom, we're here.

270
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,797
Welcome. Thanks for coming
all the way here.

271
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,091
-Hello.
-Hello.

272
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,551
-Hello.
-Hello.

273
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,345
What took you so long, punk?

274
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,307
Do you know how long it takes
to make 100 heads of kimchi?

275
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,517
That's why I said let's just buy it.

276
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,769
Who makes kimchi anymore?

277
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,980
Your siblings will only eat your kimchi.
What choice do I have?

278
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,775
Where are they? Where's Hyun-a?

279
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:59,403
Hyun-a got herself a boyfriend
from somewhere.

280
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,239
Gosh. Sorry.
How rude of us to talk among ourselves.

281
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,241
-Don't worry about it.
-Don't worry about it.

282
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:10,289
Finish quickly before the sun sets,
and let's get wasted.

283
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,542
Unpack quickly and start making kimchi.

284
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,505
-You must be Se-wan.
-Yes.

285
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,423
The dorm RA.

286
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,843
Thank you so much for inviting us.

287
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:23,761
Thank you.

288
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,680
She has good manners through and through.

289
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,268
Thank you so much
for being good to Hyun-min.

290
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:32,895
By any chance…

291
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,482
You don't like him
or anything like that, do you?

292
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,318
Mom, what's wrong with you?
She has a boyfriend.

293
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,237
You two.

294
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:46,200
You don't have a crush on Hyun-min
or anything like that, right?

295
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,326
-No!
-No!

296
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,828
-I have high standards.
-Me too.

297
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,413
Hey! He has high standards too!

298
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,624
To be blunt, I'm the prettiest one here.

299
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,125
Mom, please!

300
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,877
I'm quite the beauty.

301
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,214
Hyun-min is pretty too
because he takes after me.

302
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,174
You should be grateful, you punk.

303
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,221
It won't go in.

304
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,722
Where is it?

305
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,724
Se-wan! Jamie!

306
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,852
You two, separate!

307
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,854
If you do that again,

308
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,480
I'll make you regret it!

309
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,317
Carson, I thought you were handling
your breakup well,

310
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,278
but I guess it hurt.

311
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,195
Hey, punks.

312
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,531
Watch it in front of Carson, will you?

313
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,205
What's with you two?

314
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,791
-Are you two a couple?
-No.

315
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,711
What do you mean?
You're wearing matching shirts.

316
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,254
Is it a love triangle?

317
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:43,382
It's not a triangle. We broke up long ago.

318
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:46,385
There are so many men in the world,

319
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:49,847
but you're dating around
within this tiny group?

320
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,308
Who are you seeing? Who is it?

321
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,392
Stop distracting me.

322
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,686
If you're not going to help,
leave me alone.

323
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,479
Work hard, son.

324
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,440
You smell like cigarettes!

325
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,318
-Aren't you making dinner?
-That's right.

326
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,236
Should I order chicken?

327
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,824
Jjajangmyeon?

328
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,411
You want us to eat something
we have all the time in the dorm?

329
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,164
Fine.

330
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,041
I'll grill up some meat.

331
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,085
Jamie, here.

332
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,255
You're such a good eater.

333
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,217
Hey.

334
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,512
Are you not over Hans?
Why are you wearing that?

335
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,348
What are you talking about?

336
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,059
I grabbed old clothes in case I got dirty.

337
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,186
You broke up a while ago.

338
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,104
Why do you still have it?

339
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,814
This is nice cotton. It's comfy.

340
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,652
I'll ask one last time.

341
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,572
Is that really it?
You're not still hung up on him?

342
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,283
Hey. If I were,
would I be going out with you?

343
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,662
It meant nothing to me.
That's why I wore it like nothing.

344
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,246
Just to clear the air,

345
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,166
I didn't wear this
because I'm hung up on her either.

346
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,252
I also brought an old shirt
in case I got seasoning on it.

347
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,797
They really do think alike. Right?

348
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,256
We went out for three weeks.

349
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,300
There's nothing to remember.

350
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,261
Once I break up with someone,
I delete all my memories

351
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,931
to increase my brain storage capacity.

352
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,140
Well, well, well…

353
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,393
You're alike even in the way
you don't remember anything.

354
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,270
I didn't know you were such a good match.

355
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,482
Sam, let's stop. Okay?

356
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:27,444
SamSam, stop being so petty already.

357
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,364
You're nearing the danger zone.
Stop being so petty..

358
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,324
I'm not being petty.

359
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,576
I'm totally fine.

360
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,412
It's all in the past anyway.

361
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,831
I'm not that petty.

362
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,667
Anyway…

363
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,920
why did you break up
if you were such a good match?

364
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,131
Minnie cheated on him with another guy.

365
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,841
What? Who was it?

366
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,050
Was it someone I know?

367
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:54,722
No. She fell for a guy wearing the hanbok
in the cult who scams people. So--

368
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,390
What? It was that asshole?

369
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:57,933
I'm mad now.

370
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,852
Why are you mad?

371
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:04,148
I just found out about two of her exes
in one day.

372
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,692
There's no one else that I know, is there?

373
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,361
I'm not close to Hans,
so I don't care about him.

374
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,947
But if it's someone close to me--

375
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,324
Enough! Stop it already!

376
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,702
Hey. You said
you went out with a lot of girls too.

377
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,121
I never wore matching shirts.

378
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,207
And even I know that you hit on Jamie
and were rejected.

379
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,751
That's enough.

380
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,210
See? Look at her.

381
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,880
Look at her clenching her teeth.
You're being suspicious.

382
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,299
Babe. You do love me, right?

383
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,594
Are you mad at your current boyfriend
because of your ex-boyfriend?

384
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,429
Hey. I said that's enough.

385
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:38,515
I'm not petty. Just be honest.

386
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,768
I just don't want to get stabbed
in the back.

387
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,853
I've seen you do that
to guys so many times--

388
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,272
Hey, asshole!
Forget it then! Let's break up!

389
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,648
You loser pissy pants!

390
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,443
Who are you to dump me?
If anyone ends it, it'll be me.

391
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,156
You're the one who ruined my pure love
in less than 24 hours.

392
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,533
-Let's end it. Let's break up.
-Like hell.

393
00:17:56,617 --> 00:18:00,245
I wanted to end it after 24 minutes,
but I was putting up with you.

394
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,581
I won't take you back even if you beg.

395
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,333
Let's end it. Let's break up.

396
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,628
My point exactly. I must've been nuts.
Why did I like someone so petty?

397
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,506
Give me a break. You look like a fly.

398
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,091
Why you…

399
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,013
They broke up within 24 hours.

400
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,306
What did I say?

401
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,809
You said a week. I said a day.

402
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,186
Awesome. I got it right.

403
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,064
Hey. Are you happy
that you got that right?

404
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,150
-Hey, wait.
-Hey! Separate!

405
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,529
What's wrong with you?

406
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,490
Stop it. Don't do that to my baby.

407
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,491
Right.

408
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,381
Are you really breaking up like this?

409
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,259
What a great age.

410
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,595
I'd be dating like crazy
if I were just a few years younger.

411
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,222
More than now?

412
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,141
You date more than I do.

413
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,309
Me? I haven't seen anyone in a while.

414
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,354
Mr. Crane came to the school bawling
less than a month ago.

415
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:08,772
Has it been that long?

416
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,942
It has been really long since my last guy.

417
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:15,154
No wonder.
I felt like my heart was getting hard.

418
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,948
I can't live without love. Damn it.

419
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,994
Son, we're out of liquor. Go get more.

420
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,454
I need to melt my heart with alcohol.

421
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,375
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

422
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,214
Jamie had such a bad first impression.

423
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,009
He didn't talk. He was distant.
He didn't hang out with us.

424
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,552
He got a lot better.

425
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,179
You're even traveling with us.

426
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:43,640
That's right. You're sensitive
about going to the bathroom.

427
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,101
You'll faint if you see the bathroom here.

428
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,394
I'll have to adjust.

429
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:50,606
I got a lot better though.
It's all thanks to my baby.

430
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:52,816
Seriously.

431
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,359
"My baby."

432
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,485
Is that fun?

433
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,070
What will you do in Korea now?

434
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,365
I know you want to live a normal life
and find your own life…

435
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,909
That's the problem.

436
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,536
I've never known what I wanted to do.

437
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,956
I've always done as others told me
and set up for me.

438
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,458
So I don't know what I like.

439
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,960
I'll have to figure it out now.

440
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,253
Help me, okay?

441
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:16,465
Depends on how you act. You're rich,
so treat us to lots of good food.

442
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,966
I promised my mom

443
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,094
I'd make money for expenses
if she pays for my tuition.

444
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,888
I'm glad Se-wan got me those jobs.

445
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,599
You're a total bum.

446
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:26,767
Don't talk to me.

447
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,436
That's right. Se-wan dragged you
to those jobs

448
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,772
because you broke her phone screen, right?

449
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:32,689
Yes.

450
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:33,857
That was a total scam.

451
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:37,402
It was broken already.
She just dumped it all on you.

452
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:41,657
-What? Really?
-That's right. Se-wan is a selfish brat.

453
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,742
Dump her quickly.

454
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,078
IL-SEOB

455
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,290
Hey, you're getting a call.
Aren't you going to pick up?

456
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,795
Hey, sorry.

457
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,840
Something urgent came up,
so I had to go out of town.

458
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,760
Yes. Sure.

459
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,346
Let's go see the musical another time.

460
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:05,889
Listen, Il-seob.

461
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:07,516
I'm sorry.

462
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,851
Terris has been acting weird recently.

463
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,645
He was serial dating girls,

464
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,981
but he doesn't seem to be
seeing anyone now.

465
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,984
He must be sick of them.
Damn it. Don't talk to me.

466
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,528
Don't let her drink too much.

467
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,281
She's got a nasty habit when drunk.

468
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,701
She's drunk. We're in trouble.

469
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,035
I'm still fine.

470
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:32,457
You know, I just hate parents.

471
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,085
They're all irresponsible.

472
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,129
What are you so unhappy about?

473
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:40,007
It's not that I'm unhappy.

474
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,594
You're the same.

475
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:48,265
You gave birth to kids with no dads
and just neglected them.

476
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,182
Hey.

477
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,183
What the hell?

478
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,812
Just my two cents.

479
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,856
I think my mom needs to repent.

480
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,319
Do you know how Hyun-min lives at school?

481
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:04,406
He pretends to be a foreigner
and lives secretly in his friend's room.

482
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,117
He freeloads off of the others
all the time.

483
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,244
Did you know that he did that?

484
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,330
Just my two cents.

485
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:14,041
I didn't think about it before,
but I pity myself now.

486
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,667
But you looked the other way.

487
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,048
I'm short-staffed at home as is.
Why did you let him stay?

488
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,799
Is giving birth everything?

489
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,260
Don't you feel bad for your kid?

490
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,803
You should be responsible.

491
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:30,057
Hey. Se-wan is drunk and acting up again.
Let's go.

492
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,392
Okay. Grill the rest and come out.

493
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:36,271
Damn it. What the hell?
I shouldn't have come.

494
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:46,365
I also had a hard time when Minnie
cheated on me with that guy from the cult.

495
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,450
But…

496
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,452
time heals all wounds.

497
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,246
"This too shall pass." Right?

498
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,458
Stop it!

499
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,710
How dare you comfort me?

500
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,587
Get out of my face.

501
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,800
I gave birth to Hyun-min by myself
when I was 21,

502
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,593
but I didn't abandon him at least.

503
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:09,805
That was pretty responsible,
if I say so myself.

504
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,140
Mom! How could you say that?

505
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,017
Jamie was adopted.

506
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:17,646
Whether you gave birth to your child
or raised him with all your heart…

507
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,109
Thanks to her birth mom dumping him,
he met a better mom and grew up well.

508
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,902
You're right, I grew up well.

509
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,404
Se-wan, I'm fine.

510
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,823
You're fine, right?

511
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,409
It's no big deal to have multiple parents.

512
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,827
Mom, please!

513
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,371
Jamie and Hyun-min

514
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,375
must've been so hurt when they were young.

515
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,794
What's wrong with moms?

516
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,671
My mom too.

517
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:47,384
I know a lot of people talk behind my back

518
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:50,554
how I had a bunch of kids
with different dads.

519
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,055
But you know,

520
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,266
I can run into a pit of fire

521
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,102
for each one of my kids.

522
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:59,312
Even still, others will keep talking.

523
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,065
Aren't you ashamed?

524
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,109
It's not like they'll provide for me.

525
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,154
People care too much
about what others think.

526
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,613
What others may think.

527
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,198
What others may say.

528
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,577
Not to be ashamed in front of others.
To have and do as much as others.

529
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,163
Others. It's always "others."

530
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,497
Fine.

531
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:22,252
If a parent makes a lot of money
so they're not ashamed in front of others

532
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,755
and gives you enough money
to make others jealous,

533
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,633
is that being responsible?

534
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:30,635
No.

535
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,887
I…

536
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,264
will never have kids.

537
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:35,599
I'll never get married.

538
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,227
I don't trust people.

539
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,313
I trust love even less.

540
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,065
Whether or not
you trust them is up to you,

541
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,736
but child.

542
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,200
Look at that little boy who likes you,

543
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:58,121
looking at you with his sparkling eyes.

544
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,165
At least show him some respect.

545
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:05,670
Saying you don't need love
when you're receiving love like that

546
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,465
is disrespectful.

547
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:12,511
I know.

548
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:26,316
Look at all the stars. It's been so long.

549
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,776
I love it!

550
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,194
Aren't you cold?

551
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:30,487
No.

552
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,657
-Isn't the Korean countryside nice?
-Yes.

553
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,825
I'm really glad I came.

554
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:39,746
I must've been very mistaken
all this time.

555
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:42,374
You're fine. I'm much worse.

556
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,167
I live without thinking.

557
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:47,587
No, you don't.

558
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:56,846
Gosh.

559
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,306
What's wrong?

560
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,267
My stomach…

561
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:03,019
I haven't been to the bathroom
since yesterday.

562
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,816
Right. Let's turn around. Come on.

563
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,902
I just can't use the bathroom here.

564
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,529
Then what?

565
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:15,323
We can't even get an ambulance here.

566
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,616
I can't hold it anymore.

567
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,368
Let me go over there and…

568
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:21,079
Hey. Hey, Jamie!

569
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,038
What the…

570
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,331
But…

571
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,382
Must he do this here?

572
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,885
Se-wan! Don't leave. It's scary.

573
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,804
I won't leave.

574
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,472
I won't leave.

575
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,224
Se-wan, are you there?

576
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,934
I'm here!

577
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,979
Must I stand next to my boyfriend
while he poops?

578
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,564
I'm really scared.

579
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,816
Can you sing for me?

580
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,359
No!

581
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,611
Just take a dump!

582
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,287
Are you done yet?

583
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,497
Not yet!

584
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:09,127
What is this in the middle of a date?
How many times did this happen?

585
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:13,423
It's not like I'm asking for
anything romantic.

586
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:16,926
Something normal. An ordinary date.

587
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,012
That's what I want.

588
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:21,348
But this is how we started.

589
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,309
I must be very comfortable around you.

590
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,446
Anyway…

591
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:39,240
my constipation improved thanks to you--

592
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,826
So, here it is.

593
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:45,830
Who dumped my scooter here?

594
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:48,083
I think one of my brother's friends
took it out.

595
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,585
All of his friends are weird.

596
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,380
Especially that guy Hans. He's a freak.

597
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,049
What's with the paper cranes?
Why did he give them to you?

598
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,092
I know.

599
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,135
He's hard of hearing too.

600
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,012
Anyway, I feel sorry for him.

601
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,723
Don't you have to go back to Seoul?

602
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,016
What about school?

603
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,519
Whatever. My mom's disowning me.

604
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,479
My little brother will get the buildings.

605
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,523
Your family owns buildings?

606
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,274
Awesome.

607
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,401
Just my two cents.

608
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,570
It's my dream to become
the wife of a building owner.

609
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,906
Hold on tight.

610
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:24,744
Hey.

611
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,955
They're gone.

612
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,997
