1
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,909
I can't afford to have my face
get all puffy tomorrow.

2
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,164
You're not the one auditioning.
Why do you care so much?

3
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:42,292
Who knows? I may run into some idols.

4
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,045
You're so lucky. Can I go with you?

5
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,881
I barely got Sam to agree to take me.

6
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:51,676
I had to kiss up to him
and feed his ego. I almost barfed.

7
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,429
Still, when else could I see
the inside of an agency?

8
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:57,807
Is it true that Sam was scouted
by an agency randomly on the street?

9
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,685
He lies so much all the time.
I don't know what to believe.

10
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,437
I'll find out tomorrow.

11
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,939
SamSam is cute and pretty

12
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,816
when you think about it.

13
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,446
It's him!

14
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,656
Oh, my gosh!

15
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,533
Over here! Look here!

16
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,993
Oh, my gosh!

17
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,912
Gosh, you're so hot!

18
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:22,373
I love you! Please, give me a heart!

19
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,086
Oh, my gosh!

20
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,796
You're so hot!

21
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:28,963
My goodness!

22
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,549
Good luck on the audition tomorrow!

23
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,177
I love you!

24
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,722
Hey. He's human just like you.

25
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:39,849
What's wrong with her?

26
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:45,855
MOM

27
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,774
Why is my mom calling again?

28
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:48,775
I'm not answering.

29
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,361
Hello?

30
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,029
Yes.

31
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,864
Hyun-min is here.

32
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,032
Hey, what the heck?

33
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,534
It's your mom.

34
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,119
She's in front of the dorm.

35
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,662
What? She is?

36
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:05,041
My face is getting puffy already.

37
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,001
Why did you want to eat at this hour?

38
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:11,089
Dagnabbit. You ate an entire fire noodle
and a bag of ramyeon by yourself.

39
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,257
Minnie.

40
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,843
Ask me for a bite again,

41
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,469
and I'll sew your mouth shut.

42
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,264
What the…

43
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,227
Hey.

44
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,187
What is that?

45
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,273
I don't know. Gosh.

46
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,482
What's with the baby?

47
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,901
My gosh. Is that baby for real?
Is it yours?

48
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:32,902
What?

49
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,028
No, he isn't.

50
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,114
He's my baby brother.

51
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,615
-Baby brother?
-Baby brother?

52
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:43,037
Your mom left your baby brother with you?

53
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:46,624
She left a baby with you
to take a trip with her boyfriend?

54
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,793
He looks a little different from you.

55
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,962
All six of us have different dads.

56
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,297
-What?
-What?

57
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,381
For real?

58
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,425
My mom never wants to get married.

59
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,010
She wants to date freely forever.

60
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,304
I respect her.

61
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,972
She's my role model.

62
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:04,934
I'm not in the mood to explain
my mom's complicated love life.

63
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,394
So, what will you do?

64
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,938
What else? I have to watch him
until my mom gets back.

65
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,773
Are you out of your mind?

66
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,817
You know the professor is on edge already

67
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,153
because of the fire and the thefts.

68
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,155
It's bad enough that you live here.

69
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,073
What if he finds out about the baby too?

70
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,868
I know that.
I'll figure something out tomorrow.

71
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,369
I'll look after him tonight--

72
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,913
What do we do?

73
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,998
-Hey.
-What do we do?

74
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,459
Come here.

75
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,545
What if someone makes a report
after hearing a crying baby?

76
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,673
Peekaboo.

77
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,342
Peekaboo.

78
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,272
He stopped crying.

79
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,565
Look at him smile.

80
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,026
That's a big smile. How cute.

81
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:58,154
He stopped as soon as he went to Se-wan.
He must like her.

82
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,240
Why me?

83
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,199
Oh, okay.

84
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,542
Se-wan. Is he asleep?

85
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,378
Yes, I think so.

86
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,421
Here.

87
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,966
Oh no. Don't cry.

88
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,804
He cries whenever anyone else takes him.

89
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:26,641
If someone hears him and reports it,
they'll find out I'm living here.

90
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,769
You'll also be in trouble
for letting me get away with it.

91
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:30,687
What do we do?

92
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,021
Are you threatening me?

93
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,481
No, not at all.

94
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,400
If I get kicked out,

95
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,777
I'll just commute five hours again
from Icheon.

96
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,029
But if you get fired and kicked out,

97
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,614
you'll lose your scholarship.

98
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:42,907
I'm just so worried.

99
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,785
How did I get caught up in this?

100
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,204
I hate my life.

101
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,247
Get out of here.

102
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,962
Hello. We're having a grand opening event
at Korean Beef and Pork.

103
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,797
Please come in for lunch.

104
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,633
We have the best food
and the best service.

105
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,552
For a limited time only,…

106
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,346
I'm beat from watching
Hyun-min's brother all night long.

107
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,640
But I have to do this. This pays the best.

108
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,518
Then take a break over there.
I'll do it by myself.

109
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,729
Then it'll look like I'm slacking off.

110
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,147
We should rest together.

111
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,861
You look like
you're getting used to working.

112
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,195
You've gotten better.

113
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,906
Of course.
I have to work hard and pay you back.

114
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,617
That's a good attitude.

115
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,202
I thought you'd screw me over.

116
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,579
I'm grateful, actually.

117
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,497
I need to make spending money.

118
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,583
I wouldn't have thought of doing this.

119
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,586
You should treat me better going forward.

120
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,630
The guys say I'm being too hard on you,

121
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,592
but all of this is for your own good.

122
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,593
No, sorry.

123
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,219
No? Okay.

124
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,890
Excuse me. Hello. Do you know Park Se-wan?
She studies business.

125
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,350
No, I don't. Sorry.

126
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,227
-Hey, that's mine.
-Doesn't matter.

127
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,398
The person you have reached…

128
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,858
Why won't she pick up?

129
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,653
Mom, did you borrow money again?

130
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,198
That lady from Songpa-dong
came to my school.

131
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,869
How much is it this time?

132
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:11,496
What?

133
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,793
I have no money.
Why don't you just sell me off?

134
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,628
Whatever!

135
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,798
I've cut ties with our stupid family,
so you pay back your own debts!

136
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,426
What's wrong? Who was it that--

137
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,677
You heard?

138
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,930
Why are you eavesdropping?

139
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,557
I wasn't eavesdropping.
Is something wrong at home?

140
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,934
-That lady earlier--
-Hey.

141
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:37,105
It's none of your business,
so worry about yourself.

142
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,947
-What? Minnie passed the audition?
-What? Minnie passed the audition?

143
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,907
Yes. I even signed a contract.

144
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,575
I'm a trainee starting tomorrow.

145
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,202
Awesome.

146
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,079
You tagged along to watch Sam audition,

147
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,372
but you got signed? How?

148
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:57,083
I was watching him audition,

149
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,127
but he was dancing terribly.

150
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,213
I showed him how it's done
because I was frustrated,

151
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:04,465
and the president really liked me.

152
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,050
What do you mean?

153
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,677
Those people are blind.

154
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,929
You tagged along and got signed instead.

155
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,140
Sam, you ended up helping Minnie instead.

156
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:15,101
Hey, it's fine.

157
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:18,354
Everyone has their own path to take.

158
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,815
Sam! I'm really sorry
for what I did to you.

159
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,024
You're not mad, are you?

160
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,569
Hey. You all seem to be very confused.

161
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,863
I was the one who turned them down.

162
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,365
What? They said to come back
after some practice.

163
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,119
The president asked me quietly
to his office,

164
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,912
and he asked me to sign with them.

165
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,998
But I told him that I have to tell my dad

166
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:39,208
before I sign anything, so I called him,

167
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,668
and my dad said

168
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,211
not to work for someone else.

169
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,338
That he'd start an agency for me
if I wanted.

170
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,757
So I apologized and turned them down.

171
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,301
Oh, dear.

172
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,803
But why do your ears look
particularly red today?

173
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,054
Am I imagining it?

174
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:56,851
Right. Your lie was
way over the top today.

175
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,312
Were you that upset?

176
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:03,191
That's because my life is
on a different level compared to you.

177
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,609
It's difficult to comprehend.

178
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,487
Can't you just be happy for her?

179
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,322
Seriously. Be a man.

180
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,824
I'm totally happy for her.

181
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,745
I'm so, so very happy for you.
So very happy.

182
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,498
Aren't you going to buy dinner
to celebrate this happy day?

183
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,415
Sure. Okay.

184
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,293
Dinner tonight is on me.
What should we have?

185
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,836
Ask the youngest. Sam.

186
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,589
Why me again?
She's buying. Make her order.

187
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:27,965
Stop ordering me around.

188
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,510
You'll continue serving
peeled shrimp at the cafeteria

189
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,471
despite knowing how
children are exploited preparing them?

190
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,556
What? What was that?

191
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,016
What's wrong with him?

192
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,059
What is it this time?

193
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:42,230
Children in Southeast Asia
are being exploited to peel shrimp,

194
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,106
so he's protesting peeled shrimp.

195
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,568
He got two refills of shrimp
at the cafeteria two days ago.

196
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,987
Poor children are being exploited

197
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:54,242
working 16 hours a day
just for our brief convenience.

198
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:57,411
Why is it so hard to remove shrimp
from the menu?

199
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,289
I'll take this up
with the university president.

200
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,876
What? Do I want to end up
like a shrimp in a tuna net?

201
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,796
It's dolphins, not shrimp,
that get caught in a tuna net.

202
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:08,965
Hello?

203
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,638
How could she come to my school?

204
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,306
It's Se-wan, a business major.

205
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,308
We're fashion majors. Sorry.

206
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,351
I see. I'm sorry.

207
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,979
Excuse me. Have you seen her before?

208
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,438
Park Se-wan, a business major.

209
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,606
He's my brother.

210
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,483
I'm showing him the school.

211
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,068
He's cute, isn't he?

212
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,320
It's Han Hyun-min.

213
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,489
Do you know Han Hyun-min?

214
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,949
-Sorry, I don't.
-Okay.

215
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,951
-What's he doing here?
-Excuse me.

216
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,953
-Damn it.
-Do you know Han Hyun-min?

217
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,257
-What the…
-What the…

218
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,221
He must be gone.

219
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,056
What is it? Who's following you?

220
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,434
Is a creditor after you too?

221
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,561
What do you mean, creditor?

222
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,856
But then again, he's a creditor of love.

223
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,942
-It's my mom's boyfriend.
-Your mom's boyfriend?

224
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,902
Didn't she go on a trip with him?

225
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,487
That's her current boyfriend.

226
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,614
He's her ex-boyfriend.

227
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,617
Why is her ex-boyfriend here
looking for you?

228
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,910
Exactly. That's why I'm going insane.

229
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,371
Ever since they broke up
and she got a new boyfriend,

230
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,791
he has been calling every day,
saying he wants her back.

231
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,377
I stopped answering his calls,
so he came to the school.

232
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,713
My mom is driving me nuts.

233
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,965
Your family is a mess too.

234
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,636
Other parents help their kids.
What's wrong with us?

235
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,055
It's their problem.
Tell him to take it up with her.

236
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,848
You don't know Mr. Crane.

237
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,309
He's so obsessive.

238
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,393
"Mr. Crane"?

239
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,271
When he started dating my mom,
he folded 10,000 paper cranes

240
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,065
with a love note in each one.

241
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,859
He's such a big romantic
that he's obsessive too.

242
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,402
Your family has issues too.

243
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,238
Why is your mom's ex-boyfriend
bugging you?

244
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,574
Let's go.

245
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,414
What if he ends up coming to the dorm?

246
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,918
If I'm caught living here with my brother…

247
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,002
Don't you start.

248
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,297
I can just commute from Icheon again.

249
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,965
I'm just worried about you.

250
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,175
I'm going to kill you.

251
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,930
Hey. I keep farting.

252
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,598
Hey. No. Don't.

253
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,434
-I really need to go. Take him.
-I have to get to class.

254
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,853
-Se-wan…
-Hey, you prick!

255
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,648
I'm going to leave him here.
I'm going to abandon him!

256
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,109
What? Are you abandoning your baby?

257
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,318
My gosh.

258
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,196
How could you do that?
Even wild animals don't do that.

259
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,781
You'll be punished.

260
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,367
I am not. He's not my baby.

261
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,745
-What's she saying?
-Kids these days are scary.

262
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,122
You shouldn't do that.

263
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,541
Where's the dad? Did he run away?

264
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,251
You're still so young. Poor thing.

265
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,752
Looks like you've had it tough.

266
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,087
That's not it.

267
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,673
This is my friend's brother.

268
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,758
I'm sorry.

269
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,636
He must be crying because he's hungry.
Breastfeed him or something.

270
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,680
I'm not his mom!

271
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:03,764
What are you--

272
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,433
Sorry. Oh no.

273
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,644
Hyun-min!

274
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,530
Thank you for coming to read it.

275
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,574
Do you know Park Se-wan?

276
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,200
Anyone who's a business major?

277
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,618
Do you know Park Se-wan?

278
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,079
-She came all the way here?
-This is what happened.

279
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:45,139
I'm looking for Park Se-wan.
Please read my story.

280
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,432
I'm hurting so much.

281
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,475
Whatever!

282
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,561
I've cut ties with our stupid family,
so you pay your own debts!

283
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,773
I wish the world would
come to an end tomorrow.

284
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:57,026
There are many times
I wish it'll all end at once.

285
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,366
What?

286
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,744
What are the guards doing?

287
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,662
How could they let just anyone come in?

288
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,499
She was doing that
in front of the lecture hall.

289
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:15,211
So, the student's mom borrowed money
and is avoiding her,

290
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,338
so she's demanding money
from the daughter?

291
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,672
Students have no money.

292
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:19,590
Exactly.

293
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:23,010
Her mom's the one who borrowed the money.
Why are they bothering her?

294
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,345
I really don't get it.

295
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,222
Is this normal in Korea?

296
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,850
Well, families can't turn their backs
on each other completely.

297
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,353
But the problem is that her mom

298
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,939
let her creditor
come to her daughter's school.

299
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,524
You should be grateful

300
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,401
that you're the son of a world star
like Barbara Houston.

301
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,653
You're lucky.

302
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,071
Someone may hear you.

303
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,197
Right.

304
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:52,456
Hello? I'll come out right now.
Send down the guards.

305
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,707
ASK YOUR "DISPICABLE" MOM FOR MY MONEY

306
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,376
PEELED SHRIMP!

307
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,339
It's cold out. Do you want some of this?

308
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:04,093
No. I'm doing this for little children
who are being exploited.

309
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,886
I should endure the pain.

310
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,849
It was humiliating by myself.
It's nice to have company. Thank you.

311
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,433
Sure. Me too.

312
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,770
But "despicable" is spelled
d-e-s with an "e,"

313
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,689
not d-i-s with an "i."

314
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,816
It's "e" instead of an "i."

315
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:22,069
As in "disagree."

316
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,195
Really?

317
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,532
You can't do that here, ma'am.
Please leave.

318
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,451
I just need to see Se-wan.

319
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,828
Please, sir.

320
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,707
What are you waiting for? Escort her out.
You can't do this here.

321
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,292
What are you doing here?

322
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,295
Ban peeled shrimp from the cafeteria!

323
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,171
-I just need to see Se-wan.
-Ban peeled shrimp!

324
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,756
Se-wan!

325
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,133
-Se-wan--
-You're so mean.

326
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,801
What did Se-wan do wrong?

327
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:47,845
Who are you? Are you her friend?

328
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,431
She has a tough life as it is.
Must you do this?

329
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:53,726
She works several jobs and is an RA
at the international students dorm.

330
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,896
-Stop harassing her.
-What? International students dorm?

331
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,564
Hey. Don't just stand there.

332
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,274
Escort her out.

333
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,191
What was that?

334
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,737
Ban them!

335
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,620
It's like a buffet.

336
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,996
You ordered all of this?

337
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,123
Is Minnie really paying for all of this?

338
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,334
Are you insane?
What do you think you're doing?

339
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:22,713
What else? That petty punk
wanted to screw you over.

340
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:23,839
SamSam.

341
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,967
Must you really go this far?

342
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,053
You're so petty.

343
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:32,514
Why? What do you mean?
She should buy this much. Right, Minnie?

344
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,225
How much is all of this?
I can't afford this!

345
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,978
You're a trainee now.
This is a cause for a celebration.

346
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,563
Your dream came true.

347
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,650
Someone as cool as you
wouldn't order a few pieces of chicken

348
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,902
and say you're treating us, would you?

349
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:48,155
Looks like our youngest
really did it this time.

350
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:50,491
And I'm really happy this time.

351
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,618
-Sorry.
-Enjoy!

352
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,203
-Wait, sir.
-Yes?

353
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,663
Her.

354
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:57,456
She will pay.

355
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,457
You son of a bitch.

356
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,542
Watch your language. How dare you?

357
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,753
Excuse me. I guess you didn't hear.

358
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:05,422
Everything you ordered is free.

359
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,257
What? What do you mean?

360
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,550
Really?

361
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,302
Everything is free? Why?

362
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:15,641
You won our delivery app's promotion,
"Find the 1,000th golden dish."

363
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:19,061
The 1,000th order we receive today
is entirely free.

364
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,771
For real? This is great!

365
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,523
What do you mean?

366
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:26,360
You wouldn't have won
if you had ordered one less dish,

367
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:30,239
but the person who placed the order
was really lucky.

368
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,448
Congratulations.

369
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,866
-Wait!
-What?

370
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,410
You can't count them separately.

371
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,495
It was one order,
so it should count as one.

372
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:37,746
-Enjoy.
-No way!

373
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,248
Thanks for the feast, Minnie.

374
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,792
You've been so lucky lately.

375
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,210
Thank you.

376
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,795
Eat up. Enjoy.

377
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,715
How is it thanks to Minnie?
I placed the order.

378
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:48,841
There he goes again.

379
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,843
Minnie was going to treat us,
so it's on her.

380
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,386
You petty brat.

381
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,931
You were punished
because you were being so petty.

382
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,851
What did I do? You're the one
who made me place the order.

383
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,020
Hold on.

384
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,396
Hey, Sam.

385
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:06,233
You know I'm fighting the school
because of peeled shrimp

386
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,152
that exploit little children.

387
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:12,239
So how could you order a shrimp dish?

388
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,282
You jerk.

389
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,493
Why is everyone picking on me?

390
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,995
What did I do?

391
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,000
Give it a rest. You'll make him cry.

392
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:26,628
I'm not crying!
Why is everyone picking on me?

393
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,631
Sleep, sleep my baby

394
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,385
Sleep, sleep my baby

395
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:37,181
Sleep, sleep my baby

396
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:40,851
Excuse me. This is
the international students dorm, right?

397
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:41,769
Do you live here?

398
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,188
Yes. Are you looking for someone?

399
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:48,150
I am… So, I'm Park Se-wan's

400
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:49,651
mom's--

401
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,487
What? You're Se-wan's mom?

402
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:54,740
Hello.

403
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,367
I'm Carson, Se-wan's roommate.

404
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,245
This is Se-wan's bed.

405
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,414
She must be at work. She'll be here soon.

406
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,209
I appreciate it, but who are you?

407
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,835
I'm Hyun-min. I'm her friend.

408
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,296
I'm her closest friend here.

409
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,965
You can say we share a common fate.

410
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,553
Then is that baby Se-wan's?

411
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,597
No. Gosh, no.

412
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,057
It's nothing like that.

413
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,936
Se-wan is the spitting image of you.

414
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,395
She's right.

415
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,898
Once Se-wan comes,
let's go out and eat together.

416
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,235
Se-wan. You're back.

417
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,528
Why were you in there?

418
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,404
Hey. Your mom's here.

419
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,364
What?

420
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,701
It reminds me of when I was in school.

421
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,953
It was different though.

422
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:41,870
What's going on?

423
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,913
My goodness.

424
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,499
Let go.

425
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,835
Where's your mom?

426
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,921
Where is she? Spill it.

427
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,882
I've cut ties with my mom long ago.

428
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,342
Why are you bugging me?

429
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,594
Look at her. She's playing dumb.

430
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,972
She picked up all the bad habits
from her mom.

431
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:03,183
What do you mean? I'm not playing dumb.

432
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,270
Why are you telling me
to pay back my mom's debt?

433
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:09,022
Did I ask you for money?
Do you think I want to do this?

434
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:12,192
Your mom won't take my calls.
I'm frustrated because she's avoiding me!

435
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,069
Then what about me?

436
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,196
Must you do this at my school?

437
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,782
You're both adults. Leave me out of this!

438
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,701
Why are you… Gosh!

439
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,789
What did I do wrong?

440
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,624
Go tell your mom.

441
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,586
If she doesn't pay me back,
I'll keep coming back to harass you.

442
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,004
Got that?

443
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,047
Look at her making her daughter suffer.

444
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,842
To think I considered her a friend…

445
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,559
How did she get in here?

446
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,812
Hyun-min brought her in,
saying she was your mom.

447
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,106
She was looking for you out front.

448
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,610
How did she know I lived here?

449
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,486
Who told her? Was it you?

450
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:00,157
No. She was asking for you
in front of the door, so I let her in--

451
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,491
Why did you? Why?

452
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,036
Hey, you made him cry.

453
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,580
If I get kicked out, you're dead too.
We share a common fate.

454
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:07,998
-Why you little…
-Hey.

455
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,672
Se-wan! We're in trouble.

456
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,008
What? What trouble are we in this time?

457
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,052
Mr. Crane is outside.

458
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,638
-He came to the dorm.
-What?

459
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,848
I didn't see him yesterday,
so I thought he left.

460
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:25,766
What do I do?

461
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:28,060
I'll be caught for sure.

462
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,811
I'm so pissed off.

463
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,980
It's one after the other.

464
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,482
I'm really sorry.

465
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,485
I can just go back to commuting
five hours from Icheon.

466
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,654
I'm just worried about you.

467
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,616
Why did I associate myself with you?

468
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,662
There's no one by that name here.

469
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,873
This dorm is for foreigners.
There are no Korean students here.

470
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,333
No.

471
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,961
They said he lived in this dorm.

472
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,505
Mister. I think I know
the student you're looking for.

473
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,299
-Do you?
-Yes.

474
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,594
He doesn't live here. Come with me
and I'll tell you where he lives.

475
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:03,762
Okay.

476
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,224
Where are we going?

477
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,017
Let's talk off campus.

478
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:12,980
What is she doing?

479
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,439
Who is that?

480
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,650
Is he another creditor?

481
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,071
Mister.

482
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,366
It's of no use
even if you come to see Hyun-min.

483
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:28,036
It isn't up to him.
He can't change how his mom feels.

484
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,082
Please, don't cry.

485
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,841
I just don't understand.

486
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,678
My heart is breaking, that's why.

487
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:49,141
We got back from our trip
not that long ago.

488
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:55,105
We were so happy.
Why does she want to break up?

489
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:59,818
How could love change so quickly?

490
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,528
I refuse to break up.

491
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,905
Doing this won't change anything.

492
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,992
If you really believe it's love,
you should let go

493
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,202
and wish her well.

494
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,039
I'll be better.

495
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,124
If I did something wrong, I'll fix it.

496
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,376
So please--

497
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,753
Still, there's no use.

498
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,214
Feelings have changed. It's over already.

499
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:24,301
We started it together.
So we have to end it together.

500
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,553
I refuse to end it!

501
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:27,846
If you keep this up,

502
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,849
all the good memories will disappear too!

503
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,642
Is that what you want?

504
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,019
No, I don't.

505
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,437
Exactly.

506
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:39,608
So cherish the beautiful memories,
and find someone better.

507
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,027
Don't come to the school again.

508
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:46,156
If you do this again,
I'll call the police. Okay?

509
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,910
No. What am I supposed to do then?

510
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,620
Please stop.

511
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,829
-Please.
-Listen to me.

512
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:53,747
Listen to what?

513
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,125
Let go of her. She said no!

514
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,170
Forcing yourself onto someone
like this is assault.

515
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,255
Let's go.

516
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,590
No. Don't go.

517
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,175
Don't go!

518
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,345
Don't go!

519
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:09,429
Let go. Hey.

520
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,597
Hey. Let go.

521
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,141
What's your problem?

522
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,685
I tried to ignore it
because you said to butt out,

523
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,104
but this is too dangerous.

524
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,063
What?

525
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,564
What's dangerous?

526
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,109
This much obsession is violence.
It's not love.

527
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,361
Obsession? Violence?

528
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,154
What are you talking about?

529
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,949
Hey. How did it go? Where is he?

530
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:32,494
I was stern and made it clear to him,
so he won't come to you again.

531
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,829
Thank God.

532
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,288
What do you mean?

533
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,624
Then is he after Hyun-min?

534
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:38,917
What? What is it?

535
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,088
What are you thinking?

536
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:46,133
That man isn't my boyfriend.
He's my mom's ex-boyfriend.

537
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,175
Your mom's ex?

538
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,760
What did you think he was?

539
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,680
Well, I thought he was your ex-boyfriend.

540
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:52,764
What?

541
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:53,974
That old man? My…

542
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,142
-Why you…
-Hey. Sorry.

543
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:58,270
-That's how it looked. Sorry.
-Hey, you. Get over here.

544
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,438
Hey! You're dead.

545
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,397
Get back here!

546
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,566
What's wrong with them?

547
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:07,904
I'm back.

548
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,531
-Hey.
-Hi.

549
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,824
What? You're back early.

550
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:13,243
Doesn't your training start today?

551
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:14,744
I quit the agency.

552
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:15,912
-What?
-On your first day?

553
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,457
I can't go online
and I can't eat anything I want.

554
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,083
I can't live like that.

555
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,169
And once I start preparing for my debut,

556
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,795
I'll have to quit school as well.

557
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,131
I didn't come to Korea to become a singer.

558
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,133
And the deal breaker was

559
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,093
they said no dating allowed.

560
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:34,764
I see. No dating really is unacceptable.

561
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,016
Especially for you.

562
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,018
Consider it a good experience.

563
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,478
Isn't it a waste though?

564
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,313
It's not easy to get into an agency.

565
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:46,151
Ta-da! I got the numbers
of all the hot guy trainees.

566
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,819
SamSam was so jealous.

567
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,529
He'll be elated to hear you quit.

568
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,448
You're right. Where is he, anyway?

569
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,074
I haven't seen him all day.

570
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,585
I'll be reborn.

571
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:07,297
Goodbye, petty, narrow-minded brat.

572
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:10,509
I'll be reborn as a thoughtful,
magnanimous Sam,

573
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,846
who never gets jealous, envies others,
lies, or bluffs.

574
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,267
I wasn't sleeping!

575
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,393
I really wasn't!

576
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,561
That's not it.

577
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,481
Your lotus position is terrible.

578
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:29,486
What's wrong with my form?
Why are you picking on me?

579
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:34,824
Look at him.
Even that Westerner has a perfect form.

580
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,743
Why is a Korean so…

581
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,370
I'm not Korean.

582
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,247
I'm an Australian citizen.

583
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,500
But most Asians have good form.

584
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:46,127
No. Wait a second. This is discrimination.

585
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,880
And it's not that I'm doing it wrong.

586
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:52,217
This is how it's actually done.
Have you been to the Shaolin Temple?

587
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,761
I did the best lotus position there.

588
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,972
Even when I went to India,

589
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,641
as soon as I sat in the lotus position,

590
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,936
people would lose their minds
and say I looked so cool.

591
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,855
That I sat exactly the same way
the Buddha sat.

592
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,947
Why is she back?

593
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:15,699
Damn it.

594
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,164
Miss.

595
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,292
Hey.

596
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,044
-Hi, Se-wan.
-Why are you here again?

597
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,880
-Why are you doing this to me?
-That's not it.

598
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:33,842
I'm not here to see you. Don't worry.

599
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,176
Then why are you here?

600
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:36,803
Over here!

601
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,471
Are you hungry?

602
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,181
Yes. I skipped dinner to wait for you.

603
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,391
My goodness.

604
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:44,352
Thank you for taking such an interest
in my campaign.

605
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,645
Of course.

606
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,315
Let's go get something to eat
and talk over dinner.

607
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,399
Okay.

608
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:51,776
What should we have?

609
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,278
Have you heard of fläsklägg?

610
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,196
-No, never.
-My grandfather loved it.

611
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,531
What the hell was that?

612
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,248
I went out with an old man like that?

613
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,669
How could he think that?

614
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,379
I'm speechless.

615
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:15,592
Who does he think he is to butt in?

616
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:17,636
That twerp.

617
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,348
Let go of her.

618
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:22,766
She said no!

619
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,685
Forcing yourself onto someone
like this is assault.

620
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:27,771
Let's go.

621
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,524
Why is my heart racing?

622
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,039
He recently came from the US,
and his admission process was suspicious.

623
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,540
Detective.

624
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:51,836
That student would never do drugs.

625
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:53,588
I guarantee it.

626
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,215
How can you guarantee it?

627
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:57,217
Do you know him that well?

628
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,803
You're not getting me.

629
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,389
Anyway, what about the other kids?

630
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:05,600
This student.

631
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,395
I was undercover,
watching them for a few days,

632
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,480
and the things he does are not normal.

633
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:14,109
I think he is at least an addict.

634
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:48,184
