1
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:27,444
Seriously!

2
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,738
Seriously! Stop being ridiculous.

3
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,489
It's mine, so I'm going.

4
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:32,949
How is it yours?

5
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,452
You don't even have a girlfriend
to sleep there with.

6
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,955
If I line up the girls who want me,
it would be like the Great Wall.

7
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,332
Gosh, you're so noisy.
What is it this time?

8
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,669
I entered a contest
for a mobile shopping app and won.

9
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:48,214
A free stay at a new six-star hotel
that just opened.

10
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,884
But he keeps insisting it's his.

11
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,302
Let's get this straight.

12
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:55,513
You didn't win, I did. It was my user ID.

13
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:56,639
You used his user ID?

14
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,434
Yes. You had to be a new member to enter.

15
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:00,935
I was already a member.

16
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:05,315
Still, I created an ID for him
and entered, so it's mine.

17
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,524
It's a tough call.

18
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,693
They both have a right to claim it.

19
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:12,781
-Let me take back one move.
-Sell it online and split the proceeds.

20
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,284
Did my janggi opponent go somewhere?

21
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,870
You need to prove your identity
to stay there.

22
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,206
Neither of you are willing to give in.

23
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,333
Then you two can go together.

24
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,460
Are you stupid? Why would I go with him?

25
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,254
Gross. I don't want to go with you either.

26
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:33,426
How about whoever brings someone
to spend the night with by check-in wins?

27
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,095
-I'm in.
-Me too.

28
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:38,098
I say the two of them
will sleep together tomorrow.

29
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,307
Look.

30
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,225
What?

31
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,644
It's raining but I don't have an umbrella.

32
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,145
-Hey.
-Wait.

33
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,522
What happened here?

34
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,817
Really? Do you want to
get beat up on a rainy day?

35
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,235
Wait.

36
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,696
Hey. Let's play janggi.

37
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,116
I have to go to the library.

38
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,826
I have a book that's due today.

39
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,082
Good night.

40
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,458
SEOM, JEJU STORY
PREMIUM BLACK PORK FROM JEJU

41
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,211
-Jamie.
-Se-wan.

42
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,504
What are you doing here?

43
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,381
I was out for a walk.

44
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,050
In the rain?

45
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,971
Well, I love the rain.
What are you doing here?

46
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,681
What else? I was working.

47
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,432
You work here?

48
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,767
What the heck?

49
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:25,687
You fainted because you had to poop
while working here.

50
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,105
Don't you remember?

51
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,648
Yes. That's right.

52
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:31,276
I just followed you around,
so I don't remember much.

53
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,486
Are you heading back?
We can share my umbrella.

54
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:35,947
I have my own.

55
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,497
Why do you have such a big umbrella?

56
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,833
Is it a convenience store parasol?

57
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,085
No. I brought it from the States.

58
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,547
Chill out. Just kidding, okay?

59
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,048
It was a joke.

60
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,425
Hey, you go ahead.

61
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,384
Why?

62
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:59,095
I have to stop by
the convenience store. Bye.

63
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:08,354
Hey! Jamie! I'm so glad I ran into you!
Are you heading back?

64
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,064
Yes. You can share my umbrella.

65
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:14,611
Goodness gracious. Why is it so big?

66
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,404
Were you picking someone up?

67
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,947
No. Of course, not.

68
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,743
Then how were you waiting here
right on time?

69
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:26,497
Hold on. You and Se-wan…

70
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,582
What about her?

71
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,752
Did Se-wan teach you to charge me

72
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:34,047
for sharing this umbrella with you?

73
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,340
I'm leaving.

74
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,051
Hey! I'm only kidding! It was a joke!

75
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,221
Minnie said she's never played
janggi before,

76
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,932
but she beat me in five minutes.

77
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:48,144
-You want something delicious?
-What? What is that strange sight?

78
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,271
-Come on.
-He was going to the library. Why…

79
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:53,524
Wait. Did he go to pick up Carson?

80
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,614
Hey, Jamie.

81
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,407
Did you make it to the library okay?

82
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,367
I saw everything.

83
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:03,743
What?

84
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,829
Come now. Don't play dumb.

85
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,623
I know who you like.

86
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,042
You went to pick her up with an umbrella.

87
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,919
You little American lovebird.

88
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,212
That's not--

89
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:17,215
But why did it have to be a girl
who has a boyfriend?

90
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,508
What? She has a boyfriend?

91
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,718
Sergeant Kim. That's Carson's boyfriend.

92
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,262
I see. Carson.

93
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,805
I don't like her.

94
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,598
No?

95
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,642
Who did you think I meant?

96
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:28,893
Is it someone else?

97
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:30,853
Minnie?

98
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,067
-Se-wan?
-Yes, it's Carson.

99
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,028
I didn't know she had a boyfriend.

100
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:39,946
Gosh.

101
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,364
It's okay.

102
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,741
-It's not like they're married.
-What?

103
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,702
Love is something you fight for.

104
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,078
Just my two cents.

105
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,622
After giving up on Ju-ri,

106
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,666
I realized I was the idiot for losing her.

107
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:55,211
A man shouldn't back down
once he starts something.

108
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,755
Hey. That's not right.
She has a boyfriend.

109
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,257
I should move on.

110
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:02,593
I'll go now.

111
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,138
But this is your room.

112
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,640
What a shy kid.

113
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,435
Should I help him?

114
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,354
NEXT DAY

115
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,567
Are you busy tonight?

116
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,235
Let's all have dinner together.

117
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,321
Out of the blue? What's up?

118
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,741
Well, it may be a special night
for somebody.

119
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,163
What are you up to now?

120
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,581
Spill it. What is it?

121
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,207
I'm not telling.

122
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,336
-Why, you…
-Jamie will suspect me if you know.

123
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,338
Damn it.

124
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,922
Jamie? What is it?

125
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,883
Don't let him know that you know.

126
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,344
He's too shy to say anything.

127
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,138
I need to arrange a casual setting--

128
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,973
Hyun-min, move out.

129
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,350
What? What do you mean?

130
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,019
What do you think?
I'm moving back into the dorm.

131
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:54,937
Hey, you…

132
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,856
What's with him now?

133
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,317
-Anyway, see you tonight.
-Hey, wait.

134
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,696
What's this? What is that jackass
up to now?

135
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,741
He's awfully suspicious.

136
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,789
Why are you suddenly moving back?
Did something happen?

137
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,833
What else could happen to me
other than breaking up with Ju-ri?

138
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:19,253
What? You stole the girl
your friend liked,

139
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,546
so you should be happy.

140
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,256
I tried,

141
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,384
but this is just wrong.

142
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,136
Why? What did she do?

143
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,014
I know she's kind of unique,
but she has her charm.

144
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,808
Yes, she has charm.

145
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,810
She's unique. I like that. But--

146
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,269
Apologize and make up.

147
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,688
It's natural to fight
when you live together.

148
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:43,277
No. I won't be treated like
I'm worse than a dog.

149
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,530
Whatever. Just move out.

150
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,533
Damn it.

151
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,993
I finally got used to it here.

152
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,329
What can I do?

153
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,999
Should I beg Ju-ri?

154
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,296
Terris isn't eating or drinking.

155
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:03,589
He's miserable.

156
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,676
I'm used to guys having a hard time
after breaking up with me.

157
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,803
It doesn't even faze me.

158
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:12,056
Still. Don't you want to make up with him?

159
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,642
He still loves you a lot

160
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,310
and seems to be repenting.

161
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,022
Your puppy is so cute.

162
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,400
May I touch it?

163
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,943
Sure. Okay.

164
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,407
Sibelhomme.

165
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,075
What? Did you just curse at me?

166
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,493
No.

167
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,288
Him. My baby's name is Sibelhomme.

168
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,623
But that sounds like a profanity.

169
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,917
It's French.

170
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,503
"Si," as in such.

171
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,256
"Bel," as in beautiful and handsome.

172
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,508
"Homme," as in man.

173
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,844
Si bel homme.

174
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,138
A beautiful and handsome man.

175
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,681
It means "pretty boy."

176
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,683
I see.

177
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:57,852
Sibelhomme.

178
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,312
You're adorable.

179
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,357
Oh, my. He hated Terris.

180
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,193
He must like you a lot.

181
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,737
This sweet puppy hated Terris?

182
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,821
Why?

183
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:12,867
Actually, Sibelhomme is the reason
we broke up.

184
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,873
Choose. Is it the dog or me?

185
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:20,958
Don't call him a dog.

186
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,835
He has a name.

187
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:23,961
Yes, Sibelhomme.

188
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,422
Which will it be, Sibelhomme or me?

189
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,300
Sorry.

190
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,636
Sibelhomme is like a brother to me.

191
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,847
Goodbye, Terris.

192
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,894
That damn dog.

193
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:44,440
Terris said he was treated
worse than a dog.

194
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,816
I guess it was true.

195
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:50,446
Still. A person is slightly more important
than a dog.

196
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,867
If it's necessary, you can give him away…

197
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:58,120
He's like family to me.
I've been with him for three years.

198
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,123
I can't dump him for
a boyfriend of three weeks.

199
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,333
I see.

200
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,335
He doesn't compare.

201
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:11,425
If Terris got along with Sibelhomme
half as well as you did,

202
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,678
we wouldn't have broken up.

203
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:19,517
You must be bored out of your mind
because I didn't take you for a walk.

204
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,143
Why didn't you…

205
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:25,189
Well, I bought a dog-walking dress
through home shopping,

206
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,983
but it didn't fit, so I returned it.

207
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,026
May I take him out for a walk then?

208
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,404
I've always wanted to do that.

209
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,626
Fetch.

210
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,589
Terris and Ju-ri clearly love each other.

211
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,009
They'd be happy together
if it wasn't for Sibelhomme.

212
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,552
If it wasn't for Sibelhomme.

213
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,722
If it wasn't for Sibelhomme?

214
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,641
He's super fast when he goes out
for a walk.

215
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,977
I almost lost him a few days ago.

216
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,771
I can say I lost him while walking him.

217
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,940
Everyone will be happy if he's gone.

218
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:08,899
Everyone.

219
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,070
I'm going to the bathroom.

220
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,781
You have to wait here, okay?

221
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:16,949
Bye now.

222
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,294
How can he be so stupid.

223
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,547
He's really waiting there
because I told him to.

224
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,717
You can keep waiting,
but I can't go to you.

225
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,552
I won't.

226
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,308
Sibelhomme. Where's Sibelhomme?

227
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,478
Sibelhomme! Hey, Sibelhomme!

228
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,147
Sibelhomme! Hey, Sibelhomme!

229
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,524
Sibelhomme! Hey, Sibelhomme!

230
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,069
Sibelhomme! Hey, Sibelhomme!

231
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,905
Sibelhomme! Hey, Sibelhomme!

232
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,324
Sibelhomme!

233
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,950
Sibelhomme!

234
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,122
You brat!

235
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:08,209
I said to wait right here!

236
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,921
I'm sorry. I was so wrong, Sibelhomme.

237
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,466
I must have been crazy.
What was I thinking?

238
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,259
Sibelhomme.

239
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,427
Hey, Sibelhomme!

240
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,845
Sibelhomme!

241
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,600
What? I don't want to go
if Carson will be there.

242
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,268
Please, Hans.

243
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,978
Jamie likes Carson,

244
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,814
so I'm trying to set them up together.

245
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:33,484
But I'm in no position to play Cupid
for someone else.

246
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,903
You play Cupid for me.

247
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,321
Cupid?

248
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,074
As in, help you make them a couple?

249
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,412
As you know, I don't butt in
on other people's business.

250
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,414
That's a very strict rule of mine.

251
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,040
You and your rules again?

252
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,084
You always talk about
how caring Koreans are.

253
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:53,087
You should show your friends
how much you care,

254
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,422
you heartless prick.

255
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,381
AFFECTION

256
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,676
Play Cupid?

257
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,886
I'll think about it.

258
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,475
How could I consider
getting rid of Sibelhomme?

259
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,272
I don't deserve to live comfortably
in the dorm.

260
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,151
It may be tiring,
but I should commute from home.

261
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,325
I was out for a walk.

262
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,954
That was terrible acting.

263
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,416
He's suspicious.

264
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,085
Jamie will suspect me if you know.

265
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,881
What? Does Jamie like me?

266
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,468
Let's go.

267
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,096
Are you heading back?
We can share my umbrella.

268
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,642
Oh my gosh!
I thought he was being suspicious.

269
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:52,188
Then what? He likes me?

270
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,399
Well, it may be a special night
for somebody.

271
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,526
He's too shy to say anything.

272
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,863
I need to arrange a casual setting--

273
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,158
Wait a second. Then, tonight…

274
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:09,413
I asked Hyun-min to arrange this
so that you and I could be alone.

275
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,751
-Please, accept this.
-Gosh.

276
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,587
This is all so sudden.

277
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,714
Se-wan. This comes from my heart.

278
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,425
Please accept it.

279
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:24,845
Hey. I…

280
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,849
I'm not ready yet.

281
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,487
What are you doing?

282
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,113
-Sorry.
-Excuse me.

283
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,449
-Yes. Coming!
-Excuse me.

284
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,208
What do I say to him?

285
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,710
I'm not ready for this.

286
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,172
I really can't do this today.

287
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,094
Se-wan. Where are you going?

288
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,347
Well, I think I should just go.

289
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,306
Don't go.

290
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,601
Hyun-min made me play Cupid.

291
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,937
But that's so not me.
I don't know what to do.

292
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,146
Cupid?

293
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,192
You guys are so alike.

294
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,319
Don't you know that girls
hate this kind of thing?

295
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,779
Don't complain to me.

296
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:24,905
It was Hyun-min's plan.

297
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,740
He just doesn't think.

298
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,909
But you shouldn't egg him on.
This is awkward.

299
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,661
Who knows?

300
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,663
Carson may think Jamie's not so bad.

301
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,415
What do you mean…

302
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,377
-Carson?
-You're her roommate.

303
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,379
How's her love life these days?

304
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,215
Jamie likes Carson?

305
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,383
Didn't you know?

306
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:45,801
I thought you knew.

307
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,345
I do. Of course.

308
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,266
What was I thinking?

309
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,273
Guys. Over here.

310
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:02,318
Now that I see them together,
they do make a cute couple.

311
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,030
Why are you coming together?

312
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:06,989
We met out front.

313
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:11,744
I went to Bukhansan with some girls.

314
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,164
It was nice.

315
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,375
I wanted to have some makgeolli
and acorn jelly…

316
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,461
Your outfit is a bit…

317
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,922
People will stare.

318
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,549
This is really comfortable.

319
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:29,219
Who cares what others think?
As long as I'm comfortable.

320
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,057
Anyway, it's been too long
since we drank together.

321
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,475
I was getting slightly hurt.

322
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,560
Hyun-min is so thoughtful.

323
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,605
He can't make it.
He says he's in no position to butt in.

324
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,149
What? He called us all here
and then he flaked?

325
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,108
It's fine.

326
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,611
Everyone who needs to be here
is here, so let's begin.

327
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:46,862
What do you mean?

328
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,323
What? It's nothing.

329
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,753
Carson. Isn't it hard to wait
for your boyfriend to get discharged?

330
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:05,005
Why don't you see another guy instead?

331
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,173
Why?

332
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,676
Do you know someone
better than Sergeant Kim?

333
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,344
How about someone like Jamie?

334
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,845
Jamie?

335
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,847
He's great, of course.

336
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,766
Girls like guys like him.

337
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,351
For a tough girl like you,

338
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,521
a thoughtful and sensitive guy
like Jamie is perfect.

339
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:21,522
Really?

340
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,233
Hey. Jamie.

341
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,194
What do you think about me?

342
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,737
Stop it, guys.

343
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:32,741
Look at him smile at her.
He's absolutely loving it.

344
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,745
Jamie is beyond sensitive.
He's hypersensitive.

345
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,038
He's super touchy.

346
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,873
It'll drive you crazy.

347
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,709
I'm not like that to my girlfriend.

348
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:45,129
He's right. Jamie isn't the clueless type

349
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,672
who makes life hard for others.

350
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,340
What's going on here?

351
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,801
Are you standing up for him?

352
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,262
Right? You guys really get each other.

353
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,848
You're destined for each other.

354
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,559
What do you say, Carson?
What if Jamie asked you out?

355
00:16:58,767 --> 00:16:59,977
Would you be interested?

356
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,562
That's right.

357
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,690
Just go out. Do it. Be a man. Ask her out.

358
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,402
Right. Go ahead. I'm getting excited.

359
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:11,488
Shouldn't you ask someone out
when you're alone?

360
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,908
My gosh.

361
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,994
Not bad, Jamie.

362
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,789
What's this? I didn't realize
that Jamie was such a tough guy.

363
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,583
What a jerk.

364
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,544
Why did he lead me on if he liked Carson?

365
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,505
Are you leaving?

366
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,050
No. I'm going to the bathroom.

367
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,473
Why did I jump to conclusions like that?

368
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,266
How humiliating.

369
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,227
I'm so pissed.

370
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,688
I took the day off to be here.

371
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,530
What's taking Se-wan so long?

372
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:54,656
Did she go home?

373
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,825
She went to the bathroom. She'll be back.

374
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,118
I'll call her.

375
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,996
Dagnabbit. Kids these days.

376
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,456
Back in my day,

377
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,668
you had to get permission
from your seniors to go to the bathroom.

378
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,961
Why are Minnie and Sam…

379
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,839
That's right. They went to the hotel.

380
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,636
Are you going to keep doing this?

381
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:16,678
Let me have it.

382
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,013
Why should I?

383
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,724
-I brought a girl. You let me have it.
-Excuse me.

384
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,935
How long do I have to be here?

385
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,562
Can I start shooting the hotel
for my review?

386
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,774
Yes, sure. Do whatever you want.

387
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:29,983
Minnie.

388
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:33,237
The last train to Busan is leaving soon.
Please decide quickly.

389
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,572
Fine. Wait.

390
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,075
Hey. We need to talk.

391
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,576
What? We can talk here.

392
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,702
Get over here.

393
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,082
Excuse me.

394
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,293
Do you mind helping me with my shoot?

395
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,212
Yes, of course.

396
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,340
You must have your own channel.

397
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,426
Yes. I'm kind of famous.

398
00:18:57,052 --> 00:19:00,973
Especially for my reviews
of hotels and motels.

399
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,684
I brought a girl! You leave!

400
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,352
Stop embarrassing me.

401
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,354
Then give up.

402
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:08,897
I'm not embarrassed at all.

403
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,692
You had to go all the way to Busan
to find a guy.

404
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,110
Look who's talking.

405
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,862
Look at who you brought.

406
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,406
She's not your girl. As if.

407
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,869
-Hey. Let's shoot for it.
-There's no turning back.

408
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,370
Rock, paper, scissors, say shoot!

409
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:24,621
-Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
-Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!

410
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,334
Hold onto this.

411
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,003
-Look.
-Wow, this is awesome.

412
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,421
Open the door.

413
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,631
-What's going on?
-Let us in!

414
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,592
-Mi-suk!
-What are you doing? It's locked!

415
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,719
-Mi-suk! What's going on?
-Let us in!

416
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:42,347
Se-wan, that brat.
I'll go straighten her out.

417
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,600
I should teach her a lesson.

418
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,685
Go easy on her. Don't kill her.

419
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,605
Jamie.

420
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,858
I'll bow out soon too, so…
You know, right?

421
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,693
Good luck with Carson.

422
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,653
What's wrong with you guys?

423
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:57,988
Stop pushing us together.

424
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,448
I hear you like her.

425
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,701
Hyun-min told me
to help you two get together.

426
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:03,744
What?

427
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,914
You guys really get each other.

428
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,790
You're destined for each other.

429
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,418
Just go out. Do it. Be a man. Ask her out.

430
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,672
-Is that why Se-wan said that?
-Of course.

431
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,424
-She knew too.
-Damn it.

432
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,135
WHY WON'T YOU ANSWER?
WHERE ARE YOU?

433
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,553
PARK SE-WAN

434
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,514
-Se-wan, where are you?
-Hey.

435
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,267
I'll give you one minute.
Get your butt over here.

436
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,061
What? Where are you?

437
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,648
Okay.

438
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,650
Was that Se-wan?

439
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,610
Hans, I don't like Carson.

440
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,862
-What?
-I don't like Carson.

441
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:39,947
Have fun with her.

442
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,492
He doesn't like Carson?

443
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,872
Jamie doesn't like Carson.

444
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,291
Carson likes Jamie. Was that it?

445
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,709
That's right.

446
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,378
I had it mixed up.

447
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,922
Gosh. That could've been bad.

448
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,684
I said one minute. What took you so long?

449
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,936
Sorry. I tried to hurry.

450
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,396
Why?

451
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,691
Was it too hard for you
to leave your love, Carson?

452
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,276
What are you talking about?

453
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,860
Why did you call me here?

454
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,822
To pay for my drinks.

455
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:24,992
You still haven't paid for my phone,
so pay me back with this.

456
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,078
Do I still owe you for that?

457
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,247
Are you calling me unreasonable?

458
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,292
No. Order more if you want.
Anything you want.

459
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,837
You've become generous
since you started dating.

460
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:38,797
I'm not dating.

461
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,507
What? Are you smiling?

462
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,303
Are you happy? Are you so happy
that you're losing your mind?

463
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,221
A little bit?

464
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,643
Did they all leave?

465
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:54,896
Damn it. Those weak little punks.

466
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,443
Just drink. You could use it.

467
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,821
Nice. Hans.

468
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,449
What has gotten into you?
You never pour me drinks.

469
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,159
You always drink by yourself.

470
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,369
Don't stress too much.

471
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:13,248
Just follow your heart. It's okay.

472
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,876
What is?

473
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,670
You've done your best.

474
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:21,381
No one will judge you
for dumping your boyfriend.

475
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,759
What? What are you talking about?

476
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,886
I'm on your side.

477
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,513
It's okay to like Jamie.

478
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,223
I hope you guys end up together.

479
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,351
I like Jamie?

480
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,353
What nonsense is that?

481
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,605
I sincerely wish you guys the best.

482
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,608
However, it's not right to cheat.

483
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,195
That's not right. End it with Sergeant Kim

484
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,781
and then make a fresh start.
So you're not ashamed.

485
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,658
What garbage are you…

486
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,494
SERGEANT KIM

487
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,413
Hello?

488
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,748
Hey, babe.

489
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,501
What? What text?

490
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:02,923
What? I like another guy?

491
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,885
I texted Sergeant Kim
while you were in the bathroom

492
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,261
that you found someone new.

493
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,889
It looked like you felt too bad
to tell him,

494
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,140
so I did it for you.

495
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:16,561
Babe. No. It's not true.

496
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,648
There's this crazy bastard here.

497
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,692
I'll call you back
after I kill this asshole.

498
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,153
You crazy bastard! Stop right there!

499
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:27,823
Who is it?

500
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,454
Why are you ringing the bell
in the middle of the night?

501
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,331
Who are you, ma'am?

502
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,958
-Who are you?
-I live here.

503
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,459
Cut the crap.

504
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:42,087
Everyone who lived here
moved out yesterday.

505
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,339
They moved yesterday? Where to?

506
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,049
How would I know?

507
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:47,551
Why not?

508
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,302
Why would I know that?

509
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:52,389
Of all the random punks
to show up at my door…

510
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,515
My goodness.

511
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,183
Damn it.

512
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,521
Mom.

513
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,314
I'm in front of our Icheon house.

514
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,234
How could you move without telling me?

515
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:08,989
If I didn't pick up, you should've texted!
How could you do this to your son?

516
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,241
What? Jirisan?

517
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,077
It'll take me forever to get there.

518
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,121
How am I supposed to commute to Seoul?

519
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,123
Damn it.

520
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,295
Hello?

521
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,423
Yes, I made the reservation.

522
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:28,383
What?

523
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,927
They all left without paying the tab?

524
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,471
It was 180,000 won?

525
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,974
You'll call the cops on me
if I don't wire the money now?

526
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:40,479
Seriously. What the hell?

527
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,068
You're drinking too much.

528
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,737
It's past midnight. Let's go.

529
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,655
Why? Are you worried?

530
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:55,744
True. Carson drinks like a fish,
so she wouldn't die from this much.

531
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,664
Am I funny?

532
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,626
No. You're cute, that's why.

533
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:03,543
What?

534
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:08,215
Yes, fine.

535
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:12,719
I can be cute too if I wanted.

536
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:15,263
I can baby talk too.

537
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,806
Like this.

538
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,141
-Coming.
-Coming!

539
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,602
No, sit.

540
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:23,104
I can sit by myself.

541
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,275
What has Carson got that I don't have?

542
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,946
I may dress like this
because I'm always working,

543
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,114
but I'm sexy too, if you look carefully.

544
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,079
Okay. I got it, so stop.

545
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,752
You're a real asshole.

546
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:47,963
What? I am? Why?

547
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,590
Did you enjoy making a fool out of me?

548
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:54,261
Why did you have to lead me on like that?

549
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,888
What are you talking about?

550
00:25:56,972 --> 00:26:01,685
When you brought the parasol
when it was raining…

551
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,316
I thought you came to pick me up.

552
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,532
I thought you liked me,

553
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,617
so I was a little excited.

554
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,787
I thought you'd ask me out today,

555
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,540
so I was nervous. How humiliating.

556
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,543
You asshole.

557
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:34,009
If I had asked you out,
would you have said yes?

558
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,844
Not a chance. Are you mad?

559
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,762
I'm never going out with anyone.

560
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,056
Then why were you humiliated?

561
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,976
Why are you upset
that I may like someone else?

562
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:44,436
That's because…

563
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:52,986
Hearing that someone liked me
made me happy, that's why.

564
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:58,908
Because it has been really long
since I've felt that.

565
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,084
Yes?

566
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:09,753
I'm sorry.

567
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,671
Why do you keep pressing that?

568
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,589
I'm sorry.

569
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:25,935
Where am I?

570
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:35,153
Damn it. Se-wan, you idiot.

571
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,871
Damn it. Why did I…

572
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,831
Are you guys awake? Open the door.

573
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:03,181
Here's water and hangover medicine.
Take it and let's go eat.

574
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:07,519
My gosh. You really are thoughtful, Jamie.

575
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,232
Who was that?

576
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,483
Why are you here?

577
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,778
Don't you remember last night?

578
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,739
You have such high tolerance.
Why were you so drunk?

579
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:20,657
What?

580
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,867
LAST NIGHT

581
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,704
Let's just share one room.

582
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,498
I swear I won't touch you. I swear.

583
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:32,502
I don't want to. I can't trust you. No.

584
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,796
It's not like I want to do this.
I have no money.

585
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,132
I need two rooms, please.

586
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,675
-What?
-What?

587
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:39,801
Why are you two here?

588
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:43,054
We couldn't go back to the dorm
because it's after curfew.

589
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,389
Se-wan's plastered.

590
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:45,724
Two rooms?

591
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,811
Thank god that's all that happened.

592
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,488
What is that?

593
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,533
You don't want me,
but no one else can have me.

594
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,161
Either make me yours
or let someone else have me.

595
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,205
I'll make you mine.

596
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,708
Do you expect me to believe that?
You'll say you blacked out.

597
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,209
Were you lied to all your life?

598
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,087
Fine. I'll give you evidence.

599
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,297
Here's my pencil case.

600
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:19,507
Here.

601
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,511
No!

602
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,767
PROPERTY OF PARK SE-WAN

603
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,620
