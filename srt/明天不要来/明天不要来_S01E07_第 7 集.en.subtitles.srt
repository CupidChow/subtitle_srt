1
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:27,777
DAEHAN INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY DORMITORY

2
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:34,909
Two o'clock.

3
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,287
Jeju black pork neck being grilled.

4
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,177
It's delicious.

5
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,971
What if we get caught
because of the smell?

6
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,390
We're in the basement.
Only a dog could smell it.

7
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,309
Right? Who would come here at night?

8
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,394
Why do we have to hide our relationship?

9
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,562
We're not having an affair.

10
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,355
Koreans are old fashioned.

11
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,149
It's awkward to date openly.

12
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,901
And I'm an RA here.

13
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:10,278
People may say that I'm dating
instead of working,

14
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:14,032
or that I show preferential treatment
to one person.

15
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,494
Does that mean we can't go here together?

16
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:18,495
What is that?

17
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,414
An unlimited pass to an amusement park?
Where did you get this?

18
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,209
From our boss. When should we go?
Tomorrow? The day after?

19
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,211
We're not going anywhere.

20
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,712
We should sell them online.

21
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:30,757
Fine. Sell them.
You're so obsessed with money.

22
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,927
Just kidding.

23
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,097
I haven't been there
since my middle school field day.

24
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,015
Should we go in two days
when we both don't have classes?

25
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,644
We should go on a weekday
so that it's less crowded.

26
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:49,109
This is for working hard at your
part-time jobs, studying, and dating.

27
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:50,735
So, here.

28
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,239
What's going on?

29
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,117
What are you two doing here? Are you two…

30
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,785
It's not what you think…

31
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,162
You are so smart.

32
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,081
So we can eat here.

33
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:06,501
If you cook in the kitchen,
the kids will come like wild dogs.

34
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,627
Especially Carson.

35
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:12,340
I'll keep it a secret,
so call me next time, okay?

36
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,515
You made seaweed soup
for your boyfriend's birthday?

37
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,809
Gosh. What a devoted girlfriend.

38
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,603
Don't be too good to guys.

39
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,314
They'll take you for granted
if you do that.

40
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,150
Sergeant Kim's grandmother

41
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,986
made me seaweed soup
on my first birthday in Korea.

42
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,445
It was delicious.

43
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:38,783
So I decided I'd make it for him
on his birthday.

44
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,331
This is the real deal.

45
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,667
It has a deep, traditional flavor.

46
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:51,796
Did Sergeant Kim's grandmother
teach you her recipe?

47
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,550
No. It's an instant soup
that I bought at the convenience store.

48
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,343
What?

49
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,637
You should've said so.

50
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,515
Dagnabbit. It's better than mine.

51
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,060
Sergeant Kim Yeong-cheol
went on leave yesterday.

52
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,228
Didn't he tell you?

53
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,521
What? He went on leave?

54
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:12,275
He said he wouldn't be able to for a while
because of an emergency at work.

55
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,318
That's strange.

56
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,777
Thank you.

57
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,446
CHEONGSOL PENITENTIARY

58
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,488
Let's go.

59
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,284
Why didn't he tell me he was on leave?

60
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,578
Is he…

61
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:29,083
hiding at home
to jump out and surprise me?

62
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,218
Hold the door.

63
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,346
Thank you.

64
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,936
SEAWEED
GLASS NOODLES

65
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,021
It must be someone's birthday there too.

66
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,233
Wait. That hoodie…

67
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,360
It looks so familiar.

68
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,792
-Babe.
-Yes?

69
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,253
Where did you go? I missed you like crazy.

70
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,297
To the market. It's your birthday.
You need to have seaweed soup.

71
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,299
We could've just had them delivered.

72
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,649
I'll make it with beef today.

73
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,025
-The soup?
-Yes, the soup.

74
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,987
Are you going to cook?
Then I want short ribs.

75
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,406
-Got it. Okay.
-And then I'll have you next.

76
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,449
Did you order something?

77
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,659
No, I didn't.

78
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,744
Who is it? We didn't order any--

79
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,621
Babe.

80
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,499
Wait, hear me out.

81
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,711
Why didn't you take my calls? Why?

82
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:55,920
Well…

83
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,005
Let me--

84
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,340
And why is she wearing my hoodie?

85
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,429
The thing is…

86
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,849
-Calm down and listen--
-You asshole!

87
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,687
-Are you okay, babe?
-It's hot.

88
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,938
What's wrong with you?

89
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,607
-Are you hurt? Is it hot?
-Yes.

90
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,692
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,869
Take them down and organize them for me.

92
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,163
Hey.

93
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,831
I'm sorry.

94
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,713
Professor.

95
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,257
Isn't this the Hollywood actress
Barbara Houston?

96
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,885
How did you get a picture with her?
That's so cool.

97
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,720
Jamie?

98
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,180
What are you doing?

99
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,140
Oh, I'm sorry.

100
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:51,184
But isn't that Jamie?

101
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,603
Why was he with--

102
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,854
None of your business.

103
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,190
-You can't tell anyone. Not a word.
-Yes, sir.

104
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,733
We'll be in trouble if this gets out.

105
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,569
It's trouble for you, me,
and the entire school. Got it?

106
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,447
You didn't see a thing.
Erase it from your memory. Okay?

107
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,990
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

108
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,040
Barbara Houston's son, Jamie Houston?

109
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,087
Jamie is Barbara Houston's son?

110
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,559
He was adopted from Korea
when he was five.

111
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,020
It really is Jamie.

112
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,071
Jamie is the son of
a top Hollywood actress?

113
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,826
No way.

114
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:52,954
No.

115
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,381
You didn't kill that prick?

116
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:06,259
You came to Korea for him,
and he cheated on you?

117
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:07,760
What a jerk.

118
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,513
How could he do that to the girl
who supported him during his service?

119
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:11,514
But…

120
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,394
Why didn't you get boneless chicken?

121
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,729
And you should've asked for more radish.

122
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,732
How can you eat chicken right now?

123
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:25,611
I told you. Devotion leads to desertion.
You shouldn't have spoiled him.

124
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,738
Hey! You already had a drumstick.

125
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,198
You can't eat them all.

126
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,284
Others have mouths too,
not just buttholes.

127
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,954
Most people can't eat anything
after being dumped.

128
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,747
She's eating more than usual.

129
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,416
She's a monster.

130
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,668
It's because I feel empty inside.

131
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,629
So? Will you just leave them alone?

132
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,048
Forget it. It's over.
I'll never see him again.

133
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,216
Why is it over?

134
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,260
What about everything you gave him?

135
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:52,972
Hey. What good is it to cling onto someone
when it's over?

136
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,141
Once the love is gone,
it's never coming back.

137
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,852
Tell him to give back
everything you gave him then.

138
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,354
Think about everything
you gave that asshole.

139
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,356
Forget it. I don't want to see him again.

140
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,945
Hey! I was just dumped. Let me eat.

141
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,323
Be nice, will you?

142
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:11,365
Dagnabbit.

143
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,368
Why is she taking it out on me?

144
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,121
She loses it when someone takes her food.

145
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,748
Why is she letting him off?

146
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,875
Right? When someone took her umbrella,

147
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,628
she said she'd crush their bones
into 20,000 pieces.

148
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:24,837
I told you.

149
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:28,549
Carson acts like she has a bad temper,
but she's soft inside.

150
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,218
Shouldn't we do something?

151
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,429
We can't watch our friend
being treated that way.

152
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,973
I told you. We should get revenge for her.

153
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,308
We have to do something!

154
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:39,018
Like tear them apart or something.

155
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,604
Shouldn't we at least take back
the stuff she gave him?

156
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,190
You're right.
Why should he get to keep them?

157
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,609
Let's go tomorrow
and show him what's what, okay?

158
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,944
-I'm in!
-Definitely.

159
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,153
That's too much.

160
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,030
Why are you so upset
about their love life?

161
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,949
It's up to them to date or break up.

162
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,367
Why are you butting in?

163
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,451
I told you.

164
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,119
This is why you have no friends,

165
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,120
you heartless prick.

166
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,123
It's my principle
to stay out of other people's lives.

167
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,083
But it's Carson.

168
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,918
You don't have an aorta of loyalty.

169
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,545
It's iota, not aorta.

170
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:09,882
You know the Lee Moon-sae record
that you lent her? His first album.

171
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:13,261
She lent it to Sergeant Kim.
Did you get it back?

172
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,470
What?

173
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,440
I'm too excited about going
to the amusement park to sleep.

174
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,610
I planned out which rides to go on
and in what order. Want to see it?

175
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,490
I'm too tired. Going to sleep.
See you tomorrow.

176
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,872
Has Jamie been putting on an act
all this time,

177
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,041
while keeping this big secret from me?

178
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:48,671
Why is someone
from the American upper class

179
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,048
hanging out with a nobody like me?

180
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,802
He'll inherit
hundreds of millions of dollars,

181
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,805
but he's working at a restaurant
to pay for my phone.

182
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:00,850
Was all of that an act?

183
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,394
But why?

184
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,732
Where are we going so early?

185
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:11,193
We agreed to go to Sergeant Kim's place.
How could you forget?

186
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,863
That's right.
We're going to get revenge for Carson.

187
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,407
We did. But are you really going?

188
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,242
What do you mean? Of course we should.

189
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,203
I told you. It's wrong
to butt into other people's love lives.

190
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,622
That's what he said.

191
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,915
Why should we? She doesn't want it.

192
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,001
We took an oath
to get revenge for a friend.

193
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,920
We should do it at all costs.
You call yourselves her friends?

194
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:33,215
Since when did you care about loyalty?
You're the biggest traitor.

195
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,926
Revenge? Like hell.
You just want your stuff back.

196
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,428
We said we'd go, so we should.

197
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,347
Where's Minnie?

198
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:42,516
Hello?

199
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,852
There's a special discount on cosmetics.

200
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:47,063
I'll go after I shop, so go ahead.

201
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,649
I'll kill you if you don't come.
You'd better come.

202
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,776
You have Sergeant Kim's address…

203
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,196
Damn it. What happened to Sam?

204
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,200
I feel really sick, guys.

205
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,410
I was puking all night.

206
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,996
Let's go. We'll get medicine on the way.

207
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,790
No, stop. That's not it.

208
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,416
I can't feel my leg.

209
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,085
Look. It won't move.

210
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,671
You coward. Your ears are red.

211
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,214
Stop lying, and let's go.

212
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,633
The two of them look scary enough.

213
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:19,428
Sergeant Kim will be scared,
so don't be scared. Go.

214
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:23,516
Get revenge for Carson on my behalf.

215
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,559
That selfish coward.

216
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,062
I told you that traitor wouldn't go.

217
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,313
When did you say that?

218
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,648
You always say you said it.

219
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,525
Let's go. Off we go.

220
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:44,870
Se-wan!

221
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,960
You got here early. Sorry I'm late.

222
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,044
It's fine.

223
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,088
It was so smart to come on a weekday.

224
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,507
It isn't crowded,
so we can ride everything.

225
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,550
Look.

226
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:01,971
These are always packed,
so we should ride those first.

227
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,141
What's this? Why does this feel
so awkward and distant?

228
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:09,228
Is he really the same Jamie who ate
with me in the storage room?

229
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:15,025
He's smiling on the outside,
but I wonder what he's thinking inside.

230
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,068
Ta-da.

231
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,321
He's all excited.

232
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,573
It's cute.

233
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,324
Why do I feel so betrayed?

234
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,538
Hey. Are you that happy?

235
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,915
You grew up in America.

236
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,334
You must've been
to better amusement parks.

237
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,045
No. I've never been to one.

238
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,422
It's my first time.

239
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,175
Let's go.

240
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,346
My shoelace.

241
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:51,479
Let's go.

242
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:57,860
Come in.

243
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:01,363
I wondered how I should send Carson
her things.

244
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,115
Thank you for coming.

245
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,158
Whatever.

246
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,368
If you borrow something,
you should return it.

247
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,329
Sorry? What do you mean?

248
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,873
You borrowed a Lee Moon-sae album
from her, right?

249
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:11,832
That's mine.

250
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,167
It is?

251
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,169
Would you look for it in here?

252
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,007
I really wanted to try this.

253
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,134
-Go ahead. Help yourself.
-Awesome.

254
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,929
What a nice drone.

255
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,473
I've been wanting to get one.

256
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,642
I've never seen this one. Is it new?

257
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,853
My uncle got it for me
when he went to the States for work.

258
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,355
-Try it out.
-You mean it?

259
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:35,481
Sure.

260
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:39,443
Make yourselves at home
and hang out while I pack Carson's things.

261
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:43,364
Hey. This is Yoon Jong-shin's
limited edition record.

262
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,074
My gosh.

263
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:48,244
I searched all over
Dongmyo Flea Market but couldn't find it.

264
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:52,706
Goodbye, my old love

265
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,126
I'm preparing all day to say goodbye

266
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,754
Let's go to the other side now.

267
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,799
Our safari reservation is coming up,
so let's head there.

268
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,092
-Are you hungry?
-No.

269
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,594
I need to use the bathroom.

270
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,554
Okay.

271
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,310
He has never been
to an amusement park before?

272
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,316
Liar.

273
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,111
How much of it is a lie?

274
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,487
Is anything true?

275
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,240
What does he take me for?

276
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,159
I made him work multiple jobs
and ripped him off.

277
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:33,122
I must've looked like such an idiot,
acting like I had one up on him.

278
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,457
Hey! Se-wan!

279
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,834
Hey. Carson.

280
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,837
-What are you--
-What about you?

281
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,505
Well…

282
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,674
I was…

283
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,134
Are you working here too?

284
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,429
-Yes. Yes, I'm working.
-I see.

285
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,681
-Are you here alone?
-Yes.

286
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:55,144
You didn't follow me
because you were worried, did you?

287
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,104
I'm working.

288
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,522
Okay, then.

289
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,942
I felt frustrated.
I came to get some fresh air.

290
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,153
I see. I understand.

291
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,613
I came without thinking,

292
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,032
but I felt awkward being here alone.

293
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,367
Gosh. This is great.

294
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,827
Right?

295
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,246
Yes, this is great!

296
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,164
Don't come.

297
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,000
Hey. What's wrong?

298
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,209
Hey.

299
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:24,715
-I'm just so happy to see you.
-Okay. I'm happy to see you too.

300
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,468
I need to run to the bathroom.

301
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,261
Okay. Go ahead.

302
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,349
SOFT AND SWEET
COTTON CANDY

303
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,226
Carson? What's she doing here?

304
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,895
That was close.

305
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,897
I can't believe we ran into her here.

306
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,191
You heard, right?
She and her boyfriend broke up.

307
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,192
He cheated on her.

308
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,318
Really?

309
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,946
I had no idea.
So that's why she's here alone.

310
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,406
What do we do? She'll find out.

311
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,658
-Darn it.
-Find out what?

312
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,035
What else? That we're secretly dating.

313
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,205
That's right! I've got you now!

314
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:04,254
I was thankful today

315
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:05,965
Okay.

316
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,591
That's everything.

317
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:13,055
This is so nice. I can't believe
I got to listen to this on a record.

318
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,474
The whole album is good.
You can take it if you'd like.

319
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,475
What?

320
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:19,645
You lent me the Lee Moon-sae album.
It's my token of gratitude.

321
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,271
May I really?

322
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,231
Thank you.

323
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,273
Hey. You.

324
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,567
Let's go, punk.

325
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,363
This is awesome.

326
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,864
It feels so real.

327
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,992
You can have it then. I'm tired of it now.

328
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,785
What? This?

329
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,788
Thank you, bro.

330
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,248
So…

331
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,166
Can I buy this drone in Korea too?

332
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,793
Don't buy one. Just take it.

333
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:43,836
What?

334
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,879
-May I really?
-Sure.

335
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,884
Congratulations, you two.

336
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,386
You make a good couple.

337
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,595
Sorry.

338
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,347
You're feeling down, but…

339
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,807
Why are you sorry?

340
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,392
I'm the one who's sorry.

341
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:02,021
It's your first date,
but I've killed the mood.

342
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,480
I should've just left you.

343
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,065
It's okay. You didn't.

344
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,860
Have fun then.

345
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,194
Don't mind me.

346
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,821
Okay. See you back at the dorm.

347
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,072
Okay.

348
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,282
Carson.

349
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,453
Since you're here anyway,
hang out with us.

350
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:21,081
We'll feel terrible if we left you.

351
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,124
Hang out with us.

352
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,042
Are you sure?

353
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:27,046
What? You didn't get revenge,
but you got gifts from him?

354
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,714
Are you guys nuts?

355
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,507
You call yourselves her friends?

356
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,592
I mean…

357
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:35,012
Sergeant Kim was just so nice.

358
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,305
It just happened.

359
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,182
I wish I had met him sooner.

360
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,767
Why did they have to break up?

361
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,019
I told you. He's a great guy.

362
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,562
He's the real deal.

363
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,773
I called him "bro"
without even realizing it.

364
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,567
But did he really just give these to you?

365
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,945
All you said was, "This is so nice"?

366
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,407
I told you. He's a really great guy.

367
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,159
You should've seen him.

368
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:00,621
Hey. Get your act together,
and pack up everything you got from him.

369
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,331
-We're returning them.
-What?

370
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,042
Do we have to go back just to return them?

371
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,168
Shut up, and let's go.

372
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,920
I'll teach this asshole a lesson.

373
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,882
I told you.
I said Minnie would give us crap.

374
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:15,427
You didn't tell us anything.
Since when did you have that many lines?

375
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,805
Hey! You said you couldn't walk.

376
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,474
It's better now. Look. It's all better.

377
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,184
It was your left leg.

378
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,441
I see. You used to come here
with Sergeant Kim.

379
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:33,529
Yes. When I first came to Korea,
we came here all the time.

380
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,532
We'd hang out in the amusement park
and eat dinner here.

381
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,284
He loved their stir-fried pork.

382
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,744
You must've been down.

383
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,412
Sorry, Carson.

384
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,665
I wanted to finish where we started.

385
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,085
Sort of like a funeral for love.

386
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:53,048
Hey, I'm really okay,
so don't be like that.

387
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,008
You look like you're at a funeral.

388
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,052
That looks good.

389
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,393
Se-wan. Here.

390
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,396
Hey. Are you that clueless?

391
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,732
-This is not the time.
-Why not? She says it's okay. Come on.

392
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,278
Gosh. You guys are so sweet.

393
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,115
When did you first know about us?

394
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,534
I could tell during that group blind date.

395
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,829
The way you tagged along,
and how Se-wan acted.

396
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,498
There are three things you can't hide

397
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,542
no matter how hard you try.

398
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,836
Poverty, a cold,

399
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,796
and love.

400
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,008
One more. Hunger.

401
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,347
What brings you back here?

402
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,682
You know who I am, right?

403
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,185
Carson's best friend.
We met when we visited you.

404
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,187
Yes, Minnie. It's been a while.

405
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:51,064
That's right. Did you get
the key for the handcuffs out?

406
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,150
What? Whatever.

407
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,612
What are you doing, assholes?
Give them back.

408
00:19:58,655 --> 00:19:59,698
Here.

409
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:01,742
Here.

410
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,327
Here.

411
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,411
You can keep them.

412
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:07,372
Also, let me be completely frank.

413
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,457
You really--

414
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,625
Babe, is someone here?

415
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,834
Babe.

416
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,629
So you must be that witch.

417
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,631
-Hey.
-Hello.

418
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:20,344
As a fellow woman, how could you do that?

419
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,054
He was taken.

420
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,139
I'm really sorry about that.

421
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,475
I didn't know this would happen.

422
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,810
What? You're sorry?

423
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,604
-Are you kidding me?
-Oh my.

424
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:33,190
Is that by your nose

425
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,734
a mole or sebum?

426
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:36,735
What?

427
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:41,073
It's a mole. It wasn't there before.
It just showed up.

428
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,951
The clinic director is my cousin.

429
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,786
For real?

430
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,872
The director of Snow White Dermatology is
your cousin?

431
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,250
If I go with you,
will I get a good discount?

432
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,794
A discount? It'll all be free.

433
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,128
Oh my gosh.

434
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,421
Thank you so much.

435
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,882
Ms. Minnie, give me your number.

436
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,134
Don't be so formal.

437
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,636
Let's be friends.

438
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,221
This…

439
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,433
Is this real? This is so cool.

440
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,476
This…

441
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,814
My dad's company gave him this gold toad
when he retired.

442
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,358
Okay. I see.

443
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,944
Why is his dad's retirement gift here?

444
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,781
My gosh. Look at the color.

445
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,450
It's so pretty. This must be jade.

446
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,704
-Yes. It belonged to my late grandmother.
-I see.

447
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,164
My grandmother adored me.

448
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,542
I see.

449
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:35,919
What the hell?

450
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:39,047
He gave the others everything they liked.
Why can't I have anything?

451
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,342
Gosh, this is…

452
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,928
This is really nice.

453
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,638
-Yes, isn't it?
-Yes.

454
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,181
You can take it.

455
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,141
Really?

456
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,353
I ate too much. I'm stuffed.

457
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,188
I'm going to get some fresh air.

458
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,482
Are you going to take a dump?

459
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,192
Seriously. Stop that.

460
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,278
And it's not that I go all the time.

461
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,530
I'm too sensitive to go at all.
Get it straight.

462
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,533
What's with the sudden attitude?

463
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:09,161
I didn't know he could be so cute.

464
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,832
Jamie is really kind and thoughtful.

465
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,668
Look at him leaving us alone
so we could talk.

466
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,920
Punk. What a catch.

467
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:22,007
Anyway, is something wrong?
Did you two fight?

468
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,301
Or is it still awkward being alone
with him?

469
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,012
-Can you tell?
-Totally.

470
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:30,223
You're pretending to look after me
and are sticking by my side.

471
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,435
It's so obvious that you're trying
to keep a distance from him.

472
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,394
Well…

473
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:41,276
I can tell how you're pretending
to be fine too.

474
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:43,570
It's hard, right?

475
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,989
Breaking up with that asshole
Sergeant Kim?

476
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,240
Yes.

477
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,326
Trust me. It's not hard at all.

478
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,496
When I threw the seaweed soup at him,

479
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,873
that asshole thought that girl got hurt

480
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,209
and freaked out and glared at me.

481
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:58,627
Those eyes…

482
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,755
I knew that instant

483
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,508
that our love was over.

484
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,802
I wasn't pissed off.

485
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,679
It was like I had jumped into ice water.

486
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,099
It totally woke me up.

487
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,017
Everything became clear.

488
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,521
That's it?

489
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:20,023
Your love was over, so that's it?

490
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,984
The person you loved lied to you.

491
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,321
-How can you forgive him?
-He didn't lie to me.

492
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,115
Our love ended.

493
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:31,326
Just because it ended,
it doesn't mean that it was all a lie.

494
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,329
When we were in love, we loved sincerely.

495
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,914
That's enough.

496
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,209
I don't get it.

497
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:41,378
When I wanted to come to Korea with him,

498
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,839
I thought my mom would be
completely against it.

499
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:48,051
But she said
it was a once-in-a-lifetime romance,

500
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,344
and to love freely.

501
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,721
She was really cool about it.

502
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,098
As my mom said,

503
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:56,226
that love will remain in my heart forever.

504
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,061
That's good enough.

505
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,399
You guys go ahead.

506
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,443
I'm going to meet up with someone.

507
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,694
Sergeant Kim?

508
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,279
I'll go with you.

509
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,072
What? I can go by myself.

510
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,824
It's just that I'm worried.

511
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,618
Jamie. I'm sorry, but…

512
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,581
I think I should
be there for Carson tonight.

513
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,291
You should go ahead.

514
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,459
Okay.

515
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,836
Be careful. Call me when you get home.

516
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,260
Isn't it funny?

517
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,053
When you think about it,

518
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,640
that asshole stayed the same.
I'm the one that changed.

519
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:39,311
If I hadn't gone with the seaweed soup
to celebrate his birthday,

520
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:42,397
I'd still be in love with him.

521
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,191
Gosh. Dagnabbit.

522
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,818
You said it was over.

523
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,361
Is it not?

524
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,571
I don't know.

525
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:53,116
It's just ridiculous
how it changed overnight.

526
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,577
If I didn't know…

527
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,705
What if I took a time machine
to yesterday morning

528
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:01,333
and knocked the pot off the stove?

529
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,920
Then you'd be lying to yourself.

530
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:09,174
Why? I can do that if I need to.

531
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:13,220
There's nothing I can do
if someone lies to me,

532
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,723
but it's my decision if I lie to myself.

533
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,435
Although I don't know
why someone loves me,

534
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:24,439
I know exactly why I love him.

535
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,484
He stayed by my side, he was thoughtful,

536
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:31,947
he worried that I'd be lonely or scared.

537
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:36,576
Whenever I was tired and felt drained,
he encouraged me.

538
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,037
Then I should hold onto him.

539
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,998
That's what I think.

540
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:45,460
You should be selfish
when it comes to love.

541
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:50,257
Will you hold onto Sergeant Kim?

542
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,801
No. It's over between us.

543
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,053
There's just something
I need to say to him.

544
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,684
Then you should go by yourself.

545
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,437
-Good luck.
-Oh, okay.

546
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,064
-I'll go then.
-Okay.

547
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,858
Bye.

548
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,280
Gosh. Thank you for today, Sergeant Kim.

549
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,364
Same here.

550
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,032
I had fun, bro.

551
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:16,950
Me too.

552
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,536
Good night, sis.

553
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,748
I'll see you then.

554
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,501
Okay. I'll book it and call you.
Text me when you get home.

555
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,461
Thank you for coming over.

556
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:29,504
Come again.

557
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:30,422
This way.

558
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,134
What are you guys doing here?

559
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,473
Carson. Well…

560
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:44,644
They came to pick up your things.
Don't get the wrong idea.

561
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:45,770
Whatever.

562
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,398
I came to tell you something
for the last time.

563
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,443
I'm not here to vent or beg,
so you can relax.

564
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:53,778
Okay, go ahead.

565
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,990
You fell in love with another girl?

566
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,575
Sure. It can happen.

567
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:02,537
But you should've ended it with me first.

568
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:05,874
It's disrespectful toward me
to two-time me like that.

569
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:09,711
So, let me hit you just once.

570
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:58,051
Yes. When I get confused,
I should think only about myself.

571
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:59,386
I'll be strictly selfish.

572
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:03,640
If I hadn't seen that picture yesterday,

573
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:06,434
the Jamie from that picture
wouldn't exist.

574
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,354
I never saw that picture.

575
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,565
Until one day,
when it's okay for me to know…

576
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,403
Until you tell me everything,

577
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:22,117
you are just the clueless,
bumbling idiot that I know.

578
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:25,620
Jamie.

579
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,580
Se-wan. What about Carson?

580
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,498
Well…

581
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:34,129
It felt weird tagging along
since she was going to see Sergeant Kim.

582
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,380
See? I was right.

583
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,635
Sorry. It was our first date…

584
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,138
Don't be. I still had fun,

585
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:44,931
but you had to console Carson.

586
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,235
Let's go.

587
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,113
We can go to the amusement park
another time.

588
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:04,242
Sure. Let's put on a disguise
so no one can recognize us.

589
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:05,285
Okay.

590
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,287
Aren't you hungry?

591
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,289
You didn't eat much because of Carson.

592
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,249
You ate less.

593
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,377
Shall we have a barbeque
in the storage room?

594
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,421
Sounds good.
But what if Hyun-min comes again?

595
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:19,048
-He has the nose of a hound.
-We'll lock the door.

596
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,467
Should we?

597
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,343
Carson came out of nowhere.

598
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,887
Nothing happened.

599
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,097
It's fine as long as I ignore it.

600
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:30,477
I hope the world
doesn't come to an end tomorrow.

601
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:33,688
Because I have to see you again tomorrow.

602
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,948
