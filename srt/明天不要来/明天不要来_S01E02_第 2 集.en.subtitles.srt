1
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,871
Hey. You're home.
I was just drying my hair.

2
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,290
Sam's blow dryer is the best in the dorm.

3
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,459
You shouldn't come in when no one's here.

4
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,460
How did you get in?

5
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,129
I know this dorm inside out.
It's not my first day here.

6
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:48,256
Right. Here.

7
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:49,924
What's this?

8
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:53,094
I heard you landed in the ER
because you couldn't use the bathroom.

9
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,555
-How do you know that?
-Se-wan told me.

10
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,099
It's kelp jelly.
It's good for constipation.

11
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,643
Thanks for the thought.

12
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,145
No problem. We're friends.

13
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,315
It's painful
if you can't use the bathroom.

14
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,443
I know. I suffered a lot
from constipation when I was a kid.

15
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:11,488
I'd appreciate it
if you'd stop talking about it.

16
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:13,448
I won't.

17
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:16,409
Oh my gosh.

18
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,161
What's wrong?

19
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,621
Oh my gosh.

20
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:22,791
Aren't these the legendary
limited edition shoes

21
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,001
that they made only 2017 pairs of in 2017?

22
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,461
I camped out for three days

23
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:29,672
in front of a store in Gangnam,
but I still couldn't get them.

24
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,591
Are these the real deal?

25
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,802
What do you mean? Are there fakes?

26
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,678
They're real? Where did you get them?

27
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,514
They were a gift from Michael.

28
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,433
The basketball legend
from the Netflix documentary?

29
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,434
Yes, that's right.

30
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,938
Hey. If Michael gave them to you…

31
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,941
they must be real. They're totally real.

32
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,110
I'm so jealous.

33
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,278
-You can have them.
-Really? I can have them?

34
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,947
Yes. I have a lot of sneakers.

35
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,282
-Are you serious?
-I won't force you.

36
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,118
You can't change your mind later.

37
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,619
I'll show them off to everyone.

38
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:00,995
But…

39
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,623
you can't tell anyone else
where you got them.

40
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,291
-Why not?
-Just because.

41
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,835
You can't tell anyone, okay?

42
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,712
Don't worry. I'll keep my lips sealed.

43
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,092
Maybe this will keep him quiet.

44
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,604
Stop that. You're creating dust.

45
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,565
Did you get new sneakers?

46
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,316
"Sneakers"? But then again,

47
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,735
how could you even imagine what these are?

48
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,821
Oh my gosh. Those are…

49
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,406
Those are…

50
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,450
The legendary limited edition shoes
that they made

51
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,411
only 2017 pairs of in 2017?

52
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,080
SamSam's got a good eye.

53
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,416
Naturally, this is the only pair
in all of Korea.

54
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,918
-Where did you get them?
-Don't ask. You'll get hurt.

55
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,253
Where did you get them?

56
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,254
You have no money.

57
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,464
Right. Whenever we order food,
you're like,

58
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,466
"Can I get a bite? Please?"

59
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:56,759
Did you…

60
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,720
What? Did I what?

61
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,347
What do you take me for?
What kind of friends are you?

62
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,682
It is suspicious.

63
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,226
He suddenly shows up
wearing something that expensive.

64
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,146
And he won't say where he got them.
It's so suspicious.

65
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:09,814
Why can't you tell us?

66
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,277
You guys really suck.
Terris, why would I do that?

67
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,487
He's right. If anything, he'd be robbed.

68
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,032
He doesn't have the guts to rob someone.

69
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,200
I got it.

70
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,952
They're fake. They're knockoffs.

71
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,913
Knockoffs? I'm disappointed in you.

72
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,791
The son of the chairman
of Thug Tteokbokki that swept the world

73
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,211
should have a better eye for these things.

74
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,420
You're right.

75
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,339
They don't look like knockoffs.

76
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,382
Anyway, congratulations.

77
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:41,012
Isn't there a Korean tradition
for when someone buys new shoes?

78
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,096
-That's right.
-Right.

79
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,306
-Initiation!
-Initiation!

80
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,767
No! Where did you guys learn that?

81
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,611
Are you sure you put them here last night?

82
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,696
Yes. I put the yogurt
and fruit cup in here

83
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,490
to have for breakfast.

84
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,449
I'm positive.

85
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,952
Who took them?

86
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,453
This isn't the first time.

87
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,164
Wait until I catch them. I'm so annoyed.

88
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,460
Hey, Carson! Did you eat them?

89
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,170
Look at this yellow stain.

90
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,256
Did you steal my yogurt and spill it?

91
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,007
What are you talking about?

92
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,010
This is from the curry I had last week.

93
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,346
Why are you accusing an innocent person?

94
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,724
I'm in pain from drinking all night.
Leave me alone.

95
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,017
You reek of alcohol.

96
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,228
What is that red stain?

97
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,562
Did I have a nosebleed?

98
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,275
Why are you naked? Gross.

99
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,484
Oh, my eyes.

100
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,485
You're so annoying!

101
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,404
Give that pervert demerits.

102
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,613
This is terrible!

103
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,116
My shampoo went missing from the shower.

104
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,409
-What?
-What?

105
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,368
Shampoo?

106
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:49,038
My favorite eco-friendly shampoo
disappeared into thin air.

107
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,081
Did you see it?

108
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:53,626
Damn it. Go ask the guys!
Why would we go into the mens' shower?

109
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,837
Who stole my shampoo?

110
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,755
If you live with a group of people,

111
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,341
you can get confused
and use someone else's things.

112
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,386
-What do you mean, "stole"?
-No. I wrote

113
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,096
"Property of Hans,"

114
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:09,183
in Korean, English, and Swedish
in big letters.

115
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,894
We have a thief in the dorm.

116
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,148
That's right. My food in the fridge
keeps disappearing.

117
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,525
I'm sure there's a thief on our floor.

118
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,944
That means someone we know is a thief.

119
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,822
Hey! You punks.

120
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,907
How could you suspect your friends?

121
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,200
Your friends

122
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,369
who you should trust and depend on?

123
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,372
How could you suspect them
because of some missing shampoo?

124
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,750
That's not right, guys.

125
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,668
I didn't say they did.

126
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,379
It's just a reasonable suspicion
that they may have.

127
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,258
Honestly, I'm not kidding.

128
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,761
For real? There's someone that hot
in our dorm?

129
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,263
Yes. All the girls in the dorm
have gone nuts.

130
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,390
They say he's hot. A total prince.

131
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:53,061
The only new kid is Jamie though.

132
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,729
Is he that hot?

133
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,856
Hey. That's him.

134
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,111
What? Everyone's here to see Jamie?

135
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,448
Yes. Jamie. Even his name is hot.

136
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,451
He looks so hot up close.

137
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:14,457
Now that I look at him, he is cute.
Like Jung Hae-in from Prison Playbook.

138
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,043
No, like Kim Soo-hyun
from My Love from the Star.

139
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,836
Why didn't I notice before?

140
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,338
He was right under my chin.

141
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,800
Don't you mean "under your nose"?

142
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,470
Hey, what's your problem?
You understood, anyway.

143
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,596
Don't correct me.

144
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,474
Anyway, I'm claiming him. Jamie is mine.

145
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,059
-He's mine!
-What?

146
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,228
You thief. I claimed him first!

147
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,437
Let go of me, you wench!

148
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,232
Come on, give me Jamie's number! Now!

149
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:42,110
I won't! Ask him for it yourself.

150
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:45,780
You're friends with people online
all over the world that you never met.

151
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:46,823
Why are you asking me?

152
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,575
You guys are so pathetic.

153
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,870
You came all the way to Korea to study,
and this is what you do.

154
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,872
Your parents would be shocked.

155
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,333
Whatever. My parents know I'm like this.

156
00:06:58,709 --> 00:06:59,794
Oh, my stomach.

157
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,548
I'll have a Fire Noodle
to get rid of this hangover.

158
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,134
Dagnabbit.

159
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:09,804
All she does in Korea is eat.
She's the one to talk.

160
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,181
Why does she say "dagnabbit"?

161
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,766
Apparently that's what grannies say.

162
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,977
When Carson first came to Korea,

163
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,105
she lived with her boyfriend's grandma
and picked it up from her.

164
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,231
"Dagnabbit."

165
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:21,315
"Dagnabbit."

166
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,733
Oh. I kind of like it.

167
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,944
-Dagnabbit.
-Dagnabbit.

168
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,446
Hey! What are you up to?

169
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,866
What? What brings you to my room?

170
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:30,992
Nothing.

171
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,329
-Where's your roommate?
-Who knows?

172
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,247
Maybe in class.

173
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,208
Why? Are you interested?

174
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,126
No.

175
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,211
Just…

176
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,548
Hey. Give me Jamie's number.

177
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,426
Seriously? You can ask him yourself.

178
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,846
You're friends with people online
all over the world that you never met.

179
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:52,930
Why are you asking me?

180
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,725
You're his roommate, so you must be close.

181
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,935
It's best to get close naturally.

182
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,230
Got it.

183
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,316
I'll give it to you,

184
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,194
but I'm suddenly hungry.

185
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,946
Bring me a cup noodle
from your secret stash.

186
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,740
-What?
-No?

187
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,533
Forget it then.

188
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,785
It's cooked perfectly.

189
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,330
Nice. It looks good.

190
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,540
Give me his number. Now!

191
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,292
Of course, I will.

192
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,169
The first digit is…

193
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,633
-Zero.
-Don't mess with me!

194
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:31,135
All cell numbers start with 010.

195
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,387
How do you know if he got a Korean number

196
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,098
or if he's still using his number
from the States?

197
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,934
You don't want it? Forget it then.

198
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,269
Okay. What's after zero?

199
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,027
I'll tell you after 60 seconds.

200
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,196
You don't know either!

201
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,532
Stop messing with me! Do you want to die?

202
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,577
She is super quick.

203
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,788
How did she know I don't know?

204
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,289
HAVE YOU SEEN MY SHAMPOO?

205
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,166
-Be gentle.
-Come on. They're knockoffs.

206
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,167
They're real.

207
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,168
What do you mean?

208
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,132
There was a theft in the dorm?
What do you mean?

209
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,884
How do you know about that?

210
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,636
Hans called me this morning.

211
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,181
Hans, what went missing?

212
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,267
My shampoo went missing.

213
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,688
What? Shampoo? That's all?

214
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:27,066
I mean, it's not about what it was,

215
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:30,236
but that there was a theft at the dorm.

216
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,154
That's right. This is very serious.

217
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,157
Should I call the police?

218
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,827
No. You don't need to report this.

219
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,371
If things like this get out,

220
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:43,165
it'll hurt the school's reputation
and the dorm's.

221
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,501
Ms. Jung?

222
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,296
Yes? Hello, professor.

223
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:51,924
Did you see a bottle of shampoo
in the shower?

224
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,468
It said "Hans" in big letters.

225
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,053
I threw it away.

226
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,388
What?

227
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:02,018
There was like one drop left,
so I threw it away. Why?

228
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,769
Is there a problem?

229
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:04,979
"One drop"?

230
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:08,357
But I could've used it three more times
if I added water.

231
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,525
It's nothing.

232
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,112
You did good. I'll let you go.

233
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,363
Okay. Have a nice day.

234
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,323
You too.

235
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,451
You didn't even check properly.

236
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,661
What if we called the police?

237
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,622
-I'm sorry.
-Darn it.

238
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,415
Have a nice day.

239
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,501
See? What did I say?

240
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,962
You shouldn't suspect your friends
like that.

241
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,881
I'm really disappointed in you.

242
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,716
It may be a harsh world,

243
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,510
but friends should trust
and depend on each other.

244
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,179
You heartless prick.

245
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,224
My stomach. I feel sick.

246
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,225
Seriously.

247
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,518
Seriously. That jerk.

248
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,562
You didn't even ask around?

249
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,897
Hey, is he gone?

250
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,066
Why did you hide?
What are you, a cockroach?

251
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,487
The professor almost caught me.
What if he finds out I live here?

252
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,405
You could just say you're visiting me.

253
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,658
Still. What if he suspects me?

254
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,076
It's better to avoid him.

255
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,411
Seriously. Who the hell?

256
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:03,788
This is driving me nuts.

257
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:04,872
-Why?
-What's wrong?

258
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,667
The gochujang that I kept in the fridge!

259
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,293
-Gochujang?
-What about it?

260
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:13,172
My precious gochujang is half-gone!

261
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,716
Sergeant Kim's grandma gave it to me.

262
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,510
The thief is definitely among us.

263
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,970
He's dead if I catch him.

264
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:24,809
Wait!

265
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,019
You're Sam's roommate Jamie, right?

266
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,354
Yes, so?

267
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,856
Nice to meet you.
I live on the third floor too.

268
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,192
I'm Minnie. I'm from Thailand.

269
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,694
I know.

270
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,699
It's nice to meet you.

271
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,659
Well, let's be friends.

272
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,994
How about a selfie
to commemorate this moment?

273
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,913
I don't like taking pictures.

274
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:47,790
But…

275
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:49,667
Then…

276
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,460
what's your number?

277
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,462
I haven't memorized my Korean number yet.

278
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,839
I forgot my phone. Sorry.

279
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,092
For real?

280
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,512
Did that asshole
just reject the mighty Minnie?

281
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,723
I do like a challenge though.

282
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,393
He's even better looking up close.

283
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:10,396
He's so hot!

284
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,744
Darn it, what should I do?

285
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,704
I can't get my babies wet.

286
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,415
What do I do?

287
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,544
Hey, Jamie.

288
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:35,880
Did you just get off work?

289
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,882
Yes. Hey. Be careful.

290
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,718
-There may be a thief in the dorm.
-No way.

291
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,679
You can't say that.
You never know with people.

292
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:48,601
I think Hyun-min is the most suspicious.

293
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:49,935
Why? Hyun-min seems nice--

294
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,020
Jeez.

295
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,816
This kept happening
ever since he began coming around.

296
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,735
There's a lot that's suspicious.

297
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,612
How can he wear such expensive sneakers

298
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,697
when he lives here secretly
because he has no money?

299
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,282
I bet he stole them.

300
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,408
No, I gave them to him.

301
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,660
What? Why? For free?

302
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,663
Yes. He knew that I went to the ER
because I was constipated,

303
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,040
so I told him to keep quiet.

304
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,334
That's why you gave him
those expensive sneakers?

305
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,127
Are you out of your mind?

306
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,879
Do you remember how much you owe me?

307
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,547
You know, Jamie,

308
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,383
you could've sold them online.
They would've sold instantly.

309
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,677
Take them back.
Tell him to return them. Now.

310
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,346
How could I take back what I gave?

311
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,097
No? Then I'll take them from him.

312
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,392
-Hyun-min. We need--
-Out of my way!

313
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,437
I'm losing my mind, so talk to me later!

314
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,147
That bastard knows.

315
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,565
-That--
-Okay.

316
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,484
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

317
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:39,485
You have to.

318
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,528
Okay.

319
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:41,904
But please

320
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,492
stop telling everyone I went to the ER
because I was constipated.

321
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,118
Why?

322
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,620
Why else? It's humiliating.

323
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:50,704
But…

324
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,207
Fine.

325
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,167
I got it. Now go.

326
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,924
Hey, you. Se-wan. We need to talk.

327
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,346
What? Jamie and I, going out?

328
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:08,722
Are you insane?

329
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,892
Then why are you always together? Why?

330
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,436
We work together. Don't you know?

331
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,146
I'm using my phone

332
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,440
as an excuse to scam him
for a little money.

333
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,986
So it was all planned.
You're going to hit on him.

334
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:25,364
Hey. I am not!
I don't have time to hit on anyone.

335
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,951
It's hard enough taking care of myself.
I don't have time for him.

336
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:33,455
Then does Jamie have a crush on you
on his own?

337
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,208
Anyway, I've got you.

338
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,793
I'm watching you.

339
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,254
Okay. Think whatever you want.

340
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,255
I'm exhausted.

341
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,008
Anyway, what's Jamie's deal?

342
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:47,052
No one knows anything
other than that he's from LA.

343
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,347
-Do you know?
-No, I don't. And I don't care.

344
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:54,435
I don't like people knowing
too much about me either.

345
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,397
But from how well he speaks Korean,
he must be Korean.

346
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,149
Maybe he's a Korean-American

347
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:03,110
born and raised here
until he immigrated with his parents.

348
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,910
What? Were they talking about me again?

349
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,833
What? What is it? What's wrong?

350
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:18,751
My sneakers!

351
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:19,960
My sneakers are gone!

352
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,922
What? Are you sure
you didn't hide them somewhere?

353
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,591
No! I put them here yesterday to dry!

354
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,635
Maybe they fell over.

355
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:28,969
Where are my sneakers?

356
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,806
What? A thief?

357
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,975
Yes. A real thief was here last night

358
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,269
and stole people's laptops and stuff.

359
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,813
Maybe that thief stole your sneakers too.

360
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:40,856
What?

361
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:47,488
The police will be here to investigate,
so just wait.

362
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,949
Yes. Once they find the thief,
you'll get them back.

363
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,284
They said to report
all the stuff that was stolen.

364
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,705
But Hyun-min,
you don't live here officially.

365
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,123
He can't file a report.

366
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,124
You're right.

367
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,086
If you do,
they'll know you live here in my place.

368
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:05,255
They may think you're the thief
if they know you're here illegally.

369
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,925
I told you not to break the rules.

370
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:08,968
What now?

371
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,761
Terris. File the report for me.

372
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,096
Tell them they're yours.

373
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,430
That won't work.

374
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,933
They're super rare.
The only one in all of Korea.

375
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,268
What if the police ask him
where he got them?

376
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,604
Right. What should I say?

377
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,022
Tell me the truth.

378
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,775
You can't tell anyone else.

379
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,318
You can't tell anyone, okay?

380
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,571
-I can't tell you.
-What? You're very suspicious.

381
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,533
-I can't file the report then.
-Come on. Just do it for me.

382
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:36,495
If they're not yours and belong
to someone else, he'd be in trouble.

383
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,039
Hey, I swear it's not what you think.

384
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,207
Don't you trust me?

385
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,673
See? I warned you.

386
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,717
The missing shampoo was a sign.

387
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,885
Ms. Jung said she threw that out.

388
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:55,347
Carson, aren't you going to report
the missing designer sunglasses?

389
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,683
I can just get new ones.

390
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,519
But someone stole half of my gochujang.

391
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:04,356
I'm sure one of the jerks here ate it.

392
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,609
Why won't they put that down on the list?

393
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,069
Dagnabbit.

394
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:12,865
I suspect Ms. Jung
more than the kids on our floor.

395
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,534
She can go into everyone's room

396
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,161
and knows everything about us.

397
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,830
Just the vibe Ms. Jung gives off--

398
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,749
What vibe do I give off?

399
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,086
Do I look like a thief?

400
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,337
No.

401
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,422
Or a monster?

402
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:31,967
You prick.
How dare you accuse me of theft?

403
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,553
-Are you trying to get me sacked?
-No.

404
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,472
Get over here. Come here, asshole.

405
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,015
Get over here!

406
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:38,932
Ms. Jung.

407
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,394
Did you touch my gochujang in the fridge?

408
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,772
My gosh. I'm going to lose my mind.

409
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:48,233
What? I touched your gochujang?

410
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,987
My gosh. This is why I took a video.
In case this happened.

411
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,030
Look at this.

412
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,575
Watch this, you fool.

413
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,620
You came home plastered at 3 a.m.,

414
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,955
put all the food in a mixing bowl
because you were hungry,

415
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,832
then passed out on the floor. Remember?

416
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,879
I was worried you'd get sick,
so I carried you to your room,

417
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:11,673
cleaned up the room
and even did the dishes.

418
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,300
Who do you think did all that?

419
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:17,471
Then is this red stain from the gochujang?

420
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:22,142
This is the thanks I get
for helping someone in need.

421
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:25,896
Come here, you wench.

422
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,356
-Come on. Get over here.
-Help!

423
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,732
-Come here!
-Hold on. Auntie.

424
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,068
-Come here!
-Please calm down. Stop it.

425
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,695
I'll plaster gochujang
all over your face.

426
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,197
Get back here.

427
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,911
Hey, don't those look like my sneakers?

428
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,538
-No.
-Those aren't yours.

429
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,540
Yes, they are. I'm certain!

430
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,458
-No, don't--
-They are not.

431
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,417
Darn it.

432
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,212
-What are you doing?
-Stop that.

433
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,672
-What the hell, man?
-Sorry.

434
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,049
Seriously. Snap out of it.

435
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,927
I should've worn them more.

436
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,179
I should have worn them
until they wore out.

437
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,140
I told you that it's no use to save them.

438
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,808
Hey, you! Han Hyun-min!

439
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,102
You'd better give it to me straight!

440
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,396
I know you tricked Jamie
and took his sneakers!

441
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,897
He doesn't have them!

442
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,316
Drop the bullshit.
If you're lying, I'll kill you!

443
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,026
It's true. They were stolen.

444
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,487
Cut it out. He's already out of it.

445
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,156
-Really?
-Yes.

446
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:18,699
Did you report it?

447
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:21,285
Of course not. He's living here secretly.

448
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,748
Then you can't get them back
even if they catch the thief.

449
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,333
What? Really?

450
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,334
She's right.

451
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,961
Give it up now.

452
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,421
Just forget it.

453
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,673
What should I do?

454
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:44,057
It was the first time
I got something that I really wanted.

455
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,476
I grew up not knowing

456
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,105
what I liked or what I wanted.

457
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,527
I've always had many little siblings

458
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,322
So I thought I always had to give in

459
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:02,034
For the first time ever, I asked Santa

460
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:05,495
But I was realistic
My stocking was empty

461
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:11,001
I was never selfish
How could this happen? Why?

462
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:14,087
Hyun-min really wanted those sneakers

463
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:17,341
Hyun-min really wanted those sneakers

464
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:20,427
Where are you, my sneakers?

465
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,678
Please

466
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,101
-Just my two cents
-Just my two cents

467
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,145
How could this happen?

468
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,480
-Just my two cents
-Just my two cents

469
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,857
Where in the world are they?

470
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,275
-Just my two cents
-Just my two cents

471
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,486
Nothing ever goes my way

472
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,862
-Just my two cents
-Just my two cents

473
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,447
This is ridiculous

474
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,908
-Just my two cents
-Just my two cents

475
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,576
You guys can't understand

476
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,411
-Just my two cents
-Just my two cents

477
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,163
You can never understand

478
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,082
-Just my…
-Michael

479
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,750
-Just…
-If you hear me

480
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,669
-Just my two cents
-Just my two cents

481
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,295
Please come back

482
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,505
WHOO HA

483
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,467
WHOO HA

484
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:17,025
You guys always had whatever you wanted.
You can never understand me!

485
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,030
Se-wan.

486
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,700
You're way too suspicious.

487
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,827
Are you sure you're not going out?

488
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,371
If you keep that up,
I'll go out with him for real.

489
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,998
Darn it. I just don't get it.

490
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,709
It's not like he has a girlfriend.

491
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,836
Girls are all over him,

492
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,379
but he pushes them all away.

493
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,714
What's going on?

494
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,424
Maybe he doesn't like girls.

495
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,634
Then does he like guys?

496
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,804
-What--
-Wait. Is Jamie gay?

497
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,390
He's probably just shy and reserved.

498
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,434
And so what if he is?

499
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:54,313
Hey. What does Jamie being gay
have to do with you to make you sigh?

500
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,482
It has nothing to do with me,
but it's a waste.

501
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,943
He's the first super hottie I've met
in a while.

502
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,488
I still don't know for sure
whether or not I'm gay,

503
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:07,534
but you guys don't need to decide
my sexual identity for me.

504
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,328
-No, that's not--
-And Se-wan.

505
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,748
I asked you many times
not to talk about my private life.

506
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,459
Why are you spreading
these baseless rumors?

507
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:16,918
Is it because I owe you?

508
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,254
What are you talking about?
What did I say?

509
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,465
Please stop talking about me.

510
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:23,967
Oh my gosh.

511
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,303
He's so cool and charismatic
on top of it all.

512
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,805
-Seriously?
-Did you see that?

513
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,724
That's the relationship we have.

514
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,184
He's not even my type.

515
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,644
Damn it. K-dramas are so annoying.

516
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:38,273
The male protagonists
always like whiny loser girls like you.

517
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,942
Pretty girls like me
are always the villains.

518
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,236
You always call me a villain.

519
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,781
I predict, as a K-drama expert,

520
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,700
that you two will get together for sure.

521
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,244
Jamie is definitely from a rich family.

522
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:54,206
And you should go see a doctor
and get checked up.

523
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,083
You're either terminally ill,

524
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,877
or you two are siblings
who were separated at birth.

525
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,797
One of these will happen for sure.

526
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,382
I'll be watching you.

527
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,967
No, you're the one who needs a doctor.
Come here.

528
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,427
-Life isn't a K-drama!
-Let go!

529
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,388
-Come here. You're a basket case.
-Let go!

530
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,475
Sorry, babe. I can't go home tonight.

531
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,644
I need to be here for Hyun-min. Okay.

532
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:18,980
Come on and eat.

533
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,900
You haven't eaten all day.
That won't bring your sneakers back.

534
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:24,277
Who cares about those stupid sneakers?

535
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,863
-Here.
-I don't know where my babies are.

536
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,323
How could I eat?

537
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,788
Awesome. This is huge.

538
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:35,956
-Awesome.
-What?

539
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:39,084
Hey. Do you know how much
your sneakers cost online?

540
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,627
Over three million won.

541
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,921
They're even willing
to pay more than that.

542
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:43,839
What?

543
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,549
Damn it.

544
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,135
Those sneakers were stolen.

545
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,219
What?

546
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,887
Darn it. What a waste.

547
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,556
That was a total jackpot.

548
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,808
They would've cost over ten--

549
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,018
Damn it.

550
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,896
Hey. Don't drink it like that.

551
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,648
At least use a straw.

552
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,278
Let him be. He needs to let it out.

553
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,386
Hey! My sneakers!

554
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,931
Damn it.

555
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:37,225
Thief! Stop right there!

556
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,143
Thief!

557
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,269
I'm not a thief!

558
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,275
Hey. Give me my sneakers.

559
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,277
-No!
-No? You asshole!

560
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,406
Damn it!

561
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,407
Wait!

562
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,658
Stop right there.

563
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,078
Thief!

564
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,707
Stop, thief. Give me back my sneakers!

565
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,791
Let go of me!

566
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:06,796
Stop right there.

567
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,757
-Let go!
-Where is it?

568
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,592
-Over here!
-Okay!

569
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,430
A thief?

570
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,432
Hey. I need to go. Say you caught him.

571
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,602
-Why?
-He can't find out I'm living here!

572
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,522
Where's the thief?

573
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:26,316
Guys! Grab him so he can't get away!

574
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,986
Incredible. Did you catch him, Terris?

575
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,863
Well, yes.

576
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,115
Hold him down so he can't move.

577
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,244
Let go!

578
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:41,373
-Ouch, that stings!
-Shouldn't you see a doctor?

579
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,708
It's fine. I don't need a doctor.

580
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:44,876
You poor kid.

581
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,003
You even got bitten
while catching the thief,

582
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,339
but you can't tell anyone it was you.

583
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,384
He's like an illegal alien.

584
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,177
He is an illegal alien though.

585
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,512
It's fine.

586
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,973
I got my sneakers back.
That's more than enough.

587
00:25:58,598 --> 00:25:59,432
Yes, sir.

588
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,600
Yes.

589
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,728
It all worked out.

590
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,272
Yes, okay. Thank you.

591
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,774
I'm glad you're here.

592
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:09,859
Did you go to the police station?

593
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,194
What happened to the thief?

594
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:15,031
Luckily, he isn't a student.
He's an outsider.

595
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:15,949
And Terris,

596
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:18,868
I told the school president
that you caught the thief,

597
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:21,871
and he was so happy
that he wanted to reward you.

598
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,164
What? Reward me?

599
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:28,336
Wait. The thief was wearing
these sneakers, right?

600
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:32,632
Right. This is evidence,
so we should submit them to the police.

601
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,593
-Whose are they?
-The thing is--

602
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:35,969
-Are they yours?
-No.

603
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,470
-Then whose are they?
-Stop.

604
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:40,390
I'll bring them to the police
as evidence. Okay?

605
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:41,349
Okay.

606
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,685
Gosh, you're strong.

607
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:47,856
Bye.

608
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,285
MESSAGE FROM PARK SE-WAN

609
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:03,913
Hey, I gave the professor an excuse
and got your sneakers back.

610
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,081
I'll bring them back.

611
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:13,798
Excuse me!

612
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,774
Where are they? Tell me!

613
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:33,526
Calm down.
They're just a pair of sneakers.

614
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,945
-Give them to me.
-I will. Hold on.

615
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,739
Hey. Thank you so very much.

616
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,617
I'll repay you for the rest of my life.
Thank you.

617
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,576
Here.

618
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:44,245
I felt bad when I heard your story.

619
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,749
Not being able to have
something you really want.

620
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:49,626
I understand.

621
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,295
Hey. What's this?

622
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,213
What is this?

623
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,841
They're the latest sneakers
from the brand you love so much.

624
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,885
No, the ones that were stolen!

625
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,887
Where are they?

626
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:02,806
Those?

627
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:07,686
I was walking out of the station
with them, and someone offered me

628
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,145
500,000 won for them.

629
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,772
Talk about luck.

630
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,608
So I spent 300,000 won on these
and called it even with Jamie

631
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,610
for the 200,000 he owed me.

632
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,696
And I got myself new sneakers too. Look.

633
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:21,032
I needed something comfortable to wear
while working anyway.

634
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:22,951
That's okay, right?

635
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:32,127
Hey. Are you crying?

636
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,421
Hey, why are you crying?

637
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,506
Are you that happy?

638
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:42,387
I'm happy that you're happy.

639
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,851
Buy me lunch.
I'm in the mood for some barbecue.

640
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,521
A FEW DAYS EARLIER

641
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,439
Excuse me?

642
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,024
Why is the Narcotics Division

643
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,402
investigating our dorm?

644
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:00,071
Drug rings are using
international students

645
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,615
to smuggle drugs
in sneaker soles and belts.

646
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:07,662
Are you saying we have a student like that
in our dorm?

647
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,290
Are there any students
who came to Korea recently

648
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:12,083
