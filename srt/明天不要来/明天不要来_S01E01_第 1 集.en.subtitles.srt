1
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,660
We'll eat now.

2
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:38,747
Where do you live?

3
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,664
Seoul, Gangnam--

4
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,350
PARK SE-WAN, KOREAN, SENIOR
BUSINESS MAJOR

5
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,019
#BUSY BEE #FULL-TIME PART-TIMER
#TOUGH AS NAILS #RESIDENT ADVISOR

6
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:05,899
Have a nice day, sir.

7
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:07,901
Hey, Se-wan.

8
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:10,320
I'm in trouble. Help. It's urgent.

9
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,197
Why? What is it?

10
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,616
I left my key in my room.

11
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,286
Quickly.

12
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,625
-What are they?
-Your first choice

13
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,168
is having me open the door.

14
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,131
Okay, as per dorm rules,
if you lock yourself out

15
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,509
and I let you in with this master key,

16
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,136
you get 20 demerits. You know that, right?

17
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,596
What's my other choice?

18
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:39,432
The second choice is having me pick…

19
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,603
the door for you through lockpicking.

20
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,690
You get no demerits,
and no one will know about it.

21
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,902
But there is a fee. A small, tiny fee.

22
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:54,823
I'm busy, so you have a deal.
Pick it for me. What's the fee?

23
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:57,617
EMERGENCY SERVICE: CURFEW,
MASTER KEY, ETC 10,000 WON

24
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,576
It's 10,000 won.

25
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,954
That's too expensive. Give me a discount.

26
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,372
Well, okay then.

27
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,708
It's your first time,
so I'll do it for half price. 5,000 won.

28
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:08,461
Sure.

29
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,174
Darn it. You scared me.

30
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,428
The resident advisor
shouldn't extort the foreign students.

31
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,596
Does the professor know?

32
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,807
I never extorted them.
She asked me to do it.

33
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,518
But printing out a price list
for your services--

34
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,435
Use this

35
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:28,189
to buy yourself an energy drink
this afternoon, madam.

36
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,440
"Madam"? Silly girl.

37
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,484
Call me "Auntie."

38
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,529
I don't think we're that close.

39
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:37,699
The floor was wet by the showers.

40
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,326
Looks like you've been
slacking off, madam.

41
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,786
-Yes.
-Lazy.

42
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,290
I've been working in this dorm
for 20 years,

43
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,500
but I've never met anyone like you before.

44
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,836
Even if the earth perishes tomorrow,

45
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,630
you'd survive off cockroaches.

46
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,091
I like her a lot.

47
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,187
What?

48
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,479
Here.

49
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,981
Hey.

50
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:13,401
You shouldn't be paying me
out in the open no matter how urgent.

51
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,779
Okay, 4,000 won. What do you need?

52
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,656
You dropped it.

53
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:22,785
Hey.

54
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:26,915
Who are you again?

55
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,459
You're Sam's roommate
who moved in last week, right?

56
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,713

58
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,259
Excuse me.

59
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,970
What? Is there more?

60
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,764
You're the RA here, right?

61
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,767
-I want to switch rooms.
-Your room?

62
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,061
Why? Do you not like your roommate?

63
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,897
Sam is a bit noisy, isn't he?

64
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,400
That's true, but more because
I want a single room.

65
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,860
-A single room?
-Yes.

66
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,862
A room with its own bathroom and shower.

67
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:58,905
I'm a bit sensitive.

68
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,074
It's uncomfortable sharing a room
with others.

69
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,118
Does he think this is a hotel?

70
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:06,746
Listen.

71
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,332
There aren't any single rooms here.

72
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,001
We require you to live in a dorm

73
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,879
to force you to interact
and make friends with others.

74
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:18,591
People much more sensitive
and difficult than you live here.

75
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,010
You're not special.

76
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,553
But just in case--

77
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,847
Hey. I'm so busy. Bye.

78
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:32,105
I'm hungry. Where is he?

79
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,482
SamSam is so slow.

80
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,442
Come on. It must've gotten cold.

81
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,821
It tastes the best hot.
You should've been faster.

82
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:43,741
I know. What took you so long
to pick it up from the front door?

83
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:47,996
You're spilling the soup. Dagnabbit.

Then get it yourself next time!

87
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,629
Either stop ordering me around
or stop complaining.

#VAIN #PATHOLOGICAL LIAR #TRICKSTER
#THE YOUNGEST #RASCAL

90
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,511
The youngest should run errands.
That's how it works.

91
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:06,514
The youngest? Is it a crime to be young?

92
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,224
You stress age and seniority.

93
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,184
I hate how Koreans stress hierarchies.

94
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,103
As they say, "When in Rome…"

95
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,480
So when you're in Korea,
you follow the Korean way.

96
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,482
Let's eat up.

99
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,699
This is an international dorm
in which foreigners live.

100
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,492
Why do we care about age?

101
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:31,456
Furthermore, even Koreans
hate doing things like that these days.

102
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:32,665
They despise them.

103
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:36,252
Hey. At least we have delivery apps now.

104
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,213
Back in my day,
I had to physically go to the store.

105
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,299
Have you gone to Sindang-dong
to get tteokbokki?

106
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:44,010
Or to Uijeongbu to get an army stew?

107
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,763
Man, the world has become so convenient.

108
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:50,433
Man, where did she learn
how to talk like an old fart?

109
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,809
Oh, no.

110
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,521
Why does Hyun Bin look so hot
even in a North Korean uniform?

111
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:59,650
"I'm dying from slashing weight
because of Comrade Ri Jeong Hyeok."

112
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:00,818
What was that?

113
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,528
It's North Korean.

114
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,031
"You bastard.
I've had enough of your lies!"

115
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,574
What? Were you talking to me?

116
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:10,078
Yes. It means, "Drop the bull, asshole."

117
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:10,995
Get it now?

118
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,374
She's binge-watching
Crash Landing on You right now.

119
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,044
-Se-wan. You haven't eaten yet, right?
-No.

120
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,463
-Join us.
-Thank you.

121
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,842
My battery doesn't last half a day.

122
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,552
NEW MESSAGE TO JONATHAN

123
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,098
How old is that phone?
That's a total fossil.

124
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,058
At least replace the cracked screen.

125
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,476
-Can you even see?
-Yes.

126
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,561
Get a new phone.

127
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,064
Even the free phones are better
than yours.

128
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,442
People change phones
way too frequently now.

129
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,736
It's a waste of money.

130
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,654
My phone!

131
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,657
Sorry. My bad. I didn't see it. Sorry.

132
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,617
-The screen cracked.
-What?

133
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,701
It really cracked.

134
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:55,998
Dang it! I can't get part-time jobs
without my phone!

135
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,459
-I'm so sorry about what happened.
-What will you do?

136
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,420
You smashed my perfectly good phone.

137
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,840
I'm sorry. I'll reimburse you for it.

138
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:07,677
You mean it? You just said
you'd reimburse me for this.

139
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,970
Sure, I will.

140
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,055
I have to get to class. Let's talk later.

141
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,474
Okay. You promised, okay?

142
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,437
Oh no, my phone!
Look at the screen. Damn it.

143
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,315
You'll win an Academy Award
and an Oscar this year for sure.

144
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,402
So this is why
you haven't gotten a new phone.

145
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,237
"You've got it all planned."

146
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,824
You've been waiting to bait a sucker.

147
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:30,908
Way to go.

148
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,955
Minnie. Should I process the 50 demerits
for your curfew violation last week?

149
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:39,041
Carson. You clogged the toilet again.

150
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,377
Should I tell the cleaning lady
it was you?

151
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,045
You know, right?

152
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,881
-Okay!
-Fine, I'll shut up. Shut up.

153
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,594
My poor roommate.

154
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:52,597
He got suckered by Se-wan
as soon as he came to Korea.

155
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,891
SamSam, you ignoramus.

156
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,768
The Academy Award and the Oscars
are the same thing.

157
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,104
The trophy from the Academy Award
is an Oscar.

158
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,272
You birdbrain.

159
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,149
What are you talking about? It is not.

160
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:06,486
-Hey. I saw someone who won both.
-Really?

161
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:10,615
A famous director who comes
to my dad's shop every day for tteokbokki

162
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:11,824
won them both.

163
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,326
I saw them with my own eyes.

164
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,536
There you go again, you pathological liar.

165
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,121
Look. His ears turned red.

166
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,457
At least, Sam's ears are honest.

167
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,751
They turn red from humiliation.

168
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,216
Hi, babe.

169
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,800
Yes, I'm heading out now.

170
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,010
I'm putting my shoes on.

171
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,221
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

172
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:37,266
Hyun-min has been sleeping here all day.
Isn't he going home?

173
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,393
Hey, get up. Get up.

174
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,937
I'm tired.

175
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:42,855
What time is it?

176
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:45,858
Look at the time.

177
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,860
Why didn't you wake me?

178
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,695
HYUN-MIN, KOREAN, SOPHOMORE
AGRICULTURE MAJOR

179
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,614
#PARASITE #MAN OF DETERMINATION
#NATIVE KOREAN #DISGUISED AS A FOREIGNER

180
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,574
Why are you packing? Where are you going?

181
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,868
What do I do?

182
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,745
Why? Is something wrong?

183
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:58,829
No.

184
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,790
My girlfriend is

185
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:01,958
so obsessed with me.

186
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,459
She is?

187
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,752
I'm jealous.

188
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,212
So? Does she want to break up?

189
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:09,048
She says she can't stand
being apart from me every night.

190
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,591
So? Does she want to break up?

191
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,260
Why do you keep saying that?

192
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,595
She wants me to move in with her.

193
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,638
Immediately. Today.

194
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,473
TERRIS, TRINBAGONIAN, GRAD STUDENT
MASTER'S IN BUSINESS AND ADMINISTRATION

195
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,392
#SMART ALECK #PLAYER
#KNOW-IT-ALL AND A SHOW-OFF

196
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:20,601
What?

197
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,397
You're going to live together
after only going out for a week?

198
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,816
Time doesn't matter
as long as they like each other.

199
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,402
Terris. Just my two cents.

200
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,488
I may be very conservative
because I was born and raised in Korea,

201
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,115
but living together is…

202
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,285
Wait! Are you moving out of the dorm?
What about this room?

203
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,828
That's the problem.

204
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,372
It's hard to get back into the dorm
once you move out.

205
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:44,875
And if my dad finds out,
he'll demand that I return home.

206
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:49,839
Is there anyone who can pretend to be me
and live here in my place?

207
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,008
Me! You have me!

208
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,843
My commute is killing me.

209
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,679
I left home before the sun rose today too.

210
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:03,728
BICYCLE

211
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:13,779
INTERCITY BUS

212
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,656
JUST MY TWO CENTS.
3 HOUR COMMUTE? NOT A PROB…

213
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:21,120
SUBWAY

214
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:27,209
SHUTTLE BUS

215
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,757
Han Hyun-min.

216
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,758
Here.

217
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:37,136
Commuting from Icheon
is the same as commuting from Busan.

218
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,764
It's very tiring.
You try commuting five hours a day.

219
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,390
Even now, in places in Africa,

220
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:45,811
small children walk seven hours
back and forth to get water.

#EXCEPT FOR ME #SNOB #WEIRDO

223
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,067
Why are you bringing that up?

224
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,070
Please, let me live here.

225
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:57,323
I'll get kicked out
if the professor finds out.

226
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,659
He can't tell us apart anyway.

227
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,410
Even the guard thinks I'm you.

228
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,538
That's true. The professor thought
I was Jonathan last time.

229
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,124
-Okay, you live here then.
-Okay. It's a deal.

230
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,334
Yes.

231
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,836
This isn't something you guys can decide
on your own.

232
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,131
A Korean citizen residing
in the international dorm?

233
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,675
That's against the rules.

234
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,134
Screw the rules.

235
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:21,722
Stop worrying about kids in faraway Africa
and worry about your friend next to you.

236
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:26,977
Staying over now and then
because you're Terris's friend

237
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,146
and actually living here are

238
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,315
-completely different.
-Come on, Hans.

239
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,983
Let it slide just this once.

240
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:36,404
Once the rules are broken once,
twice, and so on,

241
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,863
the system will fall apart

242
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,865
and bring about a dystopian future.

243
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,701
Rules are rules.

244
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,577
What cannot be, cannot be.

245
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,956
Why is he so dang frustrating?

246
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,208
Is he always like that with rules?

247
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,586
He doesn't follow the rules.
He flip-flops as he likes.

248
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,633
I'll work on him as I live with him.

249
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,427
Anyway, I'm jealous.

250
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,887
All I have is a crush,
but you're moving in together.

251
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,182
When will you introduce me
to your girlfriend?

252
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,392
What?

253
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,145
You can meet her in due time.

254
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,941
Yes, I found that restaurant
I've been talking about.

255
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:14,984
What?

256
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,278
Did you miss me?
Do you want a good night kiss?

257
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,612
Damn it.

258
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,655
Do you want to die?

259
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:20,823
Get your roommate.

260
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,576
Hey, Jamie. You're wanted.

261
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:25,703
Get inside.

262
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,914
Who is it?

263
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,042
Hi, Se-wan. What's up?

264
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,002
"What's up?"

265
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,463
My cell phone.

266
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,840
-Hand it over. Now.
-That's right.

267
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,092
-But I don't have money right now.
-What?

268
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,219
So this is how you want to play?

269
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,554
Give me your credit card.

270
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,015
I can't due to personal reasons.
Give me some time--

271
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,057
Why you little punk.

272
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,643
Don't try to pull one over on me. Okay?

273
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,229
You've messed with the wrong person.

274
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,028
You told him to work
and pay you back from his pay?

275
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,448
Yes. I said I'd find him the work.
He's starting tomorrow.

276
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:07,036
Are you sure Jamie can make enough
to pay for a phone?

277
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,455
It's totally possible
if he works all weekend.

278
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,457
If he works hard and doesn't slack off.

279
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,666
Are you serious?

280
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,126
Hyun Bin is there?

281
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,795
For real?

282
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,088
If I go and he's not there, you're dead.

283
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,341
Hey. Are you going clubbing again?

284
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:23,761
Yes. My friend said
she saw Hyun Bin at the club.

285
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,013
-He's in a North Korean uniform.
-Come on.

286
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,973
Why would he wear a North Korean uniform?

287
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,226
-It's a waiter.
-Never mind if it isn't him.

288
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,479
It's Friday. I should party until I drop.

289
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,106
-So? Are you partying all night again?
-Probably.

290
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,734
A curfew violation?
You know that's 50 demerits.

291
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,027
My silence for 10,000 won.

292
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,196
You call yourself a friend?
You're terrible.

293
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,282
Hey. Why do you keep coming into our room?

294
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,242
Pay us from now on.

295
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,576
It'll be 10,000 won.

296
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,704
This isn't your room.
I come to see Carson, so stop fussing.

297
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,123
Pay me when you come to see me too.

298
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:56,585
It'll be 10,000 won.
It's 10,000 won for breaking curfew.

DORMITORY

301
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:13,602
Is this for real?

302
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,604
I'm in bed at 7 a.m.?

303
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,607
Life is so much easier
now that I'm in a dorm.

304
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,988
Where did he go so early?

305
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,948
I wanted to win him over with breakfast.

306
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:29,326
Hey, roommate. Good morning.
Where did you go so early in the morning?

307
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,329
I went to report you to Se-wan,
but she's out.

308
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,372
Hey!

309
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:35,624
How could you do that?

310
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,376
I'll be good to you. Okay?

311
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,379
I'll clean the room
and I'll do your laundry with mine.

312
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,466
Rules are rules.
What cannot be, cannot be.

313
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,927
Hans.

314
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:47,970
Hey!

315
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,099
How do I win him over?

316
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,393
SOJU THAT WINS YOUR HEART

317
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,780
-What?
-I'm sorry.

318
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,782
How could you drop that?

319
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,410
Where did you find this klutz?
We're busy as it is.

320
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,620
I'm sorry.

321
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,793
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

322
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,337
I'm sorry.

323
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,506
I'm sorry.

324
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,758
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

325
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:26,759
Oh, watch out!

326
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,053
I'm sorry.

327
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,387
Seriously.

328
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,016
Where did you find this klutz?
We're busy as it is.

329
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,018
I'm sorry.

330
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,734
I thought he'd slack off and fight back,

331
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:46,111
but he's working hard.

332
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,868
Did you see my umbrella by the entrance?

333
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:53,994
The tall, black one.

334
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:54,912
No.

335
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,664
Maybe someone borrowed it.

336
00:15:56,747 --> 00:16:00,125
What kind of a prick
takes things without asking?

337
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,587
They should at least leave a note
if they're going to borrow it.

338
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,298
Will it break their wrist
to write a little note?

339
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,759
What a prick.

340
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:12,179
"Prick"? Aren't you being sexist,
implying all thieves are men?

341
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:15,641
He's right. It could've been a girl.
When did you leave it there?

342
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:19,436
I went out yesterday afternoon and left it
by the entrance when I got back.

343
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,480
Someone swiped it!

344
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,652
Oh, that's right. It's supposed to rain.

345
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,073
Seriously.

346
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,158
Who's the prick?

347
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,911
Why are they stealing my things?

348
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,538
Dagnabbit.

349
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,665
Wait until I catch him.

350
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:43,419
I'll crush all the bones in his body
into 20,000 pieces.

351
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,506
Whoever took it is screwed.

352
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,925
Why did they take Carson's,
of all people's?

353
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,635
Her temper is infamous.

354
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,054
Once she loses it, it's no holds barred.

355
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:57,558
That's right. She loses it
when she gets upset.

356
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:01,186
Once, a guy knocked over her tray
and didn't apologize.

357
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,272
She fought them 16-to-1. I saw it myself.

358
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,356
Stop exaggerating.

359
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,275
It was just an argument.

360
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,068
What 16-to-1 fight?

361
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,904
I'm not exaggerating. Didn't you know?

362
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,407
Carson's from a gangster family
in Chicago.

363
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,577
Her dad was a great shot
and a great fighter,

364
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,456
so he was the big boss.
But he got caught by CSI, and…

365
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,874
Stop talking nonsense.

366
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,917
How many bones do people have?

367
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,671
About 206?

368
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,964
So, 20,000 pieces…

369
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,177
She'll break each bone into 100 pieces?

370
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:43,937
Is that all?

371
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:48,192
You should eat the expensive stuff first
at a buffet. Like meat.

372
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,569
-Is this your first buffet?
-I don't feel well.

373
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,489
Eat as much as you can when you can.

374
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,075
You still have two more jobs today.

375
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,077
-This isn't the last one?
-What bull…

376
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,287
This isn't enough to pay for my phone.

377
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,499
You're lucky they pay 1.5 times
on the weekends.

378
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:07,377
Even if you work all weekend long,
it'll barely be enough.

379
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,839
Do all college kids in Korea
live like this?

380
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,803
Yes. Everyone except for kids
who are very rich.

381
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,182
You've never done this kind of work,
have you?

382
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,643
That's not true.
I've had jobs in the States.

383
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,686
I've never done this, that's all.

384
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,065
It's obvious. You're a terrible liar.

385
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,444
You may be working all night,
so eat as much as you can.

386
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,154
Okay.

387
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,001
Aren't you tired?

388
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,587
You're an RA and you work on the weekends.

389
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,588
When do you study?

390
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,926
This is nothing new for me.

391
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,138
Don't you pity me?

392
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:03,225
So if you don't pay for my phone,
I will murder you.

393
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:04,852
Eat already.

394
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,356
I'm getting so pissed off.

395
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,526
How dare they steal from me?

396
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,027
They didn't steal it.

397
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:17,072
I'm sure they borrowed it and forgot.

398
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,157
They forgot?

399
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,450
The person who lost it is losing her mind,

400
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,661
but what? They forgot? Are you kidding me?

401
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,621
Why are you taking it out on me?

402
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:29,293
Why would they take other people's things?

403
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,295
That person was totally in the wrong.

404
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,505
Why did they take yours, of all people's?

405
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,507
If they know it's wrong,

406
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:38,010
why? Just why?

407
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,845
Why did they do that?

408
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,347
Why are you taking it out on me?

409
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,349
Find the thief and ask--

410
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,935
That's what I want to do.
Wait until I catch him. I'll…

411
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,521
Give me that!

412
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,608
What? Do you have something to say?

413
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,068
No. It just looked a little crooked.

414
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,614
Why is she so mad about an umbrella?

415
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,698
What a temper.

416
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,117
Maybe it's very expensive
or special to her.

417
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,328
Like limited edition basketball sneakers?

418
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,955
I just imagined it.
I'd completely lose it.

419
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,082
Did you persuade Hans?

420
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,834
He's a total nutjob.

421
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,920
He's a lot more stubborn than I expected.

422
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:16,298
Isn't there a way
to win him over instantly…

423
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,301
What? Do you have something to say?

424
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,887
No. It just looked a little crooked.

425
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,014
There is.

426
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,523
It's you, right? Carson's umbrella.

427
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,568
-You took it and lost it, right?
-How did you know?

428
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,736
You're totally obvious.

429
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,364
If I could tell,
she'll figure it out in no time.

430
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:41,531
Oh, no.

431
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,159
I clearly remember leaving with it,

432
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,412
but it stopped raining,
so I think I left it somewhere.

433
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,414
I can't remember where.

434
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,583
And you say you care about the rules.

435
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,461
Is taking someone's umbrella
without asking "by the rules"?

436
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,840
I'm just saying

437
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,842
it's impossible for a person

438
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,302
to always follow the rules.

439
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,764
Shouldn't you confess to her?

440
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,683
I tried to earlier,

441
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,936
but I was too scared to say anything.

442
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,690
She won't kill you if you return it today,

443
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,067
so let's check everywhere you went today.

444
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:22,572
It's raining out. Would it still be there?

445
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,075
What choice do we have?
We have to at least try.

446
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,535
Just remember where you went.

447
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,703
I'll do the searching.

448
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,122
Thanks, Hyun-min. Thanks.

449
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,164
Let's go.

450
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,302
It's nowhere.

451
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,594
We looked everywhere.

452
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,347
If I come clean to Carson now,

453
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,558
will she at least spare my life?

454
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,979
Even if you do die,

455
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,815
let's get dry and eat something first.

456
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:03,822
Yes. So if I go right now,
I can watch the security video, right?

457
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,534
-Okay.
-Is she going to check the security video?

458
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,870
Yes. She talked to the security guard.

459
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,164
They said they have to call
the security company,

460
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,790
so she agreed to pay for it.

461
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,292
She's going to check it now.

462
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,377
Wait until I catch the thief.

463
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:18,920
Hey.

464
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,173
Come and watch the video with me

465
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:23,008
and help me identify him.

466
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,052
Yes, this is it.

467
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,722
This is my chance to win Hans over.

468
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,515
She won't actually kill me.

469
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,600
Carson! Wait!

470
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:32,559
For what?

471
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,483
-It was me.
-What?

472
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,276
The person who took your umbrella--

473
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,278
I'm back. What are you doing?

474
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,155
What's he doing down there?

475
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,449
-You're here.
-Yes.

476
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,035
Hey, isn't that my umbrella?

477
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,121
Really? It was raining
when I left last night.

478
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,998
I saw this over there and took it.

479
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,754
I was right. This is my umbrella.

480
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,846
Come on. You should've told me
if you were borrowing it.

481
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,014
Did you look for it?

482
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,557
I thought someone stole it.

483
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,060
As long as I got it back.
So, did you see Hyun Bin?

484
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,978
I'm so annoyed. It was a waiter.

485
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,773
My damn friend lied to me.

486
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,233
I still had fun though.

487
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,819
What are you wearing? Aren't you cold?

488
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,196
You're so ignorant about fashion.

489
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,657
It's the "lost-pants look."

490
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,574
No, it isn't.

491
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,119
-I lost my pants while I was partying.
-What?

492
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,079
She came home like that?

493
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,164
Then…

494
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,624
she really did lose her pants.

495
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:39,459
Wait a second. Carson.

496
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,378
Why did you make such a fuss over this?

497
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:44,339
I know. What is so special about it
that you got so mad?

498
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,590
This?

499
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:46,842
It's very special to me.

500
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,802
Why? Why is it special?

501
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,595
Sergeant Kim got it for me.

502
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,098
He said I'd be in trouble
if I lost it again.

503
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,600
I thought it was from your first love
or something.

504
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,228
Sergeant Kim is my first love
and my current boyfriend.

505
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,855
Anyway, Sam.

506
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,816
Take down the notice
since I found my umbrella.

507
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,862
Hey. Freeze.

508
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:08,738
-Excuse me!
-Yes?

509
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,532
-More scallions please.
-Okay.

510
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,915
What are you doing?

511
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,213
Stop apologizing!

512
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,465
Stop filming!

513
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,300
-Where's our soju?
-Coming.

514
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,606
Is this too much for him?

515
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,734
He looks like he never did
physical labor before.

516
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:47,819
Did I work him too hard?

517
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:49,821
What if he's sick?

518
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:54,784
There you go again.
Who cares if other people suffer or die?

519
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,538
Think only for yourself.
I'm a bitch. I'm a selfish bitch.

520
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,623
Hey!

521
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,584
-Where are you going?
-To the bathroom.

522
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,712
There's no time for that.
They're calling you. Get moving!

523
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,380
-Over here!
-Get over there.

524
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:14,721
Did you get on your knees
to sacrifice yourself for me?

525
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:18,058
Although your bones could've been
shattered into 20,000 pieces?

526
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:21,102
I grew up in the countryside,
so I have strong bones.

527
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,146
Just my two cents.

528
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,315
I'd rather get hurt

529
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:26,816
than watch my friend get hurt.

530
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,819
This is how Koreans show affection.

531
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:30,820
You punk.

532
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,573
Why would you…

533
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,535
Thanks, friend.

534
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,752
Thank you.

535
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:47,837
SEOM, JEJU STORY
PREMIUM BLACK PORK FROM JEJU

536
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,344
Good work.

537
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,390
You know this isn't enough
to pay for my phone, right?

538
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,141
You have to work again tomorrow.

539
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:01,726
You did good, too.

540
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,897
How will you survive in this world?

541
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,399
Your face shows your emotions.

542
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,358
We should hurry.

543
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,193
There's a cab.

544
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,946
A cab? You still don't get it.

545
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:15,490
Do you want to blow
your hard-earned money on a cab?

546
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,075
You still owe me so much.

547
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,411
Okay. Let's get back to the dorm.

548
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,497
Hey, what's wrong?

549
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,457
Hey, are you really sick?

550
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,750
Hey. Oh no. Hey.

551
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:26,710
Hey, Jamie!

552
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,753
Jamie! Wake up! Jamie!

553
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,425
Please save him.

554
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:34,843
He…

555
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,348
He has never done physical labor before,

556
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,936
but I made him work all day long.
That's why he was overworked.

557
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,523
I'm sorry. Please don't die.

558
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,900
My screen was already cracked.

559
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,486
I'm sorry. Please don't die.

560
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,572
Please don't die.

561
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,742
What? What did you say?

562
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,411
-Poop?
-Yes. Do you see how full it is?

563
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,288
That's all poop.

564
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,123
One second.

565
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,209
There is a lot of poop.

566
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,252
This is serious.

567
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,588
Can a person faint because of poop?

568
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:15,008
Yes. Many patients come to the ER
late at night because of poop.

569
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:17,927
But he's pretty extreme.
He hasn't gone in a long time.

570
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,721
A week? Yes?

571
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,057
Yes.

572
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:26,603
I'm very sensitive and can't use
the bathroom just anywhere.

573
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,980
You have to go regularly from now on.

574
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,816
We'll administer enema
and give him IV fluids for today.

575
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,026
Okay, then.

576
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,110
Who's next?

577
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,029
Where? Here?

578
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:42,869
I've seen people who couldn't hold it
when they had to take a dump,

579
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:46,831
but I've never seen someone faint
from not going for too long.

580
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,875
You didn't go for a week? My gosh.

581
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,419
That's why I asked for a different room.

582
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:55,423
The hardest part of dorm living
is sharing a bathroom.

583
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,425
Even still, if it's that urgent,

584
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,637
you should just take a dump anywhere.

585
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,307
You made me work all day and didn't
give me time to go to the bathroom.

586
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:07,060
Fine, it's my fault. It's all my fault.

587
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,019
Happy?

588
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,778
Are you okay now?

589
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,864
Yes. I went to the bathroom
after the enema,

590
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:21,282
so I'm okay now.

591
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,411
Good, as you should be.
That was some expensive poop.

592
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,329
Stop saying "poop." It's embarrassing.

593
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,998
Really, poop? It's embarrassing, poop?

594
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,500
Let's just take a cab.

595
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,085
Look, Mr. American man.

596
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:35,088
The ER bill wasn't covered by insurance,

597
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,798
so I had to give them
everything we made today

598
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,299
and put the balance on my card.

599
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,135
But what? A cab?

600
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,721
Thank you so much.
I promise I'll pay you back.

601
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,724
Then how do we get home?

602
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:48,059
Well, the buses stopped running already.

603
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:49,894
They'll start running soon.

604
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,856
Aren't you coming?

605
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:53,940
I'm coming.

606
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,164
-Are you amazed?
-Yes.

607
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,167
It's 3 a.m.,
but it's like it's mid-afternoon.

608
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,715
I hear foreigners love visiting Korea
because you can party all night long.

609
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,218
Some party like crazy

610
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,721
while others work like crazy.

611
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:39,235
Thank you for worrying so much
about me earlier.

612
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,278
Worrying?

613
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,573
Am I stupid? Why would I worry about you?

614
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,326
I had to do that in the ambulance

615
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,703
so that the paramedics
would take good care of you.

616
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,664
It was method acting.

617
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:52,624
Okay.

618
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,375
But I thought

619
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,045
I heard you say earlier

620
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,547
that your phone screen was cracked
to begin with.

621
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:08,181
NEXT DAY

622
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:19,943
Hey, Se-wan. Hold on.

623
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,737
-What?
-You know,

624
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,448
Hyun-min is living in our room
in Terris's place.

625
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,826
-You asshole--
-That's a rule violation, right?

626
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,661
He's not allowed to, right?

627
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,579
I even got on my knees for you.

628
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,164
You're an asshole.

629
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:36,751
I'm grateful for that. I am.
But rules are rules.

630
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:37,919
Am I wrong, Se-wan?

631
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,172
Hyun-min, is what he says true?

632
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,675
Did you guys really do that?

633
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:46,719
Terris moved in with his girlfriend,

634
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,889
-so his side of the room is empty…
-Damn it.

635
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,686
Fine. Then you can just do that.

636
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:57,772
Of course, rules are important,
but people are more important.

637
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:01,234
Isn't that right, Hans,
you heartless prick?

638
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,610
Se-wan.

639
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,112
I reported them to you,

640
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,280
so I did my part.

641
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:08,700
And what you said was quite offensive.

642
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,994
There are better ways
of expressing yourself.

643
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,289
Thank you so much, Se-wan.

644
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,456
Thank you so very much.

645
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,836
For what? For free?

646
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,215
CONTRACT

647
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:27,552
This is unfair. Show up in five minutes
if you page me?

648
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:28,845
That's ridiculous.

649
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,889
And what?
The contract term is seven years?

650
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,308
I'm not some idol.
What's with the seven year contract?

651
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,559
This is ridiculous.

652
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:37,103
-It's unfair.
-Is it?

653
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:39,105
All you have to do is keep quiet.

654
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,149
Why do I have so many obligations?

655
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:42,901
Okay, fine.

656
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:45,612
Five minutes is a bit unrealistic.

657
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,408
Ten minutes. Okay?

658
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:51,868
What? Ten minutes?

659
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:53,620
Ten minutes is…

660
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,813
