1
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,162
Did you just get back from work?

2
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,497
Well, yes.

3
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,334
That smells good.
Is that kimchi fried rice?

4
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:47,088
Do you want some? I made too much.

5
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,423
Really? May I have some?

6
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,894
I don't do this to just anyone.

7
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,229
PROPERTY OF PARK SE-WAN

8
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,149
Se-wan, about what you wrote on my arm--

9
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,860
That? It's nothing.

10
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,196
I doodle my name everywhere
when I'm drunk.

11
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,406
It's like animals marking their territory.

12
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,366
Like animals marking their territory?

13
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,535
Like, "He's mine, so don't touch it"?

14
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,204
That's not it.

15
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,039
It's just a habit. That's…

16
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,625
It means nothing at all.

17
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,627
But Se-wan.

18
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,836
Wash it off.

19
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,339
Wash it off
before the others get the wrong idea.

20
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:32,092
What are you guys doing?
Are you living together?

21
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,551
We are not!

22
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,678
We're just eating.

23
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:42,018
Wow. Kimchi fried rice,
kimchi, and kimchi cup noodles.

24
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,146
Koreans just can't live
without their kimchi.

25
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,732
None of my friends can make it.

26
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,692
Their favorite idols have an event,

27
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,653
so they're going to give them gifts.

28
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:55,115
We can't find someone this late.
Should I just cancel?

29
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,784
No! I've been dying to
meet Korean soldiers

30
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:00,370
ever since I watched
Descendants of the Sun.

31
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:04,582
Hey, Se-wan. Skip your job tomorrow
and come with us.

32
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,127
-Where?
-Carson's boyfriend said

33
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,379
his senior officers want him
to set them up.

34
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,382
So we're having a group blind date
when she visits him tomorrow.

35
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,633
What for?

36
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,385
I can't.

37
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,845
You can't go even if you want to.

38
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:20,598
His senior officers want
foreigner girlfriends like me,

39
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,434
and asked me to bring foreigners
who live in the dorm.

40
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,604
What? Are they discriminating
against me for being Korean?

41
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,735
An AI speaker? Where did you get it?

42
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,823
My friend Dimitry, who works
at our schools' AI lab, gave it to me.

43
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,742
It's a beta version.
He asked me to test it out.

44
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,954
Hello, Master.

45
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,414
"Master"? I don't think so.

46
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,040
It's my philosophy

47
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,918
that all entities are free and equal.

48
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,839
Thus, just think of me as a friend
and speak comfortably, okay?

49
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,258
Mom, send me 300,000 won
for a new puffer coat.

50
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,761
I'm the only one
without a long puffer coat.

51
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,222
I've asked you to get me one
for the last four years.

52
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,765
Please, give me some money.

53
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:06,811
You always say we don't have enough.
I'll just freeze to death.

54
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,938
You're so immature. What are you, a child?

55
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,273
Do you want it that badly?

56
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:13,943
Everyone looks like a penguin
in those puffer coats in the winter.

57
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,070
I can't tell who's who.

58
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:19,699
Hey, guys. Bro's Quiz Attack is coming.
They're coming tomorrow.

59
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,201
What? Really?

60
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,536
"Bro's Quiz Attack"? What's that?

61
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,206
It is an online speed quiz game

62
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,416
operated by online quiz app Bro's Quiz.

63
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:32,003
Teams of two compete
in one-minute speed quiz games,

64
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:36,507
and the top three teams win prizes.

65
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,510
They will be in Daehak-dong,
at 2 p.m. tomorrow, sir.

66
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:40,720
I see.

67
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:44,307
But why are you using honorifics?
I said to talk like a friend.

68
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,726
I got it, punk. You're so whiny.

69
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:47,644
What the…

70
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,565
Thanks for the food. I'll do the dishes.

71
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,567
No, I'll wash them. Just leave them.

72
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,194
It's okay. I'll do them.

73
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,447
What's going on here?

74
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,283
Why are you acting like newlyweds?

75
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,244
Are you two really dating?

76
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,828
What the hell?

77
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:06,955
"I'll do them."

78
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,748
"No. I'll do them."

79
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,459
I'll kill you.

80
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,420
-She cooked, so I should clean.
-No. I'll do them…

81
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,095
I said I'd do them.

82
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,391
What the heck? You ripped his shirt.

83
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,476
You're so tough.

84
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,436
It's okay. It's nice and cool.

85
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,188
It'll be easier to do the dishes.

86
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,443
What the heck? He erased it already?

87
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,280
Was he teasing me
when he already erased it?

88
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,614
That asshole.

89
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,408
Who should I take?

90
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,285
Hold on. Let me look.

91
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,745
Soldiers? That's nice.

92
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,248
A blind date sounds like fun.

93
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:53,876
I want to get my fill of the scent of men.
Should I join you?

94
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,628
They want to meet foreigners.

95
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,839
I'll pretend to be one.

96
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,424
I studied Japanese.

97
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,051
Hello, I'm Park Se-wan.

98
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,678
Park Se-wan is Korean.

99
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,971
You need a Japanese name.

100
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,264
Again.

101
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,518
Hello. I'm Yoshiki Geshiki.

102
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,065
It's funny,
but you'll be found out immediately.

103
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,651
Why? Then how about Chinese?

104
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:19,569
Hello, everyone.

105
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,322
I'm speechless.

106
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,990
You erased it already?

107
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,116
A blind date?

108
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,451
She said I was hers.

109
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,202
The scent of men?

110
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,787
Yoshiki Geshiki?

111
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,043
Terris. Team up with me. Please?

112
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,170
Do the speed quiz with you?

113
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,172
So we can be humiliated?

114
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,548
I'm not interested.

115
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,550
I knew it. I knew you'd say no.

116
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:43,468
Hans!

117
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,427
Don't even ask.

118
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,888
Don't you see me conversing with an AI?

119
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,098
I don't want to deal with morons like you.

120
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,601
Morons? Forget it.

121
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:54,020
Not my first choice,
but Hyun-min. Join me.

122
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:54,979
No thanks.

123
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:55,980
Just my two cents.

124
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,316
I'm physically allergic to knowledge.

125
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:02,487
It's not like I want to do it.
This is for you.

126
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,907
One of the prizes
is a puffer jacket. Look.

127
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,035
The second place prize
is the latest puffer coat.

128
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,537
This is the one I wanted to get.

129
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,623
This is the second place prize? I'm in.

130
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,917
Okay, I'm in. Let's do this, SamSam.

131
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,002
The two idiots have teamed up.

132
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:21,047
Second place? Whatever.
You'll probably humiliate our school.

133
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,132
Stop underestimating us.

134
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:26,177
This has nothing to do with knowledge
or intelligence.

135
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,304
Your instincts are much more important.

136
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,722
Let's practice.

137
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:30,807
Ask me a question.

138
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:35,228
What do you call an animal
without bones, like a squid and octopus?

139
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,940
I know it's just practice,
but that's too easy.

140
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:39,982
Go on.

141
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,567
Animals without bones.

142
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,986
"Boneless animals." There.

143
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,532
Get lost, you moron!

144
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,076
You broke up in less than 30 seconds
after teaming up.

145
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:52,412
Terris.

146
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,955
Please do it with me.

147
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,289
Let me test you.

148
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,583
-As per Einstein's theory of relativity--
-Hey.

149
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,252
Why would that be on a speed quiz?

150
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,421
That would be
in a physics midterm at Harvard.

151
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,048
Harvard doesn't have physics midterms.

152
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:08,052
Why not? They have midterms.
You know nothing. Stop being cocky.

153
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,971
See? She says they do!

154
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,514
Please, Terris.

155
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,517
I told you. In my country of Trinidad,

156
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,688
I'm in the top 0.0003 percent.
I'm a genius.

157
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:23,359
To partake in this publicity stunt
is to defame my reputation voluntarily.

158
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,820
Fine, smart and all-knowing Terris.

159
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:29,282
Can't you use your brain power
to help your poor friend?

160
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:32,452
Don't you have it in your heart
to help out a friend in need?

161
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,705
Plus, we have to come in second

162
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,165
if we want that puffer.

163
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,125
But I don't do second place.

164
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,710
I was admitted with the highest score,

165
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,714
and I've always been the top of my class
in my department.

166
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,424
I can't come in second.

167
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:49,051
Fine, I got it. I don't need you.

168
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,271
Thank you so much for driving us, Jamie.

169
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:04,233
You never drove in Korea though.
Won't it be dangerous?

170
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,486
Don't worry. I have an international
license and I'm a good driver.

171
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:10,239
A rental car is much better than the bus.

172
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,492
What's taking Se-wan so long?

173
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,410
Did she decide not to go?

174
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,329
There she is.

175
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:18,956
-Sorry.
-Hi.

176
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,583
I was late because of work.

177
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,378
Nice. You're looking good today.

178
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,297
Dress like that regularly

179
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,424
instead of looking like a bum
all the time.

180
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,261
It's only because I don't dress up.
But once I do, I'm unstoppable.

181
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,640
Who is she trying to impress?

182
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,434
She wrote on my arm
that I was hers just the other day.

183
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,602
What the heck?

184
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,729
He's so cute that he stands out as he is.

185
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,940
Why did he dress up like that?

186
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,983
Is he trying to pick up a female soldier?

187
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,820
You're going on a blind date
to piss me off, aren't you?

188
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,490
What about your job?
Shouldn't you be making money?

189
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:56,244
You tagged along because you're pissed
that I'm going on a blind date.

190
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,579
You messed with me first.
It's my turn today.

191
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,582
Hey. Aren't we going?

192
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,543
Okay, we'll go.

193
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,257
Terris is infamous for being an asshole,

194
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,052
but you're an intellectual
that values humanism.

195
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:16,556
I get your point,
but I don't want to use my intelligence

196
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,766
in a cheap competition for a puffer.

197
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:19,809
How could you?

198
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,227
Just my two cents.

199
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,105
I think being smart
like you guys is useless.

200
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,149
Intelligence is useful only if you use it.

201
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,402
It's your friend's wish,
but you ignore him.

202
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,654
You're like machines with no compassion.

203
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,906
You really are too mean.

204
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,491
You're offending this machine.

205
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,369
Stay out of it. Don't annoy me,
you hunk of metal.

206
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:41,747
Why is that asshole
suddenly giving me crap?

207
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:42,999
What? Do you want to die?

208
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,250
Come over here.

209
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,335
That's no way for a machine
to treat a human.

210
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,295
Stop right now.

211
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,840
Gosh. What happened to being friends?
What a prick.

212
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,592
"A prick"?

213
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,138
Sorry. Hyun-min.

214
00:09:57,221 --> 00:10:01,100
If it's between man and machine,
naturally, I'll side with the human.

215
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,144
Let me apologize on its behalf.

216
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,228
Apologize?

217
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,647
Do the quiz show with me.

218
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,232
I'll accept your apology then.

219
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:16,157
What? Minnie went on a blind date?
And she's not answering her phone?

220
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,869
Right. She went behind my back.
She didn't even tell me.

221
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:24,624
She knew she'd be chopped liver
if she brought me.

222
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,208
That's why she took Se-wan.

223
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:30,588
So, are you saying
you're prettier than Se-wan?

224
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:31,672
Aren't I?

225
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,091
What the hell? I'm offended.

226
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:37,470
-Screw that. Forget the speed quiz.
-No, that's not what I meant--

227
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:38,596
Forget it.

228
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,390
What do you think about this site?
Isn't it convenient?

229
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,477
I applied for school through them
when I first came to Korea.

230
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,357
I was thinking of transferring
to another major. This is good.

231
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,317
It's in Korean,

232
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,611
so it's easy to use for people like you
who don't know English.

233
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,154
What?

234
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,614
What are you talking about?

235
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:59,533
I speak seven languages,
including English.

236
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,493
Really?

237
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,620
You must be super smart.

238
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:05,081
Will you do the speed quiz with me?

239
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,210
Hey. She's an ignoramus.

240
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,753
What's the capital of Vietnam?

241
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:11,921
Ho Chi Minh.

242
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,923
See? She doesn't know anything.

243
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,675
She's right. Ho Chi Minh.

244
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,221
It's Hanoi. Hanoi.

245
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,223
You're just as ignorant.

246
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,475
I won't do the speed quiz with you.

247
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,851
Dagnabbit.

248
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,103
Dagnabbit.

249
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,649
Why does a military base look like this?

250
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:32,900
It's a prison.

251
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,152
What? Prison?

252
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:36,737
Jail?

253
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,280
Your boyfriend is in jail?

254
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,033
Yes. Sergeant Kim
is a corrections officer.

255
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,368
His unit guards prisons.

256
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,912
I was excited because I thought
it was a real army

257
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,248
like in Descendants of the Sun.

258
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,333
What the heck? A prison?

259
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,420
Wait. Prison?

260
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,631
As in Prison Playbook?

261
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:56,757
Exactly.

262
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:00,970
I was really moved by Korean prisons
after watching that drama.

263
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,305
I'm really at one of those prisons.

264
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,390
For real?

265
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,939
This is bad.

266
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:15,568
We have to submit names of visitors
in advance, so I sent them yesterday.

267
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,570
Jamie wasn't included,
so he can't come in.

268
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:18,863
Then what?

269
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,865
I'm really sorry, Jamie.

270
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:24,368
I don't know when we'll be done.
I feel bad asking you to wait.

271
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,578
Do you want to go back?

272
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,913
We can just take the bus back.

273
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,874
He's the one who wanted to tag along.

274
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,167
Make him wait.

275
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,670
Yes, I can wait. It's fine. Have fun.

276
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,213
Are you sure?

277
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,341
We don't have a single second to waste.

278
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,718
We should go now.

279
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,559
KANG HO-DONG'S BRO'S QUIZ

280
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,814
Why isn't Hans here yet?

281
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,696
Hans, are you here? Where are you?

282
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,156
I'm right behind you.

283
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,492
-What? You are?
-Yes.

284
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,535
Hey, you made it.

285
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,415
-Terris. Why are you here?
-I'm playing with Hans.

286
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,417
What? Hans!

287
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,836
What's this about?
You agreed to be on my team!

288
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,797
If I'm going to do it,
I want to come in first.

289
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,590
What? You asshole!

290
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,091
How could you do this to me?

291
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,134
Why not?

292
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,845
Do you know what distinguishes humans
from machines?

293
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,263
We have desires.

294
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,642
It's only human nature
to pursue fame, pride,

295
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,477
and material gain.

296
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,145
How humanistic is this?

297
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,232
I'm the idiot
for trusting the likes of you.

298
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,317
Say hi.

299
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,735
Hello.

300
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:40,820
Hello.

301
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,489
Thank you for coming all this way.

302
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,908
Let's have fun today.

303
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:50,371
Don't you have soldiers like the ones
in Descendants of the Sun?

304
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:54,375
This is the military,
so there must be lots of soldiers.

305
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,378
Why did you have to bring
people like them?

306
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,384
She's kidding. She's not funny, is she?

307
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,847
It's fine.

308
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,099
She has a unique sense of humor.

309
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,433
-She's funny.
-What?

310
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,727
Don't you talk like,
"That is not true, sir?"

311
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,855
It's very different from the drama.

312
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,233
Well, we don't speak like that
in the military anymore.

313
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,360
Wait. Who's that?

314
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,195
That super good looking guy.

315
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:26,282
He's new. He just joined our unit.

316
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,908
Private! Come here.

317
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,786
Yes, sir! Private Yoo Si-jin.

318
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,246
YOO SI-JIN

319
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,457
Wow. It really is Yoo Si-jin.

320
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,835
Captain Yoo Si-jin
of Descendants of the Sun!

321
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,088
No, ma'am. I just have the same name.

322
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,590
I am not a captain, ma'am.

323
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:46,051
He looks just like the soldier
from the drama.

324
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,595
You're so cool.

325
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,347
Excuse me. Can he be my partner?

326
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,473
Hey, you…

327
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,769
The person you have reached…

328
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,605
Not a single person is picking up.

329
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,357
What have I been doing with my life?

330
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,193
Registration is almost over.

331
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,988
It's a great chance to get a puffer.

332
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,119
What? Speak Korean.

333
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,996
You speak Korean so well.

334
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,664
I'm Korean, so speak Korean.

335
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,500
Will you buy me cigarettes?
Two packs. You can keep the change.

336
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,336
Really? Okay.

337
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:24,173
Is that what you expected?
You punk. You're too young to be smoking.

338
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,299
They're not for me.

339
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,592
They're for my friends.

340
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:27,676
Are you a gopher?

341
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,555
I was in charge of lunch until last month.
I've been promoted to get cigarettes now.

342
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,308
Congratulations on your promotion.

343
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,268
But I can't help you.

344
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,436
I'm not like that.

345
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,188
Damn it. What do I do?

346
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,149
Hold on. What grade are you in?

347
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,400
I'm a senior.

348
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:47,363
What? Then you must be smart
since you're studying for college.

349
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,405
Awesome.

350
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,991
I'll get you the cigarettes,
so do something with me.

351
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,451
You mean it? But what?

352
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:53,786
Just come with me.

353
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,498
"What should I do?

354
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,667
Should I apologize or say I like you?"

355
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,709
Pardon?

356
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,128
What…

357
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,046
Come on.

358
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,799
It's from Descendants of the Sun,
Captain Yoo.

359
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,176
I am not a captain, ma'am.

360
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,469
I am Private Yoo, ma'am.

361
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,596
You even talk like a soldier.

362
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,099
Can you give me a salute? Just once?

363
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,854
I cannot salute just anyone, ma'am.

364
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,190
Just once.

365
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:26,193
Si-jin. Just do it for her.

366
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,904
Private Yoo Si-jin. Yes, sir!

367
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:31,782
Salute!

368
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,076
That's so cool.

369
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:36,537
What the heck?

370
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,706
You said she was cute.

371
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,790
She's a nut.

372
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:43,585
She watched Descendants of the Sun
and is a bit hyped up.

373
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,587
I heard you were from Japan.

374
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,297
Yes.

375
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,384
I am a Korean soldier.

376
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,346
This is Korean sushi. Delicious.

377
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,891
Yum yum together, okay?

378
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:58,809
I'm on a diet.

379
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,854
Thank goodness. You speak Korean.

380
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:06,942
I am a huge fan of Japanese anime. Really.

381
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:13,282
Do you not like me because I'm ugly?

382
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,450
Yes.

383
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,829
I mean, no.

384
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:23,292
I see. You misunderstood me.

385
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,877
Why is she so grumpy?

386
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,796
Look at the guy. He's a total ass.

387
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,721
A speed quiz?
I don't know if I'd be of help.

388
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:39,641
What do you mean? You're a senior.
You must've studied for college.

389
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,478
No. I gave up long ago
since I didn't want to go to college.

390
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,437
What?

391
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,105
Do you get bad grades?

392
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,149
Yes. I'm in the bottom of my class.

393
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,443
Gosh. Why didn't you tell me sooner?

394
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:52,821
KANG HO-DONG'S BRO'S QUIZ

395
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,114
Bro's Quiz.

396
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:58,243
We're finally in Daehak-dong!

397
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,873
Okay. First team. Please come up!

398
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,711
Okay. You get one minute for the quiz.
Let's begin.

399
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:08,670
WHACKO

400
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,048
What do you call someone who's weird?

401
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,132
Someone who's weird?

402
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,885
No. It's close.

403
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,554
-You guys call me that too.
-Hans.

404
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,599
-No. Longer.
-Longer?

405
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:21,934
Haaans?

406
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,685
No! Like a nickname.

407
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,979
What do you call kids
who do strange things?

408
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,022
Strange things?

409
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,316
-Yes! Pervert!
-No! Not that.

410
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,442
You know. This.

411
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,902
Spinning on your head?

412
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,154
-Head spin?
-No!

413
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:38,033
Listen. What the kids call me to tease me.

414
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,786
Heartless prick. Pigheaded? Frustrating?

415
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,746
You really are frustrating.
Explain better.

416
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,623
-Pass.
-We're not passing.

417
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,917
No. Calm down, and explain slowly.

418
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,586
-Why can't you control your emotions?
-What do you mean?

419
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:53,132
I'm the most rational,
reasonable person in the world.

420
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,258
You should calm down

421
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,467
before you pee again.

422
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,969
When did I do that?

423
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:59,555
You were scared of teenage thugs
and peed your pants.

424
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,306
Why are you bringing that up?

425
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,808
You threw up at an interview.

426
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,268
Why are you bringing that up?

427
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,436
You started saying strange things.

428
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,606
This is a shame.

429
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,316
The minute is up.

430
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,527
-Serves them right.
-Next team! Please come up!

431
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,695
They got none.

432
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:18,574
The Zombie Sisters got eight!
You're currently in first place!

433
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,202
Next team, come right up!

434
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,370
It's us.

435
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:24,830
Do well.

436
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:25,914
SPEED QUIZ

437
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:30,586
Okay, you get one minute.
Speed Quiz. Begin.

438
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,712
TENNIS

439
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,755
You're fighting. You hit him.

440
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,717
You hit him nine times, then again.
How many hits is that?

441
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,759
Then ten hits?

442
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,261
Put them together. Faster.

443
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,345
Ten hits. Tennis.

444
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,389
-Not water, but?
-Fire.

445
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,266
What's four in Korean?

446
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,934
"Sa"? Fire sa?

447
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,561
Sapphire.

448
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:52,316
Do you need help?
If you're here to visit someone,

449
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:55,110
you should head this way and take a right.

450
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,778
Well, the thing is…

451
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,282
Do you want to see something cute?

452
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,366
No…

453
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:05,454
Tears. Worry. Growl.

454
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,664
This is it, right? Are these your friends?

455
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,000
-Salute.
-Salute.

456
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,962
He couldn't come in
because he didn't request a visit.

457
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,548
I know rules are important,
but that's wrong.

458
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,592
-He traveled so far.
-You're right, ma'am.

459
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,844
This looks fun. May I join you?

460
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,846
Yes. Of course, ma'am. Please.

461
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,809
Alcohol made from grains.

462
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,936
Beer?

463
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,480
What the killer said to the beer
as he killed it.

464
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,023
Die beer.

465
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:36,485
-Diaper!
-You got six. You're two behind first.

466
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:40,072
-Yes! We're in second place! I made it!
-You have enough time left.

467
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,032
-Yes! The puffer coat!
-What are you doing? Next!

468
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,617
No. It's okay.

469
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,577
-Hush.
-Hush? You can't talk?

470
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,703
Sign language?

471
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,874
You're only one behind first place.

472
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,501
That's not it. How frustrating.

473
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,294
What? You feel stuffy?

474
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,587
You're congested? Congestion?

475
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,381
CONGESTION

476
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,841
You're tied for first!

477
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:00,801
Hurry! Next one!

478
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:04,429
You freak! That's not it! No!

479
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,515
-X? The letter X?
-No!

480
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,641
No!

481
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:08,850
X-Man? Yu Jae-suk?

482
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,813
Kang Ho-dong?

483
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:17,359
Okay, then. You got nine correct!

484
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,404
Team Two Cents came in first!

485
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,530
Congratulations!

486
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,248
I saw you standing there
and you were so handsome,

487
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,125
I couldn't help but notice you.

488
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,421
You're also cool.
I've never met a female soldier before.

489
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:42,009
You're such a gentleman.
It must be because you're American.

490
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,722
What's your number? Quickly.

491
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,015
I'm sorry,

492
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,766
but I have a girlfriend.

493
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,524
Are those handcuffs real?

494
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,236
Yes, they are.

495
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,613
Please slap them on me.

496
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,824
I want to try. Please?

497
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,160
Hurry!

498
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,374
I'd like to take you

499
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,127
to a nice Korean restaurant
when I'm on leave.

500
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,295
May I have your number?

501
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,547
Well…

502
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,051
You're playing too hard to get.

503
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:27,262
I thought Japanese women were cute
and friendly.

504
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:29,723
I'm Korean.

505
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:30,682
What?

506
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,269
Hey. She says she's Korean.

507
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,396
I asked for a foreigner.

508
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,231
I'm sorry I'm Korean.

509
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,153
You shouldn't tell people you're Korean
for the sake of the country.

510
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,743
Wait! Excuse me!

511
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,872
Excuse me. You can't do this, ma'am.

512
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,082
Uncuff me please.

513
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,877
You know, I really like you.

514
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,295
What will you do?

515
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,131
Will you go out with me or not?

516
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,384
Give me your number.

517
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,345
Please stop that
and give me the key, ma'am.

518
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:11,807
What? If you keep that up,
I'll make sure we can never be apart.

519
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,766
I'll swallow it.

520
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,109
QUEEN'S RICE

521
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,778
What the heck? A rice cooker?

522
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:26,613
Queen's Rice?

523
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:29,241
What is this crap?
Why did you answer them?

524
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,534
We were in second place.

525
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,869
I guessed correctly and got us
in the first place.

526
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,413
So what's your problem?

527
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,666
I can't believe this. Why did you…

528
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,460
Go get me the cigarettes.

529
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,878
And split the prize.

530
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,046
I won't do it.

531
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,381
You shouldn't be smoking.

532
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:47,384
I knew it. You can't trust adults
to keep their word.

533
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,677
Just split the prize.

534
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,011
How can we split this?

535
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,472
How do we split a rice cooker?

536
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,433
Do you want the lid?

537
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,143
You're so lame.

538
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,603
You can sell it online
and split the money.

539
00:23:58,687 --> 00:23:59,521
What?

540
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,316
That would work.
I can buy a puffer coat with that.

541
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,862
That works. I only thought of
coming in second.

542
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,156
You're super smart.

543
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,949
Hey. Post this online.

544
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,460
I can't get it out.

545
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,336
Maybe it went too far down.

546
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,005
Then crap it out.

547
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,756
We won't make it home at this rate.

548
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,678
My arm hurts. Go easy, will you?

549
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:34,389
I'm trying to get comfortable.

550
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:39,394
I cannot change positions midway, sir!

551
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,990
I think Se-wan got mad and left.

552
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,492
I should go look for her.

553
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,160
You should go.

554
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,119
She must be nearby.

555
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,371
Take Minnie and go home.

556
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,040
I'll take the bus with Se-wan.

557
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,166
Okay.

558
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,639
The person you have reached…

559
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:16,890
She won't pick up.

560
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,726
Where is she?
She doesn't even know the area.

561
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:28,068
Excuse me. Are you the one
selling the rice cooker?

562
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,487
Yes. You requested
the in-person sale, right?

563
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,031
I didn't know you were a foreigner.

564
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,117
You speak Korean so well.

565
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,078
He's Korean, born and raised.

566
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,497
I see.

567
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,457
May I check the product?

568
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,833
It's new, right?

569
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,126
Of course.

570
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,755
I received it as a prize today.

571
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:52,092
You really never used it?

572
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,761
Does it even work?

573
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:57,556
I'm sure it does. It's brand new.

574
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,770
Is it broken? Why are you selling it
for so cheap if it's new?

575
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,065
What if it's broken?

576
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,775
It works fine.

577
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:11,236
I'm selling it for cheap
because I need the cash.

578
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,740
It'll be a pain if it doesn't work
because I got it for cheap.

579
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,535
If you don't trust me, test it out.

580
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,834
We'll cook the rice now.

581
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,460
Why are you so distrusting?

582
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,462
You don't need to go this far.

583
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,009
Okay, let's begin.

584
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,452
Se-wan! Park Se-wan!

585
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,253
Hey, Se-wan.

586
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,260
I was looking for you.
Why didn't you pick up?

587
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,225
What were you doing here alone?

588
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,770
Were you here the whole time?

589
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:27,854
Yes.

590
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,691
What is it? Is something wrong?

591
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,401
Is something wrong?

592
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,323
Something is always wrong.

593
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:41,201
I had just forgotten, that's all.

594
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,789
I was so sick of living

595
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,125
that I hated waking up in the morning.

596
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,586
I'd wish…

597
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,716
the world would come to an end
so that there would be no tomorrow.

598
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,180
But it was fun thanks to you.

599
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:06,810
When I woke up in the morning
and before I went to sleep,

600
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,396
it would tickle right here.

601
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,860
But after getting all dressed up today

602
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,571
to make you jealous,

603
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:22,742
my reality slapped me across the face
when I got there.

604
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,246
What do you mean?

605
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,464
After my dad's company went under,

606
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,552
he was sent to prison for fraud.
It has been years.

607
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:45,014
I never went to visit him,

608
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:48,101
but I went to one for a blind date.

609
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,061
My mom…

610
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:54,149
hasn't come to her senses,
and borrows money from loan sharks

611
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,152
and makes her creditors
come for me at my school.

612
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,531
That's my reality.

613
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,910
No matter how hard I try,
I can't escape from it.

614
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,208
This is why I shouldn't get excited
because of you,

615
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:17,714
and why I can't like you.

616
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:45,325
Around 7 p.m. tonight,

617
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,869
there was an electrical accident
in Daehak-dong,

618
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:51,456
causing a 30-minute delay
in the subway system.

619
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,125
-According to the police investigation…
-We missed the last bus.

620
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,002
What should we do?

621
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:59,297
Darn it. What else?
We have to take the first bus.

622
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,972
I'm hungry.

623
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,352
Eat this.

624
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,937
Where did you get this?

625
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,022
Is it product placement?

626
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,690
You haven't eaten all day.

627
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,617
Eat this too.

628
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,871
Is this our third night together?

629
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:34,582
No. Is it the fourth
if we count the basement storage room?

630
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,960
We always spend the night together.

631
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:48,680
What is that?

632
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:52,141
Hey. Why did you take a picture of this?

633
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,352
It'll rub off eventually.

634
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:55,895
I wanted to keep it forever.

635
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,278
