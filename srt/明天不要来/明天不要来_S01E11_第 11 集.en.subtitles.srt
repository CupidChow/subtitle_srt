1
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,489
We're having an open house already?

2
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,575
This semester's over already.

3
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:36,953
I hear the talent show prize is no joke
this year.

4
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,372
First place gets a top-of-the-line laptop.

5
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,167
-Are you entering too?
-Of course.

6
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,963
One kid last year blew fire with his mouth
and burned his hair from what I recall.

7
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,132
One kid tried to do a cover of Twice

8
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,301
and got hit by a beer can
from what I recall.

9
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,845
-Why you…
-Bring it!

10
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,263
There you go again.

11
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:58,683
How long will you keep this up?
Make up already, won't you?

12
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,310
Do you have a date yet?

13
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,644
A date? What date?

14
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:05,190
It's tradition to bring a date
to the open house afterparty.

15
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:07,817
There's a fine
if you bail or don't bring a date.

16
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,945
It's sad enough not having a date.
I have to pay a fine too?

17
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,781
Just kill me, why don't you?

18
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:16,826
Last year, Sam didn't bring a date,
so he paid 100,000 won.

19
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,705
Se-wan got wasted, caused a scene,
and didn't pay.

20
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,458
Carson. Who are you bringing this year?

21
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,210
You brought Sergeant Kim last year.

22
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,420
Why are you bringing up that bastard?

23
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,880
Dagnabbit.

24
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:31,633
I'm going to rest quietly alone this year.

25
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,093
What do you mean?

26
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,513
You're supposed to party it up
even harder after a breakup.

27
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,931
Leave it to me.

28
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,850
I'll find you a date.
Let's go on a blind date!

29
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,144
No thanks. I can't be bothered.

30
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,525
Please, just one girl.

31
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,902
You have countless girls stored away.

32
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,529
Give me just one.

33
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,240
Hey. Just make up with Minnie already.

34
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,243
If you keep being petty
because of your stupid pride,

35
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,327
you'll lose her for good.

36
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:03,039
She wants you to be clear
about how you feel. Don't you get that?

37
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,041
Hyun-min, what type do you want?

38
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,918
Forget it. I don't want one from you.

39
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,253
Why not?

40
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,338
I feel bad about Ju-ri,

41
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:12,382
so I'll make sure you get a date.

42
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,760
Yes. I know someone perfect for you.

43
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:16,845
Just my two cents.

44
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:20,932
If you truly repent what you did to me,
I'll consider it.

45
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:24,018
I truly repent. Please give me a chance

46
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,354
to wash away this guilt
weighing on my heart.

47
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,481
-What about me?
-No way.

48
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,817
They'll give me crap
for setting them up with you.

49
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,155
I don't believe how Terris goes around
acting like a Casanova.

50
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,157
I think it's all an act.

51
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,576
He goes out with them
then breaks right after.

52
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,328
Seeing him repeat that
lets me know he has a problem.

53
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:47,292
Give me a break. You're the one
with the messiest love life.

54
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,461
Anyway. I knew you'd refuse,

55
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,589
so I prepared a secret weapon.

56
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,008
Ta-da.

57
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:58,094
It's the latest dating app.
It has a huge success rate.

58
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,597
Hyun-min. You should try this app.

59
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,140
They're paying you, aren't they?

60
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,058
It's product placement!

61
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,019
You're entering the talent show?

62
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,103
Yes.

63
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,980
I'm surprised. What will you do?

64
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,274
Why are you surprised?
I'm a really good singer.

65
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,277
-You are?
-Why do you look so shocked?

66
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,363
I'm not. It's just unexpected, that's all.

67
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,491
It's only because I never sang
in front of the others.

68
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,535
If I did, they'd go crazy.

69
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,500
My childhood dream was to become a singer.

70
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,337
A skilled vocalist
who competes purely by her voice alone.

71
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,672
-Really?
-Yes.

72
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,591
Why did you keep it a secret?

73
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,259
I have my reasons.

74
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:42,805
Sam, that prick.

75
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,641
It's over if he doesn't apologize
by today.

76
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:48,061
I was debating whether or not
to go out with him anyway, so no loss.

77
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,690
Damn it. What kind of an asshole…

78
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,637
I really wanted to
become a singer when I was young.

79
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,640
I always put down "singer"
as my career goal.

80
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,602
My mom was really against it at first,

81
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,981
but after a while,
she looked into schools in Italy.

82
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,024
You may have become an amazing singer.

83
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,528
It's such a waste
to keep that talent hidden away.

84
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,239
It still bothers me even now.

85
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,741
Couldn't you pursue it while studying?

86
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,996
I wanted to.

87
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:51,249
But my family went bankrupt
when I was in high school,

88
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,918
and I couldn't afford
to dream of becoming a singer.

89
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,839
Singing lessons were too expensive,
so I stopped and gave it up.

90
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:02,302
I'm no longer in a position
in which I can do

91
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,762
whatever I want.

92
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:09,642
I see.

93
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,730
But we're too young to give up.

94
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,023
It's not too late--

95
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:18,359
I think it'll be better
to live an ordinary life.

96
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,611
But I wonder at times

97
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,156
how it would've been
if my family didn't go under

98
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,783
and I could do what I wanted.

99
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,869
Of course. You should do what you want.

100
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,872
There are many singing competition shows.

101
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,290
Did you try going on those?

102
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,499
Forget it.

103
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,837
Jamie. You have to keep this between us.

104
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,048
No one knows that I'm a good singer.

105
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:41,924
Okay.

106
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,886
But won't they find out
if you sing at the talent show?

107
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,597
Yes. I want to surprise them.

108
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,895
The thought of singing on stage again
after all these years

109
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,105
gets me so excited.

110
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,524
My heart is racing already.

111
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,276
I'm sure.

112
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,363
I'm going to karaoke to practice.
Would you go with me?

113
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,530
Of course.

114
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,992
-What's wrong?
-What?

115
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:10,787
Nothing.

116
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,622
Dust got in my eyes.

117
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:14,624
Stupid dust.

118
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:20,755
Yes. I'll subtly ask her
if she has a date for tomorrow.

119
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:24,300
As Terris said,
Minnie may be waiting for me to ask.

120
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,510
That's right.

121
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:29,931
What's that?

122
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,434
Someone at our school
drives a car like that?

123
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,404
What the hell?
Why is Minnie getting out of that car?

124
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,574
-What? You met Eoksour?
-What? You met Eoksour?

125
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:49,617
Yes.

126
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,743
Who's that?

127
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:51,744
You don't know?

128
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,913
The management grad student.

129
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,331
The oil tycoon's son.

130
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,543
They call him "Eoksour"
because he's even wealthier than Mansour.

131
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:01,212
He's also exceptionally good looking,

132
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:05,007
and has great manners, so it's "Eoksour"
as in "eok," meaning 100 million.

133
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,177
I know. He really has the best manners
as the rumors say.

134
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,346
He took me to the hospital right away

135
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,849
and took me to a designer mall
to buy me new clothes

136
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,892
because I spilled coffee on mine.

137
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,563
He was so dependable and thoughtful.

138
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:21,065
He seemed like a real man

139
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,692
unlike the boys in this dorm.

140
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,487
Plus, I think he fell for me.

141
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,824
Like hell. Is he blind?

142
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,201
He's just throwing money around
because he's rich.

143
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,578
There he goes again.

144
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:37,248
Don't get so upset
and just admit that you're jealous.

145
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,207
Jealous?

146
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,834
I'm not jealous.

147
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,544
Do I look jealous to you?

148
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,503
Definitely not.

149
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,963
She means nothing to me.

150
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:47,091
Exactly. It's over between us.
Why should he be jealous?

151
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,386
It's him.

152
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,389
Hi, there.

153
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,892
Yes, I got home safely.

154
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,728
What? Tomorrow?

155
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,856
Of course, I'm available.

156
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,442
Bring my friends?

157
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,110
Okay. I'll ask them.

158
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:07,862
Okay.

159
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,238
Your friends? Why?

160
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,532
To buy us clothes too? Designer brands?

161
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:16,078
No. He wants to take us all out
for dinner.

162
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,289
What? If he's treating,

163
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,957
it must be expensive.

164
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,918
Tell him we're free. Quick.

165
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:22,835
Okay.

166
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,589
ROCK YOU KARAOKE

167
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,429
One, two. One, two, three.

168
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,933
It hurts

169
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,394
My throat…

170
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,771
Enjoy.

171
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,363
I haven't gone singing in so long.

172
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,157
-I'm going to warm up first.
-Okay.

173
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:54,742
Which song will you sing?

174
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,578
Well, something a little difficult.

175
00:08:58,746 --> 00:08:59,830
Hit songs.

176
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,925
Gosh. This sound is coming
from a human being?

177
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,512
How could someone sing this terribly?

178
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,640
I understand why
her mom was so against it.

179
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,186
Everyone will find out
if she sings at the talent show.

180
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,189
She'll be too embarrassed to go to school.

181
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,400
What should I do?

182
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,361
Isn't there a way?

183
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,907
My throat feels a bit tight.

184
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,284
You still sang well.

185
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,120
This song matches my voice, but…

186
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,330
Is it too easy?
Should I sing something else?

187
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,458
Se-wan.

188
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,669
Are you performing alone
at the talent show?

189
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,587
Yes. Why?

190
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,508
Do you want to do a duet with me?

191
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,594
A duet?

192
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,513
She's pretty.

193
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,557
I'll be right back. Wait here.

194
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,146
Nice, Carson. Looking good.

195
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,148
I'm not dressed up for the blind date.

196
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,609
It's for the dinner with Eoksour.

197
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,444
Terris.

198
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:12,570
Oh, hey.

199
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,991
This is my friend Il-seob.
He's a really, really great guy.

200
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,492
He's polite and thoughtful.

201
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,120
Not at all. He's too kind.

202
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,373
-How have you been?
-Good. Sit.

203
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,374
Okay.

204
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,418
This is my friend Carson.

205
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,129
Nice to meet you.

206
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,466
Terris called out of the blue

207
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,469
and said you were a great person
and that I should meet you.

208
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,679
I see. Okay.

209
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:43,059
How pretty could she be?
Terris is setting me up with her.

210
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,311
Don't get your hopes up.

211
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,582
I don't expect anyone that pretty.

212
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,669
Don't get your hopes up.

213
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,128
-Ji-eun, over here.
-Relax.

214
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,719
This is my friend Hyun-min.
This is Ji-eun.

215
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,554
Hello.

216
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,808
Yes. Hello.

217
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,435
Sit down.

218
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,561
I'll get going.

219
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,063
Enjoy yourselves.

220
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,106
You're leaving?

221
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,692
Okay. Thanks. Bye.

222
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,699
Terris is a great friend, isn't he?

223
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,867
Yes, he is.

224
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,037
I don't know if he made it clear,

225
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,832
but I'm not here for a blind date.

226
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:48,874
Excuse me?

227
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:50,918
I see.

228
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,171
I'm not interested in meeting guys
like this.

229
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,216
I broke up with someone not too long ago,

230
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,636
so I'm not interested
in meeting anyone new right now.

231
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,097
I'm sorry.

232
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:07,268
It's okay. We can just chat and hang out.

233
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,854
I completely understand.

234
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:14,066
I'm hurting because of someone too.

235
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,860
So I feel your pain.

236
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,154
You too? Just like me?

237
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,782
No. I haven't even started yet.

238
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,453
Well, I've liked someone for a while now,

239
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:29,248
but I couldn't say anything
for fear I'll be rejected.

240
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,374
I see.

241
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,918
I never would've imagined.

242
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,712
You're so beautiful.

243
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,630
No, I'm not.

244
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:40,050
She's smiling. Is she into me as well?

245
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,596
You're really good looking.

246
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,765
Are you a model?

247
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,142
No, not at all.

248
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,853
I'm just an ordinary student.

249
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,022
You're not ordinary.

250
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,691
-You're super handsome.
-What?

251
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,485
I'm handsome? Wow.

252
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,949
Since I truly loved him,

253
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,576
I have no regrets.

254
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,369
But the problem is,

255
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,581
it was all in vain. So now,

256
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,042
I have no fantasy or passion for love.

257
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:18,005
Still, at least you freely loved
with no regrets. I envy you.

258
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,840
That's true.

259
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:25,179
It was hard to talk about this
even with my close friends.

260
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:28,808
You're so comfortable to talk to
that it just came out.

261
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,226
Same for me.

262
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,438
I never imagined talking about this
on a blind date.

263
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:39,151
I hope you'll muster up the courage
to tell the person you love how you feel.

264
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,945
It's better to regret after doing it

265
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,530
than to regret never doing it.

266
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,909
Tomorrow night?

267
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,953
That's so last minute.

268
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,539
You don't have to come
if you're busy or have plans.

269
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,123
No pressure.

270
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,041
Okay.

271
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,627
I do have to pay a penalty
if I don't bring a date,

272
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,839
but I'm used to it. It's fine.

273
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,425
Okay. Well, I do have something tomorrow,

274
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,594
but I won't know until I get there.

275
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,305
I'll call you as soon as I can.

276
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,515
Do you mean it?

277
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,434
Thank you. Thank you so much.

278
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,606
Something you can only say
If you love someone

279
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,819
You don't listen to me
So you think I'm nagging

280
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:26,574
Let's stop
Let's stop

281
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:30,244
Please trust my feelings for you

282
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,417
What do you think?

283
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,509
Don't be too offended, okay?
I'm just trying to be constructive.

284
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:51,098
First. You keep going off-key.

285
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:54,059
You need to work on keeping the beat too.

286
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,728
-Really?
-Yes.

287
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,772
Ever hear about half-air and half-sound?

288
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,984
You need to split it exactly in half.

289
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,114
I must've saved a country in my past life.

290
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,158
How could I meet such a great girl?

291
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,036
Terris. Thank you so much.

292
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,829
See? What did I tell you?

293
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,164
Good luck.

294
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,124
So? Is she coming to the party?

295
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,752
Yes. She has plans,
but she'll check and let me know.

296
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,755
Do you think she'll really come?

297
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,090
She's too good for me.

298
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,551
I shouldn't get my hopes up.

299
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,930
Why would a girl like her
want a guy like me?

300
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,392
No. The entire time we were talking,
she was smiling

301
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,727
and totally receptive.

302
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,145
Carson, how was your date?

303
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,731
Okay. He seems like a nice guy.

304
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,316
Right? Is he coming tomorrow?

305
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,109
Yes. I said to stop by if he's free.

306
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,819
See? I'm glad it worked out.

307
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,280
Hans. Are you having any luck
with your dating app?

308
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,200
Don't worry. You'll see tomorrow.

309
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,369
This place is super nice.

310
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,787
I've never been to a place like this.

311
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,538
We're the only ones here.

312
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,624
Maybe it's too expensive
that people can't eat here.

313
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,585
Maybe Eoksour rented out
the entire restaurant.

314
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,462
Rented it out?

315
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,339
That's our Eoksour.

316
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,133
Se-wan and Jamie can't make it.

317
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,054
They have to practice singing?
What's this?

318
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,776
They say your ears bleed,
but they wouldn't actually…

319
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,612
My gosh. This is like a sitcom.

320
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,323
Hey. Can I get a ride in Eoksour's car?

321
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,325
When else would we get a chance?

322
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,785
Okay. I'll ask.

323
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,662
Hello.

324
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,163
Hey, you're here.

325
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,249
These are my friends.

326
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,251
-Hello.
-Hello.

327
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,212
Thank you for inviting us too.

328
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,505
Enjoy the meal.

329
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,423
Thanks.

330
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,884
I'm worried that
business is slow these days.

331
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:54,847
You must own this restaurant too.

332
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,682
No. I work part-time here.

333
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:57,808
-What?
-What?

334
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,893
Why would
the son of an oil tycoon work here…

335
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,354
Are all Arab people oil tycoons?

336
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,857
My father is an average office worker,

337
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,276
so I work to pay for my expenses.

338
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,030
Friends call me Eoksour as a joke
when my name is actually Aksour.

339
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,157
Now everyone thinks I'm rich.

340
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,660
What? Then what about your outfit
and the car yesterday?

341
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:17,661
Oh, that?

342
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,913
I had a part-time job yesterday
as a model.

343
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,999
I can't drive a car like that around.

344
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,460
I took the subway over earlier.

345
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,961
Korea's transit cards rock.

346
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:30,758
If you don't have money,
why did you invite us out too?

347
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:34,094
My boss said to do some publicity
because business is so slow.

348
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,722
Please spread the word
and post a nice review.

349
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,975
Eat anything you want
up to 10,000 won per person.

350
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,151
We lied to Sam
that Eoksour proposed to you.

351
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,820
He totally fell for it
and was losing his mind.

352
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,615
We almost got caught because of you.

353
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:55,824
You're a bad actor.

354
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,160
I couldn't help it. It was just so funny.

355
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,495
Don't get caught.

356
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,376
Hey. Is it true
that Eoksour proposed to you?

357
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,754
Yes. He asked me to think about it.

358
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:12,132
He asked you to marry him?
You only met a few days ago.

359
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:15,511
Why is someone who has
nothing to do with me so worked up?

360
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,138
Sure. I have nothing to do with you,

361
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,932
but I bet this will shock you.

362
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:23,352
All men have multiple wives there.
Did you know that?

363
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,939
Don't be ignorant.
Where did you pick up that stupid rumor?

364
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,234
Also, why does it matter
if he has several wives

365
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,693
as long as he's good to me?

366
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,653
I mean…

367
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:35,614
And if you marry him,
you always have to wear a scarf.

368
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,157
And you can't go clubbing.

369
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,243
A player like you can't handle it.

370
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,370
You ignorant fool.
It's a hijab, not a scarf.

371
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,081
You have a big mouth
for being so ignorant.

372
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,875
Also, I've partied more than enough,

373
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,211
so I don't want to party anymore.
Don't worry.

374
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,171
You must be out of your mind.

375
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,798
Hey, that's not all.

376
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:56,343
You can't have pork belly and soju
that you love.

377
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,559
Here he comes.

378
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,228
Did you find a date?

379
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,522
Whatever.

380
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,607
Where's Minnie?

381
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,735
Is she with Eoksour again?

382
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,655
She's flying out to his house tonight
on his private jet.

383
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:17,990
What? His house?

384
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,243
He said he wanted to introduce her
to his family

385
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,870
and future sister-wives.

386
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:23,996
"Sister-wives"?

387
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,753
Right. Eoksour's first and second wives.

388
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,089
Yes. They call each other sister-wives.

389
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,260
Do you think Minnie will really marry him?

390
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,221
Why not?

391
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,266
Why would she pass up
this great opportunity?

392
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,769
Then will we take his private jet
to the wedding too?

393
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,856
I've never been on a private jet before.

394
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,195
Seriously. You suck.

395
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,530
We almost got caught because of you.

396
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,825
I got nervous
because I had to act in Korean.

397
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,078
The person you have called…

398
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,581
Did she turn off her phone?

399
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:12,377
What's going on? Are you very late?
What time is the flight?

400
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:16,381
Well, it's a private jet,
so I don't know the time.

401
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,926
This is more serious than I thought.

402
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,928
Don't panic, and listen carefully.

403
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,263
Private jets don't take off
from Incheon Airport.

404
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,932
What? Then where?

405
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,558
There should be a runway in Gimpo.

406
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,143
Why didn't you tell me?

407
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,188
Please turn around then. Quick.

408
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:35,192
What? She's completely tone-deaf
but she doesn't know?

409
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,611
I'm worried she'll be humiliated
in front of people.

410
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,864
I should stop her from going up there.

411
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,032
I need your help.

412
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,952
So, you want me to lock you
in the storage room

413
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,246
then let you out after it's over, right?

414
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,081
-Yes.
-Are you really going to give me

415
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,999
those limited edition sneakers then?

416
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,252
MINNIE

417
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,254
Minnie. Where are you?

418
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,839
You didn't leave yet, did you?

419
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,385
I'm sorry.

420
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,928
Sorry for being petty about Hans

421
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:06,014
and being immature and jealous
about Eoksour. I'm sorry.

422
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,558
If you come back to me,

423
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,812
I'll never bring up Hans again.

424
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,315
I won't be proud, and I'll be honest.

425
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:19,278
And it's a lie that I dated lots of girls.

426
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,613
You're my first. So…

427
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:23,657
don't go.

428
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,537
Mister. Are we there yet?

429
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,123
I'll have to speed if I go any faster.

430
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:34,209
If I speed, I'll get a ticket
and you'll get nauseous.

431
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,585
I choose not to speed.

432
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,587
I will go quickly though.

433
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,091
She can't leave.

434
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:44,052
Please. Please wait for me, Minnie.

435
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,140
Why do you want to rehearse now?

436
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,308
Just once.

437
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,685
-Hyun-min, put the speaker there.
-Yes, sir.

438
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,326
Why are you in here?
You're supposed to let us out.

439
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,702
You're right.

440
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,878
Please be advised.

441
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:21,006
-Travellers who are boarding…
-All the flights for tonight took off.

442
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,258
There are no other flights.

443
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,927
What? They all took off?

444
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,368
You stupid idiot.

445
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,705
You should've stopped her sooner,
you stupid idiot.

446
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,794
Minnie…

447
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,097
I'VE MISSED YOU, PORK BELLY

448
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,392
What? "Pork belly"?

449
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,029
What the hell? You scared me.

450
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:28,323
What's going on?
Didn't you go with Eoksour?

451
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,742
That's why I'm here.

452
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,661
Did you stay because of me?

453
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:33,620
Are you stupid?

454
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,956
I can deal with everything else,

455
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:39,459
but I just can't give up
pork belly and soju.

456
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,586
What? Pork belly?

457
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:46,007
Sure. What good is it
to have all the money in the world

458
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,218
if you can't eat pork
that you love so much?

459
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:49,469
I'll grill it for you.

460
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,848
I'm awesome at grilling pork belly.

461
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,017
See? What do you think?

462
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,811
You cried and begged me not to go.

463
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:00,897
That was because I thought
you went with Eoksour…

464
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,778
Did you listen to my voicemail?

465
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,783
-No. Delete it.
-What's the point?

466
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,034
I already listened to it.

467
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,828
That was because--

468
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,121
You said you'll be honest.

469
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,540
You said you won't be petty and immature.

470
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,292
Or I'll go back to Eoksour.

471
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:23,253
He'll send the private jet back right now
if I ask him to.

472
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:24,963
No. You can't.

473
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,715
I won't let you go again.

474
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:28,383
I refuse.

475
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,806
Hey. I had pork fat all over my lips.

476
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,892
Pork fat is delicious.

477
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,062
But…

478
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:45,066
didn't Eoksour buy you this outfit?

479
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,401
Why are you wearing this?

480
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,404
-Are you--
-It's a waste to throw it out.

481
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,907
Are you being petty
and getting jealous again?

482
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,743
No, I'm not. I won't get jealous anymore.

483
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:57,913
It's burning.

484
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,292
Right. The open house party.

485
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,717
DAEHAN INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY PARTY

486
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:18,141
Shit. I can't get a signal at all.

487
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,392
What the heck?

488
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,561
The talent show must be over by now.

489
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,688
Why did you bring me here to rehearse?

490
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,440
Sorry. I'm really sorry.

491
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,111
Why won't they fix that lock?

492
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,030
Damn it.

493
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:40,497
By now, I would've come in first
and received my prize.

494
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,040
Right? Jamie.

495
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:44,751
I'm going crazy too.

496
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:47,420
Ji-eun may have come.

497
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,047
Darn. This is so frustrating.

498
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,383
So why did you come in and close the door?

499
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,927
-You told me to--
-Hello!

500
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,930
Is anyone out there? Hello!

501
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,725
What are you doing here?

502
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,354
And there are three of you, too.

503
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,566
It's suspicious.

504
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,237
Were you playing go-stop?

505
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,613
Nice.

506
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,615
Let me play too.

507
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,492
Always go. Even if you don't score, go.

508
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,454
Where is everyone?

509
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:22,539
Right?

510
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,207
Hey, Se-wan.

511
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,002
You were at each other's throats before.

512
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,211
It just happened.

513
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,131
-Where are you coming from?
-Whatever.

514
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,258
Who won the talent show?

515
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:34,759
We just got here ourselves.

516
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:36,720
Why? Were you going to enter?

517
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,430
We went to the storage room to practice,

518
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:41,308
but we were locked in
and just got out now.

519
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,810
I wanted to show everyone
my singing skills.

520
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:48,148
At least you have a date this year.
That's an improvement.

521
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:50,734
Remember how you got wasted
and acted all--

522
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,485
Don't do that to my Sam!

523
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:53,987
Don't do that to my Se-wan.

524
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,780
Where are the others?

525
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:56,906
Guys.

526
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:01,661
This is Il-seob.
Terris introduced me to him yesterday.

527
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:02,954
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

528
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,039
Hello.

529
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:07,042
Where did Terris go?

530
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,169
I think he went out to pick up his date.

531
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,713
He bragged so much
about having lots of girls.

532
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,757
Let's see how pretty she is this time.

533
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,009
Wait a second. Minnie?

534
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,928
Didn't you go with Eoksour?

535
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,056
Did Sam beat Eoksour?

536
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:24,517
Of course. Eoksour is way beneath me.

537
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:25,727
You and your ego again.

538
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:29,564
He bawled and begged,
so I gave him a chance.

539
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:31,650
Hi, guys.

540
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,902
Let me introduce you to my date.

541
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,904
I met her on the dating app.
This is Ju-ri.

542
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,947
Ju-ri. Hi.

543
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,659
So she's Ju-ri.

544
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:41,910
How do you guys know her?

545
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,620
What? Even I know about her.

546
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,622
She was locked
in the storage room with us.

547
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,749
The girl that Hyun-min had a crush on

548
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,168
that Terris went out with? That Ju-ri?

549
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,628
What? With Terris?

550
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,547
You all knew?

551
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:56,841
Everyone but me?

552
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,022
Did she leave while I was downstairs?

553
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:12,649
I doubt that.

554
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,110
She wouldn't have come at all.

555
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:19,698
Why would a girl that pretty and cool
come for someone like me?

556
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,909
I got my hopes up for nothing.

557
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:27,706
Hey. It's you, right? The one who peed.

558
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:30,792
It is!

559
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,585
How can you laugh right now?

560
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,046
I was just remembering
when we were trapped.

561
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,424
It was funny. That's why I laughed.

562
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,217
How is that funny?

563
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,345
That sounds very familiar.
That petty, narrow-minded comment.

564
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,389
Hans, so you do get jealous.

565
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:47,392
Would you be okay if your girlfriend
went out with your friend?

566
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:49,811
Hey. Now that definitely
sounds very familiar.

567
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,187
-Right?
-Yes.

568
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:55,316
Weren't those earrings a gift from Terris?

569
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,901
-What? Really?
-Yes.

570
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,904
Why do you still have them?
You broke up a while ago.

571
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,740
No way. These are designer earrings.

572
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:02,949
I can't throw these out.

573
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,536
I'll ask one last time.

574
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:09,080
Is that really it?
You're not still hung up on him?

575
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,291
If I were, would I be going out with you?

576
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,209
They don't mean anything.

577
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,254
Hans. Let's give it a rest, okay?

578
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,799
Hey. Stop being so petty.

579
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,718
You're nearing the danger zone.

580
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:24,971
Why don't I see Terris anywhere?
Did he not come?

581
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,932
You're right. Where is he?

582
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,100
Guys.

583
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,561
Hey. Are you alone?

584
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,688
Where's that nice girl? Didn't she come?

585
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,857
-No, she didn't.
-Well…

586
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,025
Pay up.

587
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:38,943
Where's Terris?

588
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,571
He was bragging so much.

589
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,990
Is he hiding
because he couldn't get a date?

590
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,246
Did you go out with anyone
other than Terris?

591
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,791
-If you went out with anyone I know--
-Seriously.

592
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,667
Hey! Forget it, you petty jerk!

593
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,377
I don't need you.

594
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,629
Terris is much better.

595
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:58,963
Seriously.

596
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:03,760
No. Hyun-min. You're much better.

597
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,553
Hyun-min, will you be my date?

598
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,722
Sibelhomme likes you too.

599
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:11,059
No. Live happily ever after
with Sibelhomme.

600
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:15,271
Come on, Hyun-min. I know you like me.
Be my date! Come on!

601
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:18,191
Guys. Guys, you know…

602
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:21,528
I'll show you my secret singing skills.

603
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:22,529
No.

604
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,446
Don't do it.

605
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:27,534
-Hi.
-Hi.

606
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,701
Hey, you came.

607
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,787
-We have a good turnout.
-Yes.

608
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,373
-Drink.
-Right.

609
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:34,457
I'll have a beer.

610
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,335
-Hyun-min!
-Stay away.

611
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,420
-Stop running away!
-Get away from me.

612
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,756
Come here. Seriously.

613
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,800
Hey, Terris. What are you doing?

614
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:44,968
Il-seob is here.

615
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,678
Yes, I saw.

616
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:47,595
Hey.

617
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,014
You look great today.

618
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,482
-Shall we drink?
-Okay.

619
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:03,152
Why didn't you bring a date?
You didn't ask anyone, did you?

620
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,988
That's not it. I couldn't find one.

621
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,364
I'll pay the fine.

622
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:07,991
Why should you pay?

623
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,076
I should be the one to pay.

624
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,122
It's confusing, isn't it?

625
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:22,171
As someone with more experience
in life and love,

626
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,673
let me give you some advice.

627
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,969
Just follow your heart.
That's the best way.

628
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,847
Just follow your heart.

629
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,144
Hey. Il-seob.

630
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,607
Gosh. I think I drank way too much.

631
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,902
Il-seob. Thanks for tonight.
I'm going to turn in now.

632
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,069
Hey, Terris.

633
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,698
Walk him out, okay?

634
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,076
Shall we?

635
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,994
Sure.

636
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:56,956
Did you have fun?

637
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,416
Yes, I did.

638
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,419
-Gosh, that punk.
-I can see myself out.

639
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:02,587
It's okay.

640
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,205
