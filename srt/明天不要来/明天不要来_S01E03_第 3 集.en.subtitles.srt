1
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:26,943
I said no!

2
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,279
Just order spicy monkfish
and braised seafood!

3
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,781
I can't eat spicy food!
Why are you so selfish?

4
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,908
Let's just eat something.

5
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,994
I haven't eaten all day.

6
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:38,538
Wait. Isn't Hans getting paid today
and buying dinner?

7
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:41,708
Right. Let's take him for all he's got
while he has money.

8
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,043
It's our lucky day!

9
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,919
What should we get?

10
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,797
Since we all want different things,
how about a buffet?

11
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,924
I hear the new place
in front of the campus is good.

12
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,134
-Sure!
-Sounds great.

13
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,260
-Nice.
-I'm in!

14
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,553
Guys, it's an emergency!

15
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:56,014
North Korea launched a missile.
Did you see the news?

16
00:00:56,806 --> 00:01:01,436
The missile was seen around 6:17 a.m.
this morning.

17
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:06,316
Our Joseon's revolutionary forces
will burn down Seoul, Incheon, Busan,

18
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:10,612
everywhere in South Korea
where traitors are hiding.

19
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:14,324
We'll set all of South Korea on fire.

20
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:17,368
-This is a warning.
-See? They'll set South Korea on fire.

21
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,704
-They're going to start a war!
-Stop freaking out.

22
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:22,290
-It's okay. There's no war.
-They say that all the time.

23
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,833
Nuclear weapons research, missiles--

24
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,543
Speaking of North Korea,

25
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,170
I'm craving Pyongyang naengmyeon.

26
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,964
What do you mean?
Hamhung naengmyeon is the best.

27
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,382
If you wrap it around galbi…

28
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:34,219
Guys, that's not important right now.
A war is about to--

29
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,345
Oh my gosh.

30
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,722
They say the Jang-Jang couple
is getting divorced.

31
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,307
-Really?
-For real?

32
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,601
-I knew it.
-There's no time for this!

33
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,562
North Korea will launch a missile
and set South Korea on fire.

34
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:45,855
Hey, kids.

35
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,817
I told you to remove your hair
from the drain after you shower.

36
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,612
The drains were all clogged,
so the shower room was flooded!

37
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,948
Whose blond hair is this? Who is it?

38
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,784
I got it. Hey, you.

39
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,452
Was it you?

40
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,830
Am I the only blonde in this dorm?

41
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,289
Why are you picking on me?

42
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,209
You're the only dirty one
who washes it on certain days.

43
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,711
It's true I wash my hair on certain days,

44
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,547
but I haven't washed in a week.

45
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,173
Smell it.

46
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,466
Oh my gosh.

47
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,343
My goodness.

48
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,387
Why does her hair smell like feet?

49
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,515
Anyway, wait until I catch whoever it is.

50
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,891
Then this dorm is doomed.

51
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,310
-I'll set it all on fire.
-We'll set it all on fire.

52
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,521
-This is a warning.
-Darn it.

53
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,984
Why is everyone so laid-back
when a war may break out?

54
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,113
-Your face is glowing.
-I'm not interested.

55
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,407
-Okay.
-Your ancestors can help…

56
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,867
Sorry.

57
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,162
Me?

58
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:43,580
I'm from Sweden.

59
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,540
-You speak Korean so well.
-You do.

60
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,333
I can speak a teensy bit.

61
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,419
-"Teensy bit"?
-But I have a long way to go.

62
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,338
-My goodness.
-Anyway, may I help you?

63
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,424
We are students who are researching

64
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,051
Korean language textbooks for foreigners.

65
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,845
I see. That's great.

66
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,431
Do you have a few minutes?

67
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,808
We would love to interview you.

68
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,438
It's extremely difficult to find someone
this fluent in Korean.

69
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,647
That's right.

70
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,404
Sure. It won't take long, right?

71
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,239
-No, not at all.
-Go ahead.

72
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,866
Well, first off,

73
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,452
what term do you think is the most Korean?

74
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,537
The most Korean term?

75
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,081
Personally,

76
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,042
I like the word hyo,

77
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,169
as in "filial piety."

78
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,713
It's not just love or respect.

79
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:37,008
It's an incredible concept
that can't be translated into English.

80
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,344
-Oh, my. You're incredible.
-Amazing.

81
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,012
You're amazing.

82
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:45,391
You understand Korean culture
as well as the language perfectly.

83
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,894
How long have you been in Korea?

84
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:48,895
It's been a while.

85
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:50,855
A wee bit.

86
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,775
Oh my gosh. "A wee bit."

87
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,946
It's such a pleasure to meet you.

88
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:01,699
Do you have time to talk a little more
over some tea?

89
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,536
My friends are waiting, but…

90
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,538
Would you grace us with your presence?

91
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,085
Sure. A few minutes won't hurt.

92
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,127
Let's go.

93
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,837
-Okay.
-Great.

94
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,131
That's right.

95
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,841
-Gosh, Double Junks?
-My gosh. Nice!

96
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,969
I'm only getting bad cards today.

97
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,095
Excuse me.

98
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,099
We weren't gambling.

99
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,059
We were playing for fun for lunch.

100
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,645
Okay. Is this where we hide
if a war breaks out?

101
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,939
-What was it called?
-A bomb shelter?

102
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:33,856
Yes, that.

103
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,108
Is it?

104
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,819
We never had a war.

105
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,988
Don't mind me. You can continue.

106
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,572
-It's fine.
-We weren't doing anything.

107
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,366
You can go. Bye.

108
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,742
Goodbye.

109
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,577
-He's so good-looking.
-My goodness.

110
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,789
Oh my gosh.
What happened here? Who did this?

111
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,667
I was scared
because I thought we got caught.

112
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,420
Someone else may come in. Close the door.

113
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,798
No. The door's broken.
It only opens from the outside.

114
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,800
You have to prop it open.

115
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,177
He got mad at me,

116
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,555
saying I stepped on his foot
when I took them down.

117
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:09,225
He was taking it in
on the wrong person, wasn't he?

118
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:13,813
Yes, but it's supposed to be,
taking it "out" on the wrong person.

119
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,649
-Not "in."
-Oh my. I had no idea.

120
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,151
I know, right?

121
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,321
You know more than I do, and I'm Korean.

122
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:25,700
I'm thinking about getting plastic surgery
to look like Korean too.

123
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:28,494
You don't need to get anything done.
My goodness.

124
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,205
You have such great features.

125
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,832
I get that a lot.

126
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,083
Gosh.

127
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,626
But…

128
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,544
But?

129
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,505
-What is it?
-Something bad happened recently.

130
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,592
Did someone pass away recently?

131
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,552
What? How did you know?

132
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,349
Your grandmother…

133
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,517
didn't pass away.

134
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,686
-Your grandfather.
-That's right!

135
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,980
-Right.
-My grandfather passed away recently.

136
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,232
I was in Korea at the time,

137
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,735
so I couldn't even say goodbye.

138
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:04,322
That's why your grandfather has
a big grudge

139
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:08,409
and keeps lingering around you.

140
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,827
My gosh.

141
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,080
-Around me?
-Yes.

142
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:17,502
You've heard the traditional memorial
called jesa, haven't you?

143
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,878
Of course.

144
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:22,673
Some people criticize it
as worshipping ghosts,

145
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,760
but I think it's a way
of remembering your ancestors

146
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,428
and bringing the family together.

147
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:31,307
I think it is a great
and meaningful cultural heritage.

148
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,767
You're amazing.

149
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,352
He really is.

150
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,022
Hans.

151
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:41,609
Why don't you use this opportunity
to remember your grandfather

152
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,987
and hold a jesa for him
with all your heart?

153
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,116
-He should.
-We will help you.

154
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,828
-He definitely should.
-But he passed away in Sweden.

155
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,704
Can I have a jesa in Korea?

156
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,249
Of course.

157
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,460
Koreans even hold jesas
even after they immigrate.

158
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,545
Really?

159
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,381
Thank you so much. What should I do?

160
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,808
What's going on?

161
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:15,935
Is it a war?

162
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,606
That was so hot.

163
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,485
Babe, how did you know about this place?

164
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,028
It's very special, isn't it?

165
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,573
I've been wanting to do it here.

166
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,326
You pervert. Didn't we come here
to get the heating mat?

167
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,370
I bet this is what you wanted.

168
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,290
How about on the roof next time?

169
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,500
I'm getting turned on already.

170
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:45,131
How could that asshole scam
poor part-time workers of all people?

171
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,342
When will I finish
putting all of this away? Damn!

172
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,887
Why isn't he coming?

173
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,598
I paged him almost ten minutes ago.
He must have a death wish.

174
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,477
Hey, it hasn't been ten minutes.
I didn't breach the contract.

175
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,853
You're two seconds late.

176
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,314
You must not want to live in the dorm.

177
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,773
I'll report you.

178
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,067
You're seriously milking this
way too much.

179
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,529
-What is it this time?
-I don't have time, so let's get moving.

180
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,572
Take those boxes--

181
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,865
Guys! We're in trouble!

182
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,367
A war broke out. Can you hear that?

183
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:17,121
What? Does he think a war broke out
because of the siren?

184
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,081
Hey, calm down.

185
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,000
Yes, a war!

186
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,044
How can a war break out
as soon as I get here?

187
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,089
Why isn't my phone working?
Oh my god, Mom.

188
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,091
Jamie, it's not a war.

189
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,470
The civil defense training is today.
The civil defense training.

190
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,013
The civil defense training?

191
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,140
It's a periodic evacuation drill.

192
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,517
See? The siren stopped.

193
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,478
It really isn't a war?

194
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,687
Talk about overreacting.

195
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,440
"Why won't she pick up? Mom!"

196
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:49,487
Check those piles of boxes and books.

197
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,821
This will take us forever.

198
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,073
"Us"?

199
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,534
I'm here just to give instructions.

200
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,369
You're doing it all. Wake up.

201
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,204
You're cruel and heartless.

202
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,501
Guys, why won't this open?

203
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,378
-What?
-What?

204
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:07,755
Why won't it open?

205
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,174
It won't budge.

206
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,093
It's slammed shut.

207
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,262
I thought it was a war,
so I slammed it shut.

208
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:17,056
I'll call someone to get us out.

209
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,726
What the heck? Why won't it work?

210
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,355
Hey. We're in trouble.
There's no reception in here.

211
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,941
Come on. You can get reception anywhere.

212
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,278
Except here.

213
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,195
Damn it.

214
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,405
Wait.

215
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,032
That means we're locked in.

216
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,909
No way.

217
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,078
"No way"?

218
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,833
The door won't budge
and we don't get reception.

219
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,335
Tomorrow's Saturday, so no one is working.

220
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,547
That means no one will come here
to let us out, but--

221
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,050
Damn it.

222
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,304
Sorry.

223
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,014
I didn't know the door was broken.

224
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,559
Are we locked in here all weekend
until someone lets us out on Monday?

225
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,812
There's no guarantee
that someone will come on Monday either.

226
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,356
The cleaning ladies were here
this afternoon.

227
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,649
They won't come anymore.

228
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:13,446
I reported them earlier
for playing cards here.

229
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,573
Good going. Seriously.

230
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,701
I knew you'd screw yourself over
for reporting people.

231
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,078
I have to get to the police station!

232
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,873
They caught the manager
who vanished without paying us,

233
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,751
so they said all the victims
had to go by tonight.

234
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,297
Out of my way. I may not get paid
if I don't go today.

235
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,214
Excuse me!

236
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,507
-Excuse me, help!
-Help!

237
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:34,717
WHAT DO WE DO?

238
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,926
ABOUT WHAT?

239
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,345
WHAT IF THEY FIND OUT?

240
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,262
DO SOMETHING

241
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,388
Excuse me!

242
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,681
-Please help!
-Help!

243
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:41,599
Guys!

244
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,476
-Hey!
-Hey! Terris?

245
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,144
What are you doing here?

246
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:48,773
It's nice and cool in here,
so I take naps here now and then.

247
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,442
What's wrong? What's going on?

248
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,819
Look at his sharp nose.

249
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,863
No one can compare to that face.

250
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,615
Taek's the man for sure.

251
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,159
Deok-sun's meant to be with Taek.

252
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:03,120
What are you talking about? Ryu's the man.

253
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,455
Didn't you see his arm?

254
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:07,750
If I were Deok-sun,
I'd want to be embraced by those arms.

255
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,251
Hey. Who am I?

256
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,546
I learned Korean by watching K-dramas
since middle school.

257
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,006
It's Taek all the way!

258
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,884
Don't be ridiculous.
I've watched K-dramas since grade school.

259
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,095
-Don't disrespect my Jung-hwan.
-Hey!

260
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,014
That drama ended years ago.
Taek ended up with her.

261
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,599
Why are you arguing about it?

262
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,060
Minnie, is she in your department?

263
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,396
Her? She's a friend from high school.

264
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,023
She always followed me around
and even followed me here.

265
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,484
Oh my gosh. Give me a break.

266
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,195
I said I was studying K-content first,
and you copied me.

267
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,822
Whatever. You followed me.

268
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,407
-You followed me.
-Hey.

269
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,785
You're both Thai.
Why are you arguing in Korean?

270
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,995
It's annoying
because I understand everything.

271
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:48,457
What's her problem? Why is she butting in?

272
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,001
She has a nasty temper. Watch it.

273
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,754
What was that? Were you badmouthing me?

274
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:55,631
Darn it.

275
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,550
I'm too hungry to talk.

276
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,969
Do you want this? I ate some of it though.

277
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,141
Hey! What the hell?

278
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,977
Ma'am. Calm down
and have some self-control.

279
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,729
The buffet is waiting for you.

280
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,021
Buffet!

281
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,106
Buffet?

282
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,025
I'm hungry.

283
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,404
The guys must have gone to eat
with Hans by now.

284
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,906
We have no food or water.

285
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,324
We'll starve to death.

286
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,410
You won't die from skipping a few meals.

287
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,621
Had I known I'd die here like this
without having dated anyone…

288
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:31,542
Damn it!
I should've told Ju-ri that I liked her.

289
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,127
I regret it so much.

290
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,211
What did I tell you?

291
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:37,047
I said to ask her out.
That's what you get for not listening.

292
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,799
It's your fault.

293
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,885
You kept saying she was butt ugly.

294
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,971
-A plastic monster.
-What? I did not!

295
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:47,057
You said she looked like
a materialistic gold digger

296
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:50,394
who dates lots of guys
and has a nasty temper.

297
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,771
You kept saying that--

298
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,857
I only said that to make you
stop whining and snap out of it!

299
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,110
Conclusively, you went
to get her to go out with me,

300
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,904
but said she already had a guy.

301
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,656
Not just one, but many.
That she was a total player--

302
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,241
Hey, stop making things up--

303
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,536
Ju-ri? What are you doing here?

304
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:14,752
But isn't this jesa table too meager?

305
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:18,255
There are no vegetables, meat,
rice cakes, or yakgwa.

306
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,090
It's too empty.

307
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,468
It's not about the volume.

308
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,094
-It's about your heart.
-Yes.

309
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,681
Still, my grandfather is coming
all the way to Korea.

310
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:31,519
It breaks my heart to think
this is all he gets to eat.

311
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,854
The amount of food is not important.

312
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,190
Serve what he enjoyed when he was alive.

313
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:39,151
That consideration is what matters.

314
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,194
What he liked?

315
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:44,198
In that case,
my grandfather loved fläsklägg.

316
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,075
-What?
-"Flesh lake"?

317
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,619
It's a Swedish dish.
That would be perfect.

318
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:52,706
How could we find Swedish food here?

319
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,124
Right?

320
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,543
What should I do?

321
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,127
Right.

322
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,839
Fläsklägg is similar to jokbal.

323
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,299
That will do.
Is there a jokbal place here?

324
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,384
-No.
-Darn.

325
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,511
We never ordered food, so we don't know.

326
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,054
I can use a delivery app.

327
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,974
I'll pay for the jokbal.

328
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,145
I don't think I'll make it.

329
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,772
Hang in there.

330
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,148
Hey. Call him.

331
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,817
Ask Hans where he is.

332
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,734
Okay, fine.

333
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,154
Hello? Hans. When are you coming back?

334
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,365
They're losing it here, man.

335
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,158
Damn. He hung up on me.

336
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,368
That…

337
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,703
What is this?

338
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,413
What is it?

339
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,164
What is this?

340
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:38,502
"I'm holding a jesa for my grandfather,
so I'll call you later."

341
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,546
What? What the hell is this?

342
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,715
Hey, isn't this a cult?

343
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:46,886
Yes. The cult that cons you
into holding jesas and takes your money.

344
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,637
Looks like Hans was duped, right?

345
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:52,016
No way. He always boasts about
knowing everything about Korea.

346
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,976
-He wouldn't fall for it.
-Right?

347
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,145
Only newcomers fall for things like that.

348
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,523
I, too, was clueless
and got tricked into it when I first came.

349
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,359
Right, just like this.

350
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,364
This looks like the place I went to.

351
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,074
It is!

352
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,534
The bastard in hanbok.

353
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,120
He's the bastard that conned me!

354
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,413
Really?

355
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,332
So he's still conning people?

356
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,083
For real?

357
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,503
That asshole.
Seeing him again is pissing me off.

358
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,631
I think I know where this is.

359
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,049
What? Where?

360
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,342
That idiot, Hans.

361
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,886
We need to save him before
he loses all his money.

362
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,137
Damn it. That's right.

363
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,265
Our buffet's at risk! Where is he?

364
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,225
Was it by Konkuk University?

365
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,394
No, was it Sinchon?

366
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,562
I can't remember.

367
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,358
I think I'll know if I'm in the area.

368
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,694
Hold on. If you look carefully
at this picture,

369
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,447
there's a church steeple
outside the window.

370
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,282
See that tiny letter?

371
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,203
Which church has "Jeong" in its name?

372
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,206
I think I can find it. Hold on.

373
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,918
Are you happy your girlfriend is
a materialistic, gold-digging player?

374
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,002
That's not it.

375
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,295
Everything else aside,

376
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,674
a plastic monster?
That's the most insulting.

377
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:09,134
Did you pay for my new face?

378
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,680
That's not it, babe. Calm down.
Let me explain.

379
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,181
Explain what, you jerk?

380
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:17,810
Are you even human?
You knew I had a big crush on her.

381
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:21,480
How could you snatch her away?
You said you were my best friend!

382
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,398
You scumbag!

383
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,441
No. That's not it.

384
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,528
I really tried to get her
to go out with you.

385
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,906
But she said she liked me more
and came on to me. What could I do?

386
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,325
I came on to you?

387
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:34,743
Why you little…

388
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,662
You asked me if I liked puppies

389
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:39,248
because you turn into a dog
when you drink.

390
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,418
You made me drink
five bottles of soju to show me!

391
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,669
You are despicable.

392
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,755
You planned to steal her from me
from the start.

393
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,173
You're disgusting!

394
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,758
So what?

395
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,511
Hey, if you liked her so much,
you should've asked her out!

396
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,972
You're the loser
who was too chicken to ask her.

397
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,515
You're giving me a headache!

398
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:01,687
So, what happened was,
Hyun-min had a crush on Ju-ri.

399
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,939
Terris said he'd get you a date with her,

400
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,942
but snatched her away
and is living with her now. Is that it?

401
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,694
That's right. Isn't that disgusting?

402
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:12,322
Come on. To be honest,
you were a loser and a coward.

403
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,742
You were too scared to ask her out,
so shut up.

404
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,910
Any other guy could've snatched her away.

405
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,370
But I'm the bad guy?

406
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,789
Hey. What do you guys think?

407
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,375
True. He's the idiot for losing her.

408
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,170
It's survival of the fittest.
The loser shouldn't complain.

409
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,588
"Survival of the fittest"?

410
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,175
Then how are we different from animals?
Why do we need ethics and morals?

411
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,678
Why do we need friends?
Why does friendship matter?

412
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,472
Hey, Jamie, what do you think?

413
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:38,807
Well, I think…

414
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,189
Hyun-min, you're right,
and so are you, Terris.

415
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:50,319
Don't give us that ambiguous nonsense.
Tell us what you think!

416
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:55,157
So, Hyun-min and Terris both like her.

417
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,241
Then…

418
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,122
Split her down the middle and share.

419
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,548
Awesome. Why didn't I think of that?

420
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,009
-I'll take the top.
-Then--

421
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,428
How dare you treat her like an object?
Shut up!

422
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,555
Sorry. I was just kidding.

423
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,102
Cracking jokes doesn't suit you, you know?

424
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,813
And this isn't a joke.
It's sexual harassment and defamation.

425
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,315
Listen. Once we get out of here,

426
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,359
I'll report you
to the Human Rights Committee.

427
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,778
Stupid. You should've picked the bottom.

428
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,655
I have an amazing ass.

429
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,491
Hey. What's this?

430
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,577
Hey, it looks like
someone made fruit wine.

431
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,288
I think the cleaning ladies
hid them there.

432
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,340
My grandfather will love it.

433
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:55,801
Good. Let's start quickly.

434
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,219
-Good.
-Okay, let's begin.

435
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,470
Okay.

436
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,641
Wait.

437
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,476
What? What now?

438
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,480
I don't like what I'm wearing.

439
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,524
It's improper to see him like this.

440
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,151
What should we do then?

441
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,573
May I borrow what he's wearing?

442
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,199
Drink

443
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,701
-Drink
-Drink

444
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:23,495
-Drink it up, drink
-Okay. Damn it.

445
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,330
-Drink
-Drink

446
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,790
Drink it already. Hurry up.

447
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,878
Jamie. Drink it for me.

448
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,591
Sorry, I can't. Actually…

449
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:40,012
I've been about to burst for a while now.

450
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:43,182
Just go over there and pee.
Don't hold it in.

451
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:46,310
I'm sensitive.
I can't when others are around.

452
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,020
Hey. No one will look.

453
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,980
Just go and pee. We won't look.

454
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,773
Still, how can I--

455
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,234
But it's fine peeing here
in front of all of us?

456
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,153
Go and do it already.

457
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,531
-We won't look.
-Just do it. We won't look!

458
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,491
-Still--
-We won't look!

459
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,076
But you can still hear me.

460
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:04,995
What?

461
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:12,294
-Send waves across the stream
-Send waves across the stream

462
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:16,506
-And tickle my sister's hands
-And tickle my sister's hands

463
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,885
-As she washes vegetables
-As she washes vegetables

464
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:20,802
One more time!

465
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,804
-What in the world am I doing?
-Plop-plop, throw pebbles

466
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,848
-When my sister isn't looking
-When my sister isn't looking

467
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,193
Where is it? Are you sure this is it?
Which room is it?

468
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,444
This is it.

469
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,821
Which door was it?

470
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,281
They all look the same.

471
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,118
Gosh. I'm too hungry. I can't see.

472
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,788
Hey. Come here.

473
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,794
Okay, one more. Do it quickly.

474
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:54,920
-Quickly.
-Okay.

475
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,005
Is my bowing technique okay?

476
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,007
-Yes, it's perfect.
-Did I do it correctly?

477
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,092
It's perfect!

478
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:03,262
-Okay. Let's get moving.
-All right.

479
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,930
People are waiting. Look.

480
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,474
-They have to hurry to catch their flight.
-Right.

481
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,767
-Have a seat.
-No, please.

482
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,477
-Okay.
-Good.

483
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,562
Okay.

484
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,939
Oh, right.

485
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,858
What now? What is it this time?

486
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,404
Aren't you supposed to keep
the door open during a jesa?

487
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,906
So that the ancestor can come in.

488
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,409
-Open the door!
-Open the door please.

489
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,326
Open it!

490
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,369
Hey! Hans!

491
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,371
Hold on. Hans! Hey. Stop.

492
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,457
-What are you doing here?
-They're con artists!

493
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,836
You stupid. They give you bull
about ancestors and hold a fake jesa!

494
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,130
Right! You brag you know
everything about Korea.

495
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,881
-How did you not know?
-What? Really?

496
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,967
-No.
-What are you people doing?

497
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,844
What else? We're his friends.

498
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,513
Don't you have better things to do
other than conning foreigners?

499
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,223
You're a disgrace to the country!

500
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,642
Hey, what about your paycheck?

501
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,811
Right. I paid for the jokbal.

502
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,855
Give me my money, you asshole.

503
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,356
Seriously!

504
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,525
What are you talking about?
I don't know you!

505
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,319
You took me to that quack.

506
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,988
You made me get surgery
to improve my look.

507
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,449
What's the problem? It improved…

508
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:06,825
You did get prettier.

509
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,494
Do you know how hard it was
to remove those fillers?

510
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:13,707
And I heard you cheated on me
with my friend, you prick.

511
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,501
What do you mean? You dated him?

512
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,879
I went out with him for a week
after the jesa.

513
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:21,340
Give me my money, you prick!

514
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,603
Give me a break. Seriously.

515
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,945
You're smiling now.

516
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,157
Did the alcohol calm you down?

517
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,828
You were flipping out
like you were going to die any second.

518
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,206
"Why won't my phone work?"

519
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:58,502
Hey. I really thought
a war had broken out.

520
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,465
The news in the US makes it sound like
a war will break out in Korea.

521
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:05,592
True.

522
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:10,389
For Koreans, every day is war
even if we're not at war.

523
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:14,017
We study until we drop.
We work until we drop.

524
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:18,647
We drink until we drop.
Everything we do is war.

525
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:20,690
Is it?

526
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,652
Are you that scared of war?

527
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,655
Of course. We may die.

528
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:27,823
I see.

529
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,909
I guess you've had a pretty good life

530
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,577
if you're that afraid of dying.

531
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:37,457
I'm not afraid of war or dying
or any of that.

532
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:44,714
I'm more afraid of not getting paid
by that scamming asshole

533
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,925
after I've worked so hard.

534
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,555
I wish the world would
come to an end tomorrow.

535
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:56,059
There are many times
I wish it'll all end at once.

536
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:00,814
There are many times when I dread
waking up in the morning more than dying.

537
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:07,696
I'm so cold.

538
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,573
Why is it so cold?

539
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,801
Grandpa. You came.

540
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,220
It was hard coming all the way to Korea,

541
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,764
but I had a good meal today thanks to you.

542
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:37,893
What? Why are you speaking Korean?

543
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,686
Because it's your dream.

544
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:43,940
Anyway, thank you for remembering me
even from so far away.

545
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,442
That's a given.

546
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,944
You were so kind to me.

547
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,321
Of course.

548
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:53,116
You were my favorite
among my 12 grandchildren.

549
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,118
My cute little Liam!

550
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,828
Liam's my second brother.

551
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,998
Gosh. Sorry about that. I got confused.

552
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,417
I love you, Peter.

553
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,504
Peter is my third aunt's son.

554
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:06,880
I'm Hans!

555
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:10,634
You said you loved me the most.
Do you not even know my name?

556
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,302
You're so mean.

557
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,857
You're terrible!

558
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,734
Pay me for the jokbal. Now.

559
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:31,154
You brat! You rude little punk!

560
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,115
What's that?

561
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:35,492
Was that a dream?

562
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,871
What is that sound?

563
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:40,872
Fire!

564
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:41,957
Fire!

565
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,333
-Fire!
-Fire!

566
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,251
Fire!

567
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,002
There's a fire in the basement!

568
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,296
Fire!

569
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,299
THE NEXT DAY

570
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,886
About 10 or 13 of them came at me.

571
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,306
I did a roundhouse kick
and knocked out one of them.

572
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,475
Then I flipped another one down.

573
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,935
Your ears are beet-red.

574
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:04,521
You have stage four mythomania.
That's serious.

575
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,690
Anyway. If it weren't for me,

576
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,234
Hans would've lost everything
to those con artists.

577
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,860
That was close.

578
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:14,948
Jamie. Hurry!

579
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:15,907
Come in.

580
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,827
Professor. Why are we…

581
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,204
Why is there nowhere
to talk quietly in this dorm?

582
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,414
Were you hurt?

583
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:25,375
Because you went missing
for 16 hours and 27 minutes,

584
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,961
your mother almost had a panic attack.

585
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,380
She said she'll get here on a jet.

586
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:34,134
Even the American Embassy kept calling.
My gosh.

587
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,303
I just spoke with her, so she's fine.

588
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,388
You're the son of the biggest global star,

589
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:40,849
Hollywood's top actress, Barbara Houston.

590
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,059
Nothing can happen to you
while you're here secretly.

591
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:46,646
I promised your mother
and put everything I have on the line.

592
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,732
I swore I'd keep it a secret

593
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:52,652
that you were studying here,
and that I'd keep you safe.

594
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,362
But look what happened. I was--

595
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:58,366
I'll do my best and be careful
to stay under the radar.

596
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,326
Don't worry.

597
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,162
Your Korean is excellent.

598
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:05,582
You were adopted when you were five.
How are you so fluent in Korean?

599
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,500
My mother always made me study it,

600
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,628
saying I must never forget how to speak it

601
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:10,920
since I'm Korean.

602
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:12,505
She's amazing.

603
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,383
No wonder she's a global star.

604
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:19,596
This is why she's always voted
the most respected actor every year.

605
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,931
She won several Academy Awards too.

606
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:22,849
Yes.

607
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:23,850
Right.

608
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,977
Where were you locked in again?

609
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,313
Here.

610
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,481
In here?

611
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,735
It smells. Did someone pee in here?

612
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:36,863
Pick up already.

613
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,865
I need to get it signed and submit it.

614
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:40,116
Have you seen Jamie?

615
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,534
No, I haven't.

616
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,994
He's always disappearing.

617
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,747
Maybe he went to the storage room
again to pee.

618
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,791
He's not stupid. Why would he go there?

619
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:51,044
I made sure no one goes
anywhere near there for a while.

620
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,089
Help!

621
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,090
Help!

622
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,927
Why didn't they fix the door yet? Damn it.

623
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:04,015
…at the airport by hiding the drugs
in such hidden compartments.

624
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:07,560
-Why won't he pick up?
-Most drug deals occurred in dorms.

625
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,479
-It was due to lax security.
-What is he doing?

626
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:12,399
-The prosecution believes
-Pick up.

627
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,484
-Pick up already.
-major crime rings may be involved

628
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,277
and will investigate dorms

629
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,613
-What is he doing?
-for international students.

630
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,231
