1
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,740
Waka is a beautiful art form.

2
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,580
Among the best were
written by the emperor.

3
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,810
The emperor...

4
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,610
- How could that be the emperor?
- The emperor...

5
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,340
- It doesn't look like one.
- So the emperor...

6
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,640
From that time on,
nurtured it through his power

7
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,940
And waka was born.

8
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,310
In this period,

9
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,040
Among the unique styles
of writing that emerged is

10
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,440
Sadness.

11
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,670
Sadness.

12
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:02,980
Sadness.

13
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,440
Aside from that...

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,080
We have haiku.

15
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,910
Haiku...

16
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,680
This one is boundless.

17
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,770
Irony.

18
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:19,940
Slangs.

19
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:20,840
Foreign words.

20
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,710
You can use all of them.

21
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,410
Do whatever you want.

22
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,780
Anything you can think of.

23
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,980
Even words that are nasty and such.

24
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,110
Whatever you want.

25
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,110
I'm speechless.

26
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,310
Why are you speechless?

27
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,760
It's just so foolish.

28
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,780
Everything is possible even
those that don't make any sense.

29
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,510
Teacher...

30
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,640
But is it okay for you to call it foolish?

31
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,340
Of course.

32
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,910
I always watch NHK Haiku.

33
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,840
I really like haiku!

34
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,090
And I think, calling it foolish in front
of your students is against the law.

35
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,180
I understand. I understand.

36
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,580
If that's what you think so

37
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,280
Then can you tell me which law I violated?

38
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,710
I don't know anything about the law

39
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,010
But what you said broke my heart.

40
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,910
As my teacher, I think
you're being inconsiderate.

41
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,840
Inconsiderate?

42
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,710
I understand. I understand.

43
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,040
Your teacher's favorite food is croquette.

44
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,410
So these croquettes

45
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:55,180
They are hideous brown thing
that looks like a primitive man's food.

46
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,840
Very ordinary

47
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,910
But even if the whole
world makes fun of it

48
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,280
It won't hurt my feelings even for a bit.

49
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,510
Your teacher's feelings

50
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,940
It will remain unbothered.

51
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,780
Others are others.

52
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,680
I am me.

53
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,360
This is what you called "independence".

54
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,680
Do you understand?

55
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,180
Independence?

56
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,810
In other words, people who
can discipline their own self.

57
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,060
I don't think those people
can casually criticize others.

58
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,880
I don't make fun of croquettes or waka.

59
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,010
That's all I could say.

60
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,080
I've been dealing with troublesome
students since the first semester.

61
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,510
Don't believe him.

62
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,640
Don't believe him.

63
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,310
Foolish teacher.

64
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:06,590
Sing In Love

65
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,810
A baby floating in the amniotic fluid

66
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,110
Like a parasite in Eurasia

67
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,880
The ghost stands by the
bedside. This is sakura.

68
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,040
Teacher Kiritani

69
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,840
Are you traveling around
Eurasia in your mind, Teacher?

70
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,790
Just having a little adventure.

71
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,480
Long time no see.

72
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,510
You still haven't
changed, Teacher Yoshida.

73
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,610
I'm really happy to see you again.

74
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,040
It's been a long time since you
came here as a practice teacher.

75
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,940
Has it been 10 years already?

76
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,840
You've grown up so well.

77
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,580
I was still a college
student at that time.

78
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,610
Besides

79
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,110
It's been a long time since I
became a temporary teacher here.

80
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,040
Here

81
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:17,880
The survey forms.

82
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,540
The students' responses were not bad.

83
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,910
Really?!

84
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,880
You can become a permanent
teacher soon. I'll support you.

85
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,110
Thank you

86
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,840
I'll go ahead now, bye.

87
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,910
Hitoshi Kiritani Temporary Teacher

88
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,340
Relax

89
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:23,240
It feels great inside you.

90
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,640
I'm sorry.

91
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,540
You may change your
clothes now and wear this.

92
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,540
What about your family?

93
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,780
I have a wife.

94
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,510
But please don't tell her
about what happened.

95
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,040
Don't inform the school, too.

96
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,380
Mr. Kiritani

97
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,280
You're a brave man.

98
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,840
Calling the police right
after being sexually assaulted

99
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,180
No ordinary man can do that.

100
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:51,210
So you will be sent to the
hospital for a body fluid test.

101
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,180
But before that

102
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:57,140
You need to go back at the crime
scene to confirm what happened.

103
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,910
Relax

104
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,710
Relax

105
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,470
What?

106
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,830
Relax. It feels great inside you.

107
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,210
Relax. It's almost there.
It feels great inside you.

108
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,210
Relax. It's almost there.
It feels great inside you.

109
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,060
He kept whispering that many times.

110
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,540
Over and over again in my ears.

111
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,770
And then?

112
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,280
What?

113
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,180
Ride on me and cum in my face.

114
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,540
What the hell?

115
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,140
You can go to the hospital now.

116
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,040
Take a body fluid sample.

117
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,270
Okay!

118
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,180
You scared me.

119
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,640
What's wrong?

120
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,710
- What's wrong with you?
- Don't touch me!

121
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,270
Sorry

122
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,880
I was a little lost.

123
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,040
Lost?

124
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:51,720
Just got penetrated
with a banana in the ass...

125
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:59,720
Just got penetrated
with a banana in the ass...

126
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,540
It's been exactly three months now.

127
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,140
How is it going so far?

128
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,040
Are you taking your medicines?

129
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:28,640
Yes

130
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,870
But...

131
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,680
I feel exhausted.

132
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,680
It was like I've been going
through a very long day.

133
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,040
You feel exhausted as if you've
been going through a very long day?

134
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,910
It must be very hard for you.

135
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,010
Forget it.

136
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,910
It's alright.

137
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,710
It can be depressing at times, but...

138
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,110
It's not a big deal.

139
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,480
It's depressing?

140
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,340
That's for sure.

141
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,180
When that happens,

142
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,380
Don't force yourself to feel okay.

143
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,280
Don't judge yourself either.

144
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,640
Process your fears and face the future.

145
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,510
How will I do that?

146
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,680
Good morning

147
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,440
What time have you finished yesterday?

148
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,010
Three o'clock

149
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,740
So you haven't got enough sleep.

150
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,210
I'll go to bed after making
you some breakfast.

151
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,210
Thank you

152
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,740
You're welcome

153
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,640
What's wrong?

154
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,110
You have white hair.

155
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,240
I need to go to the toilet.

156
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,340
Toilet?

157
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:02,780
Toilet?

158
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,010
Toilet...

159
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,810
Good evening!

160
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,610
Spelled as K A I.

161
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,110
I'm Kai.

162
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,110
Do you remember me?

163
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,680
I guess you don't.

164
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,380
Relax

165
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,580
Inside you

166
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,780
It feels so great...

167
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,280
It's me.

168
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,260
The one who assaulted
you three months ago.

169
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,610
The person who took away your virginity.

170
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,160
Because I'm a hunter.

171
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,510
Your personal info has been
spreading around already.

172
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,610
Your name, address, occupation, family.

173
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,310
A school teacher using violence?

174
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,840
That's bad.

175
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,710
Hey, time to get up.

176
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,240
Kai, he's awake!

177
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,770
Teacher

178
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,080
Let me hear you rap.

179
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,510
Rap

180
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,740
Rap

181
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,440
Are you serious?

182
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,610
Can this old man still rap?

183
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,680
guess so.

184
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,580
Hey, hey! Akane!

185
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,080
The subject is

186
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,610
"How I fucked your ass"

187
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:28,780
Here

188
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,980
Hurry up already.

189
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,830
I'll let you go if you do it.

190
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,280
Hey, don't be in a hurry.

191
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,130
Whether the police or gangs,
you can call whoever you want later.

192
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,210
Teacher

193
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,510
How does it feel when I fucked you up?

194
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,280
You little slut.

195
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:54,180
He'll rap about what really happened
the time he came when I fucked him!

196
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,480
It's impossible for an
amateur like him to rap.

197
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,780
If you don't want to rap

198
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,610
You can masturbate in public instead.

199
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,580
Your asshole

200
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,710
It was nice and tight.

201
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,940
But I wonder...

202
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,610
What about your wife?

203
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:33,940
Listen everyone!

204
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,880
Hitomi Kiritani, 32 years old...

205
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,740
Working in an advertising company

206
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,690
Annual income over four figures

207
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,080
She definitely makes
more money than this guy.

208
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,510
I may show! Your derogatory name!

209
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,940
I may show! A disgraced pen name!

210
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,310
Here's a byword for your bad show!

211
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,580
You guys drove me insane!

212
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,080
I may show! Your derogatory name!

213
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,440
I may show! A disgraced pen name!

214
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,410
Here's a byword for your bad show!

215
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,080
Incontinent fools, dung
beetles, and worthless!

216
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,710
Swarming and crying
like a moth to a flame!

217
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:38,940
Disappear!

218
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:42,240
Disappear and take your bad show with you!

219
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,180
I may show!

220
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,540
I may show! You love it?
NO! Never never ever show!

221
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:53,410
You must be so proud of yourself.

222
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:58,640
Why I have to do it with you?

223
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,340
Why? Why?

224
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,780
Tell me why.

225
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,810
You know what I want?

226
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,880
Get out of my show!

227
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,310
Hey, I thought you're an amateur.

228
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:20,210
She wants all the young
boys in, all in her pussy!

229
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,310
Don't try to run away.

230
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,740
Make some noise!

231
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,490
Keep your eyes on me!

232
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,780
I got violated in my ass.

233
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,940
I got fingered in my anus.

234
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,940
Got thrusted in by a penis.

235
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,680
Also got ravished in my ear holes.

236
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,580
I screamed in pain. Nooo, nooo!

237
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,110
They say no doesn't always
mean no. So, am I a pervert?

238
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,110
The banana that penetrated my ass...

239
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,180
Was an angry cock!

240
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,280
I got pierced by an obstinate penis.

241
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,540
Got screwed in my virgin anus.

242
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,540
My self-respect's broken all the way.

243
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,440
My gender identity's gone astray.

244
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,510
Who am I? I don't know.

245
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,440
A guy or girl? I don't know.

246
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,310
I don't know who am I anymore.

247
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,680
I'm begging you.

248
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,810
Give me your dick.

249
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,910
Orgy. Huge ass. Give them all to me!

250
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,680
Semen, blood, and mucus.

251
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,810
A gay guy's intensity.

252
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,080
Sexual propensity.

253
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,340
Coitus without immunity.

254
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,280
A bandage around my heart.

255
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,740
A championship belt counterpart.

256
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,840
Let me stay inside you for a while longer.

257
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,710
I told you to rap about what actually
happened that time you got fucked.

258
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,760
Make sure you come here tomorrow.

259
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,690
If you don't show up...

260
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,710
We'll go fuck her.

261
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,280
Kai, right?

262
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,640
Please, have a seat.

263
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:34,410
That guy is a known bastard around here.

264
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,240
He's been in-and-out of our
police station since he was six.

265
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,180
Then, please arrest
him as soon as possible.

266
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,140
He always got an alibi.

267
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,640
It won't be that easy.

268
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,010
Wait a minute.

269
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,280
Calm down, calm down.

270
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,240
Don't get stirred up.

271
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,510
Well then

272
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,210
Let's make a report first.

273
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,440
Tell me how he assaulted you.

274
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,680
Please be as detailed as possible.

275
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:04,680
Okay

276
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,640
Well...

277
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,580
I punched him in the throat?

278
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:18,940
So you punched him in the throat, right?

279
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,540
Yes

280
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,710
After I punched him in the throat...

281
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,710
Kai didn't fight back.

282
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:30,980
What?

283
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,210
Love Motel "Paon"

284
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,040
Mister

285
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,210
You want to go in?

286
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,640
I'm sorry.

287
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,210
Get ready for your next class.

288
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,980
You still have five more classes to go.

289
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,080
What is your class now?

290
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:36,910
None

291
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:37,880
What about your next class?

292
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,840
Math class

293
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,040
Then get ready for your math class.

294
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:40,510
Okay!

295
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:43,160
Your teacher has an
urgent matter to discuss.

296
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:52,540
Teacher

297
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,380
Mr. Kiritani

298
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,510
If you voluntarily resign from the school,

299
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,840
They said they will
file no criminal charges.

300
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:21,940
This video will not spread out too
as long as you do what they say.

301
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,610
Stop right there!

302
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,710
You're so slow, teacher.

303
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,540
Stop!

304
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,010
Come and catch me!

305
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,480
- Get down!
- I'll get down from here.

306
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,140
You come here!

307
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,580
Come and catch me!

308
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,810
You kids should not be
here and go to school!

309
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,440
Hey mister, your rap the
other day was the best!

310
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:06,910
My name is Bunta.

311
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:09,210
Teach me how to rap next time.

312
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,280
I refused.

313
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,540
Why so?

314
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,610
I gave up music a long time ago.

315
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,110
So that means you've done it before.

316
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:24,610
You must be so proud of yourself?

317
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:29,710
Why I have to do it with you?

318
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,280
I may show! Your derogatory name!

319
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,780
You little brat!

320
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,940
What the hell are you doing?

321
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,610
This is Shota, he's my half-brother.

322
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:42,440
You go to school, scumbag!

323
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,240
Hey!

324
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,380
You asshole!

325
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:48,860
What's going on?!

326
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:50,680
What's going on?!

327
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,210
What the hell are you doing?

328
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:54,610
My lord!

329
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:56,740
This guy started it off.

330
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,610
That guy started it off.

331
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,610
I'm gonna kill you.

332
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,080
What are you going to do about this?

333
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,710
Including those other stuffs you smashed.

334
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,410
Have you lost your mind?

335
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,740
Are you aware of compulsory education?

336
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,710
Children should not be here at this time.

337
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,830
Who the hell are you to lecture me?

338
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,710
I'm a teacher.

339
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,280
You're unemployed now, aren't you?

340
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,110
Don't smoke around here!

341
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,280
Go back to work!

342
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,840
Okay

343
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,030
Anyway, you need to reimburse
for everything you broke.

344
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,210
But I have no money.

345
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,810
Fuck knows

346
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,740
Then work your ass off
so you can pay me back.

347
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,380
Give me three million in three days.

348
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:55,040
Three million?!

349
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,380
Shut up

350
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:00,010
You ruined everything!
Pay it or I'll call the police!

351
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,540
Don't test my patience.

352
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,640
If you're short on
cash, this will be perfect.

353
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,440
You can make about two million a month.

354
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,680
That much?

355
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,140
Of course

356
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,440
Not bad

357
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,840
Wanna try it now?

358
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,170
No

359
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,710
I'm not interested in men.

360
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,110
Excuse me.

361
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:16,080
Wait a moment.

362
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,410
Can you give me...

363
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:19,310
3 minutes?

364
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,940
What's your name?

365
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:23,280
I'm Hitoshi.

366
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,740
How old?

367
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,140
32 years old

368
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,910
Here we are.

369
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,880
This way, please.

370
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,940
You can take off your clothes now.

371
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,840
And wait here for a bit.

372
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,010
Master will come here.

373
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:06,510
Master?

374
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,380
Simple training course

375
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:12,580
Or a quick Q and A session, just pick one.

376
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,210
Mr. Kiritani

377
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,710
I don't know if you'll
be the top or the bottom.

378
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:19,310
I don't know how far
you can take it either.

379
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:22,180
Okay

380
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,810
Take off your mask.

381
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:25,040
Okay

382
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,010
Teacher

383
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,180
You sure a double-faced.

384
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,210
Hello

385
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,780
This can't be!

386
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,110
He ran away.

387
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,780
Forget about it.

388
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,510
I can't wait anymore.

389
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,480
Don't act without my permission!

390
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:06,310
As punishment

391
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,190
Turn him into a human
punching bag for half a year.

392
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,440
Just let him go.

393
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,110
Make him stronger...

394
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,310
So I can get hard from him more often.

395
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,240
Kai

396
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:29,580
I'm not interested in this kind of guy.

397
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,040
Fight back! Fight back!

398
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,840
Don't just lay down!

399
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,010
Go hit him!

400
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:01,040
Make him suffer!

401
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,610
Do harder!

402
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:28,080
That's dangerous! That's dangerous!

403
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,480
Is he serious?

404
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,140
It's getting more exciting!

405
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,470
You're dead!

406
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:01,310
Stab him! Stab him!

407
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,210
Hey, you!

408
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,110
Can't you just move out?

409
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,610
Don't come here again.

410
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,480
Guys like you are really annoying.

411
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,510
Can you teach me... Martial Arts?

412
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,640
Please do me this favour, Bunta.

413
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,480
I'll teach you everything including rap.

414
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,940
Just make sure Shota
will agree to my request.

415
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,140
Sure!

416
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,440
Really?

417
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,910
Then...

418
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,780
Which one would you like to learn first?

419
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,110
Kokugo!

420
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,940
What is that guy doing with your brother?

421
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,440
Well then...

422
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:20,010
Kokugo is...

423
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,360
Who the hell knows?

424
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,580
Trigger list

425
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:08,480
Are you a middle schooler?

426
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,480
Quit your boring scheme already.

427
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,980
A middle schooler?

428
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,680
What you say now is very discriminatory.

429
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,840
Discrimination has no room in this place.

430
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:24,040
Go apologize to all the
middle schoolers you offended.

431
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,240
Hey, you!

432
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:50,310
What the hell are you doing teaching those
kids, even though you can't do your own homework?

433
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:55,680
Didn't I tell you to either rap about the
time you got fucked or masturbate in public?

434
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:58,780
Hey, who's this?

435
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:06,510
I'm going to your wife now.

436
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,880
Why me of all people?

437
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:34,810
Hey, I literally can't
see anything right now.

438
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:39,110
Kai?

439
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,010
Isn't this Mr. Mitsui?

440
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:44,380
Behave yourself!

441
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,640
What are you doing?

442
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,080
I'm sorry!

443
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,080
I have something to say...

444
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,880
About the small fire
commotion the other day?

445
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:58,940
Seems like they had a
tough time smothering it.

446
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,580
Sorry for causing you trouble!

447
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,780
The smothering was really helpful.

448
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:03,910
Thank you very much!

449
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:04,810
Then chief...

450
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:06,310
I have to go now.

451
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,440
Fighting!

452
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,580
Get off your dirty hands on me.

453
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,270
Teacher!

454
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,280
I'll be there for real!

455
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:17,340
Let's go.

456
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,640
Chief! Chief!

457
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,940
I know this is my first day of
work, but can I leave early as well?

458
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:27,440
Absolutely not!

459
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:31,180
What's going on?

460
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,740
What is this?

461
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,940
What happened that night?

462
00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:58,840
Hitoshi

463
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:02,310
Do you like men?

464
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:10,280
Whether you're bisexual,
pansexual, asexual...

465
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,810
I don't mind it.

466
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,780
LGBT+ Sexual Minorities

467
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:26,440
Thank you.

468
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,270
But I...

469
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:34,340
I don't like you.

470
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,110
I'm sorry.

471
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,590
But I can't keep lying to myself anymore.

472
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,940
Wait a moment. How can I believe that?

473
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:59,440
Have you ever thought about how I feel to have a wife
who earns exactly three times of my annual income?

474
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:00,840
No.

475
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,140
Like I say, I don't believe you.

476
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,170
Suck it.

477
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,810
Hey, suck it!

478
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:12,480
Stop!

479
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:13,240
Suck it!

480
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,840
Hey, suck it!

481
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:18,810
Make sure you get me hard!

482
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,210
I like men.

483
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:56,010
I like men! I like men!

484
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:58,640
I really like men!

485
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:24,840
I'm the one leaving!

486
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,040
What are you doing here now?

487
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,530
If you messed up with Hitomi again...

488
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,710
I will kill you.

489
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,010
Kill me then.

490
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:30,910
Hitomi...

491
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:00,040
Booon

492
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,910
I, Me, Friend, Tree, Back Alley...

493
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:07,180
Easy Game, Pizza, False
Tooth, Arrest, and Back Door.

494
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,740
That's 10 already.

495
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:11,610
Back door? As in the back door of a house?

496
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:13,710
Not that, I meant your ass!

497
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:15,410
Ass?!

498
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:17,510
You sure have a weird mind.

499
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:18,740
Alright.

500
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:21,140
All good!

501
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:24,540
How can that be?!

502
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:28,740
I bet that's what you say
to everyone anyway, right?

503
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:30,780
Listen

504
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:33,010
Trees...

505
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:35,810
Are actually "hair".

506
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,040
What?

507
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:38,680
Why is that?

508
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:42,680
Japanese people in the olden days used to
think that trees are hairs that grow on earth.

509
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:43,580
Is that a joke?

510
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:45,540
Can that tree still be turned into paper?

511
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:47,780
If you know the origins of words,

512
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,380
Then you'll be able to
write even stronger rhymes.

513
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:52,480
You have a point.

514
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,780
I don't agree.

515
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,610
Furthermore, there's
the character for "me".

516
00:51:55,810 --> 00:52:00,240
There's a theory that it's an abbreviation
of the terms "intestines" and "concealing".

517
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,740
It means that people who
make their way in life...

518
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:05,180
Hide their sins from each other.

519
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,040
That's what it is.

520
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,240
The same with "California Roll".

521
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,540
Have you heard it before?

522
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:16,810
California Roll!

523
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:18,680
Make that face again...

524
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,330
And I'll kick your ass out of this place.

525
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:32,110
I just can't stand listening to Japanese rap by
Japanese people who don't understand anything.

526
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:35,340
It's the lamest thing in the world.

527
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:45,410
You still have time to
judge other people here?

528
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,440
Get your homework done.

529
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:48,670
Homework.

530
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,910
Write down your experience.

531
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:53,480
The real ones.

532
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:54,880
Understand?

533
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:36,080
Don't run away like this!

534
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:44,440
Don't run away, coward!

535
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,040
You don't need to come here anymore.

536
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:37,580
I'm sick of you.

537
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,540
You're no fun.

538
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:08,140
2021/8/14
On the evening of April 6,1 was raped.

539
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,210
I want to kill him...

540
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:22,280
So I bite him hard.

541
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,930
It feels good inside you.

542
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,080
I want to kill him so I bite him hard.

543
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,840
My saliva and blood's combined flavors.

544
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,840
A man's wet, two fingers.

545
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:44,280
I'm just like a virgin queen.

546
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:47,410
I'm twisted and forsake my heart.

547
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:49,110
Right after, there's a pain so keen.

548
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:50,910
My rectum's been fully torn apart...

549
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:53,480
By an iron pipe, like I'm being tortured.

550
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,910
I wail like a little girl, oh!

551
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:58,910
Fucked up by violence and profanity...

552
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:00,340
Fucked up my life and soul...

553
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:03,640
And every corner of this cursed world.

554
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,510
Enough...

555
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:09,080
Until now... Until now...

556
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,480
In all corners of the world

557
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:14,910
How many people have
suffered this until now?

558
00:57:15,110 --> 00:57:17,780
Whether an adult, a child, or any creature

559
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:21,980
That guy, this guy, or the same guy...

560
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,510
A man...

561
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:24,880
A woman...

562
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,210
God...

563
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:30,010
Even the Goddess.

564
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,110
Get this guy out of here.

565
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:04,340
Say that again...

566
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:07,210
And I will beat you up.

567
00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:25,040
This is hard to believe.

568
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:37,560
No, like I thought, I can't believe this.

569
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:40,910
My little brother...

570
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:42,780
Bunta...

571
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:47,110
He's not the type to get killed easily.

572
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:40,980
Mourning for Bunta who once lived.

573
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:46,540
Parting ways make a person
more resilient and stronger.

574
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:51,180
We can't be stronger, we
also have a heart and soul.

575
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:55,610
This love, this cigarette,
I offer them to Bunta!

576
01:00:57,510 --> 01:01:02,240
Bunta's soul, his shattered figure,
seems to have appeared somewhere.

577
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:06,380
Bunta, are you watching?
Everyone here is high.

578
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,910
You remains in everyone's heart like
smoke of a cigarette that won't disappear.

579
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:13,610
Bunta's footsteps, Bunta's voice...

580
01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:16,710
Bunta's rap, Bunta's smile...

581
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:24,740
Let me introduce our newcomer

582
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:28,440
An important person from Musashi-Kosugi

583
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,040
Hitoshi!

584
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:39,280
I've moved out from there already, moron!

585
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:45,110
Let's hear your rape story!

586
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:49,740
Let Bunta enjoy it as well!

587
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:53,710
Don't run away from it.

588
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:55,210
Huh?

589
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,040
So

590
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:01,510
You rap about your
story on this stage, right?

591
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:03,840
No.

592
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,810
You got to feel the words.

593
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:21,610
Let me sing for Bunta...

594
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:27,010
and...

595
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:31,440
for everyone.

596
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:38,540
Make some noise!

597
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:23,110
Please close your eyes and listen...

598
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:41,880
Jumping into the water of an
ancient pond. The sound a frog makes.

599
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:50,180
Jumping into the water of an
ancient pond. The sound a frog makes.

600
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:56,840
Jumping into the water of an
ancient pond. The sound a frog makes.

601
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:11,380
Jumping into the water of an
ancient pond. The sound a frog makes.

602
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:15,080
Jumping into the water of an
ancient pond. The sound a frog makes.

603
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:20,110
Jumping into the water of an
ancient pond. The sound a frog makes.

604
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:24,280
Jumping into the water of an
ancient pond. The sound a frog makes.

605
01:04:24,810 --> 01:04:29,280
Probably it was alive when it
left Kamakura, the first tuna.

606
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:35,610
Probably it was alive when it
left Kamakura, the first tuna.

607
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:40,240
Leaning against a chestnut
tree in the lush woods of summer.

608
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:48,420
Leaning against a chestnut
tree in the lush woods of summer.

609
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:56,020
At Suma Temple, I hear an
unblown fife play in the shade of trees.

610
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:07,390
The flowers are in full bloom. The night rain
has passed and its colors have faded away.

611
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:10,310
Summer is over.

612
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,040
Vague memories are left in the basket.

613
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:19,340
Summer is over. Vague
memories are left in the basket.

614
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:26,750
Summer is over. Vague
memories are left in the basket.

615
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:38,290
As spring fades away, fish will have
tears in their eyes and birds will cry out.

616
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:53,380
As spring fades away, fish will have
tears in their eyes and birds will cry out!

617
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:59,840
As spring fades away, fish will have
tears in their eyes and birds will cry out.

618
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:06,380
Jumping into the water of an
ancient pond. The sound a frog makes.

619
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:14,340
Teacher!

620
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:15,610
Teacher!

621
01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:18,410
It was really awesome...

622
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:19,380
Haiku!

623
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:20,240
I am really...

624
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:21,380
am...

625
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:22,780
really moved!

626
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:26,060
You have no right to call me teacher.

627
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:30,880
That's true.

628
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:00,040
I wrote down all my
experiences here already.

629
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,640
And made a rap about it.

630
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:04,540
Really?

631
01:08:06,710 --> 01:08:09,110
But I won't show it to
anyone including you.

632
01:08:13,310 --> 01:08:14,340
Is that so?

633
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:45,910
Hey.

634
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:47,240
Yes?

635
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,680
Who killed Bunta?

636
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:52,970
Who knows?

637
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:55,480
He's still a little kid after all.

638
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:10,470
Hey!

639
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:14,340
How about we open a school here?

640
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:33,240
Hey! Wait a minute.

641
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:37,680
This is 96% alcohol!

642
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,380
Here! Water, water, water!

643
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:41,010
Water!

644
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:42,340
Drink it!

645
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:43,980
I told you to drink it!

646
01:09:58,580 --> 01:09:59,780
Teacher...

647
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:04,210
Please go out with me?

648
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:08,480
Ah wait, Sa-chan.

649
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:10,240
Sa-chan.

650
01:10:10,610 --> 01:10:11,710
This is not right.

651
01:10:12,210 --> 01:10:14,160
It's against the Child Welfare Law.

652
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,340
If there is no law,

653
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:20,380
Will you go out with me?

654
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:22,540
Sa-chan. Sa-chan.

655
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:26,680
Law obedience

656
01:10:26,910 --> 01:10:28,310
Law compliance

657
01:10:28,710 --> 01:10:29,980
Forbearance

658
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:33,610
Sa-chan.

659
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:36,740
Law compliance

660
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:37,980
Law compliance

661
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:39,680
Forbearance

662
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:45,910
Law compliance is great, isn't it?

663
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:49,910
Teacher is gay.

664
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:52,080
I'm not.

665
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:55,910
That's absurd. I'm not
interested in men at all.

666
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:59,740
But you're not interested in me either.

667
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:02,870
Sa-chan...

668
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:06,610
Sachan is still a student.

669
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:08,980
I'm an intern teacher.

670
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:13,780
What a bad guy!

671
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:16,940
Sachan is crying.

672
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:18,340
He made her cry.

673
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:19,080
Sa-chan...

674
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,140
Hey, you!

675
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:23,380
Did you call us shitheads
behind our backs?

676
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:24,980
I knew it!

677
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:27,530
How can a teacher say such a thing?

678
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:32,980
Sa-chan.

679
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:35,340
Then answer her question now!

680
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:40,740
Would you go out with
Sachan if there was no law?

681
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,230
You're still thinking about it!

682
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:52,940
No. I'm not!

683
01:11:56,910 --> 01:11:58,010
This is not right.

684
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,980
But you're acting like you
really want to go out with her.

685
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:02,440
Certainly not!

686
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:04,440
Sa-chan

687
01:12:05,110 --> 01:12:07,010
She's a nice, innocent kid.

688
01:12:08,710 --> 01:12:09,740
You really are.

689
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:11,380
Then...

690
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:13,310
No. That's not what I mean.

691
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:14,910
That's not going to happen.

692
01:12:15,110 --> 01:12:16,760
I can't sexually exploit you!

693
01:12:18,410 --> 01:12:19,710
Sexual exploitation...

694
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:21,940
I'm sure you won't get it anyway.

695
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:23,280
What I'm trying to say is...

696
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:24,640
This is not right.

697
01:13:50,410 --> 01:13:57,620
Martial Arts Benefits 5 Reasons
Why Martial Arts Can Train Your Mind!

698
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:02,140
No. 17, please come in.

699
01:14:03,110 --> 01:14:04,460
See you next time then.

700
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,210
I'm leaving.

701
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:13,840
What is that?

702
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:15,270
Nothing.

703
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:16,670
Well...

704
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:19,980
About rap...

705
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:21,210
Yes?

706
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,880
Do you think it can be useful
in recovering from trauma?

707
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:26,140
Rap?

708
01:14:27,010 --> 01:14:28,140
It's music.

709
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:34,210
About how I was raped...

710
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:38,710
Suppose I use my own words to
verbalize and explain what happened...

711
01:14:38,910 --> 01:14:40,640
Will it help me in recovering?

712
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:42,710
I think it will help.

713
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:46,940
You think so?

714
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:51,110
You want to write your
story and rap about it, right?

715
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:54,610
That means you're
recognizing your past objectively.

716
01:14:58,110 --> 01:14:59,640
That's actually great.

717
01:15:11,710 --> 01:15:14,710
Hey! It's unusual for
you to be at this time.

718
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:15,940
Where is Kai?

719
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:21,740
He's probably working part-time at "PAON".

720
01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:30,880
There he is!

721
01:15:35,510 --> 01:15:38,110
Get out of my way, dumbass!

722
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:40,170
Shota!

723
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:43,040
You can do it!

724
01:15:58,140 --> 01:15:59,170
Don't go.

725
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:08,810
Don't go!

726
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:06,180
You're overdoing it.

727
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:08,040
Don't you always do that?!

728
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:10,610
What's going on?

729
01:17:10,810 --> 01:17:12,110
What's wrong with you?

730
01:17:12,610 --> 01:17:13,980
Get on the car.

731
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:15,890
Don't worry about it.

732
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:19,210
That's enough already.

733
01:17:19,410 --> 01:17:21,080
I want more.

734
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:25,940
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

735
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:27,710
Get in the car already.

736
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:29,940
You go first.

737
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:31,340
I'm fine with it.

738
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:40,080
We're finally here.

739
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:41,970
Hurry up.

740
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,840
Quick! Remove your make up now.

741
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:54,210
Hurry up!

742
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:26,740
Relax.

743
01:20:27,810 --> 01:20:28,880
A little more.

744
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:31,010
Relax.

745
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:33,740
A little more.

746
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:35,810
Relax.

747
01:20:36,410 --> 01:20:37,580
A little more.

748
01:20:38,980 --> 01:20:39,410
So good!

749
01:20:39,610 --> 01:20:41,240
It feels great inside you!

750
01:20:59,510 --> 01:21:01,010
For our next news...

751
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:07,610
The culprits behind the murder case of grade
school student Bunta Kashiwazaki were arrested.

752
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:11,840
The criminals were five
boys and girls aged 11 to 17.

753
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:17,240
Their statement in the police report was that "Lately
he seemed to be having fun, which pissed us off".

754
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,780
So they end up murdering Bunta.

755
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:23,430
The use of artificial intelligence...

756
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:10,910
Hey!

757
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:12,970
There...

758
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:14,380
Is that okay?

759
01:22:20,110 --> 01:22:21,140
It's okay.

760
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:24,810
Shota!

761
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:31,490
Although there's no
point in saying this now...

762
01:22:32,710 --> 01:22:33,740
I'm sorry.

763
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:41,640
Don't be so full of yourself.

764
01:22:42,310 --> 01:22:43,540
I'll go first.

765
01:23:00,110 --> 01:23:01,180
Rap

766
01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:02,710
Promotes self-awareness

767
01:23:02,910 --> 01:23:04,410
Self-affirmation

768
01:23:05,310 --> 01:23:06,410
Martial Arts

769
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:08,040
Strengthen the mind

770
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:10,410
Trigger List

771
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:12,180
Prevent flashbacks

772
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:16,490
You should have noticed by now.

773
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:18,110
What?

774
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:22,380
It wasn't Kai who raped you.

775
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:28,110
What?!

776
01:23:28,310 --> 01:23:30,240
Don't tell him I told you.

777
01:23:31,610 --> 01:23:32,310
Wait a moment...

778
01:23:32,510 --> 01:23:33,810
What's going on?!

779
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:38,240
That guy...

780
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:42,210
When Kai was still young...

781
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:44,840
He assaulted Kai.

782
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:47,340
That guy?!

783
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:49,210
Who is that guy your talking about?

784
01:23:49,410 --> 01:23:50,440
But...

785
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:53,010
That guy pays him well...

786
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:55,310
And protect him, too.

787
01:24:07,780 --> 01:24:10,180
Why all men and women
who have been raped...

788
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:13,790
Engaged themselves in the sex
industry and work as prostitutes?

789
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:18,540
Wait a moment...

790
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:22,280
Teacher is not yet doing it.

791
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:35,340
Because it feels dirty and worthless.

792
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:45,340
I want to make sure that sexual
violence won't take control over me.

793
01:24:47,010 --> 01:24:49,840
Because I want to restore
my broken self-esteem.

794
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:55,340
It's depressing.

795
01:24:57,940 --> 01:25:01,340
I couldn't tell anymore
if I'm a man or a woman.

796
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:11,140
I couldn't tell anymore
if I liked men or women.

797
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:15,610
Confusing identity...

798
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:17,910
I need to stabilize it.

799
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:20,940
I want to break it.

800
01:25:25,340 --> 01:25:27,390
It's a series of self-contradictions.

801
01:25:32,510 --> 01:25:34,380
This is how it felt.

802
01:25:40,410 --> 01:25:42,480
Who is the real culprit?

803
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:48,140
Why would Kai lie about being the culprit?

804
01:26:03,210 --> 01:26:04,640
Hey!

805
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:06,010
Shota!

806
01:26:06,310 --> 01:26:06,580
Shota...

807
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:07,810
Go away!

808
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:23,710
Hello.

809
01:26:23,910 --> 01:26:26,380
This is Tomoda from
Kawazaki Police Station.

810
01:26:26,580 --> 01:26:28,140
I found the culprit.

811
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:38,380
I don't recognize him.

812
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:43,230
He was wearing a mask when the incident
occurred, so I didn't see his face.

813
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:46,140
What about his body shape?

814
01:26:47,410 --> 01:26:48,440
I had no idea.

815
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:49,810
Okay.

816
01:26:50,340 --> 01:26:51,370
However...

817
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:55,280
His body fluids matched
the sample taken from you.

818
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:58,980
So it's almost certain
that Mamiya is the culprit.

819
01:27:01,610 --> 01:27:04,480
It's surely taking you a long
time before you catch him.

820
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:07,410
Because Mamiya is a member of parliament.

821
01:27:07,610 --> 01:27:08,710
Member of parliament?

822
01:27:08,910 --> 01:27:10,240
It's really difficult.

823
01:27:10,910 --> 01:27:12,940
But we already issued a warrant of arrest.

824
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:14,170
But...

825
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:15,110
About this...

826
01:27:15,310 --> 01:27:16,340
Just keep it a secret for the meantime.

827
01:27:16,540 --> 01:27:17,570
Well...

828
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:19,580
What is Kai's real name?

829
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:22,840
Kaizuka

830
01:27:25,510 --> 01:27:27,240
Yuta

831
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:32,610
Has Kaizuka been wearing
makeup since before?

832
01:27:33,510 --> 01:27:34,380
No.

833
01:27:34,580 --> 01:27:37,310
It started after an incident at his house.

834
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:42,240
Did he do that to your face?

835
01:27:42,710 --> 01:27:45,180
You can file a complaint this time.

836
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:46,510
No.

837
01:27:46,810 --> 01:27:48,110
It wasn't Kai.

838
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:49,570
I'm alright.

839
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:52,140
I have to go.

840
01:27:52,510 --> 01:27:53,910
Thank you for your time!

841
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:56,110
This is crazy.

842
01:27:56,510 --> 01:28:01,510
This young generation's culture of giving
themselves an English nickname is embarrassing.

843
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:04,310
Carry your name well!

844
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:12,790
Isn't that because they want to be
someone other than themselves?

845
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:23,880
He said this was a photo taken
during your practice teaching.

846
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:55,140
He pretended to be the culprit...

847
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:57,240
and let me beat him up.

848
01:28:57,740 --> 01:28:59,180
Defeating the culprit...

849
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:02,760
It will help in recovering
from the trauma.

850
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:05,340
Is that what happened?

851
01:29:12,510 --> 01:29:13,540
So naive.

852
01:29:14,110 --> 01:29:16,310
Sounds like someone uneducated would do.

853
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:27,190
It's better than not knowing who the
culprit is and being anxious about it.

854
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:46,910
I never meant to destroy your family.

855
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:48,710
I'm sorry.

856
01:29:49,810 --> 01:29:51,280
Kai also regrets it.

857
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:03,840
I used to think...

858
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:10,940
Men are disgusting.

859
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:17,310
Gay people are disgusting.

860
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:20,580
I even said it in front of Kai.

861
01:30:20,780 --> 01:30:23,340
Teacher is gay.

862
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:27,610
That's absurd. I'm not
interested in men at all.

863
01:30:32,740 --> 01:30:35,110
That guy was just a schoolboy.

864
01:30:39,610 --> 01:30:41,480
Ever since...

865
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:46,330
He's been constantly
tortured by the words of adults.

866
01:30:47,310 --> 01:30:48,610
Over and over again...

867
01:30:54,110 --> 01:30:55,210
Repeatedly.

868
01:30:55,410 --> 01:30:57,010
Let me hear you rap.

869
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:18,710
Hey!

870
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:22,040
How about we open a school here?

871
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:27,540
How?

872
01:31:31,710 --> 01:31:34,280
How did it get to this point?

873
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:21,010
So high!

874
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:23,570
So adorable.

875
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:27,510
Hitomi

876
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:36,610
I was raped by a man before.

877
01:32:39,780 --> 01:32:41,610
Over one year ago.

878
01:32:46,410 --> 01:32:47,440
A year ago?

879
01:33:15,010 --> 01:33:16,810
It's all over now, right?

880
01:33:23,810 --> 01:33:25,660
Sorry for not telling you before.

881
01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:30,390
I'm the one who should apologize.

882
01:33:32,580 --> 01:33:34,840
I don't do anything for you as your wife.

883
01:33:35,780 --> 01:33:36,110
I'm sorry...

884
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:38,480
No, don't say that.

885
01:33:40,980 --> 01:33:42,530
I'm really thankful to you.

886
01:33:50,910 --> 01:33:51,940
Here...

887
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:58,680
I'm sorry if I signed it first.

888
01:33:59,310 --> 01:34:00,340
Though...

889
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:03,910
I always thought it
should be more formal...

890
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:08,990
But we have been getting
along like friends lately.

891
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:11,280
I'm really...

892
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:14,040
Feel sorry for you.

893
01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:34,340
see.

894
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:39,180
By the way...

895
01:34:40,910 --> 01:34:41,980
That time...

896
01:34:43,940 --> 01:34:45,990
When I pushed your hands away from me

897
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:52,180
It's because I felt so dirty.

898
01:34:54,010 --> 01:34:56,440
And I don't want you
to touch my dirty self.

899
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:08,680
We're getting a divorce already.

900
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:13,440
You don't need to
explain yourself anymore.

901
01:35:17,740 --> 01:35:18,880
It seems like...

902
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:22,340
Even law cannot protect love.

903
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:33,110
You've been staring at me lately.

904
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:34,610
What are you thinking?

905
01:35:44,610 --> 01:35:47,080
Ski-Ski-Ski-Skinny guy.

906
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:49,480
Sti-Sti-Sti-Stinky guy.

907
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:52,080
Regardless of who you are 10 years now.

908
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:55,210
You're somebody who sold
his body for 10 years now!

909
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:00,710
What about drugs?!

910
01:36:00,910 --> 01:36:03,140
Are you taking Viagra?!

911
01:36:16,410 --> 01:36:18,680
You don't know anything about me.

912
01:36:21,780 --> 01:36:25,080
I already know who the culprit is.

913
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:30,080
I received a phone call from the police.

914
01:36:42,810 --> 01:36:44,810
Move quickly!

915
01:36:45,010 --> 01:36:46,910
Hurry and pick them up!

916
01:36:47,110 --> 01:36:49,110
Don't waste time!

917
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:02,270
Kai

918
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:06,110
He should work for me now.

919
01:37:08,210 --> 01:37:11,480
He's getting paid well.

920
01:37:13,210 --> 01:37:14,880
So don't cry that much.

921
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:23,370
Kai!

922
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:25,390
Go change your clothes now!

923
01:37:28,980 --> 01:37:30,010
Kai...

924
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:31,310
Kai!

925
01:37:31,510 --> 01:37:32,780
Don't touch me!

926
01:37:35,310 --> 01:37:36,610
What are you saying?

927
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:39,140
I've worked so hard on my fighting skills.

928
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:42,880
Don't force him if he don't want to.

929
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:47,930
He clearly doesn't want to
get touched by your dirty hands.

930
01:37:49,980 --> 01:37:51,210
That's not it.

931
01:37:54,610 --> 01:37:55,840
It's not it, right?

932
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:06,240
I am me.

933
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:08,880
We're not the same.

934
01:38:10,780 --> 01:38:12,430
Would you like to come along?

935
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:15,140
I remember you coming to Paon once.

936
01:38:16,580 --> 01:38:17,380
I got some good stuff here!

937
01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:19,380
Forget about this guy...

938
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:25,780
After all, Bunta was killed.

939
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:31,230
There's no way to forgive the
culprit for what he has done.

940
01:38:38,980 --> 01:38:40,140
What?

941
01:38:41,310 --> 01:38:43,010
Everyone knows that.

942
01:38:49,740 --> 01:38:51,440
Don't take this the wrong way.

943
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:53,410
Mr. Mamiya...

944
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:56,340
He support us financially...

945
01:38:59,610 --> 01:39:02,040
And give us protection as well.

946
01:39:06,980 --> 01:39:08,210
Get in the car.

947
01:39:44,940 --> 01:39:46,610
I'll put it simply.

948
01:39:48,140 --> 01:39:49,170
Hey!

949
01:39:50,510 --> 01:39:52,060
Everyone here is suffering.

950
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:56,140
But Bunta was killed.

951
01:39:56,910 --> 01:39:58,440
I know that!

952
01:40:05,140 --> 01:40:07,480
The world is not simple as you think.

953
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:10,680
It's a whole mess.

954
01:40:13,610 --> 01:40:15,080
You think so?

955
01:40:38,310 --> 01:40:42,680
Mr. Mamiya is the one
protecting our place!

956
01:40:47,810 --> 01:40:49,480
Without him...

957
01:40:50,940 --> 01:40:52,410
...our lives

958
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:54,110
It will be nothing.

959
01:41:51,910 --> 01:41:53,480
I brought you guys drinks!

960
01:43:07,610 --> 01:43:08,640
Kai

961
01:43:09,080 --> 01:43:09,940
What are you doing?

962
01:43:10,140 --> 01:43:11,510
What's wrong with you?

963
01:43:11,710 --> 01:43:12,740
Having a party!

964
01:43:19,110 --> 01:43:19,780
Kai...

965
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:20,710
Kai!

966
01:43:20,910 --> 01:43:22,180
Block the other side!

967
01:43:59,710 --> 01:44:00,240
Kai!

968
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:01,480
Let's go!

969
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:14,740
Mamiya...

970
01:44:20,580 --> 01:44:23,280
He's still probably burning
in his room right now.

971
01:44:24,510 --> 01:44:25,860
Wait... Killing people?

972
01:44:26,210 --> 01:44:27,780
You're a murderer!

973
01:44:28,110 --> 01:44:29,510
They deserved it.

974
01:44:33,140 --> 01:44:34,180
Hey, you!

975
01:44:34,510 --> 01:44:36,180
What are you going to do about it now?

976
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:37,610
That's so extreme.

977
01:44:38,680 --> 01:44:40,040
Don't worry about me.

978
01:44:40,510 --> 01:44:41,840
I'm alright.

979
01:44:50,980 --> 01:44:52,440
Teacher...

980
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:56,640
What happened to that
"lawful" person I know?

981
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:04,210
Thank you.

982
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:08,440
I suddenly want to say that.

983
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:13,140
I finally did something right.

984
01:45:54,110 --> 01:45:55,860
Teacher is not gay, aren't you?

985
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:03,440
I'm not gay.

986
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:08,230
Let's not do this then.

987
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:10,340
You can go back now.

988
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:15,340
Kai...

989
01:46:15,540 --> 01:46:16,570
Kai!

990
01:47:40,910 --> 01:47:41,980
I like you.

991
01:47:45,140 --> 01:47:46,310
Teacher...

992
01:47:46,940 --> 01:47:48,110
Teacher!

993
01:48:02,340 --> 01:48:03,440
Kai...

994
01:48:06,510 --> 01:48:08,980
Why did you like me?

995
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:14,210
Don't you remember?

996
01:48:16,310 --> 01:48:17,340
Not really.

997
01:48:23,210 --> 01:48:25,140
Please tell me, will you?

998
01:48:33,710 --> 01:48:35,510
When I was in primary school...

999
01:48:36,580 --> 01:48:38,130
During our English class...

1000
01:48:38,410 --> 01:48:43,640
I got assigned to sing an
English song of my choice.

1001
01:48:47,480 --> 01:48:48,510
am...

1002
01:48:48,740 --> 01:48:50,110
I'm tone-deaf.

1003
01:48:51,010 --> 01:48:53,560
I was embarrassed to
sing in front of everyone.

1004
01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:56,610
Why should I sing in the first place?

1005
01:48:56,810 --> 01:48:58,680
It's not a music class anyway.

1006
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:00,880
So I resisted.

1007
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:05,590
I don't remember it at all.

1008
01:49:11,410 --> 01:49:12,810
At that time...

1009
01:49:13,740 --> 01:49:17,680
Teacher Kiritani, who was a practice
teacher back then, said this to me...

1010
01:49:22,310 --> 01:49:25,980
Being embarrassed is a personal issue.

1011
01:49:27,510 --> 01:49:30,860
You don't need to think of
singing for your teachers or others.

1012
01:49:31,880 --> 01:49:33,880
Sing for yourself.

1013
01:49:36,110 --> 01:49:37,510
That way...

1014
01:49:41,080 --> 01:49:45,680
Even if you're laughed at, you
should be able to hold your head high.

1015
01:50:01,310 --> 01:50:02,610
I will turn myself in.

1016
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:10,940
Open up a school and
wait for me to come back.

1017
01:51:45,780 --> 01:51:47,840
Why are you so shocked?

1018
01:51:49,410 --> 01:51:50,880
Don't worry.

1019
01:51:52,310 --> 01:51:57,010
I won't kill you...

1020
01:52:13,880 --> 01:52:16,180
Lay down your arms!

1021
01:52:16,710 --> 01:52:18,340
Mamiya Yoshiro!

1022
01:52:18,540 --> 01:52:20,510
Kaizuka Yuta!

1023
01:52:20,710 --> 01:52:23,580
You are surrounded!

1024
01:52:23,910 --> 01:52:25,310
Kill me!

1025
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:31,440
Don't move!

1026
01:52:35,710 --> 01:52:36,910
You...

1027
01:52:37,780 --> 01:52:40,340
You think you can get away with me?

1028
01:52:40,540 --> 01:52:41,410
You...

1029
01:52:41,610 --> 01:52:42,740
Wherever you go...

1030
01:52:44,040 --> 01:52:45,580
Don't move!

1031
01:52:48,340 --> 01:52:52,640
Stop!

1032
01:54:06,340 --> 01:54:09,240
Live to kill

1033
01:54:10,980 --> 01:54:14,780
I'm feeling hopeless and broken.

1034
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:18,640
This crazy city is manipulating me.

1035
01:54:18,940 --> 01:54:22,080
The best thing I found
in my worthless life.

1036
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:26,110
Emotions are growing inside of me.

1037
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:29,240
Inside me...

1038
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:33,210
Until now...

1039
01:54:33,410 --> 01:54:37,280
Life is just repeating itself.

1040
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:38,780
I don't want a life like this.

1041
01:54:38,980 --> 01:54:41,480
I can't live like this.
