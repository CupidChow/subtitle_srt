00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,800
["The Star-Spangled Banner"]

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,800
["The Star-Spangled Banner"]

3
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,800
My name is Li Tong Feng.

4
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,800
I'm 35 years old.

5
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,200
Looking back on my short life,

6
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,000
the thing I regret the most is

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,600
not being with my family.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
There's one more thing.

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,000
I didn't go to my swimming class.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,400
I still want to be with my family.

11
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,400
Mr. Li, you can start now.

12
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,000
Global warming

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,600
has caused the melting of ice and water.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,200
The sea level rises.

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,000
What is this?

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,200
This is the climate crisis

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,600
that humans have never seen before.

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,000
How to solve the problem of greenhouse gas emission

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,400
is a global problem.

20
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,400
Excuse me, Mr. Li Tong Feng.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,200
I just want to ask

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,400
that you used 30 second-hand cars under the name of the company

23
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,200
as a mortgage

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,000
to borrow 1.5 million RMB from our bank.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,400
What is the purpose of this loan?

26
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,400
Listen to me.

27
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,400
I'll tell you right away.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,600
Clean energy is the seal of the 21st century.

29
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,400
The core technology of batteries

30
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,800
is the core competitiveness of the automotive industry.

31
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,200
This car is the Asim Electric Car.

32
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,600
The king of Asian cars.

33
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,400
Its design breaks the limits of batteries.

34
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,200
One charge, one charge.

35
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,400
Boss, please sign.

36
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,000
We want to take your loan.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,400
The purpose is to get the exclusive right to loan.

38
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,400
Don't tell others.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,400
But I'll tell you the truth.

40
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
If we get it,

41
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,400
our shop

42
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,400
will be the top of the automotive industry in China.

43
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,800
Okay, I understand.

44
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,400
You're too modest.

45
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,800
Boss, it's almost done.

46
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,600
Please sign.

47
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,400
By the way, Mr. Li,

48
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,000
I have to remind you that

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,600
there is one clause in our contract.

50
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,800
Your mortgage

51
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,200
can't be a fake.

52
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,800
Mr. Zhao, I have to remind you that

53
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,400
I'm very sincere when I do things.

54
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,800
Like the process schedule,

55
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,400
change the car frame,

56
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,000
wet water gun,

57
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,000
change the tire brake disc,

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,400
turn the seat and the steering wheel,

59
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,000
and hide the age of the car.

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,200
We definitely won't do that.

61
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,200
Who is that?

62
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,400
He's doing it.

63
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,600
God is watching.

64
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,600
It's raining.

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Rain is water.

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,400
Water is wealth.

67
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,000
Rain is water.

68
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,600
To be honest,

69
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
the master told me that

70
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,800
my land is a treasure trove.

71
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,800
It's really a treasure trove.

72
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,000
It saves us money to wash the car.

73
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,200
Yes, it's worth 1.5 million yuan.

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,600
Here you are.

75
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,000
Sir,

76
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,400
is there any other way to buy this?

77
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,800
Boss,

78
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,600
return your ticket to Taiyang.

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's a temporary loss.

80
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,000
We can't return it.

81
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,800
This is our only chance.

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,600
If we don't get this contract within three days,

83
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
our company will be in trouble.

84
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,200
Besides, the deposit has been paid.

85
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Isn't the money floating?

86
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,600
Don't worry.

87
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm here.

88
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,000
This water bottle is too heavy.

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,600
It won't work.

90
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,400
It's okay, bro.

91
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,400
Forget it.

92
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,600
I'll ask someone else.

93
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,600
The number you dialed is not available.

94
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,200
Please call again later.

95
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,000
I understand.

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'll drink later.

97
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,600
Bye.

98
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,800
Well, I'll just

99
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,600
use this money to make money.

100
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,600
I'm back.

101
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,000
Why are you back so late?

102
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,600
I ate something for Xiaofang.

103
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,200
What did you eat?

104
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,000
Hot pot.

105
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,000
It doesn't taste good.

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,400
It's light soup.

107
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,400
Tao Feng,

108
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,200
don't you like spicy food the most?

109
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
What's wrong with you today?

110
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,200
Did you eat too much?

111
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,800
No, no.

112
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,000
You're a girl.

113
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,600
You're the son of a son-in-law.

114
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,400
Why are you so embarrassed?

115
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,000
Let me tell you.

116
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,000
You must never take off your clothes.

117
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,600
If you take it off too much,

118
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,000
it'll be a trouble.

119
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,800
Is it okay?

120
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
Can you be a man?

121
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,600
I'm not making money.

122
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,000
You want spicy beef?

123
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,600
You have a benefit.

124
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,200
I'll give you the price.

125
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,400
The original price is 9.91 yuan.

126
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,600
Now, in my live stream,

127
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,000
9.91 yuan.

128
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,600
Is it this one?

129
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,200
Is the house under pressure?

130
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,800
There's a house book.

131
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,800
Why is it locked?

132
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,200
What are you doing, Xiao Can?

133
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,400
Dad, I'm not Xiao Can.

134
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,400
I'm the Niu Shi.

135
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,800
Niu Mu Wang didn't find me, right?

136
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,400
Niu Mu Wang is busy in the lower floor.

137
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,600
The upper floor.

138
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,000
Niu Shi, buy it.

139
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,800
Dad, what are you looking for?

140
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,400
I'm not looking for anything.

141
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,200
What are you looking for?

142
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,800
I'll help you.

143
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
Listen,

144
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,800
Niu Mu Wang will find you.

145
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,400
Go downstairs and hide it.

146
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,800
What are you looking for?

147
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,200
I'm looking for the key to the wardrobe.

148
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,000
Why do you need the key?

149
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Give me the passport.

150
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,400
It's with me.

151
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
We put it together.

152
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,800
What do you mean?

153
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,800
We'll go on a trip tomorrow morning.

154
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
Are you going too?

155
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,800
You're not going to work?

156
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
I don't have insurance.

157
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,800
I don't have to work every day.

158
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,200
It's okay to be late for a few days.

159
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,600
It's a big deal.

160
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,200
Why don't you discuss it with me?

161
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I've discussed it with you.

162
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,400
I sent you a message a few days ago.

163
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,000
You replied to me.

164
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Did you forget?

165
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,200
What's wrong with you?

166
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,200
I forgot.

167
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,800
I'm getting old.

168
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,800
I'm not smart.

169
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,600
60 seconds.

170
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,000
Who wants to listen to you?

171
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,800
Honey, you're going on a business trip the day after tomorrow.

172
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,600
We want to go with you.

173
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Isn't Xiao Can a housekeeper?

174
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,200
She's been arguing about going out.

175
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,600
We're just in time for this opportunity.

176
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,000
If you don't mind,

177
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,400
I'll book a ticket.

178
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,600
Tong Feng, hurry up.

179
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,000
Hurry up and take the medicine.

180
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
What?

181
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,800
Self-made medicine.

182
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,600
I didn't make it.

183
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,400
You made it?

184
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
It's all children.

185
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,400
Don't be embarrassed.

186
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
Let me show you.

187
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
What are you doing?

188
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Honey, Mom is here.

189
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
Xiao Can.

190
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Grandma.

191
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,800
Have you finished your homework?

192
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,800
I've finished it.

193
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,000
Let me check.

194
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,000
Can,

195
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
can you write some more?

196
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
No problem.

197
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,600
Mrs. Xin, you're here.

198
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,000
I missed you for a few days.

199
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,200
Sit down. I'll make tea for you.

200
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,800
Please sit down.

201
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,000
Son, we're all going on a trip.

202
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,600
Will it delay your work?

203
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Delay?

204
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,800
It won't.

205
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,200
Yanyan, this is for you.

206
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,800
Mom, look at you.

207
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,600
You bought such expensive tonics.

208
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,000
Give it to my grandson.

209
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,200
Let me help you.

210
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
What are you doing?

211
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Sit down.

212
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Mom, what if it's a grandchild?

213
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
No way.

214
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,200
I'll talk to the master.

215
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
He said he would let me

216
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
bring this to you.

217
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
It's like a poem.

218
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,200
Zhang Qiang is still here.

219
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
He's sleeping on the balcony.

220
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,200
It's dark.

221
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,200
You can go too.

222
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
Mrs. Fang, I'll go by myself.

223
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Who packed this box?

224
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
Mom, I did.

225
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
This kid is pregnant.

226
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
He can't do heavy work.

227
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
You know?

228
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,200
You can't fold the clothes like this.

229
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
It saves space if you roll it up.

230
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,200
Solve problems when you encounter them.

231
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
Why did you bring me here?

232
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
I can't teach him

233
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
our trip to the countryside.

234
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Besides,

235
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
I just retired.

236
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,200
I've been the headmaster for so many years.

237
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
I'm a little angry.

238
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,200
What are you looking at?

239
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
How about I take out two of them?

240
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
I don't need that much anyway.

241
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
Put it down.

242
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,200
Mom, I made a mistake.

243
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,200
The dressing.

244
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
It's inside or outside.

245
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,200
I put that on the first move.

246
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,200
Mom, I'm sorry.

247
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,200
I'm really sorry.

248
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
Mom, have some water.

249
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,200
I said I could do it.

250
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,200
I can do it.

251
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,200
Look.

252
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
Again.

253
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,200
If you're my daughter,

254
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,200
why didn't you tell me?

255
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
I didn't?

256
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
I forgot.

257
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
Just keep it a secret.

258
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
Let's see how long you can keep it a secret.

259
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
What can I do?

260
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
I can't guess the baby's birth date.

261
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
No.

262
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
I need to get some sleep.

263
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
You'll get better if you sleep early.

264
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,200
Easy, easy.

265
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,200
What are you doing?

266
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,200
I was thinking of charging my phone.

267
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
I can't find it.

268
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,200
Where's my phone?

269
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,200
I'm holding it.

270
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,200
Look at me.

271
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
I'm holding it to find my phone.

272
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,200
It's so easy to get a signal.

273
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,200
Right?

274
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
Li Dongfeng.

275
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Why are you still holding the screwdriver?

276
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,200
Get up and leave.

277
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
You wait for me downstairs.

278
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,200
Hurry up. I'll be watching you.

279
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,200
Okay.

280
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
Take care.

281
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,200
Okay.

282
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,200
You need to come to my house.

283
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Help me get to the door and put up a roof.

284
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,200
I'll send you the door password and the phone number.

285
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,200
The door is in the window.

286
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
Remember to bring a stick when you come.

287
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
I need to call you about work.

288
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,200
I'll be myself for me.

289
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,200
I'm eccentric.

290
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
I'll be myself for you.

291
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
You didn't know I'm like a bad guy.

292
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,200
I'll be myself for me.

293
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,200
I'm eccentric.

294
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,200
I'll be myself for you.

295
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
You didn't know I'm like a bad guy.

296
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,200
I'm a happy man on a plane.

297
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,200
I'm full of happiness and hope.

298
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,200
Everyone wants to be like me.

299
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,200
I'm trying to be a good person.

300
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,200
What are you doing?

301
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,200
I'm going to the bathroom.

302
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,200
This way.

303
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,200
Let's go.

304
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,200
Hello, Mr. Chen.

305
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,200
I'm your driver, Ah Fu.

306
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
I'm happy for you.

307
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,200
What kind of car do you want?

308
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
Look over there.

309
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
Let's go.

310
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
Come on, guys.

311
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
Give me a thumbs up.

312
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
We want water.

313
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,200
Come on.

314
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,200
Come on.

315
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
Thank you.

316
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
Thank you.

317
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,200
Mom, is it nice?

318
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,200
Look, look at my big belly.

319
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,200
It's not nice.

320
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Chunsheng, how many people in your company...

321
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,200
Chunsheng, you have a good eye.

322
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Chunsheng, let me introduce you to the performance of this car.

323
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,200
I know this car very well.

324
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,200
Okay, Chunsheng.

325
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,200
I'll start introducing you to the performance of this car.

326
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,200
Switching to successful.

327
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,200
Hello, I'm Xiao Tai.

328
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
AXIMU electric car.

329
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,200
It has the world's best electric engine.

330
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,200
Blue teeth and one-way drive.

331
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,200
Sit down.

332
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
It's comfortable.

333
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
Sit in front.

334
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,200
I'll sit in the back to take care of Xiao Cai.

335
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
You're welcome.

336
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,200
Are you willing to marry your grandma or your grandma?

337
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
I'm old.

338
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Chunsheng, this is my business card.

339
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,200
Thank you.

340
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
I'll give you 27 hours.

341
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,200
Call me if you need anything.

342
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,200
Have a nice trip.

343
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,200
Bye.

344
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,200
AXIMU electric car.

345
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,200
This car is my favorite in my life.

346
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
What about me?

347
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,200
Am I not your favorite?

348
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,200
Yes.

349
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,200
He's so cute.

350
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,200
Xiao Tai, I'm calling the navigation.

351
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,200
Please tell me your destination.

352
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,200
Shunfeng Hotel.

353
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,200
I've found your destination.

354
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Are you sure?

355
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,200
Yes.

356
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,200
You've chosen the best route for yourself.

357
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,200
We're in the sun.

358
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Let's see the sunset.

359
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Sunset.

360
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,200
You're still hot.

361
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,200
Grandma, look over there.

362
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,200
There's a big white?

363
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,200
Please drive carefully.

364
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,200
It's dangerous.

365
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,200
It's dangerous.

366
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,200
It's dangerous.

367
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,200
Mother, you're holding the child.

368
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,200
It's dangerous.

369
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
It smells so good.

370
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,200
I'll talk to you when I get to the hotel.

371
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,200
You take mother and child to eat something.

372
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,200
Then you take them out.

373
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Honey, how much is the car you want to buy?

374
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
Not much.

375
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,200
Dad, not much?

376
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,200
Then how much?

377
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
How much?

378
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
Less.

379
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,200
Sister, don't worry.

380
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,200
My brother-in-law is rich.

381
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,200
He has a big car.

382
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,200
Isn't he?

383
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
Yes, he's rich.

384
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,200
Yes, when this car is bought by the agent,

385
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,200
my brother-in-law is not the same brother-in-law.

386
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,200
He's a big entrepreneur.

387
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,200
He's rich.

388
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,200
Honey, I heard your sister-in-law got divorced.

389
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,200
What's going on?

390
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,200
Did she earn money?

391
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,200
I've taught her to be good and to have a good life.

392
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,200
She should live like a student.

393
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,200
One grade is good, the other is bad.

394
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,200
Then she can get a good grade.

395
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,200
Then she can get a good grade.

396
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,200
I think she's right.

397
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,200
Xiao Tai, did you pee?

398
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
No, I didn't.

399
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
I'm asking you.

400
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
You haven't answered me.

401
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
Be good.

402
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,200
There's a bowl of water in the pot.

403
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,200
Everyone is playing happily when they come out.

404
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,200
Xiao Tai, play the most popular music this year.

405
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,200
Okay.

406
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,200
Now play the song of Jiang Yifan.

407
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,200
Love this road.

408
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,200
Drink it.

409
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
Jiang Yifan sings so well.

410
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,200
That's right.

411
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Did she ask me to knock on the door?

412
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,200
The Bluetooth is broken.

413
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Boss, my password is not right.

414
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
How much is it?

415
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,200
I know.

416
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,200
I'll send it to you later.

417
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,200
You know, you can't just say it.

418
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,200
I suddenly thought of something.

419
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,200
What is it?

420
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,200
You said that our family has been out for so many days.

421
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
The password of the family door.

422
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,200
Do you have to change it?

423
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
Changed.

424
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,200
What did you change?

425
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,200
The wedding anniversary.

426
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,200
Change it.

427
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Dad, when is your wedding anniversary with mom?

428
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,200
I want to know.

429
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,200
The password is not right.

430
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
Dad, did you forget?

431
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,200
I completely forgot.

432
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,200
No, you can't.

433
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,200
How can you forget on such a big day?

434
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,200
You should tell the child.

435
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,200
Who can remember a wedding anniversary?

436
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,200
Mother, you and your brother's wedding anniversary.

437
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,200
I don't remember.

438
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,200
Mother, you and your brother's wedding anniversary.

439
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,200
You must have forgotten it, right?

440
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,200
July 18, 1984.

441
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,200
On Wednesday, I wore a red dress.

442
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,200
Dad, drink some water.

443
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
Sun.

444
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,200
Jinhua.

445
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,200
Lower the temperature.

446
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,200
This is broken.

447
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,200
Yes, sun.

448
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,200
Xiao Tai, Xiao Tai, lower the temperature.

449
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,200
Okay, now the temperature is lowered by 3 degrees.

450
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,200
Did you decipher the password?

451
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,200
The verification failed.

452
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,200
Brother, this is not my house.

453
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,200
I know it's not your house.

454
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,200
Don't misunderstand.

455
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,200
This is my boss.

456
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,200
This is my owner's house.

457
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,200
No, brother, I didn't lie to you.

458
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
My boss is anxious.

459
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,200
Let me try again.

460
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,200
Give me a chance.

461
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,200
Opportunity is always left to those who are prepared.

462
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,200
Obviously you are not ready.

463
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,200
Come with me.

464
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,200
What?

465
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,200
It's not cold.

466
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,200
Let me do it.

467
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,200
Heat mode.

468
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,200
Wind power.

469
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,200
Where is this shot?

470
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,200
This is high technology.

471
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
You have to have some technical content, right?

472
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
Brother, you don't have any technical content.

473
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
Wind power level 3.

474
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,200
I brought a fan.

475
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
Come on, give it to them.

476
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,200
Director.

477
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,200
Sister.

478
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,200
It's suitable.

479
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,200
It's okay.

480
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
It's stuck.

481
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,200
You drive so fast.

482
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
Slow down.

483
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
Yuanyuan, don't worry.

484
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,200
Son, you are really fast.

485
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,200
Drive faster.

486
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,200
The wind can get in more.

487
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,200
We are cool.

488
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,200
How can you drive so fast?

489
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,200
Be careful.

490
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,200
Slow down.

491
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
Okay, okay.

492
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,200
Slow down.

493
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,200
It's not enough yet.

494
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
It's okay.

495
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,200
Just push it.

496
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,200
It's okay.

497
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,200
I can do it.

498
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
You can do it.

499
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,200
You can do it.

500
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,200
You can do it.

501
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,200
Slow down.

502
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,200
Slow down.

503
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,200
Slow down.

504
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,200
It's okay.

505
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,200
Just push it.

506
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
It will restart automatically in five seconds.

507
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,200
Five, four, three, two, one.

508
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
It's time.

509
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,200
Brother, you are fast.

510
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
I will count it for you.

511
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,200
Go back.

512
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
You...

513
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,200
Can you sit back?

514
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
Dad, you overtook us again.

515
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,200
We are the first place now.

516
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
Li Guangfeng, how did you burn yourself?

517
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
It's nothing.

518
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,200
Zhong Guoming died.

519
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
So...

520
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,200
The brake is a little out of order.

521
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
What?

522
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,200
What?

523
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
Oh my god.

524
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,200
It's okay.

525
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,200
Three, four, three, four.

526
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,200
That moment is gone.

527
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
A'pu is so unreliable.

528
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Why doesn't he answer the phone?

529
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,200
Oh my god, what should we do?

530
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,200
Don't panic.

531
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,200
Solve the problem if you encounter it.

532
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,200
You can't run away.

533
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,200
The air conditioner is dead.

534
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,200
Is it?

535
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
It's okay.

536
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,200
It's only like this.

537
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,200
Sometimes it's not.

538
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
Brother-in-law,

539
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,200
the expert said

540
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,200
if the brake is out of order,

541
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,200
the throttle and the brake will be stepped on together.

542
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,200
It will trigger the brake's cruise control.

543
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
The car will stop.

544
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
Brother-in-law, try it.

545
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,200
Let's try it.

546
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
Isn't it solved?

547
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
It's all locked.

548
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
All...

549
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,200
Oh my god.

550
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,200
It's 140.

551
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,200
Ask the expert what's going on.

552
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
Okay.

553
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
Everyone, that's all for today.

554
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
The expert is off work.

555
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
He is a celebrity.

556
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
He has 17,000 or 18,000 fans.

557
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
Jiang, if you don't understand,

558
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,200
can you stop being so stupid?

559
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,200
I'm not stupid.

560
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,200
There are old and young people in this car.

561
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,200
Listen to the celebrity.

562
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,200
Don't talk nonsense.

563
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,200
Don't be so noisy.

564
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,200
You are not young.

565
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,200
You are not young.

566
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,200
What's wrong with you?

567
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,200
What's wrong with you?

568
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,200
Stop talking nonsense.

569
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,200
I said stop talking nonsense.

570
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,200
Or you will be the one who will be punished.

571
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,200
Listen to me.

572
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,200
We will turn around and change the car.

573
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,200
It's 140 kilometers per hour.

574
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,200
If we turn around, it will be easy.

575
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,200
Do you understand?

576
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,200
It's okay.

577
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,200
It's okay.

578
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,200
It's solved when it's a problem.

579
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
Help!

580
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,200
Help!

581
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,200
Mom, mom, mom.

582
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,200
Help!

583
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,200
No, no, no.

584
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,200
It's okay.

585
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,200
Baby,

586
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,200
I'll take some beautiful pictures for you and my car.

587
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,200
Show them to your mom.

588
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,200
Did you hit something just now?

589
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,200
I didn't see it.

590
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,200
Did you see it?

591
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,200
No, I didn't.

592
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,200
No, I didn't.

593
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,200
Baby, are you looking for me?

594
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,200
I didn't see it.

595
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,200
Baby!

596
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,200
Baby!

597
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,200
Baby!

598
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,200
Let me go!

599
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,200
Let me go!

600
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,200
Don't shout, baby!

601
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,200
He hit my baby!

602
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,200
I'm gonna kill him today!

603
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,200
Baby!

604
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,200
I'm sorry.

605
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,680
My husband, what should we do?

606
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,800
Why isn't he answering his phone?

607
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,520
It's okay.

608
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,640
I know what's going on.

609
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,600
I'll try to fix it later.

610
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,520
It'll be fine.

611
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:11,960
Later.

612
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,000
Is the air conditioner running out?

613
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,200
Who is it?

614
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,360
It's not convenient to answer.

615
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,200
Xiao Fan.

616
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,120
You're asking me to talk about work?

617
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,040
It's already this time.

618
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,440
How can I have time to chat with him?

619
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,120
What are you doing?

620
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,320
Turn it over and slide it.

621
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,000
Get off.

622
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,680
Slide it again.

623
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,640
Is it Xiao Fang or a back-up?

624
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,000
It's really Xiao Fang.

625
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,040
It's Xiao Fang, right?

626
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,040
I'll answer it for you.

627
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,280
No.

628
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:00,880
Come on.

629
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,560
I'll answer it for you.

630
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,200
Come on.

631
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:02,840
I'll answer it.

632
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,360
Brother, help!

633
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,320
It's really Xiao Fang.

634
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,600
Sister-in-law, where's my brother?

635
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,440
What's up?

636
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,800
Boss, I told the security guard to be a thief.

637
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,520
I can't explain it clearly.

638
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,960
Explain it to me.

639
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,240
Give the phone to the security guard.

640
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,000
Come on.

641
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,720
I'm Ye Zhu.

642
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,360
This is my colleague's ID card.

643
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:28,760
Go in.

644
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,640
Brother, look.

645
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,440
Isn't this a misunderstanding?

646
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,120
If you don't go...

647
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,680
Get off.

648
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,320
I'm sorry.

649
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,480
How much is the monthly salary?

650
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,480
Why are you so stubborn?

651
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:44,960
8,500 yuan.

652
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,880
How much?

653
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,480
You can raise it when you get a license.

654
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,800
You can't even pay me.

655
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,080
간gies

656
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,480
Hi.

657
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,520
Hi.

658
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,120
No.

659
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,200
There's a problem with the car.

660
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,760
Now it doesn't stop at all.

661
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,400
My God.

662
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,320
In this situation,

663
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,160
it doesn't stop at all.

664
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,960
But this kind of thing will never happen.

665
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,400
Look at me, I'm an adult. I'm just kidding.

666
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,360
According to our parking contract,

667
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,000
if you cause any damage to the car,

668
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
you must compensate.

669
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,560
Why can't we make it clear?

670
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,600
The car is broken and there's no car.

671
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
If you can't fix it, I'll complain to you.

672
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,240
Come on.

673
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,800
Mrs. Li, don't be in a hurry.

674
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,360
There's no point in being in a hurry.

675
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,120
There are two buttons on the dashboard.

676
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,640
Just press them and you can start the engine.

677
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,120
I was just pressing them.

678
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,120
I'm dead.

679
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,320
How can this car be broken?

680
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,120
Check if there's any damage to the dashboard.

681
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,520
Mrs. Li.

682
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,120
Hey, hey, hey.

683
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,320
Mrs. Li, call her.

684
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,040
Call her.

685
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,320
Mrs. Li.

686
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,320
Li...

687
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,880
I failed.

688
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,680
I failed.

689
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,360
Assola Coin.

690
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,680
Let's go!

691
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,680
I know you are here.

692
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,680
I know you are here.

693
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,680
Bonkhoi

694
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,680
Bon-ai

695
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,680
I don't know how to play the drums.

696
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,680
Wait!

697
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,680
Wait!

698
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,680
I don't know how to play the drums.

699
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,680
I can't control it.

700
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,680
Come on, let me see.

701
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,680
No, no, no, no, no.

702
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,680
Don't touch my grandson.

703
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,680
Yes, yes, yes, you can't.

704
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,680
I'll do it.

705
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,680
I'll be the one to do it.

706
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,680
I'll take care of this.

707
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,680
You go to the back.

708
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,680
I'll do it.

709
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,680
Right here.

710
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,680
Super Tanlambaka

711
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,680
Go!

712
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,680
Brother-in-law, your legs are too wide.

713
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,680
I can't reach it.

714
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,680
Where did you come from?

715
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,680
Be careful.

716
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,680
Be careful with the wall.

717
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,680
Did you touch it?

718
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,680
Brother-in-law, I touched it.

719
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,680
You can't reach it.

720
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,680
Come on, hold my legs.

721
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,680
No, no, no, no.

722
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,680
Give me a point.

723
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,680
Come on, come on.

724
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,680
The police are here.

725
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,680
I'll tell you what.

726
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,680
I'll tell you what.

727
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,680
The car is broken.

728
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,680
The car is broken.

729
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,680
The car is broken.

730
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,680
Turn around.

731
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,680
He's now 140 meters behind.

732
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,680
He can't drive.

733
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,680
I don't want to come to this trip at all.

734
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,680
He's broken.

735
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,680
He's broken.

736
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,680
I'm not going to play drums.

737
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,680
Turn around.

738
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,680
You drop my hat.

739
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,680
When will you put on makeup?

740
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,680
Help us.

741
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,680
Jiang Xiang, move your belly away.

742
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,680
Help us.

743
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,680
What's wrong?

744
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,680
Help us.

745
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,680
God, help us.

746
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,680
I can't do it.

747
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,680
Help us get there.

748
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,680
I'll kill you!

749
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,680
You're here to save us!

750
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,680
Be careful, don't touch you!

751
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,680
SOS, help!

752
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,680
Go, go!

753
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,680
Yes, yes, yes!

754
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,680
Help!

755
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,680
Get off!

756
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,680
Wait, I understand!

757
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,680
He doesn't understand Chinese!

758
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,680
What should we do, dad?

759
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,680
Can, don't you speak English?

760
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,680
Tell him our car is broken!

761
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,680
Okay, dad!

762
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,680
Slow down, slow down!

763
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,680
Good morning teacher!

764
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,680
Let's take a picture!

765
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,680
Dad!

766
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,680
I'm here!

767
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,680
What's the time now?

768
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,680
You're so polite!

769
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,680
Dad, I'm too serious!

770
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,680
Say more!

771
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,680
I've spent 200,000 yuan a year to learn English!

772
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,680
You just learn these two words!

773
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,680
San, say help!

774
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,680
Say help!

775
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,680
Help!

776
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,680
Help!

777
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,680
Yes, yes, yes!

778
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,680
Where are you going?

779
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,680
Where are you going?

780
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,680
Where are you going?

781
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,680
It's dangerous, go back!

782
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,680
Slow down!

783
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,680
Slow down!

784
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,680
Mom, are you okay?

785
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,680
Jinqiu, you have a nosebleed!

786
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,680
You have a nosebleed!

787
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,680
You have a nosebleed!

788
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,680
I know I have a nosebleed!

789
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,680
If you have any problem, solve it!

790
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,680
Oh, right!

791
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,680
Come on!

792
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,680
Take it down!

793
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,680
This is a truck!

794
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,680
Why did you pull it down?

795
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,680
I'll give you a massage!

796
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,680
What do you mean a massage?

797
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,680
The cable is pulled out!

798
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,680
Oh, no!

799
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,680
Director Fang, you're on fire!

800
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,680
Director Fang!

801
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,680
Director!

802
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,680
It's okay, don't worry!

803
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,680
There are police officers!

804
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,680
Please, please!

805
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,680
Please, please!

806
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,680
Please, please!

807
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,680
Please, please!

808
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,680
It's not dry!

809
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,680
My Chinese is very...

810
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,680

823
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,680
I'm sorry!

824
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,680
We forgot to tell you!

825
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,680
The police are...

826

839
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,680
Stop!

840
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,680
Hello!

841
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,680
Hello!

842
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,680
Our car is broken!

843
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,680
It's broken!

844
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,680
Why are you so polite? I said my car!

845
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,680
I understand!

846
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,680
Stop the car!

847
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,680
I can't stop the car!

848
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,680
I want to see your mother!

849
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,680
My mother is right behind me!

850
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,680
Help!

851
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,680
Why are you so rude?

852
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,680
Don't hurt Ruan Zhi!

853
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,680
Ruan Zhi?

854
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,680
Help! Help!

855
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,680
Don't hurt her!

856
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,680
Stop!

857
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,680
Don't hurt Ruan Zhi!

858
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,680
Don't do this! We are all good people!

859
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,680
Don't cry!

860
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,680
They are not human!

861
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,680
We are family!

862
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,680
Stop the car!

863
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,680
Or I will shoot!

864
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,680
Let's be closer!

865
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,680
Let him know we are family!

866
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,680
How can he find out?

867
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,680
We don't have a passport!

868
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,680
Dad!

869
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,680
Where is the sun and the moon?

870
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,680
What do you mean?

871
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,680
Where is the stars and the moon?

872
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,680
Where is the sun and the moon?

873
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,680
The sun and the moon are...

874
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,680
the stars and the moon!

875
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,680
They are...

876
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,680
family!

877
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,680
Stop!

878
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,680
You are gone!

879
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,680
What do you mean?

880
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,680
Stop the car!

881
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,680
I will explain it to you!

882
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,680
He is my son!

883
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,680
Son?

884
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,680
Mom!

885
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,680
This is my husband!

886
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,680
Husband!

887
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,680
This is my sister!

888
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,680
Mom, what are you doing?

889
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,680
I understand!

890
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,680
We are family!

891
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,680
Yes!

892
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,680
Yes!

893
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,680
But you are out of luck!

894
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,680
The car is broken!

895
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,680
Broken!

896
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,680
Broken!

897
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,680
Let's go to the police station!

898
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,680
Sir!

899
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,680
We are here!

900
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,680
We are here!

901
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,680
We are here!

902
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,680
We are here!

903
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,680
We are here!

904
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,680
We are here!

905
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,680
Great!

906
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,680
He is here!

907
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,680
You are here!

908
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,680
Five minutes to the toll booth!

909
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,680
What do you want?

910
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,680
I will go to the front office!

911
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,680
I am stuck!

912
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,680
Five minutes to the toll booth?

913
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,680
What do you want?

914
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,680
Why are you hitting him?

915
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,680
All the appliances are the same!

916
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,680
One, two, three, go!

917
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,680
Ouch!

918
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,680
Ouch!

919
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,680
Ouch!

920
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,680
Ouch!

921
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,680
Ouch!

922
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,680
What's wrong?

923
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,680
You are wearing the wrong clothes!

924
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,680
This time you are definitely wearing the wrong clothes!

925
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,680
No, no, no!

926
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,680
My seat is getting hot!

927
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,680
It's hot!

928
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,680
What do you mean?

929
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,680
You hit me!

930
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,680
What's going on?

931
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,680
You are using the female air conditioner!

932
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,680
I don't have one!

933
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,680
I have the female air conditioner on me!

934
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,680
Don't worry!

935
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,680
Oh no!

936
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,680
I can't see anything!

937
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,680
Don't worry!

938
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,680
Xiao Qiao, calm down!

939
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,680
Brother!

940
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,680
Give me my bullhead!

941
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,680
Bullhead!

942
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,680
Bullhead!

943
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,680
Police!

944
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,680
Did you arrange it?

945
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,680
I almost fell!

946
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,680
Don't hit my belly!

947
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,680
Don't hit my grandson!

948
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,680
I can't take it anymore!

949
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,680
Pull down the footrest!

950
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,680
I can't get out of this building!

951
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,680
Hold on!

952
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,680
Oh no!

953
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,680
Bye bye!

954
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,680
What's going on?

955
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,680
Get away!

956
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,680
Again!

957
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,680
Don't hit him!

958
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,680
Get away from me!

959
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,680
Get away!

960
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,680
Get away!

961
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,680
It stopped!

962
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,680
It stopped!

963
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,680
Xiao Qiao, get off the car!

964
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,680
Brother, I need to get some fresh air!

965
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,680
What's going on?

966
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,680
Get off!

967
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,680
Why are you back?

968
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,680
Are you okay?

969
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,680
Are you okay?

970
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,680
I'm fine!

971
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,680
Bullhead, your pants are wet!

972
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,680
Where's the car?

973
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,680
It's impossible!

974
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,680
It's impossible!

975
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,680
Forget it!

976
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,680
Let's go scuba diving!

977
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,680
Scuba diving!

978
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,680
It's fun!

979
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,680
This is the car that we're looking for.

980
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,680
It's a 48-car-car.

981
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,680
It's a fast car.

982
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,680
630, go to the right.

983
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,680
The car is on the road.

984
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,680
Go!

985
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,680
I'm going to get you!

986
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,680
I'm going to get you!

987
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,680
630, go to the right.

988
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,680
Go to the right!

989
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,680
I'm going to get you!

990
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,680
Don't come any closer!

991
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,680
No one can stop me!

992
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,680
Brother, you have to pull the lever.

993
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,680
What lever?

994
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,680
I want to get some fresh air!

995
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,680
What should we do?

996
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,680
You go first, I'll get your brother-in-law.

997
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,680
I'll do it.

998
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,680
Be careful!

999
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,680
Be careful!

1000
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,680
I'm sorry, sister.

1001
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,680
I'm sorry, director.

1002
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,680
Be careful!

1003
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,680
It's so hot!

1004
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,680
You're the one who should be careful.

1005
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,680
Okay!

1006
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,400
Assault shaker, sword!

1007
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,400
Shield the shaker!

1008
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,240
Where's the clutch?

1009
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,280
No clutch!

1010
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,280
No lever.

1011
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,280
Auto gear, feel free to Manual!

1012
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,960
Let's test the clutch.

1013
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,960
Look in front, don't peek.

1014
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,960
You are so mad.

1015
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,960
You look like a trainer.

1016
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,560
You need to be more careful.

1017
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,560
He doesn't say you, but you can improve.

1018
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,960
Demon King, your butt is smoking.

1019
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,360
What should I do?

1020
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,160
I'm sorry.

1021
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,960
Isn't he dead? Why didn't he answer the phone?

1022
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,960
Don't worry. He might be busy.

1023
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,160
He'll be back soon.

1024
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,160
You...

1025
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,160
Can you understand?

1026
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,160
He doesn't care if something happens.

1027
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,160
First, you're a mother.

1028
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,960
You can't be angry and give birth to a baby.

1029
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,960
Besides, the police are driving in front of us.

1030
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,760
Look, all the cars are gone.

1031
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,560
It's okay. Someone will come to save us.

1032
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,560
Hello? Hello?

1033
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,560
Where did the phone go?

1034
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,760
Forget it. Let's go to another store.

1035
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,960
Don't worry.

1036
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,960
What's wrong with you?

1037
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,360
I'm fine. I'm a little dizzy.

1038
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,960
I'll close my eyes.

1039
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,760
Let's take a break.

1040
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,160
A big spider.

1041
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,360
There's a spider on your head.

1042
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,760
You're hallucinating.

1043
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,560
Grandma, there's a spider on your head.

1044
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,560
Take it away.

1045
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,560
Hurry up.

1046
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,960
Mom, don't move.

1047
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,360
I won't.

1048
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,360
What are you doing?

1049
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,360
I'll hit you.

1050
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,360
Mom!

1051
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,360
Are you okay?

1052
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,360
Mom!

1053
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,360
This is not a spider fight.

1054
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,360
This is a fight against me.

1055
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,960
I'll kick you first.

1056
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,360
If you hit me again,

1057
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,560
how can I offend your family?

1058
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,960
Mom,

1059
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,560
I didn't mean to do that.

1060
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,960
Didn't you just let me...

1061
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,760
Honey, say something.

1062
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,160
Right. My sister didn't mean to do that.

1063
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,760
Look, there's a spider on your head.

1064
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,960
And then...

1065
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,760
And then you hit your face.

1066
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,160
How can you do that on purpose?

1067
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,560
You can't.

1068
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,960
Mom, look. From this angle,

1069
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,560
Yuan Yuan is protecting you.

1070
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,760
You're not talking to me.

1071
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,160
Son, that's just a mouth.

1072
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,160
I've been teaching the master for 30 years.

1073
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:03,160
I've never been beaten.

1074
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,760
Grandma, what's wrong?

1075
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,960
Mom.

1076
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,360
Mom, are you having high blood pressure?

1077
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,360
Hurry up and take your medicine.

1078
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,560
It's from the house of the dead.

1079
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,360
Are you feeling better?

1080
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,760
Mother, if you can't get over it,

1081
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:24,960
then call Tong Feng to give me a big knife, okay?

1082
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,960
If you're guilty, you'll be punished.

1083
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,960
Jiu, are you going to take the car?

1084
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,760
No, I'm going to fix the car.

1085
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,960
Did I tell you to chase me?

1086
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,760
Yes, I'm sorry.

1087
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,960
You're still going to chase me?

1088
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,360
No, I'm taking you to the water.

1089
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,760
You're not going to chase me?

1090
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,360
My eyes are like this!

1091
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,560
I'm going to go and kill that person!

1092
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,160
You're not going to chase me?

1093
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,960
Chase me! Chase me!

1094
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,960
Don't worry, baby. I'm going to avenge you.

1095
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,760
In my heart, he's already a dead person.

1096
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,360
You're already dead!

1097
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,560
Yes, go!

1098
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,360
Hurry up!

1099
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,160
What are you doing?

1100
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,960
Look at my eyes!

1101
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,360
You're taking me to the water!

1102
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,960
Are you scared?

1103
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:16,360
Look at my eyes!

1104
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,360
Where are you going?

1105
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,760
Look at my eyes!

1106
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,760
Take me to the water!

1107
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:26,360
Brother-in-law, the screen is reacting!

1108
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,560
It's half done.

1109
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,960
Xiao Fang is calling.

1110
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,360
Hello, Xiao Fang.

1111
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,960
Boss.

1112
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,560
I'm busy driving.

1113
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,160
I'm hanging up. We'll talk later.

1114
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,160
He can't wait.

1115
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:46,160
I'm just asking you, did your cat get the vaccine?

1116
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,760
Oh, my.

1117
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:51,360
What?

1118
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:51,960
That's it?

1119
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,360
Hang up?

1120
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,160
Don't hang up, boss.

1121
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,360
I've unlocked it.

1122
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,760
I've got the house book.

1123
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,960
But who should I go to?

1124
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,560
You should give me the second house book.

1125
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,760
Or I don't know who I'm going to find.

1126
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,560
Why are you still sneaking around with the house book?

1127
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,160
Also, if you're not worried about the house book,

1128
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,760
I'll go get the vaccine first.

1129
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,160
Hello?

1130
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,360
Hang up?

1131
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:16,960
Why hasn't he信号?

1132
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:17,960
Don't come over.

1133
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,160
Mimi, don't come over.

1134
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,160
Mimi!

1135
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,160
Mimi, don't come over!

1136
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:44,760
Why are you guys not talking?

1137
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,960
Son, what happened?

1138
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,760
You still have to put the house down.

1139
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,160
Jiang Xiang, look ahead.

1140
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,960
Take a good look.

1141
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,960
Sister, don't use me as an excuse.

1142
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,560
You're too big a problem.

1143
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,760
I can't solve it.

1144
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,160
Li Dongfeng,

1145
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,160
you're not even discussing such a big problem with me.

1146
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,160
What do you take me for?

1147
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,160
But you did the right thing.

1148
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,160
I don't have a name on the house book.

1149
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,560
I don't have the right to know about this.

1150
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,560
It's okay.

1151
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:16,560
Mom, I want to pee.

1152
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,960
Shut up!

1153
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,360
Look at you and your kid.

1154
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,560
Let's talk about this later.

1155
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,560
Let's talk about this.

1156
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:25,760
Why are you holding my phone?

1157
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,560
What are you looking at?

1158
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,760
I want to see how much you have left to hide from me.

1159
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,360
Unlock it for me.

1160
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:32,760
Unlock it!

1161
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,560
Unlock it! Look!

1162
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,560
Li Dongfeng, you've changed.

1163
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,560
You're treating me like this.

1164
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,360
Come on, say it.

1165
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,360
When did it start?

1166
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,760
Yanyan, this is a misunderstanding.

1167
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,760
My son is not that kind of person.

1168
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,360
Yes, my brother-in-law is not that kind of person.

1169
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,160
That woman must have seduced him first.

1170
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,160
Jiang Xiang, shut up.

1171
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,560
Jiang Xiang, make it clear.

1172
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:05,960
What did I change? Who am I with?

1173
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,360
When did I start?

1174
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,360
As a mother, as a child,

1175
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,360
I'm telling you, don't spread rumors.

1176
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,760
I spread rumors?

1177
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,360
I'm telling you, don't spread rumors.

1178
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,360
I spread rumors?

1179
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,360
I sent you a message, it's all red.

1180
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,760
You don't listen at all.

1181
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,160
You're just a pretender.

1182
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:26,160
I thought I was discovered.

1183
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,960
We're busy because of the robot.

1184
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:32,960
Don't cry.

1185
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,760
Besides, every time you sent me a message,

1186
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:35,760
you sent me 60 seconds.

1187
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,160
You sent me dozens of messages.

1188
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,160
One of them came.

1189
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,560
You said it was all about the family's dirty business.

1190
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,160
What did I reply?

1191
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,360
My business is dirty,

1192
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,360
and yours is good, right?

1193
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,760
I saw someone outside.

1194
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:48,560
Your phone.

1195
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:49,960
You don't take care of it for 24 hours a day.

1196
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:50,960
You go home and turn off the lights.

1197
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:51,960
You go out to eat every day.

1198
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:52,960
You have to do all the chores.

1199
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:53,960
Who believes that?

1200
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:54,560
I don't believe it.

1201
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,960
I'm a second-hand seller.

1202
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,160
My phone is not for

1203
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,760
not taking care of it every day.

1204
00:55:58,760 --> 00:55:59,760
Besides,

1205
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,960
I'm doing it for this family.

1206
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,160
You're doing it for this family?

1207
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,560
I go out to sell insurance every day.

1208
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,560
I go out to pay customers.

1209
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,360
I have to take care of the kids when I come back.

1210
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,360
I'm free.

1211
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,160
Look at you.

1212
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,160
I didn't say you were free.

1213
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,160
I can't tell you that.

1214
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,360
Didn't you hear what I said?

1215
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,560
You drive.

1216
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,560
Okay.

1217
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:17,760
Li Dongfeng,

1218
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,960
you don't know how much I've paid for this family, do you?

1219
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,560
I quit the job of a fashion designer

1220
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:28,560
to take care of the kids.

1221
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,760
It hurts to have a child.

1222
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,560
Why do I have to have a second child?

1223
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,560
Don't you know?

1224
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,560
I'm doing it for our family.

1225
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,760
When we were in love,

1226
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,960
you could take a 16-hour train to see me.

1227
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:49,960
You don't even look at the WeChat for 60 seconds now.

1228
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,960
You're a liar.

1229
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,560
What did I lie about?

1230
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,960
I went to see you in a 16-hour train.

1231
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,360
There was nothing there.

1232
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,760
You have a house and a car now.

1233
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,760
The kids need tuition.

1234
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,760
The company needs...

1235
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,760
the expenses.

1236
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,360
The employees need to have salaries.

1237
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,760
The family needs living expenses.

1238
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:09,960
I don't know how to live.

1239
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,160
I have to pay for the expenses.

1240
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,960
I have to pay for the expenses.

1241
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,360
I don't know how to live.

1242
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,560
The car in the hospital was flooded yesterday.

1243
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,560
Who did I tell you?

1244
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,560
If I can't get the car,

1245
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:22,760
I'll lose everything.

1246
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,160
I can only pay the mortgage.

1247
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,160
I can only pay the loan.

1248
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,160
What should I do?

1249
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,360
Was it raining so hard yesterday?

1250
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:34,560
It was all flooded.

1251
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,960
Why didn't you tell us about it?

1252
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,360
What's the point?

1253
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:39,560
Who can solve it for me?

1254
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:42,360
I came here to negotiate the contract.

1255
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,960
But you came here to make trouble.

1256
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,360
You think I'm willing to come?

1257
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,560
Let me tell you the truth.

1258
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,560
I came to see you.

1259
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,160
I can't even catch your shadow.

1260
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,960
You're so funny.

1261
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,160
I can't tell you anything.

1262
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,960
Stop it.

1263
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,560
Let's get a divorce.

1264
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,760
Stop arguing.

1265
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,160
Why?

1266
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,560
You're pregnant.

1267
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,160
You're scaring my grandson.

1268
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:09,360
Mom, I want to tell you the truth.

1269
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,960
I don't have a grandchild.

1270
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:11,960
I still have a granddaughter.

1271
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,960
I like her or not.

1272
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:31,160
I'm going to get off the car.

1273
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:34,360
I don't want to stay in this car for a minute.

1274
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,360
I want to get off too.

1275
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,360
But the brake is broken.

1276
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,360
Shut up.

1277
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:43,960
Sister.

1278
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,360
Get out.

1279
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,360
I'm going to get off the car.

1280
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,360
I understand.

1281
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,960
I understand everything.

1282
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:57,760
You think I'm just eating and drinking at your house.

1283
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,360
It's affecting your relationship.

1284
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:01,960
I can't think of anything.

1285
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:04,360
I'll move out when I get back.

1286
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:07,160
You guys stop singing.

1287
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,560
It's my fault.

1288
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,160
I didn't take good care of you guys.

1289
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,360
If you don't believe me, I'll go back to my hometown.

1290
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:17,360
Chengdu City, Juniu District, Tuqiao Village, Guanghua Village,

1291
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:18,960
Erzu 401.

1292
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,360
It's a long way to go.

1293
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,360
660036.

1294
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:27,760
Come on, Jiang Qiong.

1295
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,360
I'll drive.

1296
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:33,160
Grandma, I can't hold on anymore.

1297
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:35,160
I can't hold on anymore.

1298
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:39,360
I'll pick you up when I have the time.

1299
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,560
You're driving too fast.

1300
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:43,560
I'll call you later.

1301
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,760
Grandma, you can pick me up.

1302
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,560
What are you thinking?

1303
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:51,160
Your wife is calling.

1304
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,960
What's going on with you guys?

1305
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:57,960
Have you stopped?

1306
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:58,760
I can't stop.

1307
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:00,560
Have you thought of anything?

1308
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,560
Wait a minute.

1309
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:06,960
The construction team here is thinking of something.

1310
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,960
When can you think of anything?

1311
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,960
Let me see.

1312
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,560
I'm sorry.

1313
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:22,360
Tie Rui Luo.

1314
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,360
Hi, sir.

1315
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,160
What does it mean?

1316
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,160
What does it mean to say sorry?

1317
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,560
Grandma.

1318
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,560
I have to kill you.

1319
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,560
Hello, everyone.

1320
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:05,560
I'm the Demon King.

1321
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,560
Today is my last live broadcast.

1322
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,560
If there's no accident,

1323
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,560
there will be an accident soon.

1324
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:16,560
I have a wish.

1325
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:19,560
Who can help me finish it?

1326
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:28,780
Who can give me a big

1327
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:31,780
help?

1328
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:35,780
Don't be here.

1329
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:41,780
It's okay.

1330
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:43,780
I'm here.

1331
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:45,780
It's okay.

1332
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:47,780
I'll think of something.

1333
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:49,780
Bullshit.

1334
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:53,780
There must be a way.

1335
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:57,780
Lin, I loved you.

1336
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:00,780
Lin, you've always been in my heart.

1337
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:02,780
Xiu Er.

1338
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:04,780
I can't pay you back.

1339
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:06,780
Shut up.

1340
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:11,780
Mr. Bi, you're dead.

1341
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:13,780
Demon, let's go to the news.

1342
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:15,780
The news is that the Demon King has been arrested.

1343
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:17,780
He has been arrested for the first time.

1344
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:19,780
He is now in the hospital.

1345
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:21,780
He is now in the hospital.

1346
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,780
He is now in the hospital.

1347
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:25,780
He is now in the hospital.

1348
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:27,780
Apa, why did they arrest them?

1349
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:29,780
Let me explain.

1350
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:31,780
What have they done to him?

1351
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:34,780
Right now, the authority did not

1352
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:36,780
allow these kinds of tie people

1353
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:38,780
to lead the situation.

1354
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:40,780
They cannot be arrested.

1355
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:42,780
They cannot be arrested.

1356
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:44,780
Wow.

1357
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:46,780
They can't be arrested either.

1358
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:48,780
They cannot be really fined.

1359
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:50,780
We'll get to the bottom of this.

1360
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:53,940
Chu Chu!

1361
01:02:55,780 --> 01:03:10,140
on the

1362
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:12,720
right

1363
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:13,720
I'm dead.

1364
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,600
How much power do you have left?

1365
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,440
This car has only been charging once in its life.

1366
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,560
It's always full of power while driving.

1367
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:31,880
In that case,

1368
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:34,160
I officially announce that

1369
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,680
you will be hit by a car

1370
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,520
in half an hour.

1371
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,720
30 minutes left.

1372
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,520
We will be hit by a car

1373
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:46,520
when Uncle Ling thinks of us.

1374
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:47,920
I have no other choice.

1375
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,520
Do you have any other way?

1376
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,120
Don't panic.

1377
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:58,520
It's a second.

1378
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:00,520
If you don't die, you will be scared to death.

1379
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:07,720
Brother Tian.

1380
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,520
I'm so dizzy.

1381
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,520
I'm so dizzy.

1382
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,120
God, I beg you.

1383
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,320
Please send Tian Bin and Tian Jiang to save us.

1384
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,120
Aunt Jun,

1385
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:19,520
you have to believe in science at this time.

1386
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:25,720
Einstein, Newton, Beethoven.

1387
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:27,720
Come and save my children.

1388
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:35,920
Dad, I have another way.

1389
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:36,920
Electricity is afraid of water.

1390
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,120
If the water is frozen, the electricity will be broken.

1391
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:40,920
We can pour water.

1392
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:42,120
Come on, Jiang.

1393
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:43,120
Give it to me.

1394
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:44,120
Wait for a while.

1395
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,120
Don't worry, brother-in-law.

1396
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:47,120
Leave it to me.

1397
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:59,120
Brother-in-law, there is no water.

1398
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:02,120
I have to bring a big bottle of water.

1399
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:04,120
Mom, where is the urine of the dishes?

1400
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,120
I gave it to Yuanyuan.

1401
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:07,120
Then, who did I give it to?

1402
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:08,120
You threw it away.

1403
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:13,120
I'm so dizzy.

1404
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:19,120
Brother-in-law, why are you looking at me?

1405
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:21,120
I can't remember anything.

1406
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,120
I have water.

1407
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:28,120
Mom.

1408
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,120
Mom, forget it.

1409
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:33,120
I just let her go.

1410
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:34,120
Forget it.

1411
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:34,720
Forget it.

1412
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,120
Come back and sit.

1413
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:38,120
Put on your seat belt.

1414
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:40,120
Li Tongfang.

1415
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:42,120
There is a water bottle on the police car.

1416
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:43,120
Water bottle.

1417
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,120
Water bottle.

1418
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:47,120
There is water.

1419
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,320
Brother-in-law, this hand sand is bright.

1420
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,320
Hand sand.

1421
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:55,320
Hand sand.

1422
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:57,320
Yes.

1423
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,320
We can pull the hand sand.

1424
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,320
But we are too fast now.

1425
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:08,320
If we pull the hand sand, it may cause a side effect.

1426
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:13,120
There is no other way.

1427
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,120
Put on your seat belt.

1428
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:16,120
Okay.

1429
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,120
Hold it.

1430
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:18,120
Protect the child.

1431
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:19,120
Come on.

1432
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:20,120
Mom, hold the sand.

1433
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:21,120
Hold it.

1434
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:24,120
We are going to pull the hand sand.

1435
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,120
There is a car behind us.

1436
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,120
Let's get away from it.

1437
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,120
Are you okay?

1438
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,120
I'm not okay.

1439
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:43,120
You pull the hand sand.

1440
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:45,120
Brother-in-law, I'm scared.

1441
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:46,120
Just do it.

1442
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:51,120
Let's go.

1443
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,120
Let's go.

1444
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:55,120
I'm pulling it.

1445
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,120
Pull it.

1446
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,120
Three.

1447
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:06,120
Two.

1448
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,120
One.

1449
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:12,120
Brother-in-law, it fell.

1450
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:14,120
It has nothing to do with me.

1451
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:15,120
It's just a quality problem.

1452
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,120
Why does it have nothing to do with you?

1453
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:19,120
Your brain...

1454
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:25,120
Did we hit something again?

1455
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:27,120
We hit something.

1456
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:33,120
You bastard, stop the car.

1457
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,120
I'm going to kill you today.

1458
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:37,120
Turn the car around and go back to my girlfriend.

1459
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,120
I can't go out.

1460
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,120
I can't get out.

1461
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,120
I can't get out of the car.

1462
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:41,120
You won't stop, right?

1463
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:42,120
Stop.

1464
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:43,120
Stop.

1465
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:44,120
You want to run away, right?

1466
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:45,120
Impossible.

1467
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:46,120
I...

1468
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:49,120
What did he say?

1469
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:50,120
I don't know.

1470
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:51,120
Do we know each other?

1471
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:52,120
No.

1472
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:54,120
Louder.

1473
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,120
What does it mean?

1474
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:02,120
What are you doing?

1475
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,120
This is a graduation bag.

1476
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,120
You are so rude.

1477
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,120
Stop.

1478
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:13,120
Don't hit me.

1479
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,120
Don't hit me.

1480
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:15,120
Don't hit me.

1481
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:16,120
Stop.

1482
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,120
Are you going to save us?

1483
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,120
Come back to me.

1484
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,120
I'm going to kill you today.

1485
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,120
I'm going to kill you.

1486
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,120
I'm going to kill you.

1487
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,120
Excuse me.

1488
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,120
Excuse me.

1489
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:13,120
Sorry.

1490
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:14,120
Sorry.

1491
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:23,120
Excuse me.

1492
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,120
Excuse me.

1493
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,120
Excuse me.

1494
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,120
Excuse me.

1495
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:32,120
I didn't know what he wanted.

1496
01:09:39,120 --> 01:10:02,960
So

1497
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:07,360
this

1498
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:08,180
ulin

1499
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:09,580
His car!

1500
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:10,500
Car!

1501
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:11,700
Car!

1502
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:13,660
Like this!

1503
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:15,060
Okay!

1504
01:10:15,740 --> 01:10:16,780
What did he say?

1505
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:17,580
I didn't hear a word.

1506
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:18,380
Got it!

1507
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:19,380
Hurry!

1508
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:22,300
How do you understand?

1509
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:24,140
Watch the road.

1510
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:25,580
Watch the road.

1511
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:27,100
Old Tang!

1512
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:39,180
Hurry!

1513
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:53,180
It's working!

1514
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:53,780
It's falling!

1515
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:54,380
It's falling!

1516
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:55,380
It's falling!

1517
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:56,660
Old Tang!

1518
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:57,980
Old Tang is here!

1519
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:10,580
They are flying in the air!

1520
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:17,020
It's going up!

1521
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:18,020
It's going up!

1522
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:22,660
Take the plane!

1523
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:23,980
Take the plane!

1524
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:32,100
Brother-in-law, are you okay?

1525
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:32,780
Your head hurts!

1526
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:39,980
Don't worry!

1527
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:46,980
Brother-in-law!

1528
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:48,100
I'm going to fly!

1529
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:49,100
I'm going to fly!

1530
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:57,580
What should we do, sister-in-law?

1531
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:58,580
What should we do?

1532
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:01,900
I have an idea!

1533
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:04,180
Let his car drive over!

1534
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:05,460
We'll take him on a flat road!

1535
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:06,780
We'll jump over!

1536
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:08,980
Okay!

1537
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:10,780
Move a little!

1538
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:13,660
Drive faster!

1539
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:14,660
Drive faster!

1540
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:15,660
Run!

1541
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:17,460
Open the door!

1542
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:18,180
Okay!

1543
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:21,260
Be careful!

1544
01:12:21,260 --> 01:12:22,260
Slow down!

1545
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:27,180
Slow down!

1546
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:27,980
This way!

1547
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:29,380
Brother-in-law, are you okay?

1548
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:30,380
Pull over there!

1549
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:31,180
Okay!

1550
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:32,180
This way!

1551
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:38,780
This way!

1552
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:39,780
This way!

1553
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:40,780
This way!

1554
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:41,780
This way!

1555
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:42,780
This way!

1556
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:43,780
Hurry!

1557
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:44,780
I'll shake the window!

1558
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:45,780
You go and pick him up!

1559
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:51,780
Brother-in-law, do you want to find someone else?

1560
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:53,780
Do it like a man!

1561
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:56,780
Come on!

1562
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:57,780
Be careful!

1563
01:12:57,780 --> 01:12:58,780
Be careful!

1564
01:12:58,780 --> 01:12:59,780
Be careful!

1565
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:08,780
Brother-in-law!

1566
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:09,780
Brother-in-law!

1567
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:11,780
No!

1568
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:12,780
Don't come any closer!

1569
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:14,780
Brother-in-law!

1570
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:16,780
You can do it!

1571
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:17,780
Come on, brother-in-law!

1572
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:18,780
Be brave!

1573
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:19,780
Son!

1574
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:20,780
Be brave!

1575
01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:21,780
Be brave, brother-in-law!

1576
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:22,780
Come on!

1577
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:23,780
We'll get you!

1578
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:24,780
Come on!

1579
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:25,780
Be brave!

1580
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:26,780
I can do it!

1581
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:27,780
I can do it!

1582
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:28,780
I can do it!

1583
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:29,780
Come on!

1584
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:34,780
I can do it!

1585
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:37,780
I can do it!

1586
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:44,780
Xiao Qiao!

1587
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:45,780
Xiao Qiao!

1588
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:46,780
Xiao Qiao!

1589
01:13:46,780 --> 01:13:47,780
What can we do?

1590
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:48,780
Hurry!

1591
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:49,780
Go to the bar first!

1592
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:50,780
Then we'll go one by one!

1593
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:51,780
Brother-in-law!

1594
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:52,780
Help me!

1595
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:53,780
Xiao Qiao!

1596
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:54,780
Help me!

1597
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:55,780
Brother-in-law!

1598
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:56,780
Brother-in-law!

1599
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:57,780
Brother-in-law!

1600
01:13:57,780 --> 01:13:58,780
Brother-in-law!

1601
01:13:58,780 --> 01:13:59,780
Brother-in-law!

1602
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:00,780
Brother-in-law!

1603
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:01,780
Brother-in-law!

1604
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:02,780
Hurry up!

1605
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:03,780
Brother-in-law!

1606
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:04,780
Don't waste time!

1607
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:05,780
Hurry up!

1608
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:06,780
Don't waste time!

1609
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:07,780
Stop right there!

1610
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:09,780
Brother-in-law!

1611
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:11,780
Brother-in-law!

1612
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:13,780
Let's go to the bar first!

1613
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:16,780
Hold me!

1614
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:17,780
Let go!

1615
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:18,780
Let go!

1616
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:29,780
Mom…

1617
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:30,780
It's okay.

1618
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:36,180
Even if you can't see it, it's always there.

1619
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:37,820
I'm not giving up on the kids.

1620
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:38,980
You two, come here.

1621
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:40,060
When is this?

1622
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:41,260
Don't come here until it's over.

1623
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:41,940
Stop it!

1624
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:42,380
Come here!

1625
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:43,820
The kids won't listen to me.

1626
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:44,860
You two are a bit...

1627
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:46,500
How can I live?

1628
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:47,820
Mom, I'll be fine.

1629
01:14:47,820 --> 01:14:48,500
You go first.

1630
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:49,460
Yan Yan!

1631
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:52,140
Yan Yan is pregnant with my baby granddaughter!

1632
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:54,020
You go first.

1633
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:55,860
We have to come one by one, right, Mom?

1634
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:56,820
You go first.

1635
01:14:56,820 --> 01:14:58,340
You go first.

1636
01:14:58,340 --> 01:14:59,180
I'll be here soon, Mom.

1637
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:00,260
Don't worry.

1638
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:02,220
Mom, look at me!

1639
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:02,980
Come on!

1640
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:04,980
Come on!

1641
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:05,860
Slowly, slowly!

1642
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:06,820
Come on!

1643
01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:07,660
Come on!

1644
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:09,300
Come on!

1645
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:10,740
Mom, hold me!

1646
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:12,420
Grandma, be careful!

1647
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:13,580
Slowly, be careful!

1648
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:14,460
Hold me!

1649
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:15,420
Hold me!

1650
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:16,060
Slowly, hold me!

1651
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:16,540
Slowly!

1652
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:17,220
Slowly!

1653
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:17,900
Come on!

1654
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:22,620
Come here!

1655
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:23,500
Hurry up!

1656
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:25,220
Slowly, slowly!

1657
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:26,140
Come on!

1658
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:26,900
Come on!

1659
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:27,900
Come on!

1660
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:28,980
I got it!

1661
01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:29,540
Be careful!

1662
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:30,500
I got it!

1663
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:31,700
Slowly, slowly!

1664
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:32,620
No, no!

1665
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:33,300
Slowly!

1666
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:34,220
Slowly, slowly!

1667
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:35,620
Yan Yan!

1668
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:36,580
Come here, Sister!

1669
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:37,900
Mom, come here!

1670
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:38,700
Come here!

1671
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:39,500
Mom!

1672
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:40,100
Mom!

1673
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:40,700
Yan Yan!

1674
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:41,340
What are you doing?

1675
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:42,380
Come here!

1676
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:43,100
Come here, Sister!

1677
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:44,180
Come here!

1678
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:45,220
Come here!

1679
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:45,620
What are you doing?

1680
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:46,540
Why are you back?

1681
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:47,220
Go away!

1682
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:47,740
Yan Yan!

1683
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:49,700
Come here, Yan Yan!

1684
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:50,460
Stop it!

1685
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:51,260
We have ten minutes!

1686
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:51,820
We're running out of time!

1687
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:52,460
Go away!

1688
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:53,060
Yan Yan!

1689
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:53,900
You have to go!

1690
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:55,740
Hurry up, Dad!

1691
01:15:55,740 --> 01:15:56,900
Come here, Yan Yan!

1692
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:58,700
We have no time, Sister!

1693
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:01,500
Mom, hurry up!

1694
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:04,420
Yan Yan, come here!

1695
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:05,340
Yan Yan!

1696
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:05,980
Hurry up!

1697
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:06,780
Dad!

1698
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:08,020
Dad!

1699
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:09,580
Yan Yan!

1700
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:15,780
I swear,

1701
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:18,380
there's no one outside.

1702
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:20,460
I'm just too busy with work.

1703
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:27,220
I've been having a bad business these two years.

1704
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:29,820
I'm afraid you're worried that I won't tell you.

1705
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:33,100
I saw you helping me pay the mortgage.

1706
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:34,740
You went out to run your clients every day.

1707
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:36,420
I felt bad.

1708
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:38,620
I thought I'd make more money

1709
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:40,620
and pay off the mortgage.

1710
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:43,580
But I didn't.

1711
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:50,380
All the family matters these years,

1712
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:56,100
you've been taking care of the elderly and children.

1713
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:00,220
I'm not a good husband.

1714
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:09,820
You're making me feel bad.

1715
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:10,820
I'm so happy.

1716
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:17,620
Honey,

1717
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:21,020
I'm sorry, too.

1718
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:25,620
I didn't suspect you.

1719
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:29,220
The main thing is,

1720
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:30,620
since I gave birth to Xiao Cai,

1721
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:32,220
my body has been weak.

1722
01:17:32,220 --> 01:17:33,820
My skin is not good.

1723
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:36,220
I'm getting worse.

1724
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:37,620
Actually,

1725
01:17:39,220 --> 01:17:42,620
I'm afraid you won't love me.

1726
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:46,420
When we were in love,

1727
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:48,220
you were just a normal woman.

1728
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:53,620
But,

1729
01:17:57,620 --> 01:17:59,620
don't think I love you.

1730
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:09,420
There are a few minutes left.

1731
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:11,420
I have to confess one last thing.

1732
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:13,420
It was the day we got married.

1733
01:18:13,420 --> 01:18:15,020
When I first fell in love,

1734
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:18,020
you dragged me into the bathroom.

1735
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:19,620
You just...

1736
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:22,620
I want to go home!

1737
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:24,820
I want to go home!

1738
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:26,420
I want to go home!

1739
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:27,820
We're saved!

1740
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:28,820
The helicopter is saved!

1741
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:29,620
We're saved!

1742
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:30,420
Get on the helicopter!

1743
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:31,620
I'll be right up!

1744
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:34,620
What's wrong with dragging you into the bathroom?

1745
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:35,820
Hurry up!

1746
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:37,020
The old man just now...

1747
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:38,220
Hurry up!

1748
01:18:38,220 --> 01:18:39,420
We'll talk when we get back!

1749
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:40,820
We're running out of time!

1750
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:43,020
Be careful!

1751
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:44,420
Slowly!

1752
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:45,420
Be careful!

1753
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:46,820
Be careful!

1754
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:48,020
Stop!

1755
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:51,620
Be careful!

1756
01:18:57,420 --> 01:18:58,820
This way!

1757
01:18:58,820 --> 01:18:59,820
Mom!

1758
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:01,620
Slowly!

1759
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:05,420
You can let it go!

1760
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:07,020
No!

1761
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:08,220
I can't let go!

1762
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:09,420
The helicopter is going to explode!

1763
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:11,220
I'll turn over if I let go!

1764
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:15,020
Hurry up!

1765
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:16,220
Move!

1766
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:19,620
Dad!

1767
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:21,020
Let it go!

1768
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:22,820
Hurry up!

1769
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:24,420
We're not done yet!

1770
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:28,420
You two, hurry up!

1771
01:19:57,420 --> 01:20:01,420
Honey, take care of my family and kids.

1772
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:03,420
I love you.

1773
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:10,820
Li Tong Feng!

1774
01:20:10,820 --> 01:20:12,820
Today is our wedding anniversary!

1775
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:14,020
I've been waiting for you for a day!

1776
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:16,620
You've been avoiding me for a day!

1777
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:18,820
You're playing with me, aren't you?

1778
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:20,020
Fine!

1779
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:21,620
Don't come back tonight.

1780
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:23,020
Even if you do, I won't open the door for you!

1781
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:24,820
I'll beat you to death!

1782
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:28,220
Why did Li Tong Feng hang up on me?

1783
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:29,620
You're such a big client!

1784
01:20:29,620 --> 01:20:32,020
It's so inconvenient!

1785
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:34,620
If you dare tell me you're a thief, I'll kill you!

1786
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:36,420
I'll kill you!

1787
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:37,620
Kill you!

1788
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:39,420
Li Tong Feng!

1789
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:40,420
You go.

1790
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:43,020
Call me when you're free.

1791
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:44,420
If you don't answer my calls,

1792
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:45,620
just you wait.

1793
01:20:45,620 --> 01:20:48,820
Li Tong Feng, I'll let you have a good time.

1794
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:51,220
Honey, the second child is done today.

1795
01:20:51,220 --> 01:20:52,420
It's quite normal.

1796
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:53,620
Don't worry.

1797
01:20:53,620 --> 01:20:56,020
I'll be nervous if you want to get married.

1798
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:58,020
You have to be with me this time.

1799
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:00,420
Honey,

1800
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:03,220
the third child is doing well in English.

1801
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:06,020
Why don't we give him a class?

1802
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:08,820
Honey,

1803
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:11,220
it's been over half a month.

1804
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:15,020
I've been in a bad mood these days.

1805
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:16,620
When will you come back?

1806
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:18,020
Honey,

1807
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:19,020
I had a fight with Jiang Jiang today.

1808
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:19,820
Honey,

1809
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:21,620
I'll see you on Wednesday.

1810
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:23,020
You have to go no matter how busy you are.

1811
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:25,220
Why do you have to come to school with me?

1812
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:27,220
Why don't you go to school with me?

1813
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:28,820
Why do you have to come here?

1814
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:30,520
Honey,

1815
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:32,620
I'm going to get married today.

1816
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:34,220
It's been over half a month.

1817
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:35,220
What should I buy for him?

1818
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:38,220
I'll buy him some flowers.

1819
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:40,220
I'm going to buy him a bunch of flowers today.

1820
01:21:40,220 --> 01:21:42,220
I'll buy him a bunch of flowers today.

1821
01:21:42,220 --> 01:21:43,620
Are you going to go or not?

1822
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:45,620
You're going to go, right?

1823
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:47,020
I'll go, right?

1824
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:49,020
Why don't you go to school with me?

1825
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:50,420
It's been over half a month.

1826
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:51,540
Now eat your food.

1827
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:54,920
What did you just hear?

1828
01:21:55,420 --> 01:21:56,860
It's the end of the year.

1829
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:00,860
Let's finish work.

1830
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:02,420
You have work ahead of you.

1831
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:05,940
Create your own.

1832
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:13,560
Hey,

1833
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:16,780
I...

1834
01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:18,820
Stop it.

1835
01:22:18,820 --> 01:22:25,820
I'm Li Tong Feng, 35 years old.

1836
01:22:25,820 --> 01:22:32,820
The last thing I regret in my life is not being with my family.

1837
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:39,820
My wife, daughter, mom, mother-in-law, uncle.

1838
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:43,820
And I haven't been to work for a month.

1839
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:48,820
I still want to tell my family.

1840
01:22:48,820 --> 01:22:50,820
Dad!

1841
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:51,820
Dad!

1842
01:22:51,820 --> 01:22:52,820
It's okay!

1843
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:53,820
Dad!

1844
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:55,820
Tong Feng!

1845
01:22:58,820 --> 01:22:59,820
I'm saved!

1846
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:01,820
I'm not dead!

1847
01:23:04,820 --> 01:23:06,820
Thank you!

1848
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:07,820
Oh my god!

1849
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:12,820
Brother!

1850
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:13,820
Tong Feng!

1851
01:23:13,820 --> 01:23:14,820
Oh my god!

1852
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:16,820
Tong Feng!

1853
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:18,820
I can't die!

1854
01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:33,820
Oh my god!

1855
01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:38,820
Brother!

1856
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:39,820
Brother!

1857
01:23:40,820 --> 01:23:41,820
Tong Feng!

1858
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:53,820
Tong Feng!

1859
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:54,820
Tong Feng!

1860
01:23:54,820 --> 01:23:56,820
You're a bastard! I'll get you!

1861
01:23:56,820 --> 01:23:57,820
Tong Feng!

1862
01:23:57,820 --> 01:23:58,820
Tong Feng!

1863
01:23:58,820 --> 01:23:59,820
Look!

1864
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:00,820
Brother-in-law!

1865
01:24:00,820 --> 01:24:02,820
I saw your last act!

1866
01:24:07,820 --> 01:24:08,820
Don't move!

1867
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:13,820
Don't move!

1868
01:24:13,820 --> 01:24:15,820
Please don't hurt me.

1869
01:24:15,820 --> 01:24:17,820
Step aside, step aside.

1870
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:18,820
I'll let you go!

1871
01:24:19,820 --> 01:24:21,820
Let me go!

1872
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:22,820
Brother-in-law!

1873
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:27,820
I'm not married yet!

1874
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:28,820
What is the difference?

1875
01:24:28,820 --> 01:24:29,820
Li Ke!

1876
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:30,820
You go away!

1877
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:31,820
Li Ke!

1878
01:24:31,820 --> 01:24:32,820
Go away!

1879
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:33,820
Li Ke!

1880
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:34,820
He's over there!

1881
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:35,820
Li Ke!

1882
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:36,820
No!

1883
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:38,820
Hurry up and save the boat!

1884
01:24:40,820 --> 01:24:42,820
The boat is stopped again!

1885
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:45,820
Move! Move!

1886
01:24:45,820 --> 01:24:47,820
Go! Go!

1887
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:54,820
You know what's the most important thing in life?

1888
01:24:55,820 --> 01:24:57,820
You can't live without your family.

1889
01:24:57,820 --> 01:24:59,820
You can't live without your friends.

1890
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:02,820
You can't live without your friends.

1891
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:04,820
You can't live without your friends.

1892
01:25:05,820 --> 01:25:08,820
You can't live without your friends.

1893
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:11,820
You can't live without your friends.

1894
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:14,820
You can't live without your friends.

1895
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:18,820
Baby, say, very good car.

1896
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:21,820
The baby is fine.

1897
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:22,820
The baby is fine.

1898
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:23,820
Yes, yes, yes.

1899
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:25,820
It's good that he's fine.

1900
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:27,820
Mom, I'm sorry.

1901
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:29,820
The bracelet is gone.

1902
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:30,820
It's okay.

1903
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:32,820
I'll give you this.

1904
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:34,820
You've been wearing it for so many years.

1905
01:25:34,820 --> 01:25:36,820
It's expensive. You don't understand.

1906
01:25:42,820 --> 01:25:44,820
I'll buy you something more expensive later.

1907
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:47,820
Uncle.

1908
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:50,820
You lost your head.

1909
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:51,820
Aren't you sad?

1910
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:52,820
I'm not sad.

1911
01:25:52,820 --> 01:25:54,820
I thought I was going to die.

1912
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:56,820
I was going to be on the news.

1913
01:25:57,820 --> 01:25:58,820
Dad, I'm so happy to see you.

1914
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:02,820
Shanshan, our board president wants to meet you.

1915
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:04,820
Hello.

1916
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:06,820
Hello.

1917
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:07,820
Hello, Mr. Car King.

1918
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:10,820
We hope you can tell the world that...

1919
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:14,820
this accident was caused by your personal misconduct.

1920
01:26:14,820 --> 01:26:15,820
That's a lie.

1921
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:18,820
Besides, your car is indeed flawed.

1922
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:21,820
But don't worry.

1923
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:25,820
The problem can be solved in the future.

1924
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:30,820
After all, Shanyi's privacy is good for everyone.

1925
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:34,820
Even so, she's also a secret.

1926
01:26:34,820 --> 01:26:36,820
And she has to pay for it.

1927
01:26:38,820 --> 01:26:41,820
Besides, I have a bottom line.

1928
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:43,820
I want to eat it tonight.

1929
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:44,820
My baby.

1930
01:26:44,820 --> 01:26:45,820
Hot pot.

1931
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:47,820
Hot pot? I'll find you hot pot.

1932
01:26:47,820 --> 01:26:48,820
How do you say hot pot in English?

1933
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:49,820
Hot pot.

1934
01:26:49,820 --> 01:26:50,820
This...

1935
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:51,820
You can't even speak Chinese.

1936
01:26:51,820 --> 01:26:53,820
How do you say Chinese in Chinese?

1937
01:26:55,820 --> 01:26:57,820
Boss, I'm coming.

1938
01:27:00,820 --> 01:27:01,820
Boss.

1939
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:06,820
Boss, I forgot my house.

1940
01:27:07,820 --> 01:27:09,820
My house? I don't want to take it.

1941
01:27:09,820 --> 01:27:10,820
You can go home now.

1942
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:11,820
Thank you, buddy.

1943
01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:15,820
Honey, you really don't need to pay?

1944
01:27:15,820 --> 01:27:16,820
No.

1945
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:20,820
Actually, I don't mind the house.

1946
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:22,820
No, it's okay.

1947
01:27:23,820 --> 01:27:26,820
Brother-in-law, you've been driving the car for a long time.

1948
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:28,820
Is your company going bankrupt?

1949
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:29,820
You're so...

1950
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:33,820
I'm not afraid.

1951
01:27:33,820 --> 01:27:34,820
I'll give you the money.

1952
01:27:34,820 --> 01:27:36,820
I still have 75,000 yuan.

1953
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:38,820
Don't worry, son.

1954
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:39,820
I'll discuss with your father.

1955
01:27:39,820 --> 01:27:41,820
I'll take him to the supermarket in the northeast.

1956
01:27:41,820 --> 01:27:43,820
I'll give you the money.

1957
01:27:43,820 --> 01:27:45,820
You can't give up your company.

1958
01:27:46,820 --> 01:27:47,820
That's right, brother-in-law.

1959
01:27:47,820 --> 01:27:49,820
I still have two boxes of beef.

1960
01:27:49,820 --> 01:27:51,820
I'll give you all the money when it's ready.

1961
01:27:51,820 --> 01:27:53,820
Dad, I still have 800 yuan in my bank account.

1962
01:27:53,820 --> 01:27:55,820
I'll give you all.

1963
01:27:56,820 --> 01:27:57,820
No need.

1964
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:01,820
It's normal to be a business man.

1965
01:28:01,820 --> 01:28:03,820
You can just start over.

1966
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:11,820
Honey, I have to confess something to you.

1967
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:15,820
Some time ago, I was trying to make a profit.

1968
01:28:15,820 --> 01:28:19,820
I got your second-hand car in the flood.

1969
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:23,820
I don't think I can make it this time.

1970
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:25,820
You bought every car?

1971
01:28:28,820 --> 01:28:30,820
My silly daughter-in-law.

1972
01:28:33,820 --> 01:28:35,820
I can't make it.

1973
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:39,820
Okay.

1974
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:43,820
Then let's hug each other.

1975
01:28:43,820 --> 01:28:45,820
What's so embarrassing?

1976
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:46,820
We're a family.

1977
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:49,820
That's great.

1978
01:28:54,820 --> 01:28:56,820
Why is the elevator so dark?

1979
01:28:56,820 --> 01:28:57,820
Don't panic.

1980
01:28:57,820 --> 01:28:59,820
If you encounter problems, solve them.

1981
01:28:59,820 --> 01:29:00,820
Help! Help!

1982
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:01,820
Don't say that.

1983
01:29:01,820 --> 01:29:03,820
The owner said that you can turn on and off the key at the same time.

1984
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:04,820
You can restart the car in five seconds.

1985
01:29:04,820 --> 01:29:06,820
Jiang Qiao, you can't be blind.

1986
01:29:06,820 --> 01:29:08,820
Can you stop the elevator?

1987
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:11,820
It's not going to stop.

1988
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:27,820
I can't follow the logic of my lover.

1989
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:30,820
I don't understand the power of a fairy tale.

1990
01:29:30,820 --> 01:29:33,820
The old man let go of the old man.

1991
01:29:33,820 --> 01:29:35,820
Boss, I'm here.

1992
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:38,820
Hello.

1993
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:40,820
Hello.

1994
01:29:40,820 --> 01:29:41,820
I'm here.

1995
01:29:41,820 --> 01:29:43,820
I'm here to deliver the food.

1996
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:45,820
I have a special treat for you tonight.

1997
01:29:45,820 --> 01:29:46,820
My darling.

1998
01:29:46,820 --> 01:29:47,820
Hot pot.

1999
01:29:47,820 --> 01:29:48,820
Hot pot.

2000
01:29:48,820 --> 01:29:49,820
I'll get you hot pot.

2001
01:29:49,820 --> 01:29:50,820
Hot pot.

2002
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:51,820
How's the food?

2003
01:29:51,820 --> 01:29:52,820
Great.

2004
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:53,820
I'll get you beef.

2005
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:54,820
Beef?

2006
01:29:54,820 --> 01:29:56,820
How do you say that in Chinese?

2007
01:29:56,820 --> 01:29:57,820
How do you say that in Chinese?

2008
01:29:57,820 --> 01:29:59,820
I'll teach you.

2009
01:30:01,820 --> 01:30:02,820
Thank you.

2010
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:03,820
You're welcome.

2011
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:04,820
You're welcome.

2012
01:30:04,820 --> 01:30:05,820
Have fun.

2013
01:30:05,820 --> 01:30:06,820
Don't be shy.

2014
01:30:06,820 --> 01:30:07,820
At this critical moment,

2015
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:09,820
I'll get out of here.

2016
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:11,820
I'll pay you 500 yuan.

2017
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:12,820
Look at him.

2018
01:30:12,820 --> 01:30:13,820
Look at him.

2019
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:19,820
I'll put it here.

2020
01:30:22,820 --> 01:30:24,820
Be careful.

2021
01:30:33,820 --> 01:30:35,820
My boss called me.

2022
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:37,820
You can go to your place.

2023
01:30:37,820 --> 01:30:39,820
Boss, you finally called me.

2024
01:30:39,820 --> 01:30:40,820
I'll be there soon.

2025
01:30:40,820 --> 01:30:42,820
I don't want to live in that house.

2026
01:30:42,820 --> 01:30:43,820
You can go home.

2027
01:30:43,820 --> 01:30:44,820
Thank you.

2028
01:30:46,820 --> 01:30:48,820
He's playing with me.

2029
01:30:48,820 --> 01:30:49,820
I...

2030
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:54,820
I'll be back soon.

2031
01:31:22,820 --> 01:31:25,820
Don't take risks alone.

2032
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:29,820
Don't be afraid of difficulties.

2033
01:31:29,820 --> 01:31:31,820
Your family will be with you.

2034
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:35,820
Even if you're not good at it,

2035
01:31:35,820 --> 01:31:37,820
you can still do it.

2036
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:41,820
When you need it,

2037
01:31:41,820 --> 01:31:42,820
Let's go!

2038
01:31:45,820 --> 01:31:48,820
Life is all about risks.

2039
01:31:48,820 --> 01:31:50,820
Don't take risks alone.

2040
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:54,820
Don't be afraid of difficulties.

2041
01:31:54,820 --> 01:31:56,820
Your family will be with you.

2042
01:31:57,820 --> 01:32:00,820
Even if you're not good at it,

2043
01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:02,820
you can still do it.

2044
01:32:03,820 --> 01:32:06,820
When you need it,

2045
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:08,820
Let's go!

2046
01:32:08,820 --> 01:32:11,820
The only harbor.

2047
01:32:11,820 --> 01:32:13,820
What's your father's name?

2048
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:14,820
Dad!

2049
01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:16,820
What's your father's name?

2050
01:32:16,820 --> 01:32:18,820
Dad!

2051
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:20,820
Mom is called Grandma.

2052
01:32:20,820 --> 01:32:22,820
Dad's mom is called Grandma.

2053
01:32:22,820 --> 01:32:24,820
Dad's mom is called Grandma.

2054
01:32:48,820 --> 01:32:50,820
I'll be myself.

2055
01:32:50,820 --> 01:32:52,820
I'll be myself.

2056
01:32:52,820 --> 01:32:54,820
I'll be myself.

2057
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:56,820
