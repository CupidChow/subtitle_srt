1
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,200
Biel.

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,400
Biel, wake up.

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,000
Biel.

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,080
Biel, come on.

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,520
Biel.

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,960
Biel, come on. Wake up.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,880
Why aren't you in the OR?
They're going to operate on her now.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,880
-What?
-Biel, come on.

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,680
-Like now?
-Now.

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,720
-They're doing it now?
-Yes.

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,320
There won't be enough time. Damn it!

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,240
ENOUGH! STRIKE NOW

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,280
MURDERERS

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,800
SURGICAL AREA

15
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,600
-Sorry.
-Where were you?

16
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,520
-Sorry. I didn't think…
-Can we focus?

17
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,120
Scalpel.

18
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,000
They look great, guys.

19
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,440
-Hang them in the halls when you're done.
-Okay.

20
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,320
-These are the flyers to hand out outside.
-Let's go.

21
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,000
I feel more tumor mass.
It's worse than it looks on the CT.

22
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,320
Damn it.

23
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,720
It's 11:51 p.m.

24
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,400
Tell your resident
to stop announcing the time.

25
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,320
We all know how to look at a clock.

26
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,080
We'll need her under
for another two hours.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,280
No, we stop here.

28
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,000
-We close and think about this.
-What's there to think about?

29
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,760
You, tell your boss
what we do in these cases.

30
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,880
-Well…
-Leave him out of it.

31
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,880
-This is between us.
-Between us?

32
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,040
We're here to save
your patient's life, aren't we?

33
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,200
This isn't about our war.

34
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,920
Don't give me that.
Who decided to operate this late?

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,400
You're the one
who decided to operate urgently.

36
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,240
How do we proceed?

37
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,280
Well, under normal circumstances,
we'd remove the cancerous tissue.

38
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,760
Normal circumstances?
Are these not normal circumstances?

39
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,400
Public healthcare!

40
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,360
We're at Joaquín Sorolla public hospital
in Valencia, where at midnight,

41
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,040
an unprecedented
healthcare strike will begin.

42
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,480
Are you aware of what this means?

43
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,360
Saving lives sometimes
requires drastic decisions.

44
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,160
That's the aim of the strike.

45
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,880
Go over there.

46
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,640
Emergency services are losing patience!

47
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,360
INDEFINITE STRIKE

48
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,360
STRIKE

49
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,160
Midnight, folks.

50
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,320
The strike begins.

51
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,240
-Let's close and go.
-No one's going anywhere.

52
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,800
We finish the surgery.

53
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,560
What do we do?

54
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,240
Return to your positions.

55
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,560
Pilar, we've been operating too long.

56
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,000
She can't handle more stress.

57
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,120
Oh, you want to stop operating
to prevent more stress?

58
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,280
Not because of your fanatical devotion
to this absurd strike?

59
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,840
I'm staying. Who's with me?

60
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,320
New kid, you took an oath
your boss has forgotten,

61
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,600
but it's fresh in your mind:
"Save the patient's life above all else."

62
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,680
That's what we do here, save lives.
We leave politics out of it.

63
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,040
Are you in or out?

64
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,560
BREATHLESS

65
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,480
TWO MONTHS EARLIER

66
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,160
Let's have a drink soon, okay?

67
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,680
All right. Bye.

68
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,720
I'll take it to the cold store.

69
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,120
Ramiro! Good morning.

70
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,920
-Is the sole fresh?
-Listen, it's still breathing!

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,680
-Where's Rosa? I don't believe you.
-Rosa!

72
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,400
The doctor doesn't believe
the fish is fresh.

73
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,680
Good morning, Dr. Moa.

74
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,360
-I'm Biel, your resident.
-Of course. How are you?

75
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,720
Call me Néstor.
And stay here, I need your help.

76
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,680
Okay.

77
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,920
Hello, Doctor.

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,520
-How are you?
-Very well.

79
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,080
-How can I help?
-What have you got for me?

80
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,720
Did you get him to come?

81
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,280
Don't blame him, he did it out of love.

82
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,040
-Can I take a look at the lump?
-It's nothing, really.

83
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,960
Let's see.

84
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,320
-Do you feel tired?
-No more than usual.

85
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,840
With the hours we work,
what do you expect?

86
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,240
Come to the hospital when you can.
My resident will sneak you in, right?

87
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,840
Thank you very much.

88
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,920
Let's get a head start.
Know how to insert a needle?

89
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,800
Yes, I spent a summer
in Sudan taking blood samples.

90
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,760
Perfect.

91
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,760
So go in there, roll up your sleeve…

92
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,920
You've hit the jackpot,
a handsome guy to take your blood.

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,440
Yes, he's very handsome.

94
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,080
Hey, do you like sea bass?

95
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,040
JOAQUÍN SOROLLA HOSPITAL

96
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,920
Guys, I still have
a while left at the hospital.

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,880
I've been stuck here 22 hours.
I'll tell you about my shift later.

98
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,440
Love you all.
Here's to healthcare workers!

99
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,800
Get caught with those bubbles,
you're in trouble.

100
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,480
What? It's my trademark now.
People always ask for it.

101
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,880
Besides, I think we need to bring
a little joy to the hospital, right?

102
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,080
What are you doing?

103
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,720
I can't tell if you admire him
or he just turns you on.

104
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,120
Who, Moa? Of course he turns him on.

105
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,400
-Go to your locker room.
-Got any paper? We're all out.

106
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,760
Let's see.

107
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,720
Look at him.
With his little public healthcare badge.

108
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,920
-Yeah, you got a problem with it?
-Me?

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,600
If only they were all like him.

110
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,400
Don't defend him,
he doesn't even know your name.

111
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,080
-Let's go.
-Traffic accident.

112
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,640
-Coming through.
-Sorry.

113
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,960
Four injured in a car crash.
One of them is pregnant.

114
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,840
-She's in bay 11.
-On my way.

115
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,440
Biel, ask for 18's report and wait for me.

116
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,760
Rodri, follow me.

117
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,800
We've been sat here over two hours.
There aren't even that many people.

118
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,760
Blanca, where are the attendings?

119
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,280
Come on.

120
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,440
We've got through worse.

121
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,760
No, don't look at me.

122
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,040
-The organs look fine.
-Yeah?

123
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,880
The heartbeat… The heartbeats are strong.

124
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,240
Are you sure?

125
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,280
-Three perfectly healthy babies.
-You almost beat me to it, Doctor.

126
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,640
Yes, she's going to have to
give up work, her residency…

127
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,720
What a great idea,
getting pregnant right now.

128
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,960
Did you hear something?

129
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,160
Because I didn't.

130
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,240
The patient is badly bruised.

131
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,840
The seat belt stopped the blow,
but she may have fractured a rib.

132
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,000
We gave her lorazepam to calm her down.

133
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,120
-Hello.
-Hi.

134
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
Good morning.

135
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,440
-Could you take off your glasses?
-What?

136
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,680
Your glasses, if you please.

137
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,560
She doesn't want to take them off
so she's not recognized. It's…

138
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,640
I can hear you.

139
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,240
Patricia Segura.

140
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,960
-I can hear everything, I'm right here.
-Patricia?

141
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,640
It's Biel. Biel de Felipe.

142
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,760
Oh my God, Biel! What are you doing here?

143
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,480
-I finished med school and--
-Ended up in a public hospital.

144
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,200
Sorry.

145
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,480
Almost as baffling as me being here.

146
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,160
Because I, well…
It was the nearest hospital.

147
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,800
I wanted a private one,
but I ended up here.

148
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,120
I tried to convince
the ambulance crew and…

149
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,320
You look handsome.

150
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,200
Well, you always have been.

151
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,120
You've always been handsome.

152
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,040
Very handsome.

153
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,960
-Just a little more now.
-Thank you.

154
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,120
Will you leave us?

155
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,960
Sorry.

156
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,640
-Can I examine you?
-Yes, of course.

157
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,040
Examine me.

158
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,000
Let's see.

159
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,480
Does this hurt?

160
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,560
What happened?

161
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,920
Well, I'm not sure.
It was a very long night.

162
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,640
A car crossed over… I think.

163
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,280
I'm still processing it. How's your dad?

164
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,600
He's good.

165
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,280
He was the best boss I ever had, you know?

166
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,640
The best boss in the world.

167
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,800
-Mind if I pull this down a little?
-What?

168
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,080
Pull it down.

169
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,920
No need for that.

170
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,080
Touch me, sweetheart, you're a doctor.

171
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,320
I'm sorry.

172
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,680
Don't worry, it's okay.

173
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,400
-Forgive me, that nurse…
-I understand.

174
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,200
She gave me… I don't know, a pill.

175
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,440
God knows what she gave me.

176
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,880
Patricia, do you examine yourself?

177
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,680
-Excuse me?
-No…

178
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,800
You have a lump here.

179
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,880
And another here.

180
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,120
Okay, I'm going to find Dr. Moa.

181
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,280
Who?

182
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,040
He's the hospital's best oncologist.

183
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,600
No, wait a minute. An oncologist? Why?

184
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,040
Just a moment, please.

185
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,120
Don't worry, honey, it's okay.
Don't fall asleep.

186
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,720
-Excuse me, can you see her?
-Sorry.

187
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,680
-Can you see my daughter?
-She'll be seen further down.

188
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,760
It's okay, honey.

189
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,720
It's okay, my love.

190
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,800
So guys, wash your hands
to be clean and healthy.

191
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,160
Cough into your elbow, not the air.

192
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,600
-Use a mask--
-Sorry, can you see my daughter?

193
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,440
-She can't breathe.
-Sure.

194
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,440
Did they tell you at reception…?

195
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,920
No, we've been waiting hours to be seen.

196
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,760
-She isn't breathing, got it?
-Calm down.

197
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,600
People are waiting
and you're here making videos!

198
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,880
-My shift is over.
-She can't breathe!

199
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,000
-Calm down, I--
-Please, help me!

200
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,760
Excuse me. He's my resident.

201
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,680
I told him to make the video
for a girl with cancer.

202
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,520
-Right, Doctor?
-Yes.

203
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,760
-Doctor, you're needed in bay ten.
-Yes, I'm coming.

204
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,760
Please see her.
It will only take a moment.

205
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,960
Wait a second.

206
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,920
-I'm begging you, please see her.
-Just a second.

207
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,040
-See the patient.
-Me? I'm not a pediatrician.

208
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,800
If she waits for the pediatrician,
you'll get a complaint for sure.

209
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,360
See her. We'll talk about the video later.

210
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,120
And call Mom and Dad, please.

211
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,400
You're ignoring them
and I can't keep sticking up for you.

212
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,520
-Bay ten?
-Yes.

213
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,080
Where are you taking those towels?
Tell me they're for disposal, not laundry.

214
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,320
We'll end up asking patients
to bring them from home.

215
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,240
-How long has she had trouble breathing?
-A week.

216
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,520
I've been giving her Ventolin,
but she hasn't improved.

217
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,720
Any changes at school?
Is she worried about--?

218
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,440
-What?
-I don't know, maybe--

219
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,560
If someone else tells me
my 8-year-old has anxiety

220
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,600
or it's all in her head,
I won't answer for it, Doctor.

221
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,400
Okay. Well, we've ruled out
asthma and allergies.

222
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,040
-Has she been eating well?
-Not really.

223
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,920
And has she had
trouble eating before this?

224
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,000
What do you mean?

225
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,320
She has signs of malnutrition,

226
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,760
which could be affecting
her immune system.

227
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,600
So, I'm mistreating my child?

228
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,120
-What?
-Is that it?

229
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,080
I don't feed her?
It's my fault? I'm a bad mom?

230
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,960
My daughter has chest pain.
She can't breathe.

231
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,280
And to diagnose her,
I need to know all the facts.

232
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,360
Does she eat everything? Dairy?

233
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,200
Vegetables? Protein?

234
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,880
Shame on you.
Is insulting me all you can think of?

235
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,920
No, I swear it's not that.
I suggest you keep giving her Ventolin.

236
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,960
Well, thanks for nothing, Doctor.

237
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,600
-Let's see--
-Thanks a lot.

238
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,600
Stuck here all day
with a kid who can't breathe.

239
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,240
-You can take…
-No, thanks.

240
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,600
We'll find someone who takes us seriously.

241
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,400
Very low vitals, he's barely responsive.

242
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,640
Does the hospital know we're coming?

243
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,480
Damn it, what did you take?

244
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,400
Hurry, we're losing him!

245
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,680
Let's go!

246
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,480
Marta, get the reports
as soon as we're inside.

247
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,400
I'll get them.

248
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,000
Let's go. Look out!

249
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,120
Shit. Help me, damn it!

250
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,160
Let's go!

251
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,400
-What happened to him?
-BP 70/40. GCS 7.

252
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,200
-He was taking drugs with him.
-No.

253
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,120
Take him to Resus.
What did you take? Heroin?

254
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,880
-GHB.
-Another one…

255
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,520
It's going to kill you all.

256
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,200
You don't realize
how dangerous that drug is.

257
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,800
Hey, you look familiar. Do you work here?

258
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,040
Are you having a stroke
or don't you want to tell me?

259
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,440
Quique?

260
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,120
You're not on call tonight. Are you okay?

261
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,640
All right, I'm an intern, okay?
I work here. But I'd better go.

262
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,840
No way. You stay and help.
I'll go get the scanner.

263
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,560
What's up with your pupils?
What did you take, bitch?

264
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,800
When will we be seen?

265
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,520
Quique, he's coding.

266
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,760
-Rocío, he's coding!
-Give him one milligram of adrenaline.

267
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,760
One milligram of adrenaline going in.

268
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,160
What's happening?

269
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,800
I gave him adrenaline,
but he's not responding.

270
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,440
Adrenaline? Why? He's in V-fib.

271
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,600
Let's go. Gel.

272
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,280
-Charge to 300.
-Okay. Charged.

273
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,520
Clear!

274
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,760
Go sleep it off, kid.

275
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,560
We'll pretend you weren't here.

276
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,960
Promise me I won't suffer.

277
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,280
When things get rough,
shoot me up with whatever you have to.

278
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,640
I don't care what the law says.

279
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,720
Morphine or something.
Otherwise, I'll have to score some heroin.

280
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,440
Rosa.

281
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,240
You'll have the best palliative care.

282
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,920
I promise.

283
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,720
Thank you.

284
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,640
-Oh, honey. What's with the face?
-Jeez.

285
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,080
Is the Oncology coffee machine broken?
Because this one is too.

286
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,160
If only that were all
that was broken in this hospital.

287
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,240
I just declared a patient terminal
because she wasn't seen in time.

288
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,240
During the pandemic we were swamped

289
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:17,520
and I lost 30% of my cancer patients
because they didn't dare come here.

290
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,720
But what about now?

291
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,520
Why are we allowing people
to die before their time?

292
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,720
Don't exaggerate, it's not that bad.

293
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,800
He's not exaggerating.
Pilar, look at those two.

294
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,360
-How many on-call shifts this month?
-They get paid for them.

295
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,600
They don't get paid enough,
and you know it.

296
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,720
Yeah, you're right,
everything's going to hell.

297
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,160
-Whatever you say.
-Yes.

298
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,480
People always complain about healthcare.

299
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,920
And what do we do?

300
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,480
See them, treat them,
and save their lives when we can.

301
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,440
The fact is,
they're dismantling public healthcare.

302
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,840
And until we make a stand, Pilar,

303
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,680
until we say "enough,"
they'll keep wearing us down.

304
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,120
Make a stand how?

305
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,200
Maybe we should call an indefinite strike.

306
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,160
Show them a country without any doctors.

307
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,000
-A strike?
-Yes.

308
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,680
Like all the failed ones?

309
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,240
With all the minimum services,
it's as if there's no strike.

310
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,680
Well, we might have to do one
without any minimum services.

311
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,520
Dream on, Néstor.

312
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,680
Ask anyone why that's impossible.
The new guys, if you want.

313
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,640
Dr. Moa, got a moment?

314
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,960
He'll be right with you,
but first, answer me this.

315
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,680
Why would we never go on all-out strike?

316
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,320
No, I'll answer.
Basically for two reasons.

317
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,760
One, because although
everyone says doctors are selfless

318
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,760
and will do anything for others,

319
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,240
the truth is,
we're individualists and narcissists.

320
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,120
We're all out for ourselves.

321
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,640
And two, because if we really
went on general strike,

322
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,880
we'd have to allow patients to die,

323
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,440
and that, my dear,
no doctor would stand for.

324
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,320
Because we took an oath.

325
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,040
"The lives of our patients
above all else."

326
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,720
And especially above politics.
That's why we won't strike.

327
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,360
That's why we should.

328
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,080
-Hello?
-Is this Óscar's mother?

329
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,840
Yes, this is Óscar's mother.

330
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,160
-What?
-Once he's stable, he'll be taken up.

331
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,320
At which hospital?

332
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,720
My son's here?

333
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,520
What happened to him?

334
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,440
We've done a full workup.
We'll tell you when we have the results.

335
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,320
But, Pilar…

336
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,800
We know it was an overdose.

337
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,520
What?

338
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,520
No.

339
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,120
That's impossible.

340
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,600
Who brought him? Where was he?

341
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,200
We don't know. He came in an ambulance.

342
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,240
With who? I want to talk to them.

343
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,120
I want to know where they picked him up.

344
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,920
I want to know everything, and right now.

345
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,280
What do you see here?

346
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,800
A tumor mass.

347
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,560
Could it be benign?
I don't know, fine calcifications?

348
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,640
We'll need to do a biopsy,

349
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,440
but I've seen enough
to not be too optimistic.

350
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,480
-Damn it.
-What is it?

351
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,640
I know her.

352
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,520
She's a friend. Well, of my family.

353
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,920
-Patricia Segura, right?
-Yes, it's her.

354
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,160
If we could be discreet…

355
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,120
You're a friend of the president
of the Valencian Government?

356
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,520
Why would she come to a public hospital?

357
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,960
Well, it doesn't matter.
We need to do more tests.

358
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,880
Right away.

359
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,480
Hello, Mrs. Segura.
I'm Dr. Moa. How are you feeling?

360
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,440
Well… if I'd been told yesterday
when I was with my friends

361
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,440
that I'd be getting a biopsy today
to find out if I have cancer,

362
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,200
I would've laughed.

363
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,240
It's a lot to take in,
but worst-case scenario,

364
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,760
we'll be thanking
the accident for catching it early.

365
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,680
Well, I…

366
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,800
I don't mean to offend, but…
I don't know, I'd feel safer at Santa Ana.

367
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,800
-I'd rather see familiar faces.
-What about mine?

368
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,040
Don't take it personally, Biel.

369
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,880
Lie down.

370
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,720
Dr. Moa is one
of Europe's best oncologists.

371
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,040
If things get worse,
Santa Ana will send you here.

372
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,200
It's what private clinics usually do.

373
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,200
Right.

374
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,280
Don't… Ow.

375
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,360
Don't take
leftist propaganda so seriously.

376
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,000
Don't get sucked in.

377
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,960
I have premium insurance.
I'll receive the best treatment.

378
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,120
And I doubt it's serious, right?

379
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,040
-Biel, you know how to do it.
-Oh, God.

380
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,800
All right, you'll feel a slight pinch.

381
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,000
-Almost nothing, don't worry.
-No, it's going to hurt.

382
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,000
It's better to be honest,

383
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,640
so when you feel pain,
you know it's normal.

384
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,800
Will you always be honest?

385
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,440
If I have months to live, will you then?

386
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,960
Let's see what the biopsy tells us first.

387
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,720
One step at a time.

388
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,640
-Hello?
-Hey.

389
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,760
-Where are you?
-On the terrace. Come over here.

390
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,520
-I brought supplies.
-Sweet. Nice one.

391
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,160
-How's it going?
-Good.

392
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:08,400
Man, what a long few days.
I don't even know what I smell like.

393
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,760
My sister thinks
I'm the worst doctor ever.

394
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,280
Well, she doesn't even
consider me a doctor.

395
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,160
Come on, Rodri.
You're a rookie, like all of us.

396
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,440
You missed the ogre
Dr. Amaro's meltdown today.

397
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,360
Yeah?

398
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,040
Her son was brought in today
out of his mind on drugs.

399
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,040
She made a huge scene in the ER.

400
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,400
Quique, everything okay?
That guy makes such a mess.

401
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,920
What did you say, Rodri?

402
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,760
-What's the kid's name?
-The kid?

403
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,280
-Yeah.
-No idea.

404
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,440
She was hysterical,

405
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,720
swearing she'd kill whoever
gave her son so many drugs.

406
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,680
-The poor thing was a wreck.
-Understandable, right?

407
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,800
What's wrong?

408
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,080
All right, listen.
This stays between us, okay?

409
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,640
I took the kid to the hospital.

410
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,160
We were at a chemsex party,
and all of a sudden, he passed out.

411
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,040
That Rocío saw me with him.
If she tells his mom, I'm dead.

412
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,000
So you screwed an attending's son.
You gays are real kamikazes.

413
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,200
Don't you have a home to go back to?

414
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,920
-Here's more interesting.
-They said he was high on everything.

415
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,840
Is that true?

416
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:18,800
Well, he took GHB, speed, coke,
pink tusi, poppers, Molly, ecstasy…

417
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,640
-Jesus.
-And a few dicks too.

418
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,800
-Including yours.
-And I bet you went bareback.

419
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,240
Hey, I take PrEP.

420
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,560
Great, and we all know that PrEP
prevents hepatitis, syphilis, gonorrhea…

421
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,320
If he screwed a few guys,
did they test him for STDs?

422
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,160
Rodri, gonorrhea
doesn't put you in that state.

423
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,160
Hepatitis does.

424
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,520
-Right.
-It could be affecting his liver.

425
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,480
Rodri has a point there.
And you say you're not a good doctor.

426
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,680
You'll have to come clean.

427
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,800
For fuck's sake.

428
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,880
I'm tired of studying already.

429
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,080
Let's go for a drink at the karaoke bar?

430
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,320
Did you give me a hickey?
You got really into my neck.

431
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,080
So what if I did?

432
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,960
Well, my boyfriend won't like it much.

433
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,800
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.

434
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,720
When I drink, I forget I do.

435
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,240
Hey, how's Rodri doing?

436
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,800
I don't think he's doctor material.
Maybe I protect him too much.

437
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,000
He knows how to treat his patients.

438
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,280
And he showed good judgment today.

439
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,080
You should have some faith in him.

440
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,560
He doesn't have to be
a clone of you to be a good doctor.

441
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,400
Hello?

442
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,360
Yes, he's stable.

443
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,560
He's okay for now.

444
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,800
They're urgent.
Don't put them in the system.

445
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,840
-Give them to me directly.
-Román?

446
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,840
-Why are you here so late?
-It's early for me, actually.

447
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,800
I wanted to come in early today
to go over some cases,

448
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,920
and, well, God helps those
who help themselves.

449
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,720
Best leave God out of it.
He's been ignoring me since yesterday.

450
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,640
Doctor,

451
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,880
I'm sure your son will pull through.

452
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,360
Yes, he will.

453
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,560
I'll make sure of it.

454
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,880
-Excuse us.
-Sorry.

455
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,680
Step aside, please.

456
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,920
Fuck, we're never going out midweek again.

457
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,480
Try and get something for the hangover.
Smile at the nurses…

458
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,000
-Morning, boys.
-Morning.

459
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,840
Good night last night, huh?

460
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:55,080
"#StepDown, #SeguraDrunk,
#FastAndFurious." Nice.

461
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,280
"#StepDown…"

462
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,040
Emilio, enough, damn it!

463
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,040
We heard you.

464
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,840
How the hell
did they know I was drunk, huh?

465
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,960
Did the police leak the report?

466
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,200
No, wait… The hospital.

467
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,600
They'll pay for this.

468
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,160
What was your blood alcohol level?

469
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,120
Two beers is all it takes, right?

470
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,840
-Yes.
-All right, guys.

471
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,040
How are we going
to turn this around? Ideas.

472
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,200
Put the croissant down.
We're not here for breakfast.

473
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,840
Patricia.

474
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,800
Patricia, are you with us?

475
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,040
-Yes.
-Good.

476
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,320
Everything goes through me first.

477
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,640
WE HAVE YOUR RESULTS

478
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,440
Newspapers, TV… All through me first.
I've not been kept in the loop lately.

479
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,880
We have several options.
I suggest we're aggressive, radical.

480
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,640
First, chemo to shrink the tumor,
and if we succeed, surgery.

481
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,520
Am I dying, Biel?

482
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,320
We caught it in time.

483
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,080
God damn it!
I'd get surgery tomorrow at Santa Ana.

484
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,200
Then go.

485
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:17,680
You're free to get a second opinion.
Especially since you can afford it.

486
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,280
Unbelievable.

487
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,360
Patricia, trust me.
Your best bet is to be treated by Dr. Moa.

488
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,600
God.

489
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,040
Madam President!

490
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,600
Madam President!

491
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,840
Is it true you had an accident?

492
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,760
It's said you were over the limit.

493
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,240
-Is it true?
-How are you?

494
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,600
A statement for Ana's Afternoon.
Can you tell us why you were admitted?

495
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,360
No statements.
The president needs to recover.

496
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,960
Madam President,
just one question, please.

497
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,200
Yes, no problem.

498
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,040
First of all, thank you for coming.

499
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,160
I know…

500
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,720
you've heard the news, and I'm fine.

501
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,240
But when they were examining me,

502
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:34,400
they found… a small lump in my breast.

503
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,800
-A lump?
-Yes, a tumor.

504
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,240
Do you have any kind
of diagnosis, Madam President?

505
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,000
-A tumor.
-Will you stay in office?

506
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:47,120
The doctors say we caught it in time,
which is the main thing, right?

507
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,920
So, I'll probably have to do
some chemotherapy sessions.

508
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,360
Surgery, maybe.

509
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:02,240
It will be tough, but nothing
other women haven't faced before.

510
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,600
And I've also had
the opportunity to see firsthand

511
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:10,400
that all the resources this government
has invested in prevention have paid off.

512
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,680
So I encourage all women
to come in for a checkup,

513
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,880
because prevention saves lives.

514
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,720
We should be proud
of our public health system

515
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:24,760
and of our Valencian hospitals,
leaders in technology in Spain and Europe.

516
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,480
Our public health system
is working better than ever,

517
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,400
despite all the doomsayers and critics.

518
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:36,120
-So ladies, come in for a checkup.
-Excuse me, Madam President.

519
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,400
-Ah, this is Dr. Moa.
-Please.

520
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,800
My oncologist.

521
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,480
-Perhaps he wants to share my diagnosis--
-No.

522
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,400
I urge all the women
listening to this message

523
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,120
not to come in for a checkup.

524
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,560
I hate to say it,
because prevention saves lives,

525
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,000
but we're overwhelmed,
we can't cope. I'm so sorry.

526
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,720
This is the health system
we're condemned to.

527
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,040
Prevention saves lives,
but we're unable to practice it.

528
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,360
-I'm so sorry.
-How serious is the president's condition?

529
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,440
Madam President!

530
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,200
Don't worry, okay?

531
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,400
One second. Hey! What's going on?

532
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,880
Girl, eight.
Chest pain and difficulty breathing.

533
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,760
She was dying. I didn't know what to do.

534
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,240
She wanted to come here.
Are you the video guy?

535
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,160
-Her sats are very low.
-Take her to bay four.

536
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,560
And call Dr. Donoso.

537
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,320
Look at her left lung.
Why didn't you do a chest X-ray yesterday?

538
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,360
-They left before I could examine her.
-Why?

539
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,640
She was demanding for her to be seen.

540
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:50,640
I don't know what happened,
but you've got a guilty look on your face.

541
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,680
If you want to be taken seriously,
act like a real doctor, damn it.

542
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,800
Less social media and more proactivity.

543
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,080
Show me you know something.
What should we do here?

544
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,720
Okay.

545
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,520
Well,

546
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,640
according to the symptoms
and the CT images,

547
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,200
it could be cystic fibrosis.

548
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,640
We should do more tests,
a sweat test, or even a genetic test.

549
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,520
She also has a pneumothorax.

550
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,040
So first, we take her to the OR
and insert a chest tube.

551
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,440
The rest comes later.

552
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,200
Inform the mother, get her consent,
and we'll fit her in today.

553
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,280
We need to do it now. Figure it out.

554
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,040
-Well said, Néstor. Thank you.
-Thanks.

555
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,760
Nerea.

556
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,960
-Some speech, huh?
-He set the record straight.

557
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,720
-Let's see if it helps.
-Surely.

558
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,440
The man of the hour!
You let it all out this morning.

559
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,960
Everyone's drooling!
But if my ex sees you, he'll kill you.

560
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,880
-Néstor.
-Speak of the devil.

561
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,920
What are you playing at?

562
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,960
l let those antics slide
with newcomers, not you.

563
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,400
-Don't be dramatic, it's no big deal.
-Leo, no.

564
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,720
Do you know the mess you've made?
The calls I'm getting?

565
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,360
You've hung the hospital out to dry.

566
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,320
Don't get me started on your career.
I'd fire you right now if I could.

567
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,640
But you're a kamikaze,
so you couldn't care less, right?

568
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,040
The president doesn't want
to be treated here anymore.

569
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,440
-She didn't want to before, Lluís.
-Fix it. Get her back.

570
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,080
You're putting the jobs
of everyone who works here on the line.

571
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,600
Especially yours, right?

572
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,480
Now that you're hospital director,
this isn't good for you.

573
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,800
Don't go there.

574
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,400
Look, do you know
the saddest part of all of this?

575
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,120
If that woman had
any chance of recovery, it was you.

576
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,320
But thanks to your big mouth,
you've probably sentenced her to death.

577
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,200
ONCOLOGY HOSPITAL

578
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,280
ONCOLOGY

579
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,000
Patricia, how are you?
Can we talk for a minute?

580
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,880
Sure. I'll buzz you in.

581
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,360
Thanks.

582
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,960
Biel, I wasn't expecting you.

583
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,720
I've brought someone. Don't be mad.

584
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,840
And listen to him, please.

585
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,720
He's not my doctor anymore.
I don't have to listen to him.

586
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,240
I get you don't want him
as your doctor after what he did,

587
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,320
but listen to him for two minutes.

588
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,440
He can listen to me.

589
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,280
It's not what you did.

590
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,200
It's not that I was caught
with my pants down.

591
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,080
I'm used to that, damn it.

592
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,920
It's that you saw me
at my most vulnerable,

593
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,320
then threw me to the lions
like it was nothing.

594
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,960
Tell me. How can I trust you?

595
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,240
How can I know
you'll be my doctor, not a unionist?

596
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,840
Patricia, all he cares about
is his patients, I swear.

597
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:44,400
Do you promise me that my recovery
will always be the most important thing?

598
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,560
I promise.

599
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,000
I don't believe you.

600
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,920
Close the door behind you, Biel.

601
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,280
How's she doing? Did you call your mom?

602
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,680
She's not answering.

603
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,960
-She has it on silent at work.
-Do you know where she works?

604
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,520
She works at a bar and cleans houses.

605
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,560
She always changes.
I don't know where she is.

606
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,800
She's really sick.
Will the surgery make her better?

607
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,720
Yes.

608
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,760
But we need a parent
to sign the consent form.

609
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,600
Otherwise, we can't operate.

610
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,000
Okay?

611
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,080
OR in two hours.
Do you have the parents' consent?

612
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,600
-Well…
-Yes. She's already signed it.

613
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,280
Okay, great.

614
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,680
Would you like to join me in the OR?

615
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,160
I'd love to.

616
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,960
-Do you think you're smart?
-I copy her signature perfectly, relax.

617
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,360
No. You have two hours
to get her real consent.

618
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,920
She'll agree to the surgery, okay?

619
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,960
If we don't operate now, she'll die.

620
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,840
-Are you sure she'd give consent?
-Well, obviously, right?

621
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,560
What would you do? Would you go ahead?

622
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,080
-I don't know, Rodri.
-The girl needs surgery.

623
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,440
What's that?

624
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,200
The kid's test results.
Keep this between us, please.

625
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,200
Damn, positive for everything.

626
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,440
Gonorrhea, hepatitis, HIV.

627
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,000
-You screwed him without a condom.
-That's not the point, Biel.

628
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:07,760
It doesn't explain what's causing this.
The hepatitis isn't affecting his liver.

629
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,240
What if it's not the STDs?

630
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,880
You said he passed out
and fell to the ground.

631
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,000
Did he hit his head? Has he had a CT?

632
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,240
That's a hemorrhage.

633
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,960
Yes, it's a hemorrhage.

634
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,960
What if it's causing the coma?

635
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,760
It could be.

636
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,120
He's hypertensive and bradycardic.
Call the neurosurgeon!

637
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,120
Out of the way! Come on, quickly!

638
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,880
Move!

639
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,840
Óscar?

640
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,520
-What happened?
-He had a CT. Subdural hematoma.

641
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,520
-Who ordered the CT?
-He needs a craniotomy stat!

642
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,720
-Call Dr. Donoso.
-Hurry, this way!

643
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,480
And voilà.

644
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,160
There we go.

645
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,720
Dr. Donoso, are you done here?
You're needed in OR four.

646
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,960
-Now?
-It's Dr. Amaro's son.

647
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,000
Please, Doctor.

648
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,640
On my way.

649
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,560
Take it.

650
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,600
All that's left is to insert the tube
and close. Can you do it?

651
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,080
-Can you do it?
-Yes.

652
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,080
Good.

653
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,720
Tray, please.

654
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,480
Jésica, I need you to assist Dr. Castaño.

655
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,000
-What happened?
-It's a subdural hematoma.

656
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,120
We have to start. Every minute counts.

657
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,680
Please. He's my son.

658
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,080
Scalpel.

659
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,840
Forceps and retractor.

660
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:44,800
Sponges.

661
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,880
He's bleeding a lot.

662
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,720
-Is his INR in range?
-Yes, 0.9.

663
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,840
-Are you sure?
-Yes, Doctor.

664
00:43:58,920 --> 00:43:59,840
Everything okay?

665
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,200
More sponges.

666
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,040
I'll mark, you cut.

667
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,640
Her BP's dropping, don't take too long.

668
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,920
No!

669
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,440
What's happening, Doctor?

670
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,400
Sponges!

671
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,800
Forceps, tray, and saline irrigation.

672
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,960
We have to stop this.

673
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,400
-She's unstable.
-We need to do a thoracotomy.

674
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,920
Give me the scalpel.

675
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,000
Damn it, I can't see.

676
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,000
Sponges.

677
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,480
He's bleeding a lot.

678
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,120
Twenty-two blade.

679
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,080
Suction.

680
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,600
His blood pressure is dropping.

681
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,320
Starting norepinephrine drip.

682
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,840
Jésica?

683
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,720
There's a lot of blood.

684
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,400
More sponges!

685
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,920
She's losing so much blood.

686
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,800
-What do I do?
-We're losing her!

687
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,800
Rodrigo!

688
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,160
Rodrigo, come on!

689
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,800
I can't keep him under much longer.

690
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,360
It's clean.

691
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:59,400
-He's still losing blood.
-We need to close the wound.

692
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,480
-We'll do it together.
-What?

693
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,160
Two needle holders
with absorbable 4/0 sutures

694
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,560
and two Adson forceps.

695
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,440
One side each.

696
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,160
-Doctor, we're losing her!
-I don't know what to do.

697
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,640
Call my sister.

698
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,480
Call Dr. Donoso.

699
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,440
She's coding. Start CPR.

700
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,880
Oh, God.

701
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,400
Someone plug the wound! Please, Emi!

702
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,200
Dr. Donoso, your brother needs you.

703
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,360
Send someone else. You're staying here.

704
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,440
Jésica.

705
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:44,600
Come on!

706
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:46,960
Damn it, come on!

707
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,840
No.

708
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,800
-No, please!
-She's gone, Rodrigo.

709
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,160
-No.
-We lost her.

710
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,480
He's stabilizing.

711
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,760
Thank you.

712
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,520
I'm sorry.

713
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:52,360
