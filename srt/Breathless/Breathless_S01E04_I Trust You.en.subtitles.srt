1
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,000
Good morning.

2
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,120
3 WEEKS LATER

3
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,280
We're here today to discuss
the agreed conditions for the strike.

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,160
The strike as agreed will not be enough.

5
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,200
If we do what we always do,
we'll get what we always get: nothing.

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,480
We propose that when the strike
begins tomorrow at Joaquín Sorolla,

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,480
we refuse to run minimum services.

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,400
What?

9
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,360
They know we're going to strike,
but not without minimum services.

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,280
Wait a minute.

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,160
Wait a minute, Doctor.
No minimum services?

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,120
-What does that mean?
-It means we do nothing.

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,040
We sit on our hands. That's it.

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,960
Right, so we won't even
cover the ER? Or the ICU?

15
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:04,880
The idea is to make such a strong stand
that they have no choice but to give in.

16
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,240
Rodrigo was the tip of the iceberg.

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,080
None of us will sit on our hands
when a patient is in need.

18
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,840
If we stop now,
we can help them all later.

19
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,840
This isn't about saving ourselves.

20
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,560
This is about saving public healthcare.

21
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,280
The situation is untenable.

22
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,840
How many of you
don't have time to see patients?

23
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,920
How many of you spend
more time at work than home?

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,600
How many of us are burned out
and can't take it anymore?

25
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,560
We must stand together.

26
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,360
If the higher-ups find out before,
all this will have been for nothing.

27
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,760
Guys, we have to come together.
For Rodrigo, damn it.

28
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,200
Néstor just said it.

29
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,920
All those in favor of a strike
without minimum services,

30
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,720
raise your hand.

31
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,520
This affects us all. Don't be selfish.

32
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,920
-I'm not being selfish, damn it.
-You can't just think about yourself.

33
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,600
I vote in favor.

34
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,400
-For Rodrigo.
-But…

35
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,200
-Me too.
-Me too.

36
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,080
-For Rodri.
-We're with you, Rodrigo.

37
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,760
-For Rodrigo.
-For Rodri.

38
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,680
Come on.

39
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,240
-For Rodri.
-For Rodrigo.

40
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,280
-This is an outrage.
-May, please.

41
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,840
No, not "May, please"!
I refuse to take part in this farce!

42
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,880
You can do what you want,
but count me out.

43
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,400
May.

44
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,360
-May.
-No, please.

45
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,440
I'll talk to her.

46
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,720
-May!
-May!

47
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,800
-May.
-May, wait.

48
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,560
Hey, May.

49
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,880
-May.
-May, wait a second.

50
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,880
What the hell are you doing?
I don't get it. Rodri was your friend.

51
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,840
Rodri isn't here anymore.
But we are, and I have a lot to lose.

52
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,880
And we don't? You don't give a damn.
You're off to Germany, so screw us, right?

53
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,880
Go to hell.

54
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,720
Can we calm down?

55
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,440
May!

56
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,680
Can we relax? Don't strike
if you don't want to, but don't tell.

57
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,040
I'm not a rat. You can do
whatever the hell you want.

58
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,960
Whatever you think, Néstor isn't a god.

59
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,080
Sometimes he's wrong.
And this time, he is.

60
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,480
This is going to blow up in your faces.

61
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,040
BREATHLESS

62
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,600
645 NEW MESSAGES

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,160
How are you?

64
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,880
How many phones did my brother have?
They keep showing up everywhere.

65
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,880
Loads. He always had a spare
in case he couldn't livestream.

66
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,480
Listen, Néstor asked me
to tell you something.

67
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,920
If it's about the minimum services,
I told him he can do whatever he wants.

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,480
No, it's not that.

69
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,680
He wants to do a tribute to Rodri.
Tomorrow, before the strike starts.

70
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,400
A tribute?

71
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,200
Yeah, as a starting signal.

72
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,440
I think it's a good idea,
and it would help the strike.

73
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,960
If you really want to help…

74
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,200
throw all this away.

75
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,360
Look at her.

76
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,120
What's your problem?

77
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,560
All right, then.

78
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,480
STRIKE!

79
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,880
She's always the same.

80
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,240
She talks about the ER,
but he was her friend.

81
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,960
What a bitch.

82
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,320
May I?

83
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,440
Careful, you're sitting with the outcast.

84
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,480
What did you expect
after the scene you made?

85
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,600
I don't know.

86
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,200
A little support from you, actually.
To know my girlfriend isn't crazy too.

87
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,120
Hey!

88
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,400
Lower your voice, please.

89
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,320
What?

90
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,360
You're ashamed of us,
but not of letting people die in the ER?

91
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,600
First, I'm not ashamed,
especially not of you.

92
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,440
Last I checked, you agreed
to keep it quiet because it's easier.

93
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,920
Or did you change your mind?

94
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,240
No, right?

95
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,440
Second, we won't let anyone die.
You heard Dr. Moa.

96
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,080
Oh, right.

97
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,560
It's not shame, it's stupidity.

98
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,080
I want you to understand
my reasons for the strike.

99
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,760
Not interested?

100
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,560
No? You won't listen?

101
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,080
Seriously?

102
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,200
Okay.

103
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,840
Perfect.

104
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,720
Enjoy your lunch.

105
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,720
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN, MAN?
AT LEAST ANSWER ME.

106
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,240
I'M GOING TO THE HOSPITAL, SEE YOU THERE?

107
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,480
-See you later.
-See you. Bye.

108
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,280
BEST NOT,
I DON'T WANT TO COMPLICATE THINGS.

109
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,480
I'VE STARTED SEEING SOMEONE.

110
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,880
I'M NOT THE JEALOUS TYPE.

111
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,320
-Hey.
-See you, Quique.

112
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,400
BUT MY BOYFRIEND IS. SORRY.

113
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,200
The reports from 204.

114
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,200
Thanks, Doctor.

115
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,080
Jésica.

116
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,520
I've been looking for you all morning.

117
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,600
I've been waiting
a day and a half to hear from you.

118
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,680
I know, sorry.
I'm in over my head with this strike.

119
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,600
How are you?

120
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,760
Are you asking me
for real or out of guilt?

121
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,280
I'm asking you for real.

122
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,320
I know I've not been the best boyfriend
these past few weeks, but…

123
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,160
Hell, none of this is easy.

124
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,760
"None of this is easy"?

125
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,760
My brother committed suicide,

126
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,600
and none of this is easy for you?

127
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,960
Sorry.

128
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,560
Listen, why don't we…

129
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,880
Why don't we have dinner tonight
and talk about everything?

130
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,920
Please.

131
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,560
Okay.

132
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,840
The chemo's working.
The tumor seems to have shrunk.

133
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,200
It's ready to be operated on, right?
Patricia will be pleased.

134
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,400
Well, one more round wouldn't hurt.

135
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,600
To delay the surgery for the strike?

136
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,280
To shrink the tumor further
and have better chances in the OR.

137
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,480
Patricia won't mind waiting.

138
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,400
One more round?
That's another month, damn it.

139
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,000
You're kidding me, Néstor.
For fuck's sake!

140
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,280
Why not operate now?

141
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,040
You'd still have to go
on the hospital's waiting list.

142
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,840
We'd be in the same position.

143
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,840
Then I'll go private.

144
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,360
Then I can't be part of the surgery.

145
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,880
But I need you there.

146
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,880
I'm desperate.

147
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,240
I need you to take it out.

148
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,720
Néstor, I want it out.

149
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,560
Take it out, please.

150
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,520
-Take it out, damn it!
-All right. Okay.

151
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,560
But we'll have to do
the surgery tomorrow, okay?

152
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,120
Tomorrow?

153
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,560
It's our only option.

154
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,680
-Am I that sick?
-I told you, no.

155
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,040
You'll need an anesthesia test
and an MRI, that's important.

156
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,640
You'll be admitted today.
Biel, find a bed.

157
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,760
-It'll be difficult on such short notice.
-Find her a bed.

158
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,040
Hang on. Wait a minute, please.

159
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,360
I don't understand.
How did we go from one month to tomorrow?

160
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,240
Is it the strike?

161
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,960
It's not the strike, Patricia.

162
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,920
-What are you not telling me?
-Nothing.

163
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:45,480
I promise you, tomorrow you'll be closer
to putting this cancer behind you.

164
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,680
I'm with you.

165
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,120
What have we got?

166
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,360
Pregnant female, 35, car crash.
Hypotensive and tachycardic.

167
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,680
Possible chest trauma and hemothorax.

168
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,720
-Call Gynecology.
-Please, my baby.

169
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,360
Don't worry,
we'll take care of both of you.

170
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,400
She's coding. Resus room!

171
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,560
-She's been down for 5:20.
-25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

172
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,000
She's still in asystole.
One, two, three, four.

173
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,640
One milligram of adrenaline
every two minutes.

174
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,920
Bring O-neg blood.

175
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,680
I need the portable scanner
to check the fetus. Go!

176
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,800
Six minutes.

177
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,440
One, two, three, four.

178
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,600
25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

179
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,400
Six and a half minutes.

180
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,200
There's a heartbeat. Save the mom,
or we do an emergency C-section.

181
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,320
-She's not even 24 weeks.
-How long has she been down?

182
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,920
-Seven and a half minutes.
-Heart rate's dropping.

183
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Tell Peds a preemie's coming. Scalpel.

184
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,480
Wait! Let's check for a rhythm.

185
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,760
She has a pulse.

186
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,080
Non-reactive pupils.

187
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,840
It was difficult, but I got the room.

188
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,640
-Patricia's on her way.
-Great.

189
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,080
We need to do the MRI,
or we'll go into the surgery blind.

190
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,240
I already asked
and there are no slots for the MRI.

191
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,280
-We'll have to delay it, right?
-No.

192
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,000
She needs surgery as soon as possible.

193
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,000
I think she needs us
to tell her the truth.

194
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,120
You're rushing
to operate before the strike.

195
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,440
Biel, I'm trying to do what's best.

196
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,080
Do my duty to my patient
and keep the strike quiet.

197
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,560
It's best for everyone.

198
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,960
Trust me.

199
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,560
I want you in the OR tomorrow.

200
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,080
You've earned it.

201
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,640
Why do you need to bombard
recovering patients with union demands?

202
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,840
I don't get it.

203
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,480
Patients' spirits need to be lifted,
not dampened, don't you think?

204
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,240
Okay, we're all done here.
I'll bring you your snack now.

205
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,200
-What are you doing?
-My snack. Graham crackers.

206
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,800
-Will you stop scaring the staff?
-I'm not scaring anyone.

207
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,320
I'm testing the waters
because this hospital started the strike.

208
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,800
Yeah, but it's also the hospital
where you're having surgery for cancer.

209
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,600
Didn't you bring any casual clothes?

210
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,000
Oh, Emilio, honestly. You sound
more like my mother than my advisor.

211
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,920
I'll go get them. I'll be back.

212
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,440
Hey, Patricia, promise me you'll rest.

213
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,360
-Yes, sure.
-Please.

214
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,240
Don't get worked up
about work, strikes, or anything.

215
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,640
-Okay? Rest.
-Rest.

216
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,760
BREAST CANCER SURGERY

217
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,080
No change?

218
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,760
She's brain dead.

219
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,160
She was down for too long.

220
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,920
-And the baby?
-Stable.

221
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,360
The family has decided
to keep her alive until it can be born.

222
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,680
Dr. Fuster.

223
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,680
We're preparing the patient's transfer.
I need you to sign these.

224
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,920
What transfer?

225
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,360
Doctor, we're transferring
all the ICU patients to nearby hospitals.

226
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,440
We can't cope.

227
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,080
She either goes to Alicante or stays here.

228
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,840
And tomorrow at midnight,
no one will be here.

229
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,080
All right. We'll do it tonight.
I'll oversee the transfer myself.

230
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,120
Thank you.

231
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,560
Thanks.

232
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,320
What the hell?

233
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,280
May, please. Don't make this harder.

234
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,160
Patricia, how are you?

235
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,920
Dr. Moa asked me to tell you
that we won't be able to do the MRI.

236
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,720
But isn't it important?

237
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,920
If Néstor says we can go ahead,
I'm sure it will be fine.

238
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,720
Oh, okay.

239
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,200
I've been looking online.

240
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,440
Damn it, Patricia.
The one thing you shouldn't have done.

241
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,800
I know, but what can I do now?

242
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,880
Yes, I looked. I couldn't help it.

243
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,000
-What's worrying you?
-Néstor said I'd keep my breast.

244
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,400
But I read that the majority
of patients have it removed.

245
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,600
I don't want it removed, Biel.

246
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,920
Yeah.

247
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,520
Well, if he said that,
it's because it won't have to be.

248
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,680
Trust him.

249
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,480
Okay.

250
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,880
-Paula?
-Yes?

251
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,720
-Give this to Lorena, she's on tonight.
-Okay.

252
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,320
-Bye, honey.
-Bye. Good night.

253
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,120
760 NEW MESSAGES

254
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,400
Hurry, please. Hurry.

255
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,160
I hope everything goes okay.

256
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,400
WE WON'T FORGET YOU

257
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,720
-Make way.
-Are we moving him to Colón?

258
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,080
Let's go.

259
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,880
Look out, please.

260
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,560
ARE YOU PICKING ME UP NOW?
I'M ON MY WAY OUT.

261
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,520
-See you tomorrow.
-See you.

262
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,840
SORRY, I CAN'T TONIGHT IN THE END.

263
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,280
I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU. I PROMISE.

264
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,840
ARE YOU FREE?
I NEED YOUR HELP WITH SOMETHING.

265
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,840
NEARLY THERE.
REMIND ME WHICH APARTMENT.

266
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,200
13 ALBUFERA STREET,
1ST LEFT. I'M WAITING FOR YOU…

267
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,320
COMING UP.

268
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,960
-What the hell are you doing here?
-Your relationship lasted one day, huh?

269
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,960
Or was the boyfriend a lie too?

270
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,600
Wow. I mean, you're fucking insane.
You made all that up just to come here?

271
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,440
-Are you sure it will be in his stuff?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

272
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,360
Shit.

273
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,480
Fuck, I think
my roommate is on his way up.

274
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,480
-You need to leave. I'm sorry.
-No. Not until you explain yourself.

275
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,480
Fine, come in.
Hurry up. There at the back.

276
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,040
-All right, jeez.
-Shit.

277
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,320
Hello?

278
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,760
Quique?

279
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,520
Quique, you left the street door open.

280
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,520
Shit. Sorry, Biel, I got distracted.

281
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,200
I'm kind of busy right now.

282
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,840
Don't laugh.
This isn't fucking funny, okay?

283
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,120
It serves you right for lying.

284
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,240
And on top of that,
I'm starting to come up on this shit.

285
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,680
Goddamn it.

286
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,680
Jesus.

287
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,600
It's so fucking hot.

288
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,960
Rodri kept a notebook with passwords.
It might have the one for his cell phone.

289
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,120
I just want it to stop going off already.

290
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,640
Here it is.

291
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,560
Try 1226.

292
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,720
You'll always be in our hearts.

293
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,320
We're going to miss you.

294
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,360
Thank you for taking care of us.

295
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,200
You'll always be a legend.

296
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,520
I watch your videos every morning.

297
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,240
Your brother was a star.
He had tons of followers.

298
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,120
Rodri helped a lot of people.

299
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,200
DELETE PROFILE?

300
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,880
-What are you doing?
-I'm fucking sick of it!

301
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,800
Sick of you all talking
about him as if he were a saint!

302
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,880
All he did was make shitty videos.

303
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,880
Look, I get that you feel guilty.

304
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,480
-But Rodri doesn't deserve this.
-And I do?

305
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,760
Do I deserve all this?

306
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,840
And I don't feel guilty.

307
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,400
I feel angry! So angry!

308
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,200
Because he chose to make shitty videos

309
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,120
instead of growing some balls
and being a real doctor.

310
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,560
What is this? This is fucking bullshit!

311
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,680
Jésica.

312
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,920
Stop.

313
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It's okay.

314
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,400
I miss him.

315
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,360
I don't know
what I'm going to do without my brother.

316
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,800
-First, you have to forgive him.
-I can't.

317
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,600
-Yes.
-I swear I can't.

318
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,360
I know it's hard, but you have to.

319
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,160
-Sorry.
-No.

320
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,760
-Sorry.
-No, don't be.

321
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,440
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be sorry.

322
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,840
-Holy shit.
-Fuck.

323
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,920
Are they fucking?

324
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,200
Sounds like it.

325
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,680
Damn.

326
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,920
And doesn't hearing
other people fucking turn you on?

327
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,600
I'm so high on Molly right now,
even that chair turns me on.

328
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,240
-You're on Molly?
-Yeah, a bit.

329
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,280
Got any left?

330
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,400
Even a little makes me horny.

331
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,000
Óscar, stop.

332
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,040
Stop, please.

333
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,080
Stop. Fuck.

334
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,120
Fuck.

335
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,120
You can't get hard?

336
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,760
I just…

337
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,200
-I got a bit distracted, sorry.
-Sure.

338
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,720
It's not that you're not into me
or that I'm your boss's son.

339
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,480
It's that I have HIV, right?

340
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,360
Come on, Óscar.

341
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,520
-It's not that, I swear.
-Sure.

342
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,480
It's cool, man.

343
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,440
I'll take a piss and go.

344
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,480
Óscar, wait a minute, please.

345
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,480
Damn it.

346
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,680
For fuck's sake.

347
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,480
On the count of three, carefully.
One, two, three.

348
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,720
May, please,
I don't want to argue anymore.

349
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,400
Me neither. I came to help.

350
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,880
This chaos you've caused
isn't the baby's fault.

351
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,360
Slowly but surely.

352
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,360
-Everything ready in Alicante?
-Yes, I've spoken to them.

353
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,160
Come on. We're doing well.

354
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,680
Almost there. Careful.

355
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,160
Shit!

356
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,320
Call Gyn and Peds
for an emergency C-section.

357
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,600
Let's go to the OR.

358
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,080
She's deteriorating.

359
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,280
Damn it. Her heart's too damaged.

360
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,280
-Damn it. She's coding.
-Shit.

361
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,480
-Should I get the crash cart?
-Hurry!

362
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,000
-Fetal bradycardia.
-You'll have to start.

363
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,440
I've never done one alone.

364
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,280
It's too premature.
It has little chance of survival.

365
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,520
Better than no chance.
You start and they'll take over.

366
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,560
May!

367
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,000
Hold on.

368
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,240
The baby's heart is failing. Get it out!

369
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,840
It's stuck. I can't get to the uterus.

370
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,480
Don't hold back.
She's dead, the baby's not.

371
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,160
Rocío, I need you to pull the skin.
Pull hard, make some space.

372
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,000
-It's too slippery.
-Hurry, before its heart stops.

373
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,320
Okay. Wait.

374
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,040
-Got it.
-Okay.

375
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,280
-Cut. Clamp.
-Clamp.

376
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,640
Anesthetists Vázquez and…

377
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,480
What the hell happened here?

378
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,240
To the OR, now! Quickly!

379
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,800
You move a patient without consent
and perform a botched C-section.

380
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,440
What were you thinking?

381
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,480
Its heartbeat was dropping.
We would've lost it.

382
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,400
Very nice.

383
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,360
But if you hadn't moved the patient,
this would never have happened.

384
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,880
It was my fault, Pilar.
I accept full responsibility.

385
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,320
There's no need to accept it. It's yours.

386
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,880
May's a resident,
she can afford to screw up,

387
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,400
but you're an attending.

388
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,720
Again, why did you move
the patient from the ICU?

389
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,120
Why did you let May do the procedure?

390
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,040
Dr. Amaro--

391
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,240
Alicante has a better NICU.
I thought the mom would make the trip.

392
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,840
I made a mistake.

393
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,920
Yes, you made a big mistake.

394
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,360
No one will erase
this black mark on your record.

395
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,640
Not hungry?

396
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,760
I mean, this is inedible.

397
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,960
Maybe it's true after all
and public healthcare needs a little push.

398
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,360
It's on the list of requests
you've had on your desk for weeks.

399
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,520
Well, when all this is over,
we'll sit down and chat

400
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,840
about your requests.

401
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,640
"When all this is over"?

402
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,320
When you operate
and take out this goddamn cancer.

403
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,880
Can you stay?

404
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,640
Until I fall asleep. We can talk.

405
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,280
The nurse gave me a sleeping pill,
but it didn't do anything.

406
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,520
What do you want to talk about?

407
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,720
I don't know.

408
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,480
About you.

409
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,280
How you became
Spain's most famous oncologist,

410
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,280
for example.

411
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,560
Let's see.

412
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,880
I had a professor at college who said
there were three types of doctors:

413
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,680
those who have a calling,
those who do it because of family,

414
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,200
and those who are in it for the money.

415
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,920
You have a calling. No mystery there.

416
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,680
No. My calling came later.

417
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,640
I'm a doctor thanks to my family.

418
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,440
-You have doctors in the family?
-No.

419
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:29,560
You're getting them all wrong.
I got good grades.

420
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,280
My parents were obsessed
with me going to med school,

421
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,320
and I always did what they wanted, so…

422
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,200
here I am.

423
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:42,560
Ah, you're a nerd.
That's not what you say in the interviews.

424
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,560
Right.

425
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,240
The rebel doctor image
works better for me.

426
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,760
Good boys have no appeal.

427
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,560
You have your charm.

428
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,280
Tell me about you.
Did you always want to be a politician?

429
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:03,280
Not at all. Believe it or not,
my family is working-class and left-wing.

430
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,080
-Always has been.
-Wow.

431
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,880
-They must be pleased.
-Pleased?

432
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,400
Not at all. You should've seen my uncle.

433
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,520
You don't know the fuss he made
when he found out I joined the party.

434
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:27,080
A leftist all his life, then suddenly,
his favorite niece, a right-winger.

435
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,240
Poor guy.

436
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,320
-What does he do now?
-Well, if today is… Thursday?

437
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,280
He died ten years ago, on a Thursday.

438
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,880
-I'm sorry.
-Not of cancer.

439
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,200
You can put that on my record.

440
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,160
I'll remove yours tomorrow.

441
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,480
I promise.

442
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,960
We have to find a contradiction
in Joana's statement.

443
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,920
Hugo says she undressed herself
and that it was all consensual.

444
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,440
It's his word against hers,
and undressing isn't consent.

445
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:22,240
-You know best, the expert feminist.
-Where did that come from?

446
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,600
Sorry.

447
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,760
Sorry, that was unfair.

448
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,080
Do you think I taught our son
to undress drunk women?

449
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,480
-To fuck them without a condom?
-I'm sure Hugo didn't do that.

450
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,680
What if he did?

451
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,920
What if I raised a rapist
without even realizing?

452
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,600
Listen to me.

453
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,280
If so, it wouldn't be your fault.
You've been an amazing mom.

454
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,840
You've always been there.

455
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,480
How many moms think that?

456
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,120
And in reality,
they don't know their kids at all?

457
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,600
That's what scares me the most.

458
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,120
I swear, sometimes
I look at him and I feel dizzy,

459
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,880
as if I don't know who he is,
as if it's his face, but not him.

460
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,320
I don't know.

461
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,920
If anyone's to blame
for not being there, it's me.

462
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,760
I don't hold it against you anymore.

463
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,680
A kid can't raise another kid.

464
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,520
That's why you didn't tell me
when he was arrested.

465
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,680
You didn't think I could handle it.

466
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,040
I'm sorry.

467
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,560
I get why you didn't rely on me,
but from now on,

468
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,720
to help Hugo, we have to be a team.

469
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,600
What is it?

470
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,800
Don't tell me there's more.

471
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,960
Leo, you're scaring me.

472
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,840
I have to tell you something.

473
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,760
STRIKE NOW

474
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,960
The strike.

475
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,880
What?

476
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,320
It's that…

477
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,960
Néstor will announce tomorrow
that we won't run minimum services.

478
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,880
You didn't come home last night.

479
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,160
I stayed here.

480
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,480
This strike isn't going to end well.

481
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,040
We knew we'd have to make sacrifices, May.

482
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,720
-Yeah, but your sacrifices affect me too.
-How?

483
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,560
It'll be harder for you
to get a job in Germany now.

484
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,040
Because you didn't have the guts
to tell Dr. Amaro the truth.

485
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,240
The truth?

486
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,600
I don't care about my record.
I don't want to go to Germany.

487
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,320
What do you mean?

488
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,720
-We've been planning it for months.
-No, you have.

489
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:37,920
You, who only listens to yourself.
Do you know how hard it is to talk to you?

490
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,040
You're like a brick wall.

491
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,440
All right.

492
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,760
I'm listening.

493
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,920
Say what you have to say.

494
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,280
Go on.

495
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,680
Say it.

496
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,040
I want to break up.

497
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,960
I have a good reason
for telling him, but I can't tell you.

498
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,960
-You sell us out and can't say why?
-No. But I called the press.

499
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,400
I said we have an important announcement.

500
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,720
Everything's set.

501
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,000
-In case we have to strike early.
-Okay.

502
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,280
-I screwed up.
-Yeah.

503
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,400
But as much as they want to,
they can't stop it now.

504
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,080
-I hope you're right.
-Yeah.

505
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,320
No minimum services?
Have you lost your mind?

506
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,360
Take any decisions you need to.

507
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,840
The strike goes ahead.

508
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,360
Conspiring against the hospital.
You've outdone yourself.

509
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,680
If you don't stop this madness,
I'll start calling in replacement teams.

510
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,720
Sorry, but there's no going back.
Do what you must.

511
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,480
What do we do?

512
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,080
Call the health minister?
A SWAT team? What do we do?

513
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,240
Calm down, Lluís.

514
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,680
The president of the region
is two floors down, damn it.

515
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,760
Playing with patients' lives
is fine in theory.

516
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,200
In practice, they won't dare.

517
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,560
We'll see.

518
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,040
Leave it to me.

519
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,240
Biel.

520
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,640
It's likely we'll have
to bring the strike forward.

521
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,040
Once Patricia's in the OR,
alert the press and go to the tribute.

522
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,040
-Okay?
-Is everything okay?

523
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,680
Yes, everything's fine.

524
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,360
I'll go change for surgery.

525
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,680
-Good morning.
-Hi, Dr. Moa.

526
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,200
-Quite a show you've put on.
-It's not a show, it's a demand.

527
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,400
-I'm out of here. I have surgery.
-No, you don't.

528
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,960
-Why?
-I'm the Chief of Surgery.

529
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,280
Think you can just change
the schedule as you please?

530
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,560
I can't stop you, but I decide the order.

531
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,400
And you're going last.

532
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,360
You're such a bitch.

533
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,360
You might not finish before midnight.

534
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,680
Will you leave halfway through
because of the strike?

535
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,840
And will you play
with a patient's life, Pilar?

536
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,480
-Me?
-Yes, you.

537
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,040
I haven't done anything. This is all you.

538
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:39,240
I'm just holding up a mirror
to show you how wrong you are.

539
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,640
Want to operate?
Operate. No one's stopping you.

540
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,200
Want to abandon your patient
when the strike starts? Do it.

541
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,960
We'll see how that goes down
in those magazines you love being in.

542
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,720
Don't provoke me, Amaro.

543
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,080
It's not a provocation.

544
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,920
It's a lesson.

545
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,400
It's not the same when you care
about the patient you're abandoning.

546
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,520
Is it?

547
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,080
-Thanks, Arturo.
-No worries, Doctor.

548
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,600
They've still got two hours.

549
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,120
We won't have time.

550
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,800
We have to tell Patricia.

551
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,840
No. We'll bring her up to the OR now.

552
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:29,480
Once she's here, start the tribute
and announce the strike. Okay?

553
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:33,000
-And hide her so she doesn't find out?
-Exactly.

554
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:33,920
Clean.

555
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,040
Néstor, that won't end well.
We have to tell her the truth.

556
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,600
We can still cancel it.

557
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,680
No.

558
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,560
I promised I'd operate today,
and that's what I'll do.

559
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,880
No matter what.

560
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,080
Scalpel.

561
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,000
Biel.

562
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,040
It will be fine.

563
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,800
Hold.

564
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,080
A little more.

565
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,520
Patricia, how are you?

566
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,400
You took ages.

567
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,920
The OR's been busy.

568
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,320
We'll take you up now.

569
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,760
-Is everything okay?
-Yes, it's always like this here.

570
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,200
-Get into bed, please.
-All right.

571
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,400
Leave your phone.
Nothing can be taken up to the OR.

572
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,520
-Shall I put it in your bag?
-Okay.

573
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,360
There we go.

574
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,720
Okay.

575
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,920
Don't be afraid, Patricia.

576
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,040
It will be okay.

577
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,240
FOR RODRIGO

578
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,000
They're dismantling…

579
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,440
Thank you for being here.

580
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,880
With this tribute, we wish to honor
our colleague and friend, Rodrigo,

581
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,480
and make an important announcement.

582
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,240
When the strike begins at Sorolla,
we won't meet the minimum services.

583
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,720
-Well said, Biel.
-That's right.

584
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,880
-That's right.
-Bravo.

585
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,640
So what happened to Rodrigo
never happens to anyone ever again.

586
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,160
-That's right.
-Well said.

587
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,440
-Bravo!
-Thank you.

588
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,160
Bravo!

589
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,960
-Yeah!
-That's right.

590
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:41,440
Public healthcare!

591
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:46,880
Public healthcare!

592
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,800
For Rodri!

593
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:54,840
Public healthcare!

594
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,840
For Rodri!

595
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,880
Public healthcare: in breaking news,

596
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,200
the announced strike
will have no minimum services.

597
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:29,440
Excuse me. I need to speak
to Patricia Segura urgently.

598
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,480
-She was taken to the OR.
-You'll have to wait until she comes out.

599
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,640
-How are they doing?
-Still not done.

600
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,720
-Gauze.
-We announced it.

601
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,680
Great.

602
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,080
Now all we can do is wait.
Go get some rest, I'll stay here.

603
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,320
Inserting the IV.

604
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,880
Come on.

605
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,280
Come on.

606
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,920
Public healthcare!

607
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,960
We're at Joaquín Sorolla public hospital
in Valencia, where at midnight,

608
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,560
an unprecedented
healthcare strike will begin.

609
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,280
I'll go there.

610
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:23,760
Emergency services are losing patience!

611
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,240
Forceps.

612
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,360
STRIKE

613
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,160
Midnight, folks.

614
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,320
The strike begins.

615
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,280
-Let's close and go.
-No one's going anywhere.

616
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,760
We finish the surgery.

617
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,560
What do we do?

618
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,160
Return to your positions.

619
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,520
Pilar, we've been operating too long.

620
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,000
She can't handle more stress.

621
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,200
Oh, you want to stop operating
to prevent more stress?

622
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,280
Not because of your fanatical devotion
to this absurd strike?

623
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,920
I'm staying. Who's with me?

624
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,640
-We said we'd remove her cancer.
-Patricia's important.

625
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,360
-But so is the strike.
-Does she know that?

626
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,040
Dr. Moa, what do we do?

627
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,400
Let's go.

628
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:55,880
I'm staying.

629
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,360
Biel, by my side.

630
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,800
Pilar, there are only three of us.

631
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,240
I said we continue.

632
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,080
Today you'll prove
why you were Moa's favorite.

633
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,120
What a mess.

634
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,880
-We have to remove the breast.
-I said she'd keep it.

635
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:25,120
How could you say that without an MRI
to know the extent of the tumor?

636
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,280
Come, feel.
Notice the difference in consistency?

637
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,960
This is all tumor. We can't save anything.

638
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,200
It's likely spread to the lymph nodes.

639
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:34,920
Metastasis?

640
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,480
We don't know yet.

641
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,600
We remove the breast. Tray.

642
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,400
She's deteriorating.

643
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,760
Probe. We need
to remove the affected nodes.

644
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,640
-No, norepinephrine first.
-Give me gauze.

645
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,560
-The probe, Biel!
-I can't find it.

646
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,520
Without the probe,
I can't locate the sentinel node.

647
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:05,080
-Sats are dropping, Pilar.
-Biel, call the Nurses' Station.

648
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,760
-They're all on strike.
-She's going to crash.

649
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,120
Pilar!

650
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,080
What do we do?

651
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,800
There was more tumor mass
than the tests showed.

652
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,280
I'm sorry.

653
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,760
You removed my breast?

654
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,560
You removed my breast.

655
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,080
You removed my breast.

656
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,320
Yes.

657
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,480
And I'm afraid
we'll have to operate again.

658
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,720
It's still inside me?

659
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,160
Yes, you still have cancer.

660
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,680
Fuck.

661
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,360
Where's Néstor?

662
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,120
I don't believe this.

663
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,840
Where the hell is Néstor?

664
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:16,800
