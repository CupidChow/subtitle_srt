1
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,200
Segura, step down!

2
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,640
NO MINIMUM SERVICES

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,520
Segura, step down!

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,120
FOR RODRIGO

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,760
Segura, step down!

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,360
Segura, step down!

7
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,240
Segura, step down!

8
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:50,960
Segura's rise, healthcare's demise!

9
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,080
Segura's rise, healthcare's demise!

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,560
Assaults on healthcare workers
have increased by 38%.

11
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,200
We're burdened with such
huge pressure and responsibility

12
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,400
that the suicide rate in our profession

13
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,080
is significantly higher
than in the rest of the population.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,920
Segura, step down!

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,560
You clapped for us before.

16
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,000
Now, we're just asking you to listen.

17
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,000
And we won't stop until you do.

18
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,560
BREATHLESS

19
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,640
The wound is healing nicely.

20
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,960
For God's sake. How dare he?

21
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,920
-Patricia--
-No, please, I beg you.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,720
You abandoned me in the OR.

23
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,240
Because of you, I lost my breast
and have cancer spreading inside me.

24
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,720
You promised my recovery
would be the most important thing

25
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:06,360
and that the doctor…
would prevail over the unionist.

26
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,520
And I trusted you.

27
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,960
When I was most vulnerable.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,440
I decided to believe you.

29
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,240
But you sold me out.

30
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,600
-For a goddamn strike.
-The strike had nothing to do with it.

31
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,960
-The surgery shouldn't have continued.
-Or rather, it shouldn't have started.

32
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,760
The tumor was much bigger than expected.

33
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,480
Your body was in a fragile state.

34
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,440
The best thing to do
was to stop and reevaluate.

35
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,800
Well, if you'd done…

36
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,920
-What the hell's it called?
-An MRI.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,360
-If you'd done an MRI, I wouldn't be here.
-Quite right.

38
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,360
Leave me with my patient, please.

39
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,040
Count on me for whatever you need.

40
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,600
Thank you.

41
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,360
We'll talk later.

42
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,680
Patricia, even though I'm on strike,
I've treated you from the start.

43
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,640
I'm the doctor who knows your case best.

44
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,800
Including Biel, who's only a resident.

45
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,240
Well, since you know my case best,

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,880
tell me, do I have metastasis?

47
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,360
The doctor couldn't give me a diagnosis,

48
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,400
but I'm sure you can.

49
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,680
You have the guts.

50
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,080
Has it spread to the lymph nodes?

51
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,560
How long do I have?

52
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,440
We don't know yet.

53
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,400
And when…?

54
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,040
Patricia, take it easy.

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,240
And when the hell will you know?

56
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,760
If there's no one here to test me.

57
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,400
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,880
Néstor.

59
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,920
Néstor!

60
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,560
Yes?

61
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,800
Néstor.

62
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,120
You're not a doctor anymore.

63
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,560
You're a danger to the public.

64
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,600
And I'm going to make sure
that you never practice again.

65
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,960
You're forgetting something.

66
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,440
I'm not just your patient,
I'm the goddamn president.

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,240
We'll cover the ER
and only operate in extreme cases.

68
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,200
Triage is reduced to three levels:

69
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,560
red wristbands, high priority,
yellow wristbands, kept for observation,

70
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,000
and green wristbands,
referred to Esperança and Sant Vicent.

71
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,040
Got it?

72
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,480
You'll be working without attendings,
so support each other.

73
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,600
You're very capable doctors,
and you're going to prove it.

74
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,200
I'm freaking out.

75
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,240
AREN'T YOU GOING TO STOP BY?

76
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,200
MESSAGE DELETED

77
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,680
May, don't ignore me too,
I have enough enemies as it is.

78
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,080
ROCÍO HAS BEEN BLOCKED

79
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,920
I don't know if it's an allergy
or I've caught something deadly.

80
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,080
-May!
-Sorry.

81
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,480
I have a lot on my mind.

82
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,240
-I'm glad you came to your senses.
-Here, from the ER.

83
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,160
Let's go?

84
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,480
And I bet it's your detergent.

85
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,280
Or that Dr. Moa looks at you differently
since you betrayed him.

86
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,480
But you did the right thing.
You stayed in the OR.

87
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,160
Despite this shitty situation,
I'm happy not to be working with Leo.

88
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,200
Let the chaos begin.

89
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,320
-Gerard Serra!
-Here.

90
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,200
Bunch of slackers!
My husband wasn't even tested!

91
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,440
Calm down, sir!

92
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,520
No, I won't!

93
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,080
Can't you see he fainted?

94
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,360
-He fell and no one's helping!
-What's wrong?

95
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,800
What do you want? A clap?

96
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,120
-Hey!
-I'll clap in your faces!

97
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,960
-Get off!
-What are you doing?

98
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,000
-Sorry.
-Rocío, are you okay?

99
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,360
-Let me see.
-What are you doing, man?

100
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,160
-Someone's hurt. I see blood.
-You can't act like that.

101
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,680
-The tension is palpable.
-Calm down, okay?

102
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,160
-Sorry.
-Put yourself in our…

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,880
What happened?

104
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,920
Nothing, some asshole.

105
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,320
Let me see.

106
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,520
It's nothing.

107
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,880
No one will treat me.

108
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,600
Please, I can't take
this knee pain anymore!

109
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,240
How are you?

110
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,400
Someone take a look at me, please.

111
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,360
-Don't worry.
-Please!

112
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,680
How are you?

113
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,520
Now you're learning German?

114
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,880
You must be bored doing nothing all day.

115
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,080
May…

116
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,320
Come home.

117
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,720
Or, well, I don't know.

118
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,560
For a few days, until you find a place.
Where are you sleeping?

119
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,480
Go to hell.

120
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,760
Shit.

121
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,640
We need to talk. We're having a baby.

122
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,640
Put ice on it three times a day.

123
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,600
Damn it.

124
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,560
I've got a surprise visitor!

125
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,920
I said no visitors.

126
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,440
Not even a health minister in crisis?

127
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,600
Ventura.

128
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,760
Ventura.

129
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,920
Have you seen the mess we're in?

130
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,480
And I'm stuck in here.

131
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,760
It's like a bad joke.

132
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,160
I don't get why you didn't go private.

133
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,200
We can't get into Santa Ana
for another three days.

134
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,680
-And that's doing us a favor.
-Anyway, enough nonsense.

135
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,080
What are your thoughts?

136
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,000
Have you got any plans
against unprecedented healthcare strikes?

137
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,840
I came to see how you are,
not to get you to work.

138
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,560
Come on.

139
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,640
I can't sit back
and do nothing, so tell me.

140
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,760
Do you have the unions' demands?

141
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,920
Patricia.

142
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,680
This is a tough time for you.

143
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,640
We think it's best
if you step down for a while.

144
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
Look after yourself.

145
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,480
But I can't do nothing.

146
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,440
Take sick leave, rest.

147
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,360
You're serious?

148
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,720
You want to cast me aside now?

149
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,320
Did you know something?

150
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,080
What would I know?

151
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,680
Patricia.

152
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,080
It's not that.

153
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,600
What is it then?

154
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,560
Tell me what it is.

155
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,320
Don't give me that look.
I know when I'm being played.

156
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,480
And it takes more intelligence
than yours, Venturita.

157
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,640
And flowers

158
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,080
that cost a lot more.

159
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,680
-Let's calm down.
-You calm down.

160
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,920
Right?

161
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,520
Tell me, how would you feel
if you knew you were responsible

162
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,880
for bringing
the entire health system to a halt,

163
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,280
and for that reason, you might die,

164
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,360
while the vultures
in your party fight over your position?

165
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,040
How would you feel?

166
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,440
Patricia, don't be stubborn.

167
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,760
Sooner or later, you'll have to stop.
It's for your own good.

168
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,000
No.

169
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,920
I won't…

170
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,600
I won't allow it.

171
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,560
If they take this away from me,
they take everything.

172
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,640
Everything.

173
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,280
File this one.

174
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,600
-Yes, Doctor.
-Thanks.

175
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,360
Doctor, please, I need help.
I cut myself on the cleats of a boot.

176
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,760
If it's a cut, go to the medical center.

177
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,080
We're swamped here.

178
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,480
They sent me here. Please, help me.

179
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,800
Let me see.

180
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,600
-Okay, apply pressure.
-Okay.

181
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,320
-Come with me.
-Thank you.

182
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,240
Excuse me.

183
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,760
The anesthetic will sting a little,
then you won't feel a thing.

184
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,680
Okay.

185
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,120
What's up? How's it going over here?

186
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
Deep cut. Six centimeters.

187
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,160
Excuse me, sorry.
Could we talk for a minute?

188
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,480
I'm stressing out, man, I…
I don't care if you're a scab anymore.

189
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,400
Can't you see I'm busy?

190
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,800
You need to do a subcutaneous suture.
Look how open it is.

191
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,720
Jesus.

192
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,880
Then an intradermal one,
if you know how to,

193
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,600
because the girl can't have
a scar on her face.

194
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,520
Thanks.

195
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,040
Don't mention it.

196
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,840
The thing is,

197
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,360
I've never lost a hard-on before,
Menchu, I swear.

198
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,000
The kid thought it was
because of his condition, but it wasn't.

199
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,240
Oh, that's a shame.

200
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,240
And couldn't it be
that you were nervous, honey?

201
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,320
I mean, maybe you got stressed out
and thought, "I won't perform."

202
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,120
-The usual thing.
-Me? No way.

203
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,280
-Óscar and I met at a chemsex party.
-What the hell is that?

204
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,240
A party where orgies take place.

205
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,680
You're with one guy, then suddenly,
four dicks are in your face.

206
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,320
-No kidding!
-Quique, please.

207
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,360
What?

208
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,200
The point is,
Óscar and I had sexual relations.

209
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,320
Is that better?

210
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,840
And it's never happened before.

211
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,320
-No?
-No idea what it was.

212
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,400
Something always happens to guys
when you start liking someone.

213
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,920
You have a mental block.

214
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,640
-You think so?
-It's math, honey.

215
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,280
-Did that happen to you?
-To me?

216
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,360
-Yep.
-And what did you do?

217
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,240
I married him.

218
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,640
-You're kidding.
-I swear.

219
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,560
I mean, Óscar and I flirt,
we turn each other on and all that,

220
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,280
but I don't think I like him.

221
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,160
You don't like him, yet you've been
talking about him for ten sutures.

222
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,960
-That's true.
-Yeah.

223
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,480
-I've been like this for hours.
-I've had enough. Let's go.

224
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,840
One moment, please!

225
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,680
May I have your attention, please?
If you can go to Sant Vicent, do so.

226
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,080
This is a disgrace!

227
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,160
I'm not leaving until I'm seen.

228
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,920
We've been here over four hours!

229
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,400
We came from Sant Vicent.
No minimum services there either.

230
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,920
What?

231
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,040
"Sant Vicent University Hospital
joins the strike without minimum services

232
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,000
started by Sorolla two days ago."

233
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:29,000
"Meanwhile, Segura's government
hides in silence amidst a health crisis."

234
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,200
It's out of control.

235
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,200
If it keeps spreading,
we'll have to take drastic measures.

236
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,800
Let's focus. What do we do now?

237
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,240
Meet with them and listen to them.
See if they calm down.

238
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,280
Okay, Emilio.

239
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,200
-Here.
-Thanks, Doctor.

240
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,280
Dr. Amaro, how's your son?

241
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,720
My son?

242
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,840
I'm the EMT who brought him in.

243
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,200
You brought him in?

244
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,640
Yes. I wanted to talk to you,
but we haven't crossed paths.

245
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,720
Thank God a doctor was with him,
or he wouldn't have made it.

246
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,920
A doctor? What doctor?

247
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,400
Segura, step down!

248
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,640
Segura, step down!

249
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:17,200
Segura's rise, healthcare's demise!

250
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,360
Segura's rise, healthcare's demise!

251
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:30,440
Public healthcare!

252
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:36,680
Public healthcare!

253
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,000
-Fake!
-Phony!

254
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,240
Get out of here!

255
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,160
Phony!

256
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,640
Well, here I am.
Patricia Segura, in the flesh.

257
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,000
You have every reason to be here
and to have reached this point.

258
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,520
I understand you.

259
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,040
And I don't blame you.

260
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,240
Rodrigo's death was a real blow.

261
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,320
A real blow.

262
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,080
-We lost a colleague.
-Yes.

263
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,760
But how far will this go?

264
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,240
To total collapse?

265
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,600
I'm here.

266
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,080
I'm here to listen.

267
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,760
On one condition: the strike ends today.

268
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,440
-Yeah, right.
-Oh, sure.

269
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,400
-Come off it!
-Get out of here!

270
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,320
Patricia.

271
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,320
The Health Department
has had our demands for months.

272
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,960
And you should be in bed.

273
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,880
I should be in bed,
but I'm here with all of you.

274
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:49,200
The Health Department won't do anything
because it would be a sign of weakness.

275
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,120
So, guess what you've got
on that front? Nothing.

276
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,280
On this front, you've got
a spokesperson who's willing, able,

277
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:02,360
and totally and fully committed
to putting an end to this today.

278
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,520
Why don't we negotiate?

279
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,280
The president is right here.

280
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,880
Now? It won't do any good.

281
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,840
I don't know.

282
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,480
Maybe it will. Right?

283
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,440
Hell, we wanted them to listen…
I don't know.

284
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,760
I vote yes.

285
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,000
Great.

286
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,120
-I vote yes.
-Me too.

287
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,320
What the hell are you doing?

288
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,800
-Patricia. Please, listen to me.
-Guys, listen up!

289
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,880
We're getting there!
The Health Department just called.

290
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:39,040
They want to meet with us urgently
this very afternoon!

291
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,200
-Come on!
-Yes!

292
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:48,320
All the hospitals in Valencia are joining
the strike without minimum services!

293
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,000
All seven!

294
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,040
Public healthcare!

295
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,080
KEEP HEALTHCARE ALIVE

296
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:04,080
Public healthcare!

297
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,880
-I got my stuff from your place.
-Wait a minute. No, Jésica.

298
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,880
"No" what, Lluís?

299
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,200
You abandoned me
at the hardest time of my life.

300
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,440
I understand
you're stressed out about the strike

301
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,840
and even mad at me for supporting it,

302
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,320
but you have no right
to treat me like this.

303
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,440
You're right.

304
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
You're right. That's all I can say.

305
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,360
But please, don't make a rash decision.
Let me explain.

306
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,640
If you want to explain, do it now.

307
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,360
Why did you disappear?

308
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,320
What's up, Óscar? I…

309
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,240
I wanted to apologize
for the other day because…

310
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,760
I didn't mean to make you feel bad,
and I was wondering if…

311
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,360
I don't know where this will lead,
but I really want to see you and…

312
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,880
Jesus, what a load of crap.

313
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,960
-Do you think I'm an idiot?
-Jeez, Doctor.

314
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,880
No. Why?

315
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,160
No? So at what point
did you think I wouldn't find out?

316
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,840
-You mean because of the message?
-It was you, Enrique!

317
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,840
You were the one with my 19-year-old son
the day he almost died.

318
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,320
Where are you going?
Where the hell do you think you're going?

319
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,160
-Goddamn coward!
-I'm really sorry, okay?

320
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,600
-I'm sorry, Doctor.
-You're sorry?

321
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,200
For what? Drugging him?

322
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,560
Screwing him without protection?
No, I don't think you're sorry yet.

323
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,480
But trust me, you will be soon.
You'll be very sorry you ruined his life.

324
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,360
And you can bet I'll ruin yours.

325
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,360
YOUR HEALTH IS FOR SALE

326
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,320
Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.

327
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,280
Don't worry.

328
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,040
Is that my stuff?

329
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,000
Yeah.

330
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,200
Since you won't come,
I thought you'd need them.

331
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,080
May…

332
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,960
I just want to help you
and for us to talk.

333
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,800
All right.

334
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,040
The apartment is yours.

335
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,280
We're not married.

336
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,800
And the baby, well…

337
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,160
I guess we'll see.

338
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,120
One week with you, one with me.

339
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,600
You're not going to Germany?

340
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,440
Of course I am.

341
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,160
Then how are we going
to have the baby for a week each?

342
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,920
-I live here.
-No one's forcing you to live here.

343
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,520
Oh, May.

344
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,880
-Call me when you want to talk for real.
-I am.

345
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,240
No. What you're doing is punishing me.

346
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,840
If you'd act like an adult,
we'd talk for real.

347
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,560
Okay.

348
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,080
Sorry.

349
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,800
You start.

350
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,640
You got pregnant
because I asked you to, May.

351
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,280
And I'm infinitely grateful.

352
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,560
But I don't think it's fair
you bear this responsibility.

353
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,200
What are you saying?

354
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,920
That I should have custody of the baby.

355
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,960
I'm going to ask for it.
I'm doing it for her, and for you.

356
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,640
For me?

357
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,040
You're insane.

358
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,840
-No, May--
-Get out, please.

359
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,320
Go.

360
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,280
Critical patient. Highest priority.

361
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,720
Move aside, please.

362
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,600
Rosa!

363
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,800
-What happened?
-She was bleeding from her neck.

364
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,440
We tried to examine her,
but when we moved her hand,

365
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,200
a spurt of arterial blood
hit the ambulance roof.

366
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,320
The woman put her finger back
in the hole and we brought her in.

367
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,600
-"In the hole"?
-Yes, look.

368
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,080
-The surgical wound has opened.
-Yes.

369
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,840
I feel perfectly fine, Doctor.
I was just alarmed to see so much blood.

370
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,280
Her blood pressure is low but stable.
Her finger has stopped the bleeding.

371
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,920
But how serious is it?

372
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,640
Well, her skin is like tissue paper
because of the radiotherapy.

373
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,080
Rosa!

374
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,360
Doctor, don't tell Ramiro
this has to do with my treatment.

375
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,920
-He'll lose it.
-Don't worry.

376
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,520
-Excuse me, sir.
-It's my wife.

377
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,720
Is it serious, Doctor?

378
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,000
She's done a great job
stopping the bleeding.

379
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,600
We'll operate to close the wound.
You'll have her back in a few hours.

380
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,080
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

381
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:33,960
Excuse me.

382
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,040
Can't anyone tell Dr. Moa we're here?

383
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,320
Germán, I need a bay.

384
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,640
-They're all full, man.
-It's urgent.

385
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,920
Resus room?

386
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,880
I'll give you something to relax,
but let me see the wound first.

387
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,040
All right.

388
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,400
Okay, you can take it out now.

389
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,360
Holy shit! Rosa, are you okay?

390
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,360
-Yes.
-Yes?

391
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,080
Germán, get two 18-gauge IVs
and some O-neg for transfusion.

392
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,880
-She needs to lie down.
-Okay.

393
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,320
Rosa, hey. Look at me.

394
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,840
What do we do now?

395
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,760
May!

396
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,320
Red wristband. I need
an anesthetist and a vascular surgeon.

397
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,400
-Stat!
-On it.

398
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,880
Rosa, hey.

399
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,320
Stay with me.

400
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,560
Damn it!

401
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,640
Just one day after the start
of this strike without minimum services,

402
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,320
with all Valencian hospitals now involved,

403
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,400
the Health Department and the unions
are meeting to end this deadlock.

404
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,680
They're heading to the Health Department
right now to present their demands.

405
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,800
HEALTHCARE ISN'T FOR SALE

406
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:47,880
Public healthcare!

407
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,960
Public healthcare!

408
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,520
Bravo!

409
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,320
So brave!

410
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,560
Hooray!

411
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,320
Hooray for public healthcare!

412
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,120
-No vascular surgeons.
-You're kidding me.

413
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,600
Jesus.

414
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,800
What the hell do we do?

415
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,160
If we want her to live, it's up to us.

416
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,080
We stop the bleeding
by ligating the carotid.

417
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,600
Isn't it too risky?
It carries blood to the left hemisphere.

418
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,480
We could cause a massive stroke.

419
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,760
It's all I can think of
to stop her bleeding to death.

420
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:37,160
Right, and pray she's got stenosis
and good collateral circulation.

421
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,200
So pray.

422
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,400
-Should I take my finger out?
-Do it.

423
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,680
-Holy Mother…
-Prepare the sterile field.

424
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,920
-Sponges!
-Damn it.

425
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,080
And absorbable 4/0 sutures.

426
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,920
-Okay.
-I need the sponges.

427
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,320
Clamp.

428
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,360
Biel.

429
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,520
-Press there.
-On it.

430
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,000
I can't clamp the artery, it's tearing.

431
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,720
Biel, try further down, okay?

432
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,560
Ready.

433
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,080
Damn it.

434
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,560
-Biel, she's bleeding out!
-One minute!

435
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:30,880
Almost there.

436
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,000
Okay, got it.

437
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,080
Let's hope she makes it.

438
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,360
We think it's a good deal.

439
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,280
On-call pay rates will be adjusted,

440
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,200
and although a 35-hour workweek
isn't feasible, we're offering 37.

441
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,080
The rest, you know.

442
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,920
And is the president aware of all this?

443
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,800
The president is perfectly aware
of everything her council does, Mr. Moa.

444
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:08,960
Right.

445
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,640
And she agrees?

446
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,120
Something wrong with the document?

447
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,880
Honestly, I think it's more
than you were expecting.

448
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,800
Well, it looks good on paper.

449
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,480
The concern is whether it happens.

450
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,320
If you agree, tomorrow
it will be handed over to Mrs. Segura,

451
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,440
and after she signs, so will you.

452
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,360
Agreed?

453
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,080
Very well.

454
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,880
If they force me to sign this,

455
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,560
I'll have to resign.

456
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,560
Don't look at it like that.

457
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,920
Think that if the doctors come back,
you'll be able to continue your treatment

458
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,160
and save your life.

459
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,720
Be selfish, do it for you.

460
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,080
The party will be rubbing
their hands with glee.

461
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,000
They played their cards perfectly.

462
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,720
The goddamn strike.

463
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,520
And you know what pisses me off the most?
They didn't even read my governance model.

464
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,160
-Of course not.
-They don't give a damn.

465
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,080
They only care about one thing.

466
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,160
The presidency.

467
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,320
You shouldn't smoke.

468
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,120
My grandmother lived until she was 90.

469
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,120
Smoking?

470
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,200
Minding her own business.

471
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,520
There's nothing more
we can do now, Patricia.

472
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,320
The best thing to do is

473
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,640
step down with a little dignity.

474
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,560
I don't know.

475
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,280
Tomorrow, I'll resign.

476
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,400
Look at me.

477
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,800
Look at me, Emilio.
Let me announce it myself.

478
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,560
Of course.

479
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,240
Here.

480
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,480
Only me.

481
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,440
NO MINIMUM SERVICES

482
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,280
Jesus, could they make it any lower?

483
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,480
May!

484
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,920
-Excuse me, Dr. Santapau?
-She's not here.

485
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,840
No?

486
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,280
You were right. I shouldn't have
gotten inseminated during my residency.

487
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,960
I never said that.

488
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,960
-Yeah, but you were thinking it.
-Don't be silly.

489
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,600
-Sorry if I've been hard on you--
-The heartbeat?

490
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,680
-Leo, the heartbeat?
-Wait, we have to give it time.

491
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,040
And the father?

492
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,720
No, biological mother.

493
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,280
Surrogate?

494
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,080
My girlfriend… My ex-girlfriend.

495
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,720
Leo, there's no heartbeat.
I'm going to lose her.

496
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,200
Leo!

497
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,200
Maybe it's for the best.

498
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,680
This way, she'll never
have to meet her shitty moms.

499
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,480
Damn it.

500
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,320
Thank you.

501
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,400
Do you want this baby?

502
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,520
Yes.

503
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,360
Then you have to fight for her.
That's what a mother does.

504
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,160
JOAQUÍN SOROLLA HOSPITAL

505
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,240
Come on, Rosa. Give me good news.

506
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,520
Damn it.

507
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:34,040
STRIKE!

508
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,560
DEFEND YOUR HEALTH!

509
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,720
As I said, the surgery went well.

510
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:50,000
But until we could do the CT scan,
we couldn't see the extent of its effects.

511
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,840
The ligation of the artery

512
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,200
caused a massive stroke
in the left hemisphere,

513
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:03,200
accompanied by cerebral edema
with a shift of the midline.

514
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,640
In layman's terms, Doctor.

515
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,840
We…

516
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,560
We think it's incompatible with life.

517
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,280
But it wasn't serious.

518
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,600
I'm very sorry.

519
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,080
The next few hours are critical.

520
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:26,080
I promise we'll do everything we can,
but it's very likely she'll get worse and…

521
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,040
you'll have to make a decision
to stop and withdraw treatment.

522
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,960
What? Me?

523
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,240
No, I can't.

524
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,920
She's my wife.

525
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,120
I want to see Dr. Moa.

526
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,880
-Dr. Moa--
-I want Dr. Moa's opinion!

527
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,360
Get Dr. Moa!

528
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,440
-What's going on here?
-Get Dr. Moa.

529
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,000
I'm so sorry, Ramiro.

530
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,400
How did it come to this?

531
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,440
All she wanted was for us
not to suffer because of her illness.

532
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,640
And now, my Rosa is gone.

533
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,800
And I have to decide
whether to end her life?

534
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,160
I can't.

535
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,640
I'm so sorry I couldn't be with you.

536
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,840
-Truly.
-It wasn't supposed to be like this.

537
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,720
You said we'd still have
a few months after the surgery.

538
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,400
-Yes.
-And they've been taken from me.

539
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,200
She's been taken from me suddenly.

540
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,040
-Ramiro--
-All because of your strike!

541
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,480
You know that, right?

542
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,200
Because inexperienced kids
were left in charge.

543
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:00,160
It would've happened regardless.
Any doctor would've acted similarly.

544
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,680
I know it's hard to believe,
but no one's to blame here.

545
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,320
I assure you, Mr. Meseguer.

546
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,560
Thanks.

547
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,760
Jes, do you want
to have breakfast together?

548
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,760
I'm having a rough day.

549
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,640
Biel…

550
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,240
-Wait, let me say something first.
-Okay.

551
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,800
I know you said you don't want anything.

552
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,360
And I said I'm fine with it.

553
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:51,120
But I don't know, as much as I like
secretly screwing you all over Valencia,

554
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,320
what I'd like right now is to have
breakfast together without hiding.

555
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,480
What do you think?

556
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,000
-Hi.
-Hi.

557
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,200
De Felipe, congratulations.
I heard how hard you've been working.

558
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,120
The whole hospital thanks you.

559
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,280
I won't forget it.

560
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,400
Ready?

561
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,720
-Yep.
-Come on.

562
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,520
-See you later.
-Bye.

563
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,000
Pilar.

564
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,120
Thank you.

565
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,320
Make no mistake,
I was just trying to avoid a lawsuit.

566
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,320
Don't you see
this is already blowing up in your faces?

567
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,720
There's your resident.

568
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,320
Keep leaving him on his own
and we'll have another suicide soon.

569
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,160
How could you operate
without a vascular surgeon?

570
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,080
And ligate the carotid
of a terminally ill patient?

571
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,880
-We had to try and help her.
-No.

572
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,200
Anyone with half a brain
would've let her die in the OR.

573
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,240
That's enough!

574
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,320
How fucking dare you?

575
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,800
I've been here for days
working my ass off with no rest!

576
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,080
Don't you dare tell me
what I should've done.

577
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,560
You can shove your lecture up your ass!

578
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,200
Because if that man
has to make that decision,

579
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,240
it's because you weren't here!

580
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,360
Screw you!

581
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,520
Too much lipstick.
You've gone a bit overboard.

582
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,760
I'll wait outside.

583
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,680
Okay.

584
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,040
Thanks.

585
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,120
-How are you?
-I'm not your patient.

586
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,320
The document's there.
Check it if you want.

587
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:00,920
A little more.

588
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,680
-It's a great deal.
-Couldn't have done it better myself.

589
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,200
You wouldn't have done it.

590
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,200
How tiresome you are, Néstor.

591
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,160
My successors will make me look good,
mark my words.

592
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,720
Why? Are you leaving?

593
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,840
Can you give us a moment?

594
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,560
That right there

595
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,400
is a smoke screen.

596
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,880
They're using you to get rid of me.

597
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,360
That smoke screen will save many lives.

598
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Not mine.

599
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,520
You don't know that.

600
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,680
Look me in the eye and tell me
I'm not just collateral damage

601
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,360
in your grand plan
to save public healthcare.

602
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,160
You're not.

603
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,880
If you had the balls to leave me
in the OR in the middle of surgery,

604
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,120
have them now to tell me the truth.

605
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,240
Was I collateral damage?

606
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,400
No.

607
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,600
But there are things
bigger than us, Patricia,

608
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,880
which are also worth fighting for.

609
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,440
That's all.

610
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,160
You know what?

611
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,400
You're absolutely right.

612
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,240
Emilio!

613
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,760
I'm aware of the rumors circulating
that we're making deals with the unions,

614
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,120
and that, because of this and my illness,

615
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,480
I'm stepping down.

616
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,080
What? She's stepping down?

617
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,480
There's no way.

618
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,480
This couldn't be more untrue.

619
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,400
What?

620
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,560
Because I…

621
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:57,120
I didn't take up this post just because.
I took up this post to make a difference.

622
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
That's right.

623
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:04,160
And I don't plan on leaving
until this situation is resolved.

624
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,520
What a bitch.

625
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,600
We haven't made a deal with the unions,

626
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,760
because that would mean
renouncing all my policies

627
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:16,000
and surrendering
to the brutality of their healthcare.

628
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,720
Excuse me.

629
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,080
Thank you.

630
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,280
This health system removed my breast.

631
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,280
Without my consent.

632
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,600
Then failed to remove the tumor
now spreading throughout my body.

633
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:40,960
So if they want to achieve anything,
it will literally be over my dead body.

634
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,960
I won't back down.

635
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,080
Even if that means
the lack of doctors and treatment

636
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,800
costs me my life.

637
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,880
So that what happened to me
doesn't happen to anyone else.

638
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:56,960
Because, ladies and gentlemen,
this health system deserves to be better.

639
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,320
Thank you very much.

640
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,000
Here's to our president!

641
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,760
