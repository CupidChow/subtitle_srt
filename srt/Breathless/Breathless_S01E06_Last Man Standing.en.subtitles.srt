1
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,760
ANA'S AFTERNOON

2
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,440
Public healthcare!

3
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,520
The healthcare strike
started at Sorolla three weeks ago

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,000
seems to be losing steam.

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,520
However, some hospital staff
insist on going all the way,

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,160
facing off against Segura.

7
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,320
We're just asking you to listen.

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,720
ONCOLOGIST AT SOROLLA

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,640
And we won't stop until you do.

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,680
If they want to achieve anything,
it will literally be over my dead body.

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,360
Well, you can see
how things are at Sorolla.

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,000
Ana's Afternoon has tried
to reach out to Néstor Moa,

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,800
the leader of this strike,
but he didn't want to speak to us.

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,960
Several hospitals have now withdrawn
from the protests, leaving only Sorolla.

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,400
Great.

16
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,920
We're totally screwed.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,360
We can't fall apart
because of what a few people are saying.

18
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,800
It's not a few people, Néstor.
They're not the only ones.

19
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,640
People think we're scumbags
who left a cancer patient to her fate.

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,680
-All this is taking a toll on us.
-So I'll hold a press conference.

21
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,800
I don't think exposing yourself
even more is the best idea.

22
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,840
So we just let the president
paint us as the bad guys?

23
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,720
No. I don't know.

24
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,880
Hey you, Moa!

25
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,160
Screw you, asshole!

26
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,520
You're a piece of shit!

27
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,080
-Are you okay?
-Scoundrel!

28
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,960
BREATHLESS

29
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,480
All right.

30
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,840
Stop, you're going to make me cry.

31
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,640
I want the left
to keep thinking I'm heartless.

32
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,320
This calls for a celebration.

33
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,800
Quite a comeback you've made, Segura.

34
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,320
We're skyrocketing in the polls.

35
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,240
If we carry on like this,
it could be the start of our campaign.

36
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,160
Slow down, Francisco.
The elections are still a way off.

37
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,720
-A long way off.
-Well, if they were now…

38
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,960
Absolute majority!

39
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,840
President!

40
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,920
President!

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,200
Enough!

42
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,880
Come on, let's get to work.

43
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,000
All right…

44
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,560
You have to report this.

45
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,480
No way.

46
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,360
It was just some kids fooling around.

47
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,560
Things are getting out of hand.

48
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,000
The unions just called.

49
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,960
They want to meet
to reassess the situation.

50
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,800
How can we stop them
calling off the strike?

51
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,560
You might have to negotiate with Patricia.

52
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,920
No.

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,880
She'd just humiliate us
and then give us nothing.

54
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,160
Well, then maybe
we have to accept we've lost.

55
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,080
Not yet.

56
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,520
Look, you're right.
A press conference won't do any good.

57
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,440
No.

58
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,520
I have to refute her ideas in person.

59
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,960
-It's the only way they'll listen.
-That could backfire.

60
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,080
Well, what have we got to lose?

61
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,400
Excuse me, please. Coming through.

62
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,480
-Donoso didn't strike for long.
-No surprise there.

63
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,840
She says one thing then does another.

64
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,400
I didn't know you knew her so well.

65
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,360
Weren't you in the ER waiting room?

66
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,280
I snuck out for five minutes.

67
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,160
I don't get it.

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,560
If we're the only ones on strike,
why are we still so swamped?

69
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,960
Amaro's orders.

70
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,640
Critical patients on the floors,
the rest in the ER until it's over.

71
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,760
Right. And when will it be over?

72
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,840
No idea. All this to end up
with the whole hospital angry

73
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,400
and Néstor hating me.

74
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,440
Hey, if I can get over my real girlfriend,
you can get over your imaginary boyfriend.

75
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,280
Yours could be imaginary too.
We don't even know who she is.

76
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,080
Have you talked since she said
she wanted to keep the baby?

77
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,000
No.

78
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,600
What for? So she can tell me
she wants my kidney too?

79
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,080
I'll pass. I need to move on.
I even have a new apartment!

80
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,640
Don't fall too in love with our place,
it's only temporary.

81
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,760
I'll throw a party every weekend.

82
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,200
I'm kidding. I'll be like a ghost.
You won't even hear me.

83
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,240
Third-degree burns
on the torso, arms, and face.

84
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,240
Oxygen saturation 90.
Hemodynamically unstable.

85
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,320
He's a prisoner?

86
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,240
Yes.

87
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,760
What's going on?

88
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,720
Uncuff him, please.

89
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,360
Take him to Resus.
Call Dr. Donoso. Let's go!

90
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,400
He's critical,
and Sorolla is still on strike.

91
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,800
-Why did you bring him here?
-There's a fire at the prison.

92
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,280
Hundreds injured.
We need all the hospitals.

93
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,040
Brace yourselves,
because more are on the way.

94
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,520
We need all available space!

95
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,480
Move as many patients
as possible to the floors

96
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,480
and discharge the least serious.

97
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,880
-Got it?
-Dr. Amaro.

98
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,440
-What is it?
-We need you.

99
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,320
Let me through, please.

100
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,400
Weak pulse.
Blood loss from a wound inflicted by…

101
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,160
Chicken bones.
Prisoners sharpen them into daggers.

102
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,600
I think it's a hemothorax.

103
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,440
-Should we take him to the OR?
-No time. He's lost too much blood.

104
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,960
-We'll take him to Resus. Let's go.
-Okay.

105
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,480
Make way, please!

106
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,800
Miguel!

107
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,760
You'll be okay. Help him, please!

108
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,800
We'll do everything we can.
Now let us work, please.

109
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,280
-Look out!
-Coming through!

110
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,800
-May, I need a FAST scan.
-Okay.

111
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,400
-How is he, Donoso?
-Sedated, intubated, and stable.

112
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,440
His uniform's melted onto his skin.
He needs surgery stat.

113
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,880
-The first free OR is yours.
-The second. This guy is worse.

114
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,800
This guy will die on the way to the OR.
We'll have to operate on him here.

115
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,040
Confirmed bilateral hemothorax.

116
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,400
Massive transfusion protocol.
Get four bags of O-neg.

117
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,320
-On it.
-Hurry.

118
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,440
Get two chest tubes ready.

119
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,400
-Scalpel.
-The blood.

120
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,360
-Is he okay? Will he be okay?
-What a pain.

121
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,240
-Son of a bitch!
-Sir.

122
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,960
-That bastard stabbed him!
-You can't be here.

123
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,320
-Let that bastard die!
-Calm down.

124
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,440
-Damn it.
-He's coding.

125
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,640
-1 mg of adrenaline.
-Ambu bag.

126
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,440
Biel, the connector.

127
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,520
Shit. Biel, compressions!

128
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,720
Come on.

129
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,760
Switch.

130
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,120
Switch.

131
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,520
Come on.

132
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,320
There. Sinus rhythm.

133
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,840
-Switch.
-Heimlich valve. Possible pneumothorax.

134
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,480
I need help, Dr. Amaro.

135
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,560
-Doctor, I've got three critical patients.
-Biel.

136
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,360
-Come on.
-Stop.

137
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,800
Stop, he's dead.

138
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,840
Help Dr. Donoso.

139
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,400
May, with me. Let's go.

140
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,600
Biel, I need your help here now.

141
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,400
Screw that son of a bitch!

142
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,360
Come on.

143
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,160
Doctor, if you don't come now,
there'll be disciplinary action.

144
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,400
Tube.

145
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,320
Time of death: 10:43 a.m.

146
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,120
Yes, have him call me urgently. Damn it.

147
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,400
-The prison, there was a fire.
-I know.

148
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,160
-Hugo's there.
-Calm down, Leo.

149
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,240
There was a riot.

150
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,000
-Should we go and find him?
-No, we can't go.

151
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,680
It makes no sense.
They can't tell us anything.

152
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,760
It must be one hell of a mess.
Don't worry, I'm sure he's fine.

153
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,840
-You're sure he's okay?
-Yes.

154
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,480
Breaking news
from Valencia's provincial prison,

155
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,800
where a serious fire has broken out.

156
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,240
More than 80 prisoners
are at Sorolla public hospital.

157
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,560
Hello? Hugo Jornet.
Yes, bring him to Sorolla.

158
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,120
Let's go. Quickly!

159
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,040
Take him to Resus!

160
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,840
Listen for a moment!

161
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,960
Silence, please! Quiet, please!

162
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,960
Listen to me!

163
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,360
The ER is completely swamped.

164
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,640
And more injured are still arriving.

165
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,120
Injured people who need your help.

166
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,480
The strike is dead and buried,
you know that as well as I do.

167
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,760
So now you have to decide
whether to sit back and let people die

168
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,960
or go in there and save lives.

169
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,760
-Come on.
-Let's do this.

170
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,560
One, two, and…

171
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,560
Please, clear the passage.

172
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,240
Porter, please.

173
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,880
Not like that, you animal!
You can't pierce burned skin.

174
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,120
-What are you doing here?
-Helping.

175
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,880
-Put the IV in his foot.
-Okay.

176
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,440
Stay in there, please.

177
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,720
One moment.

178
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,640
-Gurneys!
-Doctor, I'll take care of the bandages.

179
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,400
Doctor, over here, please.

180
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,200
Do you know where Hugo Jornet is?

181
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,120
-No.
-Leave it. Hugo!

182
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,560
Hugo!

183
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,280
-Hugo?
-Fuck.

184
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,680
Mom!

185
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,960
-Son.
-Why isn't he in an OR?

186
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,520
-They're all busy.
-Take him up. I'll handle it.

187
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,520
I've called the funeral home.
They're on their way.

188
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,320
What the hell were you doing?

189
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,880
When a superior gives you orders,
you follow them.

190
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,800
We let a guy die
to save the one who killed him.

191
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,320
That's not up to us.

192
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,960
We're doctors
and our job is to save lives.

193
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,840
-I don't know if I can do that.
-You'll have to.

194
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,240
When you put on your scrubs here,
you leave your feelings at home.

195
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,440
Yeah, you're really good at that.

196
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,440
Excuse me?

197
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,680
You can go, Dr. de Felipe.

198
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,600
I'm sure you're needed elsewhere.

199
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,680
You see, cancer cells
consume a large amount of energy.

200
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:53,240
These cells appear as dark circles.
You can easily see the new lesions.

201
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:59,040
As you can see, we've detected
new mets in the spine, lungs, and liver.

202
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,960
-The liver is the most--
-How long do I have?

203
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,880
It's best not to use those terms.
You need to focus on recovering.

204
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,720
Yeah, but how long do I have?

205
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,760
Seconds?

206
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,280
Days? Weeks?

207
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,760
Months? Years?

208
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,120
We're getting closer
to metastasis being a chronic condition.

209
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,360
It doesn't have to mean a death sentence.

210
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,160
-It's likely we can--
-Likely?

211
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,760
Only likely?

212
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,960
Don't lose hope, Mrs. Segura.

213
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,320
Shit.

214
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,120
Tell them to wait.

215
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,080
The president isn't in a position
to face him right now.

216
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,080
-Emilio.
-I'll get back to you, okay?

217
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,560
-Emilio, give it to me.
-She's in no shape.

218
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,480
Oh, God.

219
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,160
Okay.

220
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,120
What is it?

221
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,720
Nothing, we'll talk later.

222
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,240
-Are you feeling better?
-Tell me, damn it.

223
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,720
Thinking about something else
will do me good.

224
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,160
We just got a call from Ana Rovira's show.

225
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,480
Néstor has agreed to a debate with you,
and they want to do it tomorrow.

226
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,120
But that makes no sense.
He'd be walking into the lion's den.

227
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,760
-You think he's up to something?
-I doubt it.

228
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,680
Well, well…

229
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,600
Listen to me.

230
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,000
I can't refuse to go.

231
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,400
I've been accusing him
of not wanting to face me for days, so…

232
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,240
Get a move on, Jose.

233
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,600
I won't let you go to that debate unarmed.

234
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,200
What would I do without you?

235
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,680
It's no wonder you're like this.

236
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,920
That girl said
the sexiest word in the world to you.

237
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,280
What word?

238
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,280
"Pneumothorax"?

239
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,520
The sexiest word in the world is "no."

240
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,200
No.

241
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,040
Right.

242
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,400
-No.
-I'm going to.

243
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,480
You shouldn't be taking
that shit in front of me.

244
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,440
Especially not in your state, Patricia.

245
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,600
In my state? You've got a nerve.

246
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,120
My state… What would you know?
Don't judge me.

247
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,160
Don't judge me.

248
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,200
I'm not your typical cokehead politician.

249
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,440
It's been ages since I had a line. Ages!

250
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,360
And today, well,
I'm going to do whatever I want.

251
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,360
Whatever the hell I want.

252
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,960
Why did you call me?

253
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,800
Did someone tell you "no"?

254
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,400
They told me "yes."

255
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,720
Yes, I will live.

256
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,160
I have metastasis.

257
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,600
The doctor said I won't die.
That it's a chronic condition these days.

258
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,200
But I don't buy it.

259
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,520
What your doctor said is true.

260
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,520
You can live many years with cancer.

261
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,040
Biel, if I didn't believe that doctor,
who has much more experience than you,

262
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,600
you're not going to convince me either.

263
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,200
Right.

264
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,520
So why did you call me?

265
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,720
What do you want me to do? Tell me.

266
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,720
What can I do?

267
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,320
I called because I need
to know if Néstor's to blame.

268
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,680
If he hadn't abandoned me,
would I have metastasis right now?

269
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,680
Tell me.

270
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,880
Look, you don't have to believe me
when I tell you there's hope,

271
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,680
but in the surgery,
there was nothing more we could do.

272
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,560
Néstor may be to blame
for a lot of things,

273
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,320
but not your cancer.

274
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,600
Are you okay?

275
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,160
No.

276
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,720
No, it's easier to be angry.

277
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,560
Now I'm just scared.

278
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,680
God damn it.

279
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,120
What?

280
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,040
Don't look at me like that,
nothing happened.

281
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,800
Well, what a waste.
I brought you something.

282
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,160
A little something? What could it be?

283
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,760
Jeez, look at your face.

284
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,920
-Is this true?
-Read it.

285
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,960
Are you sure?

286
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,960
Absolutely.

287
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,360
It's a bombshell. Hiroshima-style.
Drop this and the war's over.

288
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,080
I don't know.

289
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,840
I don't know.
I'm not that desperate, Emilio.

290
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,080
All right.

291
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,480
Okay, but just think,
it's better to have it and not use it

292
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,240
than to have nothing against Néstor.

293
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,640
-What's this?
-The document you'll take to the judge.

294
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,040
It says you forged the rape report.
All you have to do is sign.

295
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,720
-Listen, Lluís, I was going to tell you--
-Don't even bother.

296
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,200
-At least let me explain.
-Explain what?

297
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,000
That you're completely insane?
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

298
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,320
-God knows how many times you've done it.
-Excuse me?

299
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,040
How many times
you've forged a rape report.

300
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,360
Knowing you, I bet it's quite a few.

301
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,160
-As many as I had to.
-Wow.

302
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,080
Yeah, because the system defends
the culprits more than the victims.

303
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,520
If a woman in shock
because she's just been raped washes

304
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,040
or has no injuries because she was
so terrified she didn't fight back,

305
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,000
it's not rape.

306
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,840
Because I go to trials
where they still ask you

307
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,680
what you were wearing
or if you closed your legs.

308
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,440
Who do you think you are?

309
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,440
You're a doctor,
nothing more, nothing less.

310
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,680
The same doctor as before
with the same values you used to like.

311
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,640
Since you swapped the scrubs
for the suit, you've forgotten.

312
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,560
Look.

313
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,640
Those values of yours
got our son into this mess.

314
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,920
So either you do it or I will,

315
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,920
but Hugo's not going back to jail.

316
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,320
You wanted to talk?

317
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,720
Yes.

318
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,960
I wanted to apologize.

319
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,040
I've been thinking about it and…

320
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,240
it was a shitty move
not to tell you about Lluís sooner.

321
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,320
So, I'm sorry.

322
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,240
So, in the end,
you and I did have something.

323
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,200
Don't push it. Work life is one thing,
and personal life is another.

324
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,560
And you really crossed a line yesterday.

325
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,240
How can you not care
that this bastard will live?

326
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,680
Because you take an oath
when you become a doctor.

327
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,760
The patient's health and life
will always be your first concern.

328
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,600
So?

329
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,320
Do we bury the hatchet?

330
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,240
Friends?

331
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,680
No.

332
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,560
What are you doing here?

333
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,320
I knew you had a blood test today.

334
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,640
Aurelio Muñoz, examination room four.

335
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,320
I sent you a voice message last night.

336
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,400
I blocked your number.

337
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,600
-Great.
-What?

338
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,080
Don't act all offended.

339
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,280
Every time I get close to you,
you push me away.

340
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,920
What the hell do you want, man?

341
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,840
Damn it, Óscar.

342
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,200
Jimena Blanco, examination room two.

343
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,680
The thing is…

344
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,160
Talking about this stuff
with a clear head…

345
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,880
I'm no good at it.

346
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,160
That's why I sent you a voice message.

347
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,080
-And I told you--
-Óscar Amaro.

348
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,280
It's my turn.

349
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,360
Manuel Climent, examination room one.

350
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,400
God damn it.

351
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,640
I always do the same thing.

352
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,160
How is he?

353
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,880
The supportive care is working.

354
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,880
He's resting now.

355
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,280
I'll tell the judge the truth,
but I want to talk to him first.

356
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,720
Let me know if you get dizzy.
We need to get quite a few tubes.

357
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,640
Make a fist.

358
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,480
There. Okay, clench it a little bit.

359
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,640
Hey.

360
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:48,200
So, I've had three or four drinks.
Well, maybe it was five, I don't know.

361
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,640
And I had an orange pill
in my pocket, so I took that too.

362
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,760
And I'm fine, okay?
I'm fine, but the thing is…

363
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,640
Well, I'm a bit high, I guess.

364
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,880
I'm here thinking
about everything, and I think that…

365
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,520
Man, in life…

366
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,160
We have to take risks in life.
We have to be brave, Óscar.

367
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,280
And…

368
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,320
I like you.

369
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,080
Wait, I'm tripping right now.

370
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,800
Look, I don't care anymore!

371
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,040
I don't care about your mom.

372
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,080
I don't care that you're 19.

373
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,600
I… If you want to be with me,

374
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,200
I want to be with you.

375
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,880
So yeah, that's it, screw it.
I've said it, to hell with it.

376
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,160
Let me know
when you get this message, handsome.

377
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,160
Lots of love.

378
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,280
-What are you doing here?
-You're an ass.

379
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,760
I wanted to kiss you so bad.

380
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,600
Rocío, got a moment?

381
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,480
Look out, the Arab girl looks angry.

382
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,120
Antonio, don't upset me.

383
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,960
The scalpel might slip
and cut off your balls.

384
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,920
What's up?

385
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,960
"What's up?"

386
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,480
Are you kidding me?
Your lawyer called me, that's what's up.

387
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,960
Shit.

388
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,280
Can we talk outside, please?

389
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,000
I'll be right back.

390
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,800
-Sorry, I told him not to call.
-Okay.

391
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,000
Did you tell him not to threaten me?

392
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,160
He said he'll take my baby
for putting her at risk.

393
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,320
Is that not true?

394
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,680
I know you almost lost her, May.

395
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,400
-Who told you that?
-That's not the point.

396
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,320
You should be resting
and you're here working overtime.

397
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,720
You're carrying the baby
and won't answer my calls.

398
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,000
I don't know how you are.
You're scaring me, girl.

399
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,840
She's my baby too.

400
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,320
You can hate me all you want,
but it's not the baby's fault.

401
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,840
All right.

402
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,080
I hope your lawyer's good,
because mine's going to be the bomb.

403
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,360
-Hugo, it's okay.
-Mom?

404
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,080
Don't move. It's okay.

405
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,640
How are you feeling, son?

406
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,760
Fine. What happened to me?

407
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,480
You had emergency surgery
for a fractured kneecap.

408
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,320
It's all fixed now.
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

409
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:28,400
Son, you know it was me
who examined Joana, right?

410
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,640
Yes.

411
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,320
When I examined her,

412
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,360
she didn't have any injuries,
abrasions, or anything else that…

413
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:50,840
that would indicate
that the intercourse had been forced.

414
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,720
So?

415
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,400
I said that there were.
I was convinced it was a rape.

416
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,560
I swear I didn't know
it was you she'd slept with.

417
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,880
I didn't have your version.
All I knew was what she told me.

418
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,200
I'm so sorry, son.

419
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,120
I'm sorry you've been through all this.

420
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,360
Why didn't you say before?

421
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,360
Well, it's complicated, because…

422
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,760
Will something happen to you
for forging the evidence?

423
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,520
Hugo, don't worry about that.

424
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,080
What matters is
that you won't go back to jail.

425
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,040
Mom, will something happen?

426
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,560
-Your mom will talk to the judge.
-Dad, stop.

427
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,120
She'll face
the consequences of her actions.

428
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,080
Dad, enough.

429
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,040
It's not Mom's fault.

430
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,640
It's my fault.

431
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,520
Why do you say that?

432
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,960
She asked me to stop.

433
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,320
And I didn't.

434
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,560
It's okay, Hugo.

435
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,400
-All set.
-Thank you.

436
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,320
No problem.

437
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,280
We've asked for the first question
to be about the deaths.

438
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,080
There have already been 20.
He'll come up with…

439
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,680
Look, there he is.

440
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,440
…a much smaller figure.
Twenty deaths, in case…

441
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,840
Heads up, folks. We're on in five.

442
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,320
I don't know, that figure…
in case he makes something up, is 20.

443
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,200
-Ready? We're on in a few minutes.
-Great.

444
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,400
-Shall we?
-Okay.

445
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,400
Don't forget this.
Use it when you need to.

446
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,360
All set.

447
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,600
Good afternoon.
Welcome to a very special program.

448
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,880
A program dedicated
to a debate on the healthcare crisis.

449
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,520
I'll get straight to the point, Doctor.

450
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,440
How many people have died
because of your strike?

451
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,040
Twenty.

452
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,760
So you're admitting
that you've allowed 20 people to die?

453
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,680
No, 20 is the number
of patients who have died

454
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,400
during the time you call "my strike,"

455
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,320
which it's not.

456
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,000
-Well, you are the leader--
-20 isn't a high figure.

457
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,360
Not for all the hospitals in Valencia.

458
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:27,600
In fact, we unfortunately lose
more patients due to late diagnoses,

459
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,000
lack of equipment, and understaffing:
the issues denounced in the strike.

460
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,560
Most of which are caused
by Mrs. Segura's insistence

461
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,200
on privatizing our public health system.

462
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,160
First of all, let me clarify
that what this government proposes

463
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,760
isn't privatization, it's outsourcing.

464
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,000
-Same difference.
-They're two very different things.

465
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,040
A mixed model
with quality public healthcare,

466
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,560
managed more efficiently.

467
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,920
And don't worry,
no one will need their credit card.

468
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,440
Then what are the co-pays?

469
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,840
In this case, it means patients
would pay a regulated price.

470
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,640
Like any other service.

471
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,480
Like any other business model.

472
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,200
The system as it stands is unsustainable.

473
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,120
Exactly.

474
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,680
-So let's fix it, not destroy it.
-You're proving me right.

475
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,440
I'm proposing modernization,

476
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,400
so everyone can get prescriptions,
blood test results, on their phones,

477
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,120
without having to crowd
at hospital doors unnecessarily.

478
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,080
Sounds wonderful.

479
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:33,160
I've said it a thousand times,
and I won't get tired of saying it:

480
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,480
more satisfied patients.

481
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,520
What do private providers
do with serious cases?

482
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,960
-Tell me.
-Refer them to the public system.

483
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,680
There's not one study
that shows that in Spain

484
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,520
the model you propose
is more efficient or economical.

485
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,600
-That's not true.
-You talk about satisfied patients…

486
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,720
Let him speak.

487
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:55,080
Only entrepreneurs will be satisfied,
getting rich off everyone's health.

488
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,840
-And at the expense of public funds.
-It's unbelievable.

489
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,560
-He's a demagogue. Sorry.
-You talk about satisfied patients.

490
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,960
Unfortunately, I've experienced firsthand
what it's like to be treated by you.

491
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,920
The people of Valencia
know what I'm talking about,

492
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,520
so don't have the nerve
to show up here and ask them to trust you.

493
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,880
Dr. Moa, do you have anything to add?

494
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,040
I know that many of you
don't trust me right now,

495
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,720
and you don't have to,

496
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:27,320
but please, trust your family doctor,
who's been treating you for years.

497
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,600
Trust your nurse, who eases your pain.

498
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,440
Listen to the hundreds
of healthcare professionals

499
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,840
who have agreed to stop, to say "enough,"
not to earn more money or to work less,

500
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,960
but for the sake of the people
who despise them right now.

501
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,000
-Well said.
-Yes.

502
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,920
Well said.

503
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,040
Mrs. Segura, anything to say
to Dr. Moa about this?

504
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,760
Mrs. Segura, please.

505
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,080
Honestly, no. For someone
with such a low opinion of us,

506
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,600
your speech was worthy
of the worst politician.

507
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,520
One moment, please.

508
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,120
Five-minute commercial break.

509
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,960
All the latest news when we return.
Don't miss it. Thank you very much.

510
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,600
And we're off. Good job, guys.

511
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,560
-She's a real piece of work.
-I can't watch any more of this shit.

512
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,040
I'll grab a coffee. Want one?

513
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,440
-No, thanks.
-You sure?

514
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,360
Hey, isn't that the doctor from TV?
The one from the strike?

515
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,520
-I think so.
-Damn!

516
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,640
Excuse me.

517
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,360
-Buddy.
-One thing. Excuse me.

518
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,800
Sorry, just one thing. Listen.

519
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,080
You stay away from Segura. Got it?

520
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,080
It really bugs you.

521
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,160
Getting put in your place
really bugs you reds, huh?

522
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,800
If you like the president so much,
let her treat you at the hospital.

523
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,520
-Then send you the bill, brats.
-"Brats"!

524
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,280
-Who are you calling "brats"?
-What are you doing?

525
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,840
You asked for it.

526
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,200
Stop!

527
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,040
Let's see who treats you now, asshole.

528
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,080
-Hey, guys, come on!
-Let's go!

529
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,200
Want some water?

530
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,920
The unions heard what happened.

531
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,040
They called an emergency meeting.

532
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,760
They all voted in favor
of calling off the strike.

533
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,000
And you came to rub it in?

534
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,680
I came to ask a favor.

535
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,080
Right… I'm not sure we're in a position
to be doing each other favors right now.

536
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,240
I did you one in the debate
by not mentioning your wife.

537
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,960
You know nothing about my wife.

538
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,880
I know she died of cancer.

539
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,000
That you couldn't save her.

540
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,920
And you were accused of euthanasia.

541
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,440
I was acquitted.

542
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,160
If I'd said what I know,
I would've ruined your life.

543
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,560
And I didn't.

544
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,240
Why?

545
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,720
I have metastasis.

546
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:59,120
The private oncologist doesn't dare
tell me how long I have to live.

547
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:10,040
But I've seen the odds
and only 10% survive five years.

548
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,000
Five years.

549
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,800
You're an asshole, but everyone says
you're the best oncologist in Spain.

550
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,960
So tell me.

551
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,000
Tell me, please.

552
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,680
Is it worth it to keep fighting?

553
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,800
What were the odds
that a 42-year-old woman…

554
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,720
from a working-class family,
with no political connections,

555
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,160
would be president
of the Region of Valencia?

556
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,160
What's your point?

557
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,240
The odds don't apply to you.

558
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,400
If you say you can help me,
I'll give it all up.

559
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,720
I'll do whatever you ask.

560
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,920
I'll put my life in your hands.

561
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,760
Tell me, Néstor.

562
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,760
Can you save my life?

563
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,840
Can you save my life?

564
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,840
