1
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,080
The weather phenomenon
known as the cold drop…

2
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,440
In 24 hours, it has rained more than…

3
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,520
-We can see 10 lightning bolts per…
-400 liters per…

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,240
Torrential rain over a short…

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,160
We are facing…

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,080
JOAQUÍN SOROLLA HOSPITAL

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,240
Is this cold drop really that bad?
It seems a bit exaggerated to me.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,800
You've never seen one before,
and with climate change, it's worse.

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,760
Biel, I'm from Galicia.
I'm not afraid of the rain.

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,080
A little light rain throughout the day

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,840
isn't the same
as 400 liters in three hours.

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,200
-Thanks.
-No worries.

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,800
The city shuts down,
there are flash floods…

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,200
-Six people died last time.
-Seriously?

15
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,440
A huge storm is heading
at full speed towards Valencia. Experts…

16
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,040
Don't freak out,
maybe it won't be so bad this year.

17
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,600
In the last storm…

18
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,800
Shit, I'm late.

19
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,080
…of this magnitude,
two people died and 53 were injured.

20
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,720
The city council advises
all citizens to stay at home,

21
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,840
and if they must go out,
to exercise extreme caution.

22
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,960
BREATHLESS

23
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,360
If there's a blackout,
prioritize essential equipment.

24
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,120
We can't overload the generators.

25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,520
Pilar, cancel non-urgent surgeries.

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,320
There's nowhere to do them anyway.

27
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,560
Like every time it rains,
two of the ORs have leaks.

28
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,240
Will they be fixed,
or should I get buckets?

29
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,880
Blanca, tell the interns
to get ready to help out in the ER.

30
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,080
-I'm on it.
-Better safe than sorry.

31
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,800
Lluís, is it true they've stopped
the privatization of Sorolla?

32
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,480
-Not officially, but it seems that way.
-They're scared we'll go on strike again.

33
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,640
I don't know about that,
but thank God it's been stopped.

34
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,320
All clear, folks?

35
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,920
Let's get to work.

36
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,160
Jésica, if you don't mind,
I'd like to talk to you for a moment.

37
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,480
After you.

38
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,200
What do you want to talk about?

39
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,800
I was wondering if you'd made
a decision on my proposal last night.

40
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,040
Considering I asked
for a few days to think about it

41
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,240
and it hasn't even been 24 hours…

42
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,960
True.

43
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,560
What's with you?
Do storms turn you on or what?

44
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,680
Well, we could use it
as an excuse to stay locked up in here

45
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,040
so I can help you make up your mind.

46
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,920
Know what the problem is?

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,280
-What?
-They'd know what we're up to.

48
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,320
Because just a moment ago,
my boss sent me to help out in the ER.

49
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,960
Yeah, that's also true.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,040
Why are you in such a good mood?

51
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,440
No reason. I'm just happy to be with you.

52
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,040
-Listen, please.
-Excuse me.

53
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,040
There, and in the other room…

54
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,040
We've got a family trapped in a car.

55
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,640
Sorry, I had to pass through the floor,
everything's a mess.

56
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,040
I was just about
to tell Patricia her CT results.

57
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,320
We'll start with the good news.

58
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,160
The mets in the lungs and spine
have shrunk significantly.

59
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,440
And the bad news?

60
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,000
The one in the liver has grown.

61
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,960
The chemo's not working on that one.

62
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,080
But it's okay, right?

63
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,920
I mean, knowing you,
you must have a ton of backup plans.

64
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,520
We only have two.

65
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,240
We can operate on the liver tumor,

66
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,280
but it's a very tricky surgery.

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,080
Okay, and what's the other option?

68
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,120
There's a new experimental chemotherapy
showing great results with these tumors.

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,080
The downside is
that it's experimental and expensive,

70
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,760
and there are
very strict eligibility criteria.

71
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,360
And these very strict criteria

72
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,520
were set by my government.

73
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,240
Amazing.

74
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,360
In the end, I'm going to die
because of my own health policies.

75
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,800
Poetic justice, right?

76
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,480
There's no justice here, Patricia.

77
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,560
If you say yes, I'll start making calls.

78
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,040
I have contacts
and I can speed up the process.

79
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,600
-I want you to stay in the hospital.
-No.

80
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,200
Please, at least
until the cold drop's over.

81
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,680
If anything happens,
I don't want you isolated.

82
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,640
Bring the buckets here!

83
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,120
-Hey!
-What are you doing here?

84
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,000
-Is something wrong?
-No, I just wanted to see you.

85
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,800
Óscar, you're insane.

86
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,040
Your mom already banned me from the OR.
If she sees us, she'll have me fired.

87
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,960
Yeah, but since
we left things on bad terms,

88
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,520
I wanted to surprise you.

89
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,160
What's wrong with you?

90
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,720
Are you high?

91
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,320
What do you care?

92
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,520
Don't act like a saint now.

93
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,160
-You were high when you said you liked me.
-I control it, you don't.

94
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,200
First you shoot up meow meow at home,

95
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,520
now you show up here high
in the middle of a goddamn storm.

96
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,680
This isn't normal.

97
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,840
I already have my mom to judge me.

98
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,200
I don't need more hypocrites.

99
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,480
Óscar, wait.

100
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,800
Óscar, wait a moment!

101
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,360
Óscar! Where are you going?

102
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,960
Shit.

103
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,800
30-year-old female, rescued from her car.

104
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,400
Semiconscious, sats around 90…

105
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,160
-Rocío, Germán.
-35-year-old male.

106
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,480
Conscious, but with multiple fractures.

107
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,520
Ten-year-old boy.
Semiconscious, compromised airway.

108
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,920
-Progressively worsening.
-Take the woman and boy to Resus.

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,960
See to the man.

110
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,080
-Let's go!
-Sorry.

111
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,720
Suction!

112
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,640
I'm on it.

113
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,760
It looks like plant debris,
but I can't get it out.

114
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,960
Intubation forceps.

115
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,840
I see something, but I can't reach it.

116
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,600
-Jésica, hurry, he's dying.
-I know, but I can't see.

117
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,520
He's unstable. The oxygen isn't helping.

118
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,440
I can't intubate him. He's going to crash.

119
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,120
Okay, I got it.

120
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,800
Should we call ENT to do a crike?

121
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,160
There's no time.
What should we do, Dr. Román?

122
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,720
-No idea, I'm an Anesthesia intern.
-Think.

123
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,280
That's why you're here.

124
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,200
He's coding!

125
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,400
-Endotracheal intubation!
-Do it, hurry!

126
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,120
Thirty.

127
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,760
1 mg of adrenaline!

128
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,720
Going again.

129
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,040
Go in at a 90-degree angle
or you'll damage the vocal cords.

130
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,000
Thirty.

131
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,320
-What the hell?
-What's going on?

132
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,440
Oh my God!

133
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,840
Don't worry,
the generators will turn on soon.

134
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,560
-Come on.
-Did she say 90?

135
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,840
-Yes, 90 degrees.
-Okay.

136
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,560
You got this.

137
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,480
-That's it.
-Okay.

138
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,800
-The milligram of adrenaline!
-Here!

139
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,280
One milligram of adrenaline going in.

140
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,480
Thirty!

141
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,640
Sats are rising
and heart rate is stabilizing.

142
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,200
Quique, well done.

143
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,360
You did a great job. Congratulations.

144
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,920
-Need me to take over?
-Yes, switch, please.

145
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,120
Switch.

146
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,520
Emilio, how many versions
of the press release do you need to relax?

147
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,080
As many as it takes for those vultures
not to suspect why you're here.

148
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:44,480
Look, we'll say you've come to personally
supervise the cold-drop protocol.

149
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,560
No one will believe that.

150
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,480
Can you give us a moment alone, please?

151
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,400
-Thanks.
-No problem.

152
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,480
They think I'm too sick
to waste the treatment on me.

153
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,640
We still have the surgical option.

154
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,280
The one you said was risky?

155
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,880
It will be fine.

156
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,480
I'll operate on you myself.

157
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,040
You have such an ego.

158
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,040
You think telling me that
will reassure me?

159
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,920
The ego comes with the job.
But I'm not bluffing.

160
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,000
You'll make it through.

161
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,920
You hear me, Patricia?

162
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,480
Excuse me.

163
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,040
I just wanted to confirm with Dr. Moa
about your surgery, Mrs. Segura.

164
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,120
Yes, we were just talking about it.

165
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,720
We should schedule it for next week.

166
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,280
Okay, I'll check and let you know.

167
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,920
This cold drop is
of monumental proportions.

168
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,560
It's a storm that's formed…

169
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,200
It's the front of the cold drop.

170
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,240
Look, it's taking out cars
and trees outside the hospital.

171
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,280
It's not normal.

172
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,680
-Hey, what's going on?
-Nothing, everything's fine.

173
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,120
-It's under control.
-Haven't you seen the news?

174
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,840
-Yes, I've seen it.
-"Under control," she says.

175
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,520
-Can you get the results today?
-I'll try, but no promises.

176
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,280
-Look at the mess we're in!
-Yeah, but…

177
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,960
-Leo, do you have a moment?
-What are you doing here in this weather?

178
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,000
You can see your patients via video call.

179
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,480
Honestly? I came to see you.
I wanted to talk in person.

180
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,160
Come on.

181
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,600
Please don't get angry
until I've told you everything, okay?

182
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,000
Why would I get angry?

183
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,000
I've been treating Joana Martorell.

184
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,000
I couldn't bring myself
to talk to you about it.

185
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,280
I didn't want to involve our friendship.

186
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,040
-That girl needed my help.
-I needed your help.

187
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,520
Me.

188
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,720
And I'm going to help you, okay?

189
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,080
Joana doesn't want to go to trial.
She doesn't want to relive everything.

190
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,480
What does she want?

191
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,440
For Hugo to plead guilty.

192
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,000
If he does, she'll make a deal
with the DA to get him out of jail.

193
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,800
Tell me one thing.

194
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,720
Didn't you realize what would happen?

195
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,560
This could've ended up with you
in court testifying against my son.

196
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,680
Yes.

197
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,480
Go to hell.

198
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,520
Oriol, change those buckets, they're full.

199
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,040
-Germán.
-Yes?

200
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,360
Get me two buckets. One here.

201
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,160
My God, look at this mess.

202
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,680
Another one here.

203
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,800
I'm sure there are others I've missed.

204
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,200
-Figure it out.
-Okay.

205
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,520
How are you feeling? Better?

206
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,720
Shit.

207
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,000
Hi, how's it going?

208
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,920
Manu's doing okay.

209
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,560
He has a gash on his head
and a few cuts on his forearm.

210
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,240
Let me take a look.

211
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,680
What happened?

212
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,480
I don't remember anything.

213
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,680
Just that I was running for the bus.

214
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,880
The last thing I remember
is that it started raining.

215
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,560
Can I go home now?

216
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,920
I'd like to take a look
at the cuts on your arm first.

217
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,960
Sure.

218
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,520
Have you struggled with anxiety?

219
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,680
Because those scars worry me a little.

220
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,680
It's nothing.
I did it as a kid, I'm fine now.

221
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,000
-If you need help, upstairs--
-No, I said I'm fine. Thanks.

222
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,240
I didn't do anything bad, okay?

223
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,000
I just want to go home.

224
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,480
-Do you know what we'll do?
-Don't worry.

225
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,240
Keep you in for observation
to make sure that head injury's nothing.

226
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,680
Okay? We'll clean and dress the wound.

227
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,920
-Then you can go.
-Okay.

228
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
See you soon.

229
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,840
Manu, keep applying
pressure to the wound, please.

230
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,040
-Does it hurt?
-Yes.

231
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,360
-If I plead guilty, I can't be a teacher.
-Will you listen?

232
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,560
-You'll choose another career.
-It's that easy, huh?

233
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,840
-Fucking great!
-None of this is easy.

234
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,640
I'm in final year. It's my dream!

235
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,400
You're lucky to even have this chance.
You'd rather go back to jail?

236
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,960
-Everyone will think I raped her!
-You did!

237
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,320
The sooner we accept it, the better.

238
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,480
We don't know
that it was a suicide attempt.

239
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,600
Yeah, but he has a history.

240
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,560
He went out
in the worst storm of the year.

241
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,800
Thanks.

242
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,960
He can't explain why he passed out.

243
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,080
I think it's a bit suspicious.

244
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,520
And I think he reminds you of Rodri.

245
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,040
If we call Psychiatry, they'll keep him
under observation for at least 48 hours.

246
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,520
We'll give his family a hell of a scare.

247
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,840
I think it's best if he stays in the ER
and we keep an eye on him ourselves.

248
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,320
It's not like he can go anywhere.

249
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,680
Yeah, you're right.

250
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,600
Maybe I'm scared of reliving all that shit

251
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,200
and I'm seeing ghosts
where there aren't any.

252
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,360
I don't know.

253
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,920
You seem very tense.

254
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,280
And I'm very good at relaxing you.

255
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,360
-You know that.
-You're so full of yourself!

256
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,520
I'm coming.

257
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,960
I love you.

258
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,720
Sorry.

259
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,080
No.

260
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,040
Sorry, I'll say anything when I'm coming.

261
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,840
-You've never said that before.
-Yeah.

262
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,520
Forget it, okay?

263
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,400
Pretend I never said it.
I know what you're like.

264
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,800
SANTA ANA CLINIC

265
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,320
Patricia.

266
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,000
Hi, how are you feeling?

267
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,240
I'm riding out the cold drop
in the hospital, Jaume.

268
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,000
Sorry to insist, but what
are you doing at a public hospital?

269
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,440
You know we'd look after you at Santa Ana.

270
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,600
What did you want?

271
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,000
That's my girl, always direct.

272
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,080
Well, a little bird told me
you weren't doing so well,

273
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,280
and I wanted to make a proposal.

274
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,560
Was that little bird Emilio,
by any chance?

275
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,640
Don't be mad at him.
He called because he's worried.

276
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,640
-I'm going to kill him.
-Look on the bright side.

277
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,000
He told the only person who can help.

278
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,080
Patricia, I can get you
that experimental treatment you need.

279
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,520
I know people who work
in the lab that manufactures it.

280
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,280
How much does it cost?

281
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,280
Patricia, it isn't about money with us.

282
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,280
Look, wise guy,
I won't act corruptly with my illness.

283
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,600
I'd rather have surgery.

284
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,160
Patricia, that surgery,
aside from how dangerous it is,

285
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,120
won't necessarily solve
the root of the problem.

286
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,720
It might give you a few months,

287
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,160
but that treatment,

288
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,080
that chemotherapy, could cure your cancer.

289
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,840
And what do you want
in return for your selfless help?

290
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,640
I heard you're going
to start privatizing soon.

291
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,880
All I ask is that if, at some point,
you're looking for someone

292
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,240
to manage
the public hospitals in Valencia…

293
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,240
you'll think of me.

294
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,360
All right.

295
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,320
We'll talk soon.

296
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,600
All right. Talk soon.

297
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,920
Take care, okay?

298
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,280
Take these cribs to the NICU
and get the Ambu bags ready just in case.

299
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,440
-Yes, Doctor.
-Leo.

300
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,760
Well, it's done.
Hugo's going to plead guilty.

301
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,160
Okay.

302
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,640
Did you hear me?

303
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,440
You really don't care?
Damn, you're unbelievable.

304
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,920
It must be so easy for you to judge us all

305
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,640
from your moral high ground
where everything's black-and-white.

306
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,720
Sometimes, there are no gray areas.
I've been fighting for that all my life.

307
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,880
Do I stop just because he's my son?

308
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,560
-He's your son, not a stranger!
-You know how much I love him.

309
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,520
This is tearing me apart.

310
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,480
I'll help him in any way I can,

311
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,560
but I can't tell him
what he did isn't wrong.

312
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,080
Look.

313
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,080
From now on, I think it's best
if you stay away from Hugo.

314
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,560
-Excuse me?
-You're no good for him.

315
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,000
And when all this is settled,
he's coming to live with me.

316
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,160
What's up, cutie pie?

317
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,600
May, it's normal that you're stressed.

318
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,160
-Damn it.
-Take it easy.

319
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,480
First the labor, now the mastitis.
These hospital walls are closing in on me.

320
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,720
-Such a tiny little thing.
-Yes.

321
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,480
Why are you so happy?

322
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,480
Me?

323
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,280
Why do you think?
For you, the baby, the miracle of life.

324
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,640
I think your miracle of life
is almost asleep.

325
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,000
If she wakes up, I'll take her partying.

326
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,200
-Shut up.
-Be quiet.

327
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,800
Come on then, tell me some grown-up stuff.

328
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,320
-There's not much to tell.
-Like hell there isn't!

329
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,640
The crazy party your boyfriend
threw at home the other day?

330
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,800
Seriously, nothing's changed?
I don't believe it.

331
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,560
I don't know what to do.

332
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,480
Maybe I'm overreacting
and it was a one-time thing.

333
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,680
Quique, with this whole
Romeo and Juliet thing…

334
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,840
-You don't actually know him.
-Yeah.

335
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,280
The guy might have
an obvious drug problem.

336
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,840
We'd better go. Things are a mess.

337
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,800
I'll stop by later, okay?

338
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,120
Bye.

339
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,400
-Can I see her? I--
-I'd rather you left, okay?

340
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,640
-May, please.
-You can talk to my lawyer.

341
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,400
May, she's my daughter too.

342
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,560
-I haven't held her.
-Get out.

343
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,200
May, I'll do whatever you want, really.

344
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,080
I'll give you custody,
if that's what you want.

345
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,960
But please, don't take her to Germany.

346
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,480
-Not Germany.
-Now you know how screwed up it is.

347
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,200
May, please.

348
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,160
This isn't you, you're not cruel.

349
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,200
-She doesn't deserve it.
-Get out.

350
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,240
-I'm begging you.
-Rocío, please, go.

351
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,680
Get out!

352
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,440
I don't know, maybe you're right.

353
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,200
Should I message him?

354
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,080
Yeah, I'll message him.

355
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,640
-Thanks, Silvia.
-No problem.

356
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,760
CAN WE TALK?

357
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,320
LATER

358
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,680
What the hell?

359
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,400
He's going to a chemsex party
in this storm. Look.

360
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,640
Jesus, Quique, the kid's insane.

361
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,120
You have to do something.

362
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,560
-We'll talk later, okay?
-Okay.

363
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,080
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

364
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,120
For fuck's sake.

365
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:07,080
I'M GOING PARTYING,
I DON'T WANT TO THINK RIGHT NOW.

366
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,560
Dr. Amaro.

367
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,400
-I need to talk to you for a moment.
-I don't have time right now.

368
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,400
It's about Óscar.

369
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,120
Nice job staying dry, huh?
Next time, I'll bring water wings.

370
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,800
Unless we all help,
we'll be swimming out of here.

371
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,000
Let's see how Manu's doing?

372
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,000
Stop looking at me like that
or I'll call security.

373
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,640
Like what?

374
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,120
-Manu.
-Manu, are you okay?

375
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,840
-Yes, it's nothing.
-What do you mean?

376
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,120
-When did it start?
-What did you take?

377
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,680
-Leave me alone!
-Take it easy.

378
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,960
Help!

379
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,760
-Upper GI bleed in bay 18!
-Help, please!

380
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:18,080
Maybe he swallowed something in the ER
or something he took before is kicking in.

381
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,520
Don't beat yourself up.

382
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,640
According to his file,
he'd been discharged and was fine.

383
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,080
We did the right thing.

384
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,960
What's that?

385
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,240
It's…

386
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,760
-Is it two razor blades?
-You've got to be kidding me.

387
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,720
He's not answering, damn it!

388
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,840
-Didn't he say where it was?
-It could be anywhere.

389
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,520
Who would throw a chemsex party
or whatever the hell it's called

390
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,680
in the middle of a storm like this?

391
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,160
I don't know.

392
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,720
I'm sorry, if I'd known,
I would've done things…

393
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,880
Don't flatter yourself,
this has nothing to do with you.

394
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,840
What Óscar's doing
has nothing to do with you.

395
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,840
What?

396
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:16,120
I've insisted on blaming you
for everything and it's not fair.

397
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,920
He's done this before.

398
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,960
When he was 15.

399
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,040
Óscar's always had problems,
you know? Always.

400
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,120
He pretends he isn't,
but he's full of insecurities.

401
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,680
And the only way he's found
of masking them is with drugs.

402
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,640
He almost died in my arms, you know?

403
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,160
From an overdose.

404
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,320
I didn't think he'd be able to stop using,
but, in the end, he did.

405
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,480
He managed to live a normal life.

406
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,640
Until now. What am I doing talking to you?

407
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,840
-I have to find him. Let me go!
-No, we can't go out now.

408
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,720
-Get out of my way!
-We don't know where he is.

409
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,080
Pilar.

410
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,920
I care about Óscar too.

411
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,880
A lot.

412
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,560
But wandering around
in the middle of a storm won't help him.

413
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,320
Where's Emilio?

414
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,600
He was grumbling,
so I sent him into the hall.

415
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,240
I'm not feeling well, I'm dizzy.

416
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,760
I'll call someone to check your BP.

417
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,760
I look like a monster.

418
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,600
You look like a badass to me.

419
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,360
Cancer tends to bring out
the worst and the best of people.

420
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,600
I like what's coming out of you.

421
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,160
A lot.

422
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,880
No one could like me like this.

423
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,600
Well,

424
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,920
I have strange taste.

425
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,640
You're an idiot.

426
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,400
I don't want the surgery.

427
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,080
Why not?

428
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,320
If I have six months to live,
I'd rather not be in pain.

429
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,320
-You can't give up now.
-Yeah.

430
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,240
You really do have a chance.

431
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,200
You hear me?

432
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,880
We're going to make it.

433
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,360
It's just that…

434
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:53,200
Well, it's funny, isn't it?
It's ironic that a man…

435
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,520
a healthy man like you…

436
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,760
is trying to convince…

437
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:07,240
a dying woman,
when you don't seem to want to live.

438
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,840
Why do you say
I don't seem to want to live?

439
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,920
Because your wife died…
five years ago, right?

440
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,160
And you haven't been with anyone since.

441
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,880
Well…

442
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:31,240
Not being with anyone doesn't mean
I haven't felt anything for anyone.

443
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,760
Have you? For who?

444
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,080
Patricia.

445
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,360
Patricia!

446
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,280
Patricia!

447
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,320
Let's go.

448
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,400
What's going on?

449
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,560
You passed out.
We think your liver tumor is bleeding.

450
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,560
Patricia, fight.

451
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,080
You hear me? Fight.

452
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,760
How desperate must you be
to swallow two razor blades?

453
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,480
Jésica. Don't worry,
you're going to save him.

454
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,720
Hurry, his stomach's being perforated.

455
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,840
Dr. De Felipe.

456
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,880
Dr. Moa is asking for you.

457
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,280
-I'm busy right now.
-It's Mrs. Segura.

458
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,880
She's having surgery.
He thought you'd want to assist.

459
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,200
Go, I'll handle this.

460
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,200
Let's continue.
He's going to bleed a lot. Sponges.

461
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,640
What happened?

462
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,040
Liver hemorrhage caused by the metastasis.
Stand opposite me and give me a hand.

463
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,480
Scalpel.

464
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,560
Forceps.

465
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,080
Retractor.

466
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,400
Rochester-Pean forceps.

467
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,440
Sponges. Give me sponges.

468
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,520
He's losing so much blood.

469
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,800
-I don't know why.
-More sponges.

470
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,280
I can't see anything, it's full of blood.

471
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,360
Blood pressure dropping.
Heart rate rising.

472
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,040
I need you to clear the field.

473
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,680
I need to see the stomach
to remove the blades.

474
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,600
More sponges.

475
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,680
What's happening?

476
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,480
-Doctor, what's happening?
-Someone go fix that.

477
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,240
Nothing.

478
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,000
-What's happening?
-We don't know.

479
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,680
-Call maintenance!
-On it.

480
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,320
Please, help!

481
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,120
Help!

482
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,040
The power's out.

483
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,600
-I can't see.
-Okay. Calm down, please.

484
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,680
We need light.

485
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,120
Cell phones, quickly!

486
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,040
I need light. Use cell phones,
flashlights, whatever you can find.

487
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,760
He's losing so much blood.
I need light, now!

488
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:01,400
Aren't the generators going to turn on?
Calm down, everything's fine!

489
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,280
Sit down and wait.
It will be fixed right away.

490
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,400
Quickly, please!

491
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,240
Néstor, what do we do? Close?

492
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,960
If we close now, she'll die.

493
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,320
We have to continue.

494
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,920
Doctor, the vitals monitor
is working for now.

495
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,880
The battery has two hours left.

496
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,360
Then we have two hours
to successfully finish this surgery.

497
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,280
-Can you keep her under?
-I can bag her.

498
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,240
-And give her propofol by eye.
-Do it.

499
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,200
Biel, we've lost the electric scalpel.
We have to suture the bleeding vessels.

500
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,000
-I'm not a surgeon.
-You volunteered in Sudan, right?

501
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,360
This isn't so different.

502
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,720
Mikel, run to the ENT OR
and get some headlights. Hurry!

503
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,000
-Calm down, please!
-Blanca, what's going on?

504
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,840
-I don't know.
-Find out, please.

505
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,600
I'm on it. Calm down.
Everything's fine, really.

506
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,000
We'll fix it in a moment.

507
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,560
Lluís!

508
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,840
-The generators?
-Broken.

509
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,280
Weren't they just serviced?

510
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,600
With the cutbacks, it was that
or lose the new MRI machine.

511
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,960
I didn't have much choice.
Not a word about this, please.

512
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,680
Sponges. He's losing so much blood.

513
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,560
-How many units now?
-Five.

514
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,520
Five? He's losing blood
faster than we can replace it.

515
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,960
Clear the stomach.
We have to get them out.

516
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,160
Retractor.

517
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,120
2/0 silk sutures.

518
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,840
BP's dropping.

519
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,040
She's bleeding
from a hepatic artery branch.

520
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,600
Yes, I see it.
We need to do the Pringle maneuver.

521
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,520
Sponges.

522
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,960
More light, please.

523
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,560
-Damn it, I can't see.
-She's bradycardic.

524
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,360
Heart rate 40 bpm
and blood pressure 50/30.

525
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,200
She's going to crash.

526
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,080
Damn it.

527
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,360
Clear the field.

528
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,600
-I can't see.
-She's going to crash, Néstor.

529
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,760
-She's worse.
-Shit.

530
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,320
-I can't see.
-We're losing her. Néstor.

531
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,720
Néstor, she's going to crash.

532
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,240
-I can't see.
-What do we do?

533
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,960
Where are you going?

534
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,480
-What happened?
-The generators failed.

535
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,960
We've had to switch to Ambu bags.

536
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,800
-Check for fever.
-I want to help.

537
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,280
No, you're recovering.
Stay with your baby.

538
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:21,040
Look, the baby's sleeping, I'm fine,
and you need all the help you can get.

539
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,840
Sponges. I can't see.

540
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,600
-Néstor.
-What are you doing here?

541
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:31,360
Your resident was smart enough to call me
before the president dies on the table.

542
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,520
Patricia won't die.

543
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,960
You're a great oncologist
and a decent surgeon,

544
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,440
but in the OR, I'm the best.

545
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,880
Let me help you.

546
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,280
Néstor, you know you can't do this alone.

547
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,840
We need her help.

548
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,920
Please.

549
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,800
All right.

550
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,560
I'll proceed to perform
the Pringle maneuver.

551
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,280
Maneuver performed.

552
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,240
-Vitals are stabilizing.
-Good.

553
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,040
There, I see the first one. Tray.

554
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,000
Going for the second.

555
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,840
Okay, done. We have to close.

556
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,200
-Sponges.
-Needle holder.

557
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,160
3/0 absorbable sutures and forceps.

558
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,120
Take her to her mother in 108.

559
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,920
Go on.

560
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,760
-How's his temperature?
-Still high.

561
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,160
Okay.

562
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,120
Biel, I need you
to help me suture the vessels.

563
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,560
Mosquito and scalpel.

564
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,240
Switch with me.

565
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,240
Thread.

566
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,000
Doctor, the patient has gone into V-fib.

567
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,120
Get the paddles.

568
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,400
They're uncharged.

569
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,120
We'll have to do open-chest CPR.

570
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,640
Néstor, I need you to do it
while I finish here.

571
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,520
Okay.

572
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,240
Okay, last one.

573
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,760
-That's it.
-Done. Cut.

574
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:15,200
Okay, the stomach's closed.
How's he doing?

575
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,520
His BP's very low.
If it stays that way, we'll lose him.

576
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,560
What? Why?

577
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,400
His blood's not clotting.
I need more plasma and platelets.

578
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,440
-They're thawing.
-Then warm them up in your hands.

579
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,320
You hear me? I need them now.

580
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,320
Scalpel.

581
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,360
Néstor, don't hesitate.

582
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,440
And breathe. You can do this.

583
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,840
Retractor.

584
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,760
Sponges.

585
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,520
I've got the heart.

586
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,200
Start cardiac massage.

587
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,400
Checking for heartbeat.

588
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,560
Vitals are stabilizing, Dr. Moa.

589
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,840
Good job, Doctor.

590
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:08,880
Pilar.

591
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,960
I wanted to thank you.

592
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,640
-You were a godsend.
-Please, Néstor.

593
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,160
No apologies, no thanks, no nothing.

594
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,000
You and I are above all that.

595
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,560
I just did my duty as a doctor.

596
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,680
There's a reason why a surgeon,
no matter how good they are,

597
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,840
can't operate on the people they love.

598
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,640
What do you mean?

599
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,720
When someone you care about
is on the operating table,

600
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,240
it's very difficult to stay calm
when things go wrong.

601
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,240
Doctor, Óscar's had an overdose.

602
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,160
What?

603
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,520
Óscar!

604
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,520
-He's in the ER.
-Where?

605
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,320
He's over there.

606
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,320
-Where?
-Bay 12.

607
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,000
-Óscar.
-Mom.

608
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,640
Son, what happened?

609
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,640
I'm not okay, Mom.

610
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,240
-What happened?
-I'm so sorry. I need help.

611
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,000
We'll get through this, I promise.

612
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,080
-Okay.
-You hear me?

613
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,240
-I need help.
-I know.

614
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,080
-I'm here, son.
-I'm so sorry.

615
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,640
-I'm sorry. I need help.
-I'm here.

616
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,720
Mostly due to downed trees
and floods on Carrer de la Reina.

617
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,480
Connections to the north of the region
have been greatly affected by the storm.

618
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:58,080
More than 250 liters per square meter
have fallen along the seafront.

619
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,160
Suspension of rail traffic
on the entire Mediterranean…

620
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,400
Change his diaper, please.

621
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,040
-How is he?
-He's fine now.

622
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,440
Go and rest with your baby now.
Go on, we'll finish here.

623
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,760
Morning, girls.

624
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,080
África.

625
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,400
-Have you seen the baby from that room?
-No.

626
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,360
How is this possible?
How can no one have seen anything?

627
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,480
She was in the room!
She was there! I left her sleeping!

628
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,560
-May, what's wrong?
-How?

629
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,680
The baby.

630
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,080
-What?
-The baby's gone.

631
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,600
What do you mean?

632
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,080
Rocío.

633
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,680
Rocío took her.

634
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,040
It was her.

635
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,480
Good morning.

636
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,000
Hi.

637
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,040
What's underneath these bandages?

638
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,360
Nothing good?

639
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,040
Tell me what you have to.

640
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,360
There were complications,
but the surgery went well.

641
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,360
You'll live.

642
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,200
We've gained precious time
to come up with something.

643
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,200
Thank you.

644
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,560
Pilar doesn't think
I should be your doctor anymore.

645
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,080
Why not?

646
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,200
Because she says
you're more than a patient to me

647
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,320
and I'm putting you at risk.

648
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,640
Ideologically, we're poles apart,

649
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,120
and we didn't get off
to a very good start,

650
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,720
but I admire you.

651
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,480
You're tough.

652
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,600
And funny.

653
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,360
And honest about your stuff.

654
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,400
Maybe Pilar's right,

655
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,400
and we'll end up
being more than just doctor and patient.

656
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,760
Maybe, I don't know,
we'll end up being friends.

657
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,760
Friends…

658
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,400
How boring.

659
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,560
I like them younger anyway.

660
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,600
-Doctor and patient.
-All right.

661
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,120
Lluís.

662
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,120
Everything okay?

663
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,120
Dr. Jornet.

664
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,800
Sorry?

665
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,880
It's Dr. Jornet to you.

666
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,000
The hospital director and your boss.

667
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,640
I didn't give you permission
to use my first name.

668
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,440
Even if you are screwing my girlfriend.

669
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,360
Did you really think I was that stupid?

670
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,760
Lluís…

671
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,040
-Dr. Jornet, I didn't…
-I'll just say one thing.

672
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:12,880
See this?

673
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,240
I'm waiting for Jésica to say yes.

674
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,320
And I'm not happy
that she has to think about it.

675
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,880
Not happy at all.

676
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,800
But hey, I get it.

677
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,280
You're young, attractive.

678
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,560
I don't mind you two
fooling around now and again.

679
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,520
But this is different. This is important.

680
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:40,640
And if, for whatever reason,
Jésica starts to have doubts,

681
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,760
or get confused,

682
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,160
well, it would be nice
if you got out of the picture.

683
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,680
If you know what I mean.

684
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,160
And if I don't?

685
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,960
Well, you should look
for an internship abroad,

686
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,000
because no one will hire you here.

687
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,400
Maybe your girlfriend's
worth that internship.

688
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,200
What did you do?

689
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,120
What happened?

690
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,760
We removed these from your stomach.

691
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:54,120
They caused injuries to your throat
and the pit of your stomach.

692
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,840
But you'll be okay, we got there in time.

693
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,440
-No.
-Yes.

694
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,600
You shouldn't have done it.
You should've let me die.

695
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,160
Manu.

696
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,200
We're going to help you, okay?

697
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,120
-No.
-And now…

698
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,760
-No.
-Yes. Listen to me.

699
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,200
-No.
-Manu.

700
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,280
-Manu, calm down.
-No, leave me alone!

701
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,880
-Leave me alone!
-Manu, stop.

702
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,200
-Manu, look at me.
-No.

703
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,120
-Manu, stop! No!
-It's all your fault, damn it!

704
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,760
-It's all your fault.
-Calm down, okay?

705
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,000
Security!

706
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,000
Manu, no!

707
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,680
Jaume.

708
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,120
Yes.

709
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,040
It all went well.

710
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:50,480
I was calling to say
that if that chemo is what I need

711
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,440
to get over this goddamn cancer,

712
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,840
I want it.

713
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:56,880
I want it, damn it.

714
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,480
For fuck's sake.

715
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,120
Even if it costs me the presidency.

716
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,000
You can manage Sorolla.

717
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,160
-What's up?
-Hi, Biel.

718
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,320
Jésica!

719
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,160
Hey! Look at me!

720
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,040
Help, please!

721
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,760
Jes, stay with me.

722
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,320
Help! Damn it.

723
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,720
Jes, stay with me.
