1
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,560
IT'S YOUR RIGHT

2
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,760
LET'S RECLAIM HEALTHCARE

3
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,840
Good morning.

4
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,720
-Good morning, Paula.
-Good morning, Dr. Moa.

5
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,280
A letter arrived for you.

6
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,160
-Thanks.
-No problem.

7
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,600
Hi, Dr. Moa.

8
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,480
Dr. Moa.

9
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,000
Dr. Moa.

10
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,440
Hello?

11
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,360
Is anyone there?

12
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,920
Dr. Moa?

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,520
Is anyone there?

14
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,560
Dr. Moa?

15
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,800
Dr. Moa!

16
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,120
BREATHLESS

17
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,360
Most people think Dr. Moa won the debate.

18
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,200
Yes, Emilio, but the strike's over.
That's what matters.

19
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,240
They say you looked tired
and doubt if you're cured

20
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,320
and if you're fully capable
of continuing to serve.

21
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,600
Let them talk.

22
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,280
"Patricia, step down"
is trending on Twitter.

23
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,160
"Is Segura's party
looking for a replacement

24
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,720
for next year's elections?
They should be."

25
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,200
What?

26
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,560
My pilot project
for the privatization of a hospital.

27
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,480
Now?

28
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,440
Yes.

29
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,520
Set it up.

30
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,840
Here, in this one.

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,880
They'd think it's revenge
for losing the debate.

32
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,800
No.

33
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,440
It's the decision of a sitting president

34
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,600
who's not afraid
to put her plans into action.

35
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,600
It's a strong statement, Patricia.

36
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,520
We need that.

37
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,400
I'm waiting for Néstor
to continue with my treatment.

38
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,880
I don't think it's a good time
to turn him against me.

39
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,720
-Well, that's a shame.
-Yeah.

40
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,240
But it's good that, for once,
you're putting politics aside

41
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,600
and focusing on your recovery.

42
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,280
Come on, Emilio, please.

43
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,680
No, I'm being serious.

44
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,240
Your illness has changed your priorities.

45
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,440
It's not a bad thing.

46
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,520
-I guess.
-Excuse me.

47
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,960
Dr. Moa has had to cancel
today's appointments. I'm sorry.

48
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,920
We can and we want to prove
that our plan is foolproof.

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,160
Foolproof!

50
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,520
Now that Sorolla's in the spotlight,
it's the time and place to do it.

51
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,240
Of course, it would be
our pilot hospital, in a way.

52
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,000
After the strike,
it couldn't be any other.

53
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,080
The measures are a little extreme.

54
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,920
The changes would be gradual.
Small-scale tests.

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,600
There's no rush,
but we have every intention

56
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,240
of making Sorolla
the best hospital in Spain.

57
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,240
That's why I'm going
to be treated here again.

58
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,760
To show you just how invested
I am in things being done properly.

59
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,160
You made a quick recovery.

60
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,320
Why this after what we talked about?

61
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,840
I don't get it.

62
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,160
A peer review was requested.

63
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,720
-Néstor…
-To assess what happened in your surgery.

64
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,880
I've been suspended
from my duties until then.

65
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,240
I have no idea what you're talking about.

66
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,240
Right.

67
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,640
-I don't believe you.
-Néstor, we'll talk later.

68
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,160
-What have we got?
-67-year-old female.

69
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,320
She fell onto her fence
while she was gardening

70
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,520
and got impaled on one of the posts.

71
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,040
She's lost a lot of blood.

72
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,280
-Vital signs?
-Hemodynamically stable.

73
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,000
Blood pressure 94/65. Heart rate 91.

74
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,120
Oxygen saturation 98%.

75
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,000
-Take off the blanket.
-Okay.

76
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,000
Jésica?

77
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,480
Jésica.

78
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,400
Clotilde?

79
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,960
Hi.

80
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,640
-What happened?
-Take the pain away!

81
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,080
Give me whatever you have to,
but take it away.

82
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,240
I'm going to take it away, okay?

83
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,920
We need to do a CT
and get her to the OR stat.

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I don't know how I'll get it out.

85
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,000
-Find some bolt cutters or something.
-Okay, I'll find some.

86
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,880
Wow, I wasn't expecting you.

87
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,680
Stay if you like.

88
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,640
And thank you.

89
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,280
Here we go.

90
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,120
This woman was my professor.

91
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,280
We can't let her down.

92
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,000
Then let's do this.

93
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,920
Let's start.

94
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,000
I heard Segura wants
to privatize the hospital.

95
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,320
That's all we need.

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,040
Néstor.

97
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,160
What about you?

98
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,680
They want to punish me
for being the leader of the strike.

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,360
The Medical Board didn't support it,
so they have it in for me.

100
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,680
There's not much to be done.

101
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,120
Maybe there is.

102
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,320
Prove that Segura's cancer was
much more extensive than you thought,

103
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,560
so it was best
not to continue the surgery.

104
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,000
There would need to be a report.

105
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,360
The private clinic did a CT
that confirmed metastasis.

106
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,840
Then let's get it, right?

107
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,040
Thanks, but you need
to take care of your son, Leo.

108
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,000
Look, here's my password.

109
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,480
In case they've revoked
your access to the medical records.

110
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,760
This kid is going
to finish me off, I swear.

111
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,960
Yeah, I hear you guys every night.

112
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,720
Isn't it a giveaway
that he hardly sleeps at home?

113
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,320
-You're in for it if Amaro catches on.
-Look who's talking!

114
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,040
You've already heard, right?

115
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,280
Néstor's suspension
and Segura's meeting with Lluís.

116
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,440
Tell me if you hear anything.
It doesn't look good.

117
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,120
-Good morning.
-God, things are crazy, right?

118
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,800
Hey, who's going to be your attending now?

119
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,000
How should I know?

120
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,480
Well, then…

121
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,720
We'll start with tamoxifen and cisplatin,
which have fewer side effects, but--

122
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,080
That treatment
is too mild for her condition.

123
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,080
Which have fewer side effects,
but similar effectiveness.

124
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,040
The president probably
has many obligations to attend to.

125
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,680
We can't give her aggressive chemo
that leaves her bedridden.

126
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,760
Let me worry about my work.

127
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,760
Which is best?

128
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,880
-Dr. Moa preferred--
-Hey, why don't you get me a coffee?

129
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,160
No.

130
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,800
Which would he choose?

131
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,880
Dr. Moa isn't
the only oncologist in the world.

132
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,080
The rest of us save lives too.

133
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,360
Yeah, and I don't mean to discredit you,

134
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,360
but I don't know you at all.

135
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,280
Sure.

136
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,040
And it's starting to piss me off
not having Néstor here.

137
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,560
Can you consult with Dr. Moa, please?

138
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,880
MEDICAL RECORDS
SEARCHING…

139
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,080
Shit.

140
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,080
THERE ARE NO RECORDS FOR THIS PATIENT

141
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,080
Shit.

142
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,920
-Put on your glasses whenever you want.
-Yes.

143
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,280
Marina and Marta.

144
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,440
-President, how are you?
-Very well.

145
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,480
It was a routine visit
and I'm stronger than ever.

146
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,840
Any candidates for the Health Department?

147
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,840
They're saying
you were behind Mr. Ventura's exit.

148
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,600
Mr. Ventura left politics
entirely of his own accord,

149
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,440
and there are no candidates.

150
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,120
-Thank you.
-No more questions.

151
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,720
-One moment, Madam President.
-Last question.

152
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,720
Madam President.

153
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,400
One moment! Last question, President.

154
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,480
Okay, thank you very much.

155
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,720
-One last question, President.
-Thank you.

156
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,920
Oh, dear God.

157
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,120
Stop there,
where the guy with the helmet is, Jose.

158
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,120
Okay, Patricia.

159
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,480
Let's go.
I'm going to smoke, don't make a fuss.

160
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,880
Where's the lighter?

161
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,800
Wait. Néstor.

162
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,160
Néstor!

163
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,720
Don't tell me you're ignoring me.
Give me a second, please.

164
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,440
One second.

165
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,560
I know we're not best friends,
but come on.

166
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,400
I had more than enough reasons
to request that review, but I didn't.

167
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,400
Do I think you're a jerk?

168
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,680
Yes, I do.

169
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,520
But… you're the jerk I want to treat me.

170
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,000
We'll have to trust each other
at some point, I think.

171
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,360
When were you going
to mention privatizing Sorolla?

172
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,080
You've got some nerve.

173
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,720
-You privatize us and expect treatment.
-It's best for the hospital, really.

174
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,920
You'll see for yourself.

175
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,240
I wish that were true.

176
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,000
Great.

177
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,160
Be quiet.

178
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,400
Jesus, I have to be up in an hour.

179
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,920
Damn it.

180
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,240
You had some coke left, right?

181
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,880
You know what I feel like?

182
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,840
What?

183
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,440
I want you to put it on my dick

184
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,320
and snort it.

185
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,240
You can't get enough, can you?

186
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,080
You know how much fun I have with you?

187
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,880
And how comfortable I am?

188
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,280
And how free I feel?

189
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,160
Where's the coke?

190
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,840
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

191
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,320
Clotilde, how are you feeling?

192
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,880
It hurts.

193
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,840
Can you increase the dose
of whatever you're giving me?

194
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,520
Please. Why does it hurt so much?

195
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,520
Did everything go okay?

196
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,880
Yes, everything went perfectly.
Don't worry, I'll take the pain away.

197
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,600
MORPHINE

198
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,720
But… it should've eased already.

199
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,720
Have you had any illnesses lately
where you were prescribed

200
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,400
a lot of painkillers, narcotics…?

201
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,800
Because you may have a high tolerance.

202
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,160
-No.
-No?

203
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,640
Not at all.

204
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,720
-Jésica.
-What?

205
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,320
How's your brother?

206
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,920
That boy was always the apple of my eye.

207
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,160
My brother died.

208
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,240
You came to the funeral, remember?

209
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,880
Oh, my.

210
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,240
Forgive me.

211
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,200
It completely slipped my mind.

212
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,880
I'm sorry.

213
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,480
Sometimes,

214
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,200
it happens with my daughter too.

215
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,720
I forget that she's gone.

216
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,120
What?

217
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,160
You're kidding me.

218
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,040
Okay.

219
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,440
Already?

220
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,360
-What's he doing here?
-Girl…

221
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,560
-Did you pee yourself?
-No.

222
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,400
I think you did.

223
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,840
-My water broke.
-What?

224
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,600
I'm in labor. Help me with this.

225
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,560
-What do I do with it?
-I don't know, bring it down?

226
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,440
You're going like that?

227
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,040
No, okay?

228
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,160
Here, call a cab.

229
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,640
Okay.

230
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,080
Where's the cab, damn it?

231
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,520
Relax, girl.

232
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,960
Shit.

233
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,280
I'm coming up right now.

234
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,640
Whoa, what a trip.

235
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,000
I think the last…

236
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,120
The last thing I took wasn't coke.

237
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,040
What the hell? Óscar!

238
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,640
Óscar. Damn it.
Can someone help me, please?

239
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,080
-I'm coming.
-Keep his head to the side.

240
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,200
Pick up.

241
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,640
Jesus. Where's the goddamn cab?

242
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,880
Hey.

243
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,480
-Hey.
-How's your professor?

244
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,080
I'm not sure.

245
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,080
I'm starting to suspect
she's hooked on narcotics.

246
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,880
I don't know if she fell on purpose
to come here for a good dose of morphine.

247
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,520
But she's a doctor, right?

248
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,200
She could just prescribe it for herself.

249
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,880
Her greatest legacy is her reputation.
I doubt she'd risk losing it.

250
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,160
I'll see if I can get
her medical records and find a clue.

251
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,080
I don't know.

252
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,240
You did great in the OR.

253
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,800
We made a good team in the end.

254
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,160
Yeah, you and I always made a good team.

255
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,920
Knock it off.

256
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,640
Yes, that's been resolved.

257
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,360
Don't give birth here, we're almost there.

258
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,520
Worry more about the kid not dying.

259
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,920
Hey, wake up. Are you here or what?

260
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,800
Come on.

261
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,520
Where are we?

262
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,080
The hospital.

263
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,160
Me to give birth
and you to get a good dose of B12.

264
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,120
What?

265
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,720
No way, girl.

266
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,720
What do you mean?

267
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,240
What are you doing?

268
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,480
Where are you going?

269
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,040
What an ass--

270
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,240
-Help me!
-Coming.

271
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,920
You've hardly dilated.

272
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,760
-So patience, you've got hours to go.
-No.

273
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,080
We could send you home.

274
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,840
No way. Leo, I'm having
contractions every ten minutes.

275
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,680
It's not normal, it hurts so much.

276
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,000
Something's wrong.

277
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,840
We'll do an ultrasound
to put your mind at ease,

278
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,280
but trust me, everything's fine.

279
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,400
Damn it.

280
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,760
My ex's lawyer.
Yeah, I'll pick up now, asshole.

281
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,560
-Does she know you're in labor?
-No!

282
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,600
No.

283
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,480
Do you know any scumbag lawyers?

284
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,800
With this foul mood I'm in,
I'm going in without mercy.

285
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,920
Pilar.

286
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,920
Don't be ridiculous, please.

287
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,760
Don't even try. I know what you're up to.

288
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,040
There's no way I'll testify for you.

289
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:24,360
Look, you and I aren't best of friends,
but we've always been colleagues.

290
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,640
We know each other,
work together, and respect each other.

291
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,360
Néstor, I'm the one
who requested the peer review.

292
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,040
You postponed the surgery.

293
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,160
You insisted on continuing to operate.

294
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,240
You played with a person's life
just to screw me over?

295
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,800
She's lucky you only removed her breast.

296
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,720
You would've let her die, just to…

297
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,640
I had no idea you were such a bitch.

298
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,280
What a nerve!

299
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,760
May.

300
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,360
How are you, girl?
Sorry, I only just saw your call.

301
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,480
This damn baby is killing me.
I'm not dilating at all.

302
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,520
Don't worry, you will.

303
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,000
If anyone else tells me not to worry,
I won't answer for it.

304
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,000
This is hell, guys.

305
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,280
But hey,

306
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,360
on the plus side, I have a lawyer.

307
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,320
He's the bomb.

308
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,480
He told me that,

309
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,400
legally, we're like any couple
fighting for custody of their kid.

310
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,480
But as I'm the birth mother,

311
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,120
they can't take her
while I'm breastfeeding.

312
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,280
That would create a tie
for two, three, four years.

313
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,040
-Wherever I am.
-You're still planning to go to Germany?

314
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,200
Of course. If the kid grows up
in Munich, she'll have to stay there.

315
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,480
-Far away from my ex.
-Oh, great.

316
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,200
So then?

317
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,080
So what?

318
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,400
So who's your ex, May?
When are you going to tell us?

319
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,240
-It's Blanca.
-Yeah.

320
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,480
-No, it's Leo.
-Quique, come on. Cut it out.

321
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,440
Enough about my ex.
Let's talk about your boyfriend.

322
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,640
Biel and I are worried.

323
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,680
Yeah.

324
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,360
Look, guys.
We're getting to know each other.

325
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,160
We're having fun, that's all.
There's nothing wrong with that.

326
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,280
And what about
how wasted he was this morning?

327
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,600
Man, it's such a drag
when you guys act all puritan.

328
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,880
Can't you just be happy for me?

329
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,200
For once, just once,
I'm enjoying something good in my life.

330
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,080
If you don't like it,
go chew on it somewhere else.

331
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,880
Quique, he collapsed in the doorway, okay?

332
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,600
I had to put him
in a cab and bring him here.

333
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,680
Me. About to give birth
and acting like his nurse!

334
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,760
-What?
-That's right.

335
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,680
Is he here?

336
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,080
No. He took off as soon as we got here.

337
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,040
Look, I don't know

338
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,400
if you're a bad influence on him,
he's a bad influence on you,

339
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,880
or you're as bad as each other, okay?

340
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,680
But this has to stop.

341
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,480
Hey, May.

342
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,000
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

343
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,320
-Do we call someone?
-No.

344
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,760
Breathe. That's it.

345
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,800
The wound is healing well.
You can go home in a few days.

346
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,400
Already?

347
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,640
No.

348
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,440
I can't leave yet.

349
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,720
How can I go home like this?

350
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,840
Professor, I took the liberty
of requesting your medical records.

351
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,880
And I saw that you've had
quite a few falls lately.

352
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,640
And that you've been admitted
to four different hospitals.

353
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,320
Oh, my dear.

354
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,240
Age is unforgiving.

355
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,840
Do you know who I'd like to see?

356
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,680
Your brother.

357
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,840
Do you know what, Clotilde?

358
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,200
Before you go, we'll do an MRI and a CT.

359
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,480
Beginning with… "O."

360
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,640
-"Ocean."
-"Orange."

361
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,320
What did you say? "Orange"?

362
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,000
Beginning with… "N."

363
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,240
-"Knee."
-That's not right.

364
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,080
-"Now"?
-"Know"?

365
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,480
-"New."
-"New."

366
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,320
Are you switching to Peds?

367
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,080
It's kind of a long story.

368
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,680
My God, this place has changed.

369
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,120
I started out here, you know?

370
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,880
Listen…

371
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,080
Biel,

372
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,680
you had every right
to say what you said to me.

373
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,760
But so did I to fight for my beliefs.

374
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,400
Patricia's surgery got messy,
but it wasn't my fault.

375
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,320
It would've been better
to close and reassess.

376
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,360
Right?

377
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,640
And I need you
to support me at the review.

378
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,080
Do you know how hard I worked
to be a resident at this hospital?

379
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,120
I studied my ass off all through college

380
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,800
to get the best grade on the exam

381
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,880
to be accepted here
and have you as my attending.

382
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,440
It was so important to me.

383
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:57,560
And you have no idea how hard it was
to make that decision to stay in the OR.

384
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,640
Then being rejected by you

385
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,920
and feeling so alone.

386
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,600
I can't imagine how Patricia
must've felt when you abandoned her.

387
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,400
Having to wake up alone,
not knowing what had happened to her.

388
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,760
When I was like them, I was here too.

389
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,360
And what I remember most after the surgery

390
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,240
was waking up and seeing
my doctor sitting beside me.

391
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,640
It was so important to feel protected,
to feel looked after.

392
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,840
I saw him and my fear went away.

393
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,160
You've made your decision then?

394
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,960
Shit.

395
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,840
Ready?

396
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,640
A little tired, to be honest.

397
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,280
It's going to be okay.

398
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,680
You're such a bad liar, Biel.

399
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,360
Welcome, sweetheart.

400
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,640
Hi, would you like an ice pop
to cool off during the session?

401
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,560
No, not really.
What I'd like is a little privacy.

402
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,920
-And don't call me "sweetheart."
-Sure.

403
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,080
-What's wrong?
-No.

404
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,480
-No.
-Celina.

405
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,640
-Can you come here?
-Yes.

406
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,200
Hi.

407
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,880
No one can see me having chemo anymore.

408
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,760
I thought that was clear.

409
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,840
Privacy.

410
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,240
Of course, total privacy.

411
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,840
We do apologize.

412
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,800
Let me think…

413
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,560
It could be in an empty OR at night.

414
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,720
Or in the laundry room.

415
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,240
Okay, I think I've got it.

416
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,000
Néstor!

417
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,880
Néstor!

418
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,040
She's having palbociclib.

419
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,040
I wasn't expecting so many mets.

420
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,520
Well, it's a good choice.

421
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,440
Let's see how she reacts, but it's strong.

422
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,560
I didn't think anyone
had access to these reports.

423
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,360
They tried their best
to erase them from the system,

424
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,800
but nobody here remembers
I also work in private practice

425
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,600
and I have a lot of contacts.

426
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,120
Keep them.

427
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,320
Why do this?

428
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,200
She has a really nasty cancer.

429
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,840
Even if you're not allowed to treat her,
I could really use having you close by.

430
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,640
Besides, she wants you as her doctor,
so everybody wins.

431
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,800
What you do with the reports
besides consulting them

432
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,800
to give me a hand
with the treatment is up to you.

433
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,280
She's in there, if you want to say hello.

434
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,320
I can never get the hang of this cube.

435
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,000
So, see anything wrong
with my plan for the hospital?

436
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,720
Where do I start?

437
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:50,080
Patricia, do you honestly believe
this is going to improve patient care?

438
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,720
I could refute every point you make.

439
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,160
But you're playing at a disadvantage.

440
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,840
Don't let the wire sway you.

441
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,200
But that sounds good.

442
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,320
We can play whatever you like.

443
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,160
Let's pretend the chemo is a truth serum.

444
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,840
So ask me anything you like.

445
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,240
Anything.

446
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,440
Were you really going
to use my wife against me?

447
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,720
Ugh, how boring.

448
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,280
I thought you were going to ask
what color my underwear is.

449
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,200
Or if I'm the type to only have sex
when I've had one too many.

450
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,400
You don't seem like you need
to have one too many to get laid.

451
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,360
Don't pretend to know me.
You'll lose that game.

452
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,240
No.

453
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,600
I wouldn't have used it.

454
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,120
But not for you.

455
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,680
For her.

456
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,800
She doesn't deserve it.

457
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,520
I could be in the same position tomorrow

458
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,400
and ask you to kill me.

459
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,200
Can I ask you a question, sorry?

460
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,720
Since she died,

461
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,080
have you been with anyone else?

462
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,200
Fancy an ice pop?

463
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,400
What a nice guy.

464
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,760
Well, now I'm officially
five years old, I'll say yes.

465
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,480
Want one?

466
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,280
-What flavor?
-Mango.

467
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:42,000
Ah, mango. Thanks.
Hey, sorry if I was rude before.

468
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,320
I have your reports, Patricia.

469
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,000
Are you going to use them?

470
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,160
My medical career is on the line.

471
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,320
If there were any other way, I'd take it.

472
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,920
What are you doing?

473
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,560
That was scary!

474
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,920
Be careful, man!

475
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,120
What are you doing?

476
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,760
-What's going on?
-Open the door!

477
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,320
Stop! Where are you going?

478
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,680
Stop!

479
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,840
Give me the goddamn camera, wise guy.

480
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Security, please.

481
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,120
Óscar, where are you?
I haven't heard from you.

482
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,600
You're not picking up the phone
and honestly, I'm worried.

483
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,760
Let me know you're okay, please.

484
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,640
Pilar requested the review.

485
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,680
-Who else?
-But it doesn't matter anymore.

486
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,680
No, you can't give up.
We need you more than ever.

487
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,280
They're turning us
into a neoliberal experiment.

488
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,600
-Did Patricia convince you?
-No, relax.

489
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,040
I have her reports. I'm going to fight.

490
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,480
Okay.

491
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,880
Toss the card and give the camera back.

492
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,160
Sorry, I thought it was empty.

493
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,000
Mind if I sleep here? I'm on call tonight.

494
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,800
Sure, I'm getting up now. I can't sleep.

495
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,680
She wasn't harming herself.

496
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,520
What?

497
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,480
Clotilde, remember her?

498
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,560
Yeah, of course.

499
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,000
She wasn't harming herself.

500
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,120
The accidents were due
to rapid-onset Alzheimer's.

501
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,360
You're kidding me.

502
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,960
I told her and it was so hard.

503
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,520
She was devastated.

504
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,800
But you know what she said?

505
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,920
There was something good about it.

506
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,560
She was starting
to forget her dead daughter.

507
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,880
And it wasn't hurting anymore.

508
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,520
Wow.

509
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,560
And I've been freaking out
for the last two weeks because…

510
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,560
I hardly ever dream about Rodri.

511
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,520
And it's hurting less.

512
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,680
I don't want to forget him.
I mean, I don't…

513
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,040
I don't want it to stop hurting.

514
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,120
If the price to pay
is it hurting like the first day, then…

515
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,280
I don't know why the hell
I'm telling you all this.

516
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,920
Because I'm here.

517
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,360
Because you have to tell someone.

518
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,480
And because I think you need a hug.

519
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,480
How little you know me.

520
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,000
You think?

521
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,480
Yeah.

522
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,720
Well, I'm coming over to hug you.

523
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,080
-How are you?
-Fine.

524
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,320
Got everything?

525
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,520
Yeah.

526
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,720
Only answer their questions.
Don't blab and put your foot in it.

527
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,960
Don't worry.

528
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,800
-All right.
-Thanks.

529
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,800
This is yours.

530
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,480
I thought you'd like to have it.

531
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,440
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

532
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,080
I have to find out from the nurses
you're in labor?

533
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,960
Get Leo. Something's not right.

534
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,240
I've been here for hours and nothing.

535
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,680
-Honey, what is it?
-Don't touch me.

536
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,760
May, it's me.

537
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,920
-Shut up!
-May.

538
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,040
-May. Damn it.
-Get Leo. Don't touch me!

539
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,960
Quique! Go get Leo!

540
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:02,040
We will now begin
the peer review of Dr. Néstor Moa.

541
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,600
Yes, Mrs. Segura, come in.

542
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,280
Welcome.

543
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,440
The president asked to be present

544
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,360
as the matter we're about to discuss
directly concerns her.

545
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,680
If Dr. Moa doesn't object.

546
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,760
Very well.

547
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,680
Sorry.

548
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,600
I need Dr. Santapau.

549
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,440
-It's urgent. Let's go.
-What is it?

550
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,600
Rocío.

551
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,000
Shit, May.

552
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,320
Oh my God!

553
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,280
-Is it an abruption?
-Seems like it.

554
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,920
She needs an emergency C-section.
Let's move her, quickly!

555
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,720
-You, are you Anesthesia?
-Yes.

556
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,920
Okay, come with me.

557
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,560
-Please.
-Come on, let's go!

558
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,440
Leo, please!

559
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,360
Look out!

560
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,320
-Out of the way. Look out!
-Get an OR ready stat!

561
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,800
Go! Hold on, May.

562
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,720
I can't.

563
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,320
-Come on!
-Look out!

564
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,040
Dr. Néstor Moa,

565
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:03,720
you are accused of abandoning
a patient in the middle of a surgery

566
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,560
for the sole reason of starting a strike,
which we are all aware of.

567
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,320
Do you have anything to say?

568
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,720
I won't defend myself.

569
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,240
He won't defend himself?

570
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,160
I know I don't stand a chance.

571
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,400
Everyone here is against me

572
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,480
and already judged me
before requesting this review.

573
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,760
I'll just say
that whether I'm practicing or not,

574
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,720
I'll continue to fight
to improve healthcare.

575
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,800
-What's he doing? He's lost it.
-Patient safety.

576
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,400
And the dignity of all healthcare workers.

577
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,200
That said, let's wrap this up
as soon as possible, please.

578
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,160
-What is he talking about?
-Silence.

579
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,640
Silence, please.

580
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,960
It's going to be okay, May. I promise.

581
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,720
Take a deep breath.

582
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,240
Breathe, May.

583
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,520
So, according to you,

584
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,840
Dr. Moa left the OR for no other reason
than the start of the protests.

585
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,280
Yes, that's right.

586
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,800
When the clock
struck midnight, Dr. Moa left,

587
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,840
neglecting the patient
and forcing the rest to leave.

588
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,240
Only Dr. Amaro,
the resident, and I stayed.

589
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,080
Forcing you?

590
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,720
The truth is,
he didn't give us much choice.

591
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,920
It was either that
or go against the entire hospital.

592
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,800
There was little we could do.

593
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,000
So you had to finish the surgery,
didn't you, Dr. Amaro?

594
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,240
I started it and didn't plan
to leave without finishing it.

595
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,280
Unfortunately, we were
overwhelmed by the situation

596
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,520
and we had to close
before we could remove everything.

597
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:47,640
Do you think the doctor's departure
aggravated the patient's diagnosis?

598
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,040
It's impossible to say for sure,
but I think so.

599
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,360
Dr. Moa's attitude
was not only unprofessional,

600
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,560
but also detrimental
to the patient's health.

601
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,040
Scalpel.
I need to make the cut immediately.

602
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,920
Clamp and forceps.

603
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,160
Shit, she's coding.

604
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,280
CPR, now. Come on.

605
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,920
-It's asystole, right?
-Yes.

606
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Because of the blood loss,
anesthesia, and the Kristeller.

607
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,280
-Sponges, come on!
-Adrenaline!

608
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,800
Give her one milligram!

609
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,800
Come on, May.

610
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,480
Come on, please.

611
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,040
Come on.

612
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,280
Come on, little one.

613
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,840
Come on, May.

614
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,960
-The cord.
-Okay. The rhythm's back.

615
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,520
Come on.

616
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,240
So you're the bitch.

617
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,080
Biel de Felipe.

618
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,440
If you please.

619
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,400
I'm Biel de Felipe
and I'm Dr. Moa's resident.

620
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,000
When the doctor wanted to end the surgery,

621
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:46,000
I stayed with Dr. Amaro,
thinking I was doing the right thing.

622
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,320
But I was wrong.

623
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,520
Over time, we realized
that by insisting on saving her life,

624
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,920
we put her more at risk.

625
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,560
It was hard to accept.

626
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,160
I was mad at him because I thought
he didn't care about his patients.

627
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,920
But that's not true.

628
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,320
May I?

629
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,880
It's only short.

630
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,080
"Dear Dr. Moa,
I'm writing to say thank you."

631
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,280
"I'm cured."

632
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,520
"When I grow up,
I want to be like you and save lives."

633
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,480
"Thanks for taking care of me
and being such a pain."

634
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,240
"I'll never forget you.
I hope you won't forget me either."

635
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,680
And he didn't.

636
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,640
I wrote this letter
when I was ten years old.

637
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,320
It proves what kind of doctor he is.

638
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,520
One hell of a surgeon
and an even better oncologist.

639
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,800
Letting him go would be a huge loss.

640
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,200
Thank you.

641
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,160
We'll pause to deliberate.

642
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,280
I'm so nervous.

643
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,560
Leo.

644
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,760
-How are they? Are they okay?
-Yes. Well, they need to rest.

645
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,560
-Can I see the baby?
-Of course.

646
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,360
In there.

647
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,880
You're kidding me. It's her?

648
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,000
Don't be a gossip.

649
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,800
No way!

650
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,240
África.

651
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,640
Is this what you doctors do
in public hospitals when no one's looking?

652
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,920
Relax, I was just coming
to congratulate you.

653
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,160
Can I have a drag?

654
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,680
You don't mind the press knowing
the president smokes pot?

655
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,760
It's therapeutic, right?

656
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,880
Careful, it's stronger
than anything I can prescribe.

657
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,920
You can put it in my diet
to stop the chemo killing my appetite.

658
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,320
The occasion calls for it.

659
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,000
Jeez, this is strong.

660
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:21,240
Here. Finish it.

661
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,320
See you later.

662
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,760
Anyway, I was just coming to thank you.

663
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:35,960
Patricia.

664
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:36,880
Yeah?

665
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,560
The answer is "no."

666
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:42,920
What?

667
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,360
I haven't been with anyone since.

668
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,960
I imagine it can't be easy
after what happened and…

669
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,440
it must put you off a bit, right?

670
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,320
But, I don't know…

671
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,320
We should be braver, right?

672
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,400
-In any case, we present this now.
-We can't…

673
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,720
The car's here. Let's try not to… Look.

674
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,120
-Look who it is.
-You don't say.

675
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:32,080
-Are you here for a checkup?
-No, I'm fine. How are you?

676
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,240
I'm terrific.

677
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,840
I wanted to talk to you.

678
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,680
Because I've received some material

679
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,680
I think you should know about.

680
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,840
There's one condition:
don't touch Sorolla.

681
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,000
There are some photos

682
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,600
that, if published
with the news of your metastasis,

683
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,120
would destroy your career.

684
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,720
-What do you want?
-It's obvious.

685
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,920
Your job back?

686
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:01,840
Yes.

687
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,720
And one more thing.

688
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,640
Don't touch Sorolla.

689
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,840
It won't be privatized.

690
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,680
What the hell?

691
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,160
What is this?

692
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,280
-Hey.
-What are you doing?

693
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,840
A little meow meow?

694
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,400
What are you doing?

695
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,240
It hits quicker this way.

696
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,680
Like the party I threw for you?

697
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,120
Want some?

698
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,560
No.

699
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,680
It's freaking awesome.

700
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:46,560
