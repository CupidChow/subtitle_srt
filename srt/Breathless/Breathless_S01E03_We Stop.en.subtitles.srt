1
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,720
Someone fell!

2
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,480
Rodri!

3
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,600
Help!

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,960
Somebody get help, please!

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,280
-Please, run!
-I'll go tell Dr. Donoso.

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,920
Get a neck brace
and prepare the Resus room!

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,840
Hurry!

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,080
Rodri, hold on!

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,080
Stay with me, please!

10
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,440
Hold on!

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,640
Look at me.

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,080
Stay with me, please!

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,240
-To Resus. Quickly!
-Rocío, please help him!

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,920
-Let go of him, please.
-No!

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,560
Please, we need to work!

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,440
Let's start CPR!

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,240
One milligram of adrenaline.

18
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,200
He…

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,840
He…

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,080
27, 28, 29, 30.

21
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,840
Rodri.

22
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,720
Oh my God.

23
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,560
25, 26, 27, 28…

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,080
Hasn't he been in the OR for ages?

25
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,920
Nearly four hours.

26
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,520
Well,

27
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,400
that could be a good sign, right?
I'm sure it's a good sign.

28
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,960
These things take time.
Let's not panic, okay?

29
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,440
Biel.

30
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,160
Are you okay?

31
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,400
The surgery went well.

32
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,480
-Rodri's strong.
-But you need to prepare yourself.

33
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,520
-I'm sure Rodri will make it.
-It's over. Now we have to wait.

34
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,160
Come on.

35
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,120
Didn't you say it went well?

36
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,200
They managed to stop the bleeding, but…

37
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,840
the fall caused a subdural hematoma.

38
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,880
He's in a coma?

39
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,400
The next 48 hours will be critical.

40
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,840
Do you want to see him?

41
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,280
He's at the back. Bay 8.

42
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,920
BREATHLESS

43
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,720
-All right, are you sure?
-Yeah.

44
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,800
We need to buy alcohol. Not me.

45
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,160
-Not me.
-My cousin.

46
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,240
-Okay.
-His cousin.

47
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,840
-Where are we going?
-I'll be right back, okay?

48
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,240
-And we'll talk.
-Okay.

49
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,160
Okay.

50
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,280
-Hi. Everything okay?
-Yes, everything's fine.

51
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,080
I wanted to talk to you,
see how you were doing.

52
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,600
Well, I'm doing better.
Much better, thanks to you.

53
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,520
Sure.

54
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,960
I've been thinking a lot
about what we did.

55
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,560
-Why? Did someone find out?
-No.

56
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,320
-But they could find out.
-Yeah.

57
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,920
Are you sure that boy raped you?

58
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,440
-Now you don't believe me?
-Well, you had doubts.

59
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,440
No, I said I didn't remember
because I'd been drugged.

60
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,720
You were drugged.
How can you be sure it was that boy?

61
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,880
That bastard raped me.

62
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,760
And I hope he rots in jail.

63
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,240
Doctor, please!

64
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,480
Sandra, see what that guy wants.

65
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,560
-Who?
-The Polish guy with glasses.

66
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,400
Miss!

67
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,840
Give this to Dr. Montero, please.

68
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,000
-Sorry.
-No worries.

69
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,520
-It's going to keep happening.
-We're totally overwhelmed.

70
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,360
Quiet, guys. Quiet, please!

71
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,640
We all agree that what happened
to Dr. Donoso is a real tragedy

72
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,720
and I'm truly as sorry as you are.

73
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,400
-But it wasn't the hospital's fault.
-Yes it was, Lluís.

74
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,600
An intern was left stranded
as there were no attendings to supervise.

75
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,320
I won't apologize for wanting
the hospital's best surgeon

76
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,600
for my son's surgery, so we're clear.

77
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,920
No one's saying it's your fault, Pilar.

78
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,600
-Well…
-But we're always short-staffed.

79
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,400
Have you seen the halls
with all the patients from the fair?

80
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,080
-It's worse than ever, Lluís.
-Let's stay on topic, please.

81
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,080
You all know that surgery
shouldn't have happened.

82
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,840
-There was no consent.
-That's not the point.

83
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,040
The point is we're drowning, Lluís.

84
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,200
I couldn't see Rodrigo
because I didn't have time.

85
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,880
-Really, Neus? Time's your excuse?
-It's not an excuse, it's true.

86
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,520
Are you implying
I just didn't feel like it?

87
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,840
-Look…
-A little respect!

88
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,600
Let's be practical.
How can we help Rodri now?

89
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,760
We can talk to the press.

90
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,800
-No. I'll kill anyone who does.
-Rodri's video is online.

91
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,160
-It can't be stopped now.
-The video… Listen!

92
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,360
The video doesn't say what happened.

93
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,360
If we tell the press,
they'll give the girl's family a say.

94
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,920
Do you want the mom on every newscast
saying Rodrigo killed her daughter?

95
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,240
Is that what you want?

96
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,120
I can't believe there's nothing we can do.

97
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,320
Let's do that.

98
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,320
Nothing.

99
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,600
But in an active way.

100
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,880
Let's do a sit-down strike.

101
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,960
In protest of the shitty system
that led us to this.

102
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,720
-Here we go…
-Just for five minutes, Lluís.

103
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,640
-I'm sorry, but I can't allow it.
-Oh, come on.

104
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,560
Not even five minutes?

105
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,160
Néstor, you'd tell a patient in agony

106
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,040
that you're stopping
for five minutes to strike?

107
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,000
Please.

108
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,160
That's the point.

109
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,320
I'm sorry, really.

110
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,600
Do a fundraiser or make T-shirts
if you want, but that's it.

111
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,080
How can you say that? He's a colleague.

112
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:41,240
Like a fundraiser for a school trip?
I can't believe this.

113
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,360
UNION ZONE

114
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,280
Oh, God.

115
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,600
Patricia, sorry to keep you.
I don't know if you heard about yesterday.

116
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,360
We had an important meeting.

117
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,120
Oh, yes. Such a tragedy. Poor boy.

118
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,960
Was he a friend of yours?

119
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,320
Is.

120
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,800
He's my friend.

121
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,240
Sorry.

122
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,760
You haven't had any more
fatigue, vomiting, nausea, right?

123
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,440
No. It was just a scare.

124
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,000
Thanks to you.

125
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,480
Looks like you have
your reputation for a reason.

126
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,880
Oh, the only thing is…
Look, this is from this morning.

127
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,920
It's already begun.

128
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,000
It's impossible for your hair
to fall out after so little chemo.

129
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,800
Yes, it's most likely seasonal hair loss.

130
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,400
Or due to stress.

131
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,560
I didn't lose any hair when they put
a manager in charge of the party.

132
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,280
-It's the chemo, I'm sure.
-It's impossible.

133
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,800
All right, I can see your faces.
I know it seems frivolous.

134
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,320
But my life isn't like
any other cancer patient's.

135
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,840
Whenever I go out,
photographers are there waiting

136
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,520
to get the first shots of me bald,
with the goddamn headscarf.

137
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,040
The photo of the president with cancer.
And don't get me started on social media.

138
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,240
I have to see everyone posting
that I deserve what I got.

139
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,360
-As if they need more ammunition.
-I know it's tough.

140
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,160
But the alternative
to losing your hair is much worse.

141
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,920
Isn't there anything we can do?

142
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,920
We can stop looking at social media.

143
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,640
Great.

144
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,840
We'll get over this.

145
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,880
-Having HIV isn't like before.
-Don't say "we."

146
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,400
I'm the one who has to get over it.
I'm the one who's sick.

147
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,640
I know, but you just have
to take a pill each morning.

148
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,000
Your life won't change.

149
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,120
Don't lie to me. It will change.

150
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,640
Who will love me?
Who will have sex with me?

151
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,240
Look, I know it seems bleak,
but it's really not like that.

152
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,320
If you're careful,
if you take your medication, if--

153
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,840
Mom, seriously, stop.
Your positivity is making me sick.

154
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,240
I need you to get mad at me.
Okay? Or lose your shit.

155
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,800
Or be honest
and say what you really think.

156
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,840
If I say what I think, they'll lock me up.

157
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,800
Sorry.

158
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,640
We're so bad at this, Mom.

159
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,920
This is an outrage! It's bullshit, man!

160
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,240
Sixty already, just from this morning.
They must be bored and making videos.

161
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,120
God, I hate social media. Can't we ban it?

162
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,160
Oh, sure. Then they'll be right
to call you Kim Jong Un.

163
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,280
What do I care?

164
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,160
If there aren't any rooms at Sorolla,
we'll put them in other hospitals.

165
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,480
They're all the same.
They'd have to go to private ones.

166
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,360
Which would cost us a fortune.

167
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,880
Well, we can scrape
some money from somewhere.

168
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,520
"Patricia Segura cuts
public healthcare budget,

169
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,080
then sends Swedes to private hospitals."

170
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,000
-I don't see it.
-What do we do?

171
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,280
All right, I have an idea, okay?

172
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,000
But…

173
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,560
I don't know if now's the best time.

174
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,400
What is it?

175
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,160
Good morning. How was your night?

176
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,080
Well…

177
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,160
Excuse me, do you know
where his sister is, Dr. Donoso?

178
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,440
No, she hasn't been here all morning.

179
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,920
Hey.

180
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,240
I was looking for you in the ICU.
Are you okay?

181
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,040
I don't know. I can't be there.

182
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,360
I'm a doctor, I've seen it all,
but I can't see my brother like that.

183
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,800
-What happened isn't your fault.
-Spare me the psychobabble, please.

184
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,600
Look.

185
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,640
Tell me to go to hell if you want.

186
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,320
But Rodri needs you right now.

187
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,040
I know it's hard, but he needs you there.
He needs to know you're by his side.

188
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,040
My father was never there
when I needed him the most.

189
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,680
-It still hurts me.
-He's in a coma, Biel.

190
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,360
Yeah, but you don't know
if he can hear you.

191
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,720
-Talk to him. I'm sure it will help.
-And what do I say?

192
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,480
That I screwed up so badly
that he threw himself off a fucking roof?

193
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,000
That I'm an awful sister? Do I say that?

194
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,640
I just want these 48 hours
to go as fast as possible.

195
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,400
-Why 48 hours?
-That's what the neurosurgeon said.

196
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,200
If he survives them, he has a chance.
Just a day and a half of hell to go.

197
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,800
Prioritize these documents.

198
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,880
-They need them for a procedure.
-Okay, I'm on it.

199
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,440
-Óscar?
-Come in.

200
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,800
-It all went well, Doctor.
-Great. All right then.

201
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,080
Oh, shit! Sorry, man…

202
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,160
Don't look so shocked,
you've seen it all before.

203
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,080
Right, well,
I came to see how you were doing.

204
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,720
Well, physically much better,
as you can see.

205
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,240
And the other thing, well…

206
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,320
I'm dealing with it.

207
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,680
You helped me a lot.

208
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,320
Can you pass me the towel?

209
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,840
I don't know about that. I didn't do much.

210
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,680
You're so modest.

211
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,480
You didn't save my life,
help me with the HIV thing…

212
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,440
There's nothing sexier
than a hot guy who's modest.

213
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,760
Look, Óscar. You get to move on now.

214
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,200
I know you're going to be fine.

215
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,200
Are you saying goodbye to me, or what?

216
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,040
You'll be discharged today.

217
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,640
But we can see each other outside.

218
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,160
I don't think so.
I think it's best we leave it here.

219
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,200
Are you sure?

220
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,880
I'm sure.

221
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,600
I'd believe it a little more if…

222
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,120
you didn't have a hard-on.

223
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:50,000
-Move those gurneys, we're taking him up.
-You can't discharge me yet!

224
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,400
What's going on here?

225
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,360
We're freeing up beds for patients
from the fair. Director's orders.

226
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,280
Ma'am, my colleague
will take you up to the floor.

227
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,280
Orders from the Health Department.
What else could I do?

228
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,480
-Refuse.
-Right.

229
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,280
You run the hospital, not them.
Your job is to protect patients.

230
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:13,560
No, my job is to protect the hospital.
Defying the president would be foolish.

231
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,720
I don't need to remind you
she's trying to privatize us.

232
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,760
Three months in charge
and it's already too much, huh?

233
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:24,280
First, you won't give us five minutes
to honor a colleague, and now this?

234
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,760
-Look, Néstor, I really don't…
-You don't what?

235
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,600
Finally. Where have you been?

236
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,760
Jesus.

237
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,480
-I'm on my way.
-Where are you going?

238
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,880
Lluís, we haven't finished.

239
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,760
Excuse us, please.

240
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,680
I'VE BEEN CALLING YOU ALL MORNING,
WHERE ARE YOU? CALL ME.

241
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,640
Shall we start rounds?

242
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,040
-Can you handle it?
-I prefer to keep busy.

243
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,080
I thought you'd take some time off.

244
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,120
-How many beds need to be freed up?
-Six.

245
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,320
-Six on this floor?
-Yes.

246
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,520
Good morning, Mr. Valera.

247
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,680
How are you today?

248
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,920
Not so good.

249
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,320
I'm dizzy and my stomach hurts.

250
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,920
Your labs seem fine.

251
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,480
You have high cholesterol
and elevated transaminases.

252
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,040
It's likely you have gallstones,
so you can't digest fats well.

253
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,040
You must lose weight.

254
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,120
You doctors always say the same thing.

255
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,000
Every time I come to the hospital,

256
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,280
you put me on a diet,
even if it's my ankle that hurts.

257
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,040
If your ankle hurts,
it's likely because you're overweight.

258
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,280
-You think I haven't tried to lose weight?
-You must keep trying, sir.

259
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,200
Look.

260
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,000
What hurts is this, my stomach.
It hurts here. This.

261
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,840
I know I'm fat and I will go on a diet.

262
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,840
I swear I will, okay?
But please, check my stomach.

263
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,280
Please.

264
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,000
Perfect.

265
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,120
VALENCIA COURTHOUSE

266
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,720
Hugo, son.

267
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,480
-Dad, get me out of here, please.
-Sir, please. Take your seat.

268
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,960
It's all right.

269
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,920
What do we know?

270
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,680
The hearing's tomorrow.

271
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,320
Don't worry, I'm sure
you'll come home until the trial.

272
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,880
I swear I didn't do anything.
Get me out of here, please.

273
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,680
Dad, I want to go home.

274
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,640
-Ma'am, your hands, please.
-Yes.

275
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,560
Don't worry, Hugo.

276
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,120
I don't believe this.
Why the hell didn't you tell me sooner?

277
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,520
-He's my son too.
-I was in shock.

278
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,720
-I don't care.
-Lluís, there's something else.

279
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,760
I'm the gynecologist
who wrote the victim's report.

280
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,560
-You have to be kidding me.
-I had no idea.

281
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,680
-I found out when he was arrested.
-I don't believe it.

282
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,280
Hugo wouldn't hurt a fly.

283
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,520
Tell me the truth.

284
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,240
Did he do it?

285
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,320
I don't know.

286
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,280
The girl says they were high.
Maybe she got confused.

287
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,200
Say that.

288
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,640
-What?
-At the hearing.

289
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,280
-I can't.
-I don't mean lie.

290
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,480
-Just tell the truth to cast doubt.
-They won't let me.

291
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,040
-Why?
-Because I'm his mom, for God's sake!

292
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Another gynecologist will testify.

293
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,520
How is he?

294
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,120
No change.

295
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,080
But whenever I can,

296
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,560
I come here and try to spur him on.

297
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,400
You're a good friend.

298
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,080
Well…

299
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,640
And you've also been
a good influence on Óscar.

300
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,960
I wanted to invite you for dinner
to thank you for everything.

301
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,880
No…

302
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,480
-Thanks, Pilar, but there's no need.
-I know, but I want to.

303
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,440
Does 9:30 p.m. work for you?

304
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,600
9:30 p.m., well…

305
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,840
I know I have a reputation as a hard-ass,

306
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,400
but let me show you
that behind this cold exterior there's…

307
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,240
Look, I'm terrible at this.
Just come to dinner, okay?

308
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,360
For fuck's sake.
What the hell am I going to do now?

309
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,280
It's going to be okay.
It's only temporary, Concha.

310
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,560
Two minutes, I'll be right back.

311
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,240
Patricia, you're behind all this, right?

312
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,400
How can you kick out
patients just like you?

313
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,760
Relax, I haven't kicked anyone out.

314
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,680
They're continuing treatment
at home in peace.

315
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,160
"In peace"? You people are unbelievable.

316
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,640
-Us people who?
-Right-wing politicians.

317
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,440
You're more interested in privatization
and number crunching than people's health.

318
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,560
Look, do you know
why that kid jumped yesterday?

319
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,640
Enlighten me.

320
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,440
Because we've had so many cuts

321
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,840
that he was stranded in an OR
with no one to supervise him.

322
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,600
And that's my fault too?

323
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,960
You're the knight in shining armor,

324
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,960
and we're the villains
who only want to do evil, right?

325
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,800
You may have all these patients
in your care, but I have an entire region.

326
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,440
And I rack my brains every day of the week

327
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,280
so the people of Valencia
have what they need, you know?

328
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,880
With finite resources.

329
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,160
And yes, sometimes that means
going without some things to get others.

330
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,240
-Spare me the speech, please.
-Don't worry, I didn't come to see you.

331
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,880
I came to see the director.

332
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,200
I've given you the medication.
We'll take you to the floor. Relax, okay?

333
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,560
Sorry, things got a bit crazy.

334
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,680
-Elena's not here yet. I have to stay.
-I was counting on you tonight.

335
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,240
I don't know if you noticed,
but it's been a tough few days.

336
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,960
I know. Try not to stress.

337
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,960
How's the baby?

338
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,880
How about we pretend she's not here
and it's just us for a change?

339
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,800
But May, she is here.
There are three of us now.

340
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,000
We can't back out of this.

341
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,560
Come on.

342
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:49,040
Just think, when you finish your residency
we'll be in Germany starting a family.

343
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,560
I hope you're right.

344
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,200
You'll have to work on your German.

345
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,880
You'll be admitted soon.

346
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,680
Can we talk for a moment?

347
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,200
Well?

348
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,600
What's with all the mystery?

349
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,000
I want you to testify
tomorrow at Joana's hearing.

350
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,880
Me?

351
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,440
You're the gynecologist
who examined her, I just watched.

352
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,120
I can't testify.
I'm related to the accused.

353
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,120
It's my son.

354
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,640
I want you to say
you disagreed with my report.

355
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,560
Look, Leo.

356
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,480
If I go before a judge
to tell the truth, I'll tell it all.

357
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,720
Including that you forged
the report in her favor.

358
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,640
You know that would be
the end of your career.

359
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,800
Do I tell?

360
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,520
I thought so.

361
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,280
Leo, please.

362
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,200
-Do you want me to beg?
-Leo.

363
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,080
He's my son. Do you understand?

364
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,600
He's locked in a cell,
and I can't do anything to help him.

365
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,920
You don't know
what you'd do for a child yet.

366
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,360
I'm just asking you to say
you disagreed with my report.

367
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,280
That's all.

368
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,640
Please.

369
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,680
Please.

370
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,120
Hey!

371
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,280
Hey. I see you found your way.

372
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,200
Yeah.

373
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,360
I brought this.

374
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,480
Thank you.

375
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,040
-You're welcome.
-Come in.

376
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,800
The bathroom?

377
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,360
On the right.

378
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,680
Thanks.

379
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,760
What are you doing?

380
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,760
-I just want to talk.
-No, Óscar.

381
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,480
We'll talk out there,
in front of your mom.

382
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,880
-In front of my mom?
-No.

383
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,400
Sure you want my mom
to hear what I have to say?

384
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,320
No.

385
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,200
You and I have something
more than just sex.

386
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,080
No, Óscar, don't get confused.

387
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,600
Something horrible happened to you
and you're hung up on me

388
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,960
because you think I saved your life, but…

389
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,000
-It's not like that.
-Whatever you say.

390
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,840
But I know I like you, man.

391
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,040
And you like me.

392
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,680
No, I don't like you.

393
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,040
-You do a little.
-No.

394
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,240
A little.

395
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,080
-Occupied!
-Oops, sorry.

396
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,040
-Dinner's almost ready.
-I'll be right out!

397
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,800
Óscar, no.

398
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,120
I swear.

399
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,320
No.

400
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,200
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO REACH YOU ALL DAY. I'VE HAD IT!

401
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,520
Good evening, Doctor.

402
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,200
Sorolla Hospital, good evening.

403
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,640
Yes.

404
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,320
Hello.

405
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,520
Good evening.

406
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,000
How are you? Can't sleep?

407
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,880
Would you like a sleeping pill?

408
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,000
No. I have sleep apnea.

409
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,880
If I take a sleeping pill,

410
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,560
I might not wake up.

411
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,360
I promise you won't die.
At least not any time soon.

412
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,600
When you weigh more than 400 pounds,

413
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,880
you're diabetic,
and your kidneys are starting to fail,

414
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,600
the possibility of dropping dead
at any moment is very real.

415
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,560
How do you cope?

416
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,160
With what?

417
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,160
Being scared every day.

418
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,200
Well…

419
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,040
a doctor's never asked me that before.

420
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,680
Well, I eat.

421
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,360
And I eat a lot.

422
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,600
A lot, a lot.

423
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,680
What do you do to calm down?

424
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,600
Are you okay?

425
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,880
I came as soon as I saw your message.

426
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,560
What are you doing?

427
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,040
Trying not to think. Will you help me?

428
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,120
Look, I came because you said
it was an emergency.

429
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,520
This doesn't seem like an emergency?

430
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,840
Jésica, if you want sex,
call your boyfriend.

431
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,440
I have been, all day,
but he won't pick up.

432
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,200
What the hell?

433
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,880
You should be with Rodri right now,
not messing with my head!

434
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,320
I told you, I can't.

435
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,360
Yeah. Because you're scared, right?

436
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,000
-We all are, but we're doing our best.
-I told you, I can't!

437
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,160
And yes, I'm scared.

438
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,880
Scared he'll die in front of me
and I won't be able to do anything.

439
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,760
I go in there
and all I want to do is run away.

440
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,320
Funny, isn't it?

441
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,960
I'm so ballsy about everything
and now I just want to run away.

442
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,080
It's normal that you're scared.

443
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,640
Say it's not my fault again, I'll scream.

444
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,080
No.

445
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,120
It's normal because you're right.

446
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,440
Rodri could die.

447
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,280
Please don't say that.

448
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,120
I'm not saying it will happen.

449
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,600
But if it does and he dies alone,
you'll never forgive yourself.

450
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Look, we're not going to have sex.

451
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:47,320
But if you want me to go with you
to see him, you know where I am.

452
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,880
Thank you, Pilar. It's all delicious.
The chicken is amazing, but I'm full.

453
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,880
Duck.

454
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,200
-What?
-It was duck.

455
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,640
Oh, right. The duck.

456
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,680
Quack, quack. Really good.

457
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,840
Óscar, go to the bar
and get me a pack of cigarettes.

458
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,040
Seriously, Mom?

459
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,840
Please.

460
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,800
Wait, Óscar, I'll go with you
because it's getting late.

461
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,120
Stay a little longer.

462
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,720
Thanks, sweetheart.

463
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,240
Money's in the kitchen.

464
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,160
Want a whiskey?

465
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,040
Well, all right. I'll have one.

466
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,760
I used to smoke on the sly, you know?

467
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,960
But after what happened to Óscar,
I decided to quit that nonsense.

468
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,880
Ice?

469
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,880
No, neat is fine. Thanks, Pilar.

470
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,680
Something good had to come out of it.

471
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,760
No. What's good about smoking?

472
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,440
Nothing.

473
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,360
Right.

474
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,720
Nothing.

475
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,080
Almost every doctor I know does
the opposite of what we tell our patients.

476
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,640
-Yeah.
-Smoke, drink…

477
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,600
-Yeah.
-Eat unhealthily.

478
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,640
Totally.

479
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,480
I guess it's because
we're always close to death.

480
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,840
But it's one thing
to be close to a patient's death

481
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,400
and another to be close to your own son's.

482
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,400
Quique…

483
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,240
I know you and Óscar have gotten close.

484
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,320
I want you to help me find
the bastards he was hanging out with.

485
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,600
Look, Pilar,

486
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,720
Óscar's not a kid anymore.

487
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,080
I'm not saying
there weren't bad influences,

488
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,560
but he's responsible for his actions.

489
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,640
Óscar just had an overdose
that almost killed him

490
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,440
and contracted something
he could've avoided by using a condom.

491
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,320
So if you don't mind,
I'll be judge of whether he's still a kid.

492
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,920
Can I count on you?

493
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,120
Of course.

494
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,760
-Néstor, I'm not in the mood.
-I'm not here to fight. Here.

495
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,080
I think I've found
a solution to your hair problem.

496
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,880
Ah, a poisoned chalice.

497
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,920
Open it.

498
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,360
It's freezing.

499
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,760
It's experimental.

500
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:18,160
The cold reduces blood flow to the scalp,
protecting the hair follicles.

501
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,400
We don't know
how effective it will be, but…

502
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,880
you'll look great.

503
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,080
Oh yeah, I'll look gorgeous in this hat.

504
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,480
-Looking good?
-Yeah.

505
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,440
It suits you.

506
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,840
Well, thank you.

507
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,400
Wait until you see the price.
Social Security won't cover it.

508
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,440
-It's an expensive prototype.
-Why did you do it?

509
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,520
Because I'm your doctor

510
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,840
and I know it's been hard for you
to trust me and tell me how you feel.

511
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,160
And because I want you
to imagine how you'd feel

512
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,200
if you had to tell
another doctor you didn't trust.

513
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,160
Because that's how my patients
who aren't here are feeling.

514
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,120
Emotional blackmail?

515
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,800
Maybe.

516
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,560
But it's still true.

517
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,560
Rodri and I always used to try
and guess how you got your scar.

518
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,800
We'd come up
with all these absurd stories.

519
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,920
Like you got kidnapped
in Thailand and had a kidney stolen.

520
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,160
But Rodri said it was more like you

521
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,600
to fall in love with a dialysis patient
and donate your kidney.

522
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,160
And dude,

523
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I realized I never
actually asked you what happened.

524
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,200
I didn't ask Rodri either, man.

525
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,560
Neuroblastoma.

526
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,720
-Shit.
-Kidney tumor when I was ten.

527
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,000
I got over it,
but it led to my parents' divorce

528
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,800
and me hating
my coward of a father ever since.

529
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,400
He didn't know
how to cope with my illness, so…

530
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,200
he washed his hands of us.

531
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,920
So, that's why you didn't tell us either.

532
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:31,080
Sometimes getting over cancer
is easier than accepting your family.

533
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,320
Well, that, and I liked
listening to your stories better.

534
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,120
I heard you, assholes.

535
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,840
So that's where your family trauma
and hypochondria came from.

536
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,240
No, that's where my desire
to study medicine came from.

537
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,680
I read everything.

538
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,440
I was so scared that…

539
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:00,200
the only way I could accept it was
by knowing everything about my illness.

540
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,440
And I got hooked.

541
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,320
You got hooked.

542
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,400
We'll tell Rodri
when he makes it through this.

543
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,360
For sure.

544
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,280
SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

545
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,960
I'M GOING TO SEE RODRI,
WILL YOU COME WITH ME?

546
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,400
OKAY. I'LL GIVE YOU
A CALL WHEN I GET THERE.

547
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,480
Easy, Pablo. Breathe.

548
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,680
Let's go!

549
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,520
Breathe. You're doing great.

550
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,480
What happened?

551
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,080
I gave him breakfast
and he started screaming.

552
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,920
Pablo, look at me.
Does it hurt here? Here?

553
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:02,000
Look at me. We'll give you
a painkiller to take away the pain.

554
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,840
-Get a metamizole.
-Don't go.

555
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,040
Look at me. I'm right here.
I'm not going anywhere.

556
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,840
Breathe. We're going
to take away the pain now.

557
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,000
It's just a pinch.

558
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,560
Well done, Pablo.

559
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,960
That's it.

560
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,160
There we go. All done.

561
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,320
-Find someone to get him in bed.
-Okay.

562
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,240
It's over.

563
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,320
Dr. Sader, the initial report
specified that the patient

564
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,920
had vaginal abrasions
compatible with rape.

565
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,040
It said that.

566
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,720
Due to the exceptional
circumstances of this case,

567
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,800
the gynecologist who wrote the report
can't participate in the hearing,

568
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,840
but you were there
at the time of the examination.

569
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,160
You're her resident.

570
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,560
That's right.

571
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,480
Do you consider that the report
was correct in its assessment?

572
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,480
I couldn't…

573
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,520
I couldn't see well.

574
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,720
I was behind
while Dr. Santapau examined her.

575
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,880
But you saw something.

576
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,360
I'll repeat the question.

577
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,440
Do you consider that Dr. Santapau's
assessment was correct?

578
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,760
I couldn't…

579
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,240
I couldn't see.
I couldn't examine her well.

580
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,600
I'm sorry,
but I can't say anything for sure.

581
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,080
All right. That will be all.

582
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,080
You're excused.

583
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,160
In the State's case
against Hugo Jornet Santapau,

584
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,880
given the severity of the charges
and the evidence against him,

585
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,400
the accused will remain
in custody until the trial.

586
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,720
Hugo, don't worry.
We knew this could happen.

587
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,640
Don't worry.

588
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,240
-Don't worry, Hugo.
-I'm sorry.

589
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,720
-It's okay.
-Don't worry.

590
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,640
Mom.

591
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,080
-Are these all the X-rays?
-Yes.

592
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,880
Due to the amount of fatty tissue,
the images aren't very clear.

593
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,120
His labs show elevated levels
of white blood cells and lactate.

594
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,480
That can be caused by many things.

595
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,200
-Have you done a CT scan?
-He won't fit in the machine.

596
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,680
We can't operate
without knowing what it is.

597
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,360
Especially on a patient of his size.
Surgery could be very dangerous.

598
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,200
We can't just let him die.

599
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,120
Got any ideas?

600
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,960
-Let's go.
-This way, please.

601
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,800
Make way, please.

602
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,280
Is it that way?

603
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,160
-Yes, in there.
-We have to go in?

604
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,080
-Excuse me.
-Move aside, please.

605
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,280
This is my first ever human patient.

606
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,960
-You know it's a CT for animals, right?
-It'll be fine. Hurry.

607
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,760
Look out.

608
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,200
-It's that way.
-Careful. Slowly. Come on.

609
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:32,040
He has intestinal ischemia
and part of his colon is already necrotic.

610
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,400
We have to take him to Sorolla
and operate immediately.

611
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,240
Okay. Thank you.

612
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:44,680
-No, Emilio, it won't cost that much.
-A private hospital will ruin us.

613
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,160
-COVID had to be of some use.
-The press will destroy us.

614
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,760
Just listen to me.
Please, I'm begging you.

615
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,400
-Shit.
-What is it, Patricia?

616
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,320
Nothing, I left my hair thing.

617
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,440
-It's a huge expense.
-Trust me.

618
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,240
Look, the patients from the fair
will be thrilled to be in a medical hotel.

619
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,480
-They may be, but--
-They're not that sick.

620
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,080
It's not about that.
We have to figure out…

621
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,120
Hello.

622
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,240
…how to justify it.

623
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,800
They'll have two doctors and two nurses.

624
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,640
I think we need
to work this out in a meeting.

625
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,040
Monitoring is stable.

626
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,520
All right.

627
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,920
Okay, let's start.

628
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,960
You should be proud,
you saved that patient's life.

629
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,120
Clean.

630
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,040
Are you okay?

631
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,440
-Sponges.
-Here you go.

632
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:36,040
Do you need me for the surgery?
I'd like to go and see my brother.

633
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,120
I can manage on my own. Go.

634
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:07,320
Have you been here all this time?
You won't believe what happened.

635
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,920
What's wrong?

636
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,400
Jésica…

637
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:17,960
Rodri…

638
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,520
-What?
-I'm sorry.

639
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,640
I'm so sorry.

640
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,520
I've been calling. It just happened.

641
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,520
No.

642
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,640
No!

643
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,120
It's okay.

644
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,800
It's okay.

645
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,120
-Where's Jésica?
-We had to sedate her.

646
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,680
Her parents must be about to arrive.

647
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,240
I'll go and help Pilar
tell them what happened, okay?

648
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,160
All right.

649
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,520
Stay strong.

650
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,000
What do we do now?

651
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,800
Now? Nothing.

652
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,120
We can't let this stand.

653
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,840
There have to be consequences.

654
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,800
We're going to stop.

655
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,440
Five-minute sit-down strike?

656
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,160
No. We're going to stop.

657
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,720
And stop completely.

658
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:12,560
