1
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,120
No, come on!

2
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,240
Come on!

3
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,240
Rodri.

4
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,000
How are you?

5
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,800
You'll see in a few days,
or in a few weeks…

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,200
What happened to you is normal.

7
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,760
It'll happen to us all.
It comes with the job.

8
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,160
Ready? They want to see us.

9
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,280
Don't worry.

10
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,600
Good luck.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,880
Head high, we take the heat and carry on.

12
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,000
-What happened to you is--
-Yeah.

13
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,720
Rodri, I mean it. Hey.

14
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,000
Rodri, what…

15
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,560
What happened to you sucks,
but it's part of the job.

16
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,080
Okay? It doesn't make you a bad doctor.

17
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,760
Rodrigo, come in.

18
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,400
I'll come in with him.
I was his attending.

19
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,480
-He's my responsibility.
-We'll listen to him, then you.

20
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,880
Rodri.

21
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,080
Look after him in there, okay?

22
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,440
Don't worry.

23
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,880
I mean it. I don't want him
to do anything stupid.

24
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,560
He seems very upset.

25
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,320
Please.

26
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,960
BREATHLESS

27
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,480
Odalis's mother claims
this isn't her signature,

28
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,680
that she didn't consent
to the surgery. Is that true?

29
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,960
Rodrigo, we're here
to understand what happened,

30
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,560
so please tell us.

31
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,280
Why is the Chief of Psychiatry here?

32
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,040
To assess if I'm lying or if I was
in my right mind during the surgery?

33
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,200
No, Rodrigo.

34
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,280
I'm here to help you.
We're all here for the same thing.

35
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,760
We understand the impact
losing a patient can have on a doctor.

36
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,160
I imagine you know
the hospital has insurance to cover

37
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,920
lawsuits for complications
a doctor may have with a patient.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,600
-It's hard to screw up as much as you.
-We all make mistakes.

39
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,960
We need to clear up the signature thing.

40
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,720
-Did you forge it?
-Pilar, you're not helping.

41
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,680
Okay, let's all relax a little.

42
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,120
There's no need to argue because of me.

43
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,080
If you think I should leave,
I'm willing to quit my job right now.

44
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,920
Rodrigo, I don't think you get it.
That's not your biggest problem.

45
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,560
No insurance covers forged documents.

46
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,320
If the family decides to file
a criminal case against you,

47
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,960
you could end up in jail.

48
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,440
Madam President,
many thought that due to your illness,

49
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,480
you'd step down temporarily.

50
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,760
And miss out
on the biggest tourism fair in Europe?

51
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,720
No way!

52
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,720
Of course not. I'll remain
the president of the Region of Valencia

53
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,000
as long as you want.

54
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,880
I'm grateful to the opposition
for making me strong and brave enough

55
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,720
to face and win any battle.

56
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
Right on, queen!

57
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,960
-Thanks.
-So brave!

58
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,080
President, we have more questions.

59
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,640
Thank you, dear.

60
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,720
PATRICIA SEGURA OPENS TOURISM FAIR

61
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,680
Brave!

62
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,680
Beautiful!

63
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,280
Gorgeous!

64
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,120
Wait here a moment.

65
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,720
Joana, right? Come with me.

66
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,160
Don't worry, they'll wait outside.

67
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,080
After you.

68
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,000
Check the reports are complete
and fill out these forms.

69
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,920
On it.

70
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,680
We'll leave you
for a moment to get changed, okay?

71
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,360
Don't worry, this will be over soon.

72
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,160
Did you shower after the assault?

73
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,160
Yes, I couldn't bear it.

74
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,360
Don't worry, it doesn't matter.

75
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,440
Go on, get changed.

76
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,640
-Never judge a rape victim.
-I didn't say anything.

77
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,440
They feel doubted
with every look, every silence.

78
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,280
We have to make the exam
as painless as possible, got it?

79
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,000
No! Damn it.

80
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,520
For fuck's sake.

81
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,160
-Bad day or what?
-I got an XL out by mistake.

82
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,000
I'll be showing patients
my ass all day again.

83
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,440
Hey, I thought I saw Dr. Donoso
holding hands with the director.

84
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,640
They seem pretty close, huh?

85
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,040
That's normal
when you're screwing someone.

86
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,600
Jesus, Biel. You're always
last to find out gossip, man.

87
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,600
Hey, can I ask you something?

88
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,280
How reliable are
those HIV tests from the pharmacy?

89
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,960
Why?

90
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,600
Don't screw with me.

91
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,880
Don't screw with me, Biel.
I forgot to take PrEP a few days.

92
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,960
I'm freaking out.

93
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,280
They're only kind of reliable.

94
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,120
They're very sensitive,
but not very precise.

95
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,960
False positives can occur.

96
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,240
Take a test here to know for sure.

97
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,560
I don't know if I'll be able to face it.

98
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,320
So what will you do?
Pretend everything's okay?

99
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,120
You need to know,
and the sooner the better.

100
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,520
I'll go with you and get tested too.

101
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,760
-Can't hurt to be sure.
-Did you have unprotected sex?

102
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,520
You don't need a test.
You're a hypochondriac.

103
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,560
You could use some psychotherapy.

104
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,400
The first thing we'll do
is take a blood sample.

105
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,680
The nurses usually do this,

106
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,480
but they're swamped,
so I'll take care of it.

107
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,800
But anyway, the fewer of us the better.

108
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,160
Okay.

109
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,440
It's just a tiny pinch.
You won't even feel it.

110
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,320
There we go. See?

111
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,920
Now, while we take your blood,

112
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,440
if you like, you can tell us
what happened. It might help.

113
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,520
All right, don't worry.

114
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,200
We're here to listen to you.

115
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
I'm almost done.

116
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,760
There we go. See?

117
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,720
And now,

118
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,240
press down there.

119
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,480
That's it, press hard.

120
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,440
Now, when you're ready,
put one leg here and the other here, okay?

121
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,120
May I?

122
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,200
We'll start the examination.

123
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,040
I don't know if this is a good idea.
I shouldn't be here.

124
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,200
It's okay.

125
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,160
It's okay.

126
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,200
I don't know
if he forced me or I consented.

127
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,760
-I was so high, I don't remember.
-Want to know a secret?

128
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,040
When a woman reports
a sexual assault to the police,

129
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,200
it's because the assault happened.

130
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,880
-Actually, Leo, the rate--
-Anything else to say?

131
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,520
Let's start, okay?

132
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,080
Relax.

133
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,720
Rodri, I've been looking for you.

134
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,760
-Where are you going?
-I quit.

135
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,440
-I'm resigning.
-What? No. Hey!

136
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,640
Why didn't you defend yourself?

137
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,040
Rodri, stop.

138
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,840
-You didn't forge anything.
-Yeah.

139
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,920
-It was the girl's brother.
-But I let him do it.

140
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,320
-I won't throw dirt at the brother.
-So you're going to eat it yourself?

141
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,400
Do you want to go to jail?

142
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,160
Fine. If you won't talk to him, I will.

143
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,560
-No, don't you dare.
-Yes.

144
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,080
You hear me? I'm the only one
to blame for that girl's death.

145
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,000
-No.
-Yes.

146
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,080
-No.
-So don't…

147
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,360
-Just leave it alone.
-No!

148
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,480
We should've never
left you alone in the OR.

149
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,200
Give yourself another chance.

150
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,960
Look, I talked to Neus.
She can fit you in this afternoon.

151
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,160
-Talking will do you good.
-Talking won't help at all.

152
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,280
I'm not cut out for this.

153
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,200
-What did you say to him?
-What?

154
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,720
What's wrong with you?
Have a little empathy.

155
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,640
Well, I'll have more empathy
when you're more honest.

156
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,800
Your boyfriend is
the director of this hospital?

157
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,360
-That's why you're like this?
-Weren't you going to tell me?

158
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,120
No, actually.

159
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,760
I didn't think it concerned you.

160
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,240
-No?
-No.

161
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,720
It doesn't concern me,

162
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,240
a lousy resident who screwed
the hospital director's girlfriend?

163
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,240
Damn it, Jésica, I'll get fired.

164
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,600
Well, don't worry,
because it won't happen again.

165
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,920
What a bitch…

166
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,760
Hey!

167
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,120
Hi.

168
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,880
Come in, don't just stand there.

169
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,640
-How are you?
-Screwed, to be honest.

170
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,400
But hey, I'm alive.

171
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,000
Hey…

172
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,080
It was you, right?
Who brought me to the hospital.

173
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,000
No.

174
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,520
I think it was.

175
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,560
Thank you.

176
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,120
You saved my life.

177
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,160
No, I didn't do anything.
I just took you to the ambulance.

178
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,840
Well, the doctors told me I could've died.

179
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,640
Wait a second, let me check something.

180
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,800
Okay.

181
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,280
That's good.

182
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,240
And the swelling?

183
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,040
Okay, it's better.

184
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,480
Listen…

185
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,040
You won't tell your mom
that you and I… know each other?

186
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,600
No, don't worry. I won't tell on you.

187
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,320
Besides, I don't even know your name.

188
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,360
It's Enrique, but you can call me Quique.

189
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,040
Crazy that you were eating my ass
two days ago and I didn't know your name.

190
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,760
Well, you don't exactly go
to those places to make friends.

191
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,120
Hey, can I ask you something?

192
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,920
Sure, what is it?

193
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,440
My HIV test came back positive.

194
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,880
My mom says the viral load is very low
and there are two possibilities.

195
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,720
Either it's a false positive,

196
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,080
or the infection is very recent
and isn't fully showing.

197
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,000
I have to get retested
and see what happens, but…

198
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,080
I'm really freaking out,
and I can't talk to my mom.

199
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,000
How likely is it
that it's a false positive?

200
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,760
I don't know.

201
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,320
You know, that's not my specialty,
so I can't help you.

202
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,800
But I'm glad you're better.
Take care of yourself, okay?

203
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,240
It's unbelievable.
That's why I pay insurance?

204
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,200
-What a joke.
-Let's try to calm down.

205
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,840
The entire hospital doesn't need to know.

206
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,400
-I mean, even I don't know.
-I won't calm down, damn it!

207
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,520
I go to the private hospital
and they treat me like a star,

208
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,600
all that's missing is the champagne.

209
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,520
And then,

210
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,720
they tell me the treatment will cost
200,000 euros, and that money aside…

211
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
"Money aside"!

212
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,840
As if 200,000 euros were peanuts.

213
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,160
If they had the chance
to be treated by Dr. Moa at Sorolla,

214
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,640
they wouldn't hesitate.

215
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,240
Is that why we're here?
For you to be treated by him again?

216
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,680
It's my life, Emilio.

217
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,560
What the hell do you expect me to do?

218
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,240
Well, let's see what the results say,
but I have full confidence in Dr. Moa.

219
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,440
-Don't worry, everything will be fine.
-Yeah.

220
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,560
-Are you nervous?
-A little.

221
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,840
-Sure.
-I've had two rounds of chemo.

222
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,680
I'll come as many times as I have to.

223
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,200
Patricia.

224
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,520
It's good to see you. Shall we go in?

225
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,960
Yes.

226
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,560
Doctor, here she is.

227
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,840
Hi, Patricia. How are you?

228
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,440
-Are we on a first-name basis?
-As you prefer.

229
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,720
Well, I'd prefer to be somewhere else,

230
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,040
I'd prefer not to have cancer,
and I'd prefer another doctor.

231
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,000
Nevertheless, you're back.

232
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,600
Yes, because I'll do
whatever it takes to beat this disease.

233
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,800
Here, we prefer to think
that cancer isn't beaten, it's cured.

234
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,280
-Are you correcting me?
-No.

235
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,320
You are a little.

236
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,200
Women don't like being corrected.
We've put up with it for centuries.

237
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,240
All I meant is we've been trying
to get rid of the warlike language.

238
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,600
Get rid of what you like,
but I will defeat this cancer.

239
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,160
-With cannon fire if need be.
-That's the spirit.

240
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,320
Thanks.

241
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,520
That's how you treat a patient.

242
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,960
So, where do we start?

243
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,240
Román.

244
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,480
How are you, Doctor?

245
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,840
I thought I saw you
talking to my son earlier.

246
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,400
Yeah.

247
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,240
I was on the floor
and we talked about some stuff.

248
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,360
I'm glad he's talking to someone.

249
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,120
Since he got out of surgery,
he's barely said a word.

250
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,960
Especially not to me.

251
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,920
As if everything were my fault.

252
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,480
How can anyone be so damn reckless?

253
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,400
Well, Doctor, maybe your son feels judged.

254
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,240
He's trying to get my attention
to show me I haven't been there

255
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,240
and I haven't been
the mom he wanted, or whatever.

256
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,960
Sorry, I don't know
why I'm telling you all this.

257
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,360
No, don't worry, Doctor.
I'm here if you need someone to talk to.

258
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,560
There's no need, thank you.

259
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,240
But talk to him
if you think he could use it.

260
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,640
Being alike, you'll understand each other.

261
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,960
-What do you mean "alike"?
-Aren't you gay too?

262
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,400
But it's fine if you don't want to.

263
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,880
I'll help him in my own way.

264
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,320
First, by getting him well.

265
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,120
And then,

266
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,400
I'll find out
whoever the hell did this to him

267
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,320
and make them regret it
for the rest of their life.

268
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,760
-Your labs are perfect.
-Hello, President.

269
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,080
If you're feeling up to it,
we should start today. Now.

270
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,360
And don't worry,
the first session won't be too tough.

271
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,560
I don't think you'll feel
any nausea or dizziness.

272
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,640
If you stay, I'll tell the nurses
which medication you need.

273
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,560
Hey.

274
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,080
Remember your campaign slogan?

275
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,720
"Ever onward."

276
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,240
They were so pleased with it.

277
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,680
Okay, let's start.
I have a ton of meetings later.

278
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,080
Maybe you should take
the rest of the day off.

279
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,120
Didn't he say it wouldn't be tough?

280
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,760
All right, where do I sit?

281
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,080
-Over here.
-Here…

282
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,480
-Here?
-Yeah.

283
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,400
-Tell me if you're comfortable.
-Okay.

284
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,160
Hi, sweetheart. How are you?

285
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,840
I'll get the treatment
and be right with you, okay?

286
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,080
I don't know what's worse,
her calling me "sweetheart" or this chair.

287
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,040
I don't get why it all has to be so ugly.

288
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,760
Patricia, look at me.

289
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,320
Do you see what's happening?

290
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,520
I'm showing that I'm privileged?
That I'm a snob?

291
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,800
That I'm scared.

292
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,120
And it's normal to be.

293
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,960
But don't let the fear take over.

294
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,720
All right, what do you do when you have
a big problem you don't know how to face?

295
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,760
When your political rivals are determined
to take you down and destroy you?

296
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,680
Well, I put on
my president's armor and carry on.

297
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,920
But I don't think armor works here.

298
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,960
You're as much the president here
as you are of the Valencian Government.

299
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,960
Right?

300
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,720
-Thank you.
-Come on.

301
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,040
-Here we go.
-Here we go.

302
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,080
Verónica Baldayo.

303
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,600
Yes, here.

304
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,920
Just a moment, Verónica.

305
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,520
Joana, are you okay?

306
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,720
What are you doing here?

307
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,080
I remembered he ripped this off when…

308
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,800
-It could have his fingerprints, right?
-For sure.

309
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,120
Why didn't you take it
straight to the police?

310
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,440
Joana, what is it?

311
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,600
There weren't any injuries, right?

312
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,160
In the examination, I mean.

313
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,560
I thought about it after.

314
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,760
Because the police
kept asking me if I fought back.

315
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,520
But I was so high.

316
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,040
I even showered. I'm such an idiot.

317
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,800
Sweetheart, you're not guilty of anything.

318
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,480
The only one to blame here
is the bastard who raped you.

319
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,640
Yeah, but he'll get away with it.
It's his word against mine.

320
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,640
Don't worry, he won't get away with it.
Not after the judge reads my report.

321
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,640
-But you just said there was nothing.
-I said that? Did you hear me say that?

322
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,720
-No.
-Then that's that.

323
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,200
Manuel, next time, after the wine,
have some water too, okay?

324
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,600
I don't drink anymore.

325
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,600
-I don't believe that.
-Excuse me, Doctor. Can we talk?

326
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,720
Hey, it's Mr. Pupils!
Well, I'm a little busy.

327
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,920
-If you want to talk, give me a hand.
-Okay.

328
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,160
Look, about the other day…

329
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,080
I swear I had no idea that kid
was Dr. Amaro's son. How could I?

330
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:27,880
But now his mom's desperate
to find whoever did this to her son.

331
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,160
And you don't want her
to know it was you and thank you.

332
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,240
Obviously,
because I didn't do anything to him.

333
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,040
And, well,

334
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,280
I wanted to thank you
for keeping this between us.

335
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,800
I don't like hiding things,
especially something that big.

336
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,400
Know how many points
I'd score with that hard-ass Amaro?

337
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,520
Rocío.

338
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,000
Please.

339
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,720
I didn't tell,
but if she asks again, maybe I will.

340
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,520
Seriously? Is that how
we have each other's backs?

341
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,240
I'm not the one
who showed up high, so relax.

342
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,320
All done, Manuel.

343
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,040
-My colleague will dress the wound.
-Thank you, Doctor.

344
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,680
Bitch.

345
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,640
Get these in the shot.
Show me in the trenches.

346
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,640
Please, stop.

347
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,440
Patricia, can you explain…
Stop! What's going on here?

348
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,160
We're almost done. Besides,
I have Dr. De Felipe's permission.

349
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,920
Biel, did you really allow her
to set up this circus?

350
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,480
There are other patients.
You're not alone.

351
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,800
They need care, peace,
rest, and above all, privacy.

352
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,680
None of the patients will be in the photo.

353
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,520
I'm happy to be in the photo.

354
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,440
You see?

355
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,120
Now, Biel,
tell him you advised me to do it.

356
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,080
Patricia, why would I say that?

357
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,840
All right,
that's not exactly what you said.

358
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,880
You told me to face this
the way I usually face my problems.

359
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,760
And I only know one way.

360
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,600
Working. Being president.
So that's what I'm doing.

361
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,960
Do you want to be in the photo?

362
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,480
Manuel, a photo.

363
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,400
Manuel.

364
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,840
Five minutes, Patricia.

365
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,520
Then they're out.

366
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,720
-Patricia, please.
-Just a little longer.

367
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,960
I'm just getting to grips with this.

368
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,520
Leo, I think you made a mistake here.

369
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,040
Where?

370
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,200
On Joana Martorell's report.
It says there were vaginal abrasions.

371
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,960
Because there were.

372
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,040
I didn't see any.

373
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,520
Hence you're a resident
and I'm an attending.

374
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,680
Hey.

375
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,720
-Hey.
-How are you?

376
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,040
-Okay, I guess.
-Did you talk to your brother?

377
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,040
Yes, but…

378
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,280
he won't listen.

379
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,280
I'll ask my parents to come
to try and convince him.

380
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,240
This is going to be a shitstorm.

381
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,640
God knows how we'll fix it.

382
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,880
Listen…

383
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,520
I was thinking,
if your parents are coming,

384
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,040
it might be a good time to tell them.

385
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,960
No?

386
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,120
Oh, sure.

387
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:47,080
"Hey, your son might end up in jail,
but I've got myself a boyfriend."

388
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,080
It sounds good to me, actually.

389
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,920
-I'm going.
-No, wait a minute. Don't go.

390
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
-I have to go.
-Stay for a moment.

391
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,440
-I have to go.
-Don't leave me like this.

392
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,360
I'm going.

393
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,400
She's always ridiculing me.

394
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,840
I don't get why she hates me so much.
Is it the hijab? Or the pregnancy?

395
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,000
Or because I don't share
her outdated feminist ideas?

396
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,800
Shouldn't there be more sisterhood
between us? What's the point?

397
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,600
-Here, the anesthesia consent forms.
-Thanks.

398
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,000
I don't know why the hell
I thought she'd help me out.

399
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,960
Goddamn hospital.
Goddamn shitty team spirit.

400
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,600
Everyone's out for themselves.
Well, I'll be first.

401
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:33,520
I'll make a killing as an anesthetist
at a private hospital, screw it!

402
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,800
-Language, Quique. I have a baby in here.
-You have the mouth of a trucker!

403
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,480
-From this morning.
-To the lab.

404
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,000
Go on then, spit it out.

405
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,520
Who's annoyed you so much
that you won't even listen to me?

406
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,600
If even you guys
won't listen to me, I give up.

407
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,400
You know that bitch from the ER?

408
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,440
Rocío Fuster?

409
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,440
It rings a bell. Yeah.

410
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,200
All done, sweetheart.

411
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,160
-How are you feeling?
-Fine.

412
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,640
Fine, right? It wasn't so bad, was it?

413
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,760
All right, you can get up now.
Careful, you might get dizzy.

414
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,080
-Okay?
-My bag.

415
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,000
Here.

416
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,480
-Okay.
-Are you okay?

417
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,040
-Do you need help?
-No.

418
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,840
Take it easy. Don't worry, it's normal.

419
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,040
Don't worry, it's normal.

420
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,720
-Better?
-No.

421
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,040
-No?
-Not better.

422
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,640
One second. You can take this one in.

423
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,040
-Okay.
-Just a moment.

424
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,240
Press firmly, we'll be right with you.
How's your breathing? Better.

425
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,400
How are we over here?
You'll feel better once I give you the IV.

426
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,880
-Oriol! Come and help me, please.
-Coming.

427
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,080
-Did she come from a costume party?
-How should I know?

428
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,600
When it rains, it pours!

429
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,280
What the hell is this?

430
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,360
-What is this?
-They're from the fair.

431
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,320
Mass food poisoning. Looks bad.

432
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,200
How many interns do we have?
I want them all to help.

433
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,320
-They've been called.
-Okay. It's all right.

434
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,040
-Oriol!
-Coming.

435
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,480
How could she be vomiting? It's impossible
for the chemo to cause nausea so suddenly.

436
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,200
-Where is she?
-I don't know. I left her there resting.

437
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,520
-Excuse me, have you seen the president?
-No.

438
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,720
She left to deal
with a crisis at the tourism fair.

439
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,640
What crisis?

440
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,640
You let her go?

441
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,880
It's all under control.
We believe it was food poisoning.

442
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,480
The most serious cases
are being hospitalized.

443
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:12,120
Doctors believe that with rest
and the right medication,

444
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,520
it will all blow over.

445
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,080
I think you're minimizing…

446
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,640
The ER is a mess.

447
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,160
Over 350 people affected and counting.

448
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,080
I think we're dealing
with a major health crisis.

449
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,920
-What's Patricia doing there?
-She looks pale and dizzy.

450
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,280
-Get her back here.
-Why's that?

451
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,880
She was at the fair before chemo.
If she ate there, she probably has it too.

452
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,800
-She could be dehydrated.
-We'll find solutions.

453
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,600
-I want her under observation.
-It's all under control.

454
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,640
-I'll see you in my office.
-We have other urgent matters.

455
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,840
Thank you very much.

456
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,920
Rodri! We're going to the hospital.

457
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,360
Mass food poisoning, they're swamped.

458
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,760
Count me out.

459
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,240
Listen to me, okay?

460
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,800
Enough.

461
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,240
Dude, you have to find
a way to forgive yourself.

462
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,840
I can't!

463
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,560
Yes, you can. Rodri…

464
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,680
I went along with what
my dad and my sister wanted.

465
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,480
It was what I had to do, but…

466
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,080
I'm not like them.
I'm not doctor material.

467
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,720
-I'm a danger there.
-Listen to me, Rodri.

468
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,000
You don't have to be
like your sister to be a good doctor.

469
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,160
There are many ways to be one.

470
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,880
You're a good listener.
You notice how people feel.

471
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,320
I'm telling you this so patients
don't miss out on a doctor like you.

472
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,840
So you know what? You're coming with me.

473
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,360
Because I know
there's still a doctor inside you.

474
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,120
Okay.

475
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,720
-Go on then.
-Yeah?

476
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,120
-When will I be seen?
-I know. Just a moment, please.

477
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,440
We're swamped. I'll be right with you.

478
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,680
Yikes…

479
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,680
Come on, Rodri. Let's go.

480
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,120
-Rodri, you came.
-Yes, and I'm already regretting it.

481
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,920
None of that.

482
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,640
Come on, attend to this lady.
Check her vitals, temperature…

483
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,800
Heart rate, blood pressure,
and give her an IV to rehydrate her.

484
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,800
-Go for it.
-Ma'am, how are you?

485
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,480
I need to take your vitals.

486
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,200
You have reached Patricia Segura.
Please leave a message.

487
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,520
I can't get through to her.

488
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,600
I called her cell,
her house, even the government.

489
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,880
But they ignored me.

490
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,920
I can't find her file.
Who's her emergency contact?

491
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,840
Let me see.

492
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,880
-Could something have happened?
-One of her people would've let us know.

493
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,840
Here it is.

494
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,320
Eight, seven, two, two.

495
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,840
I'm calling.

496
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,080
-Emilio Alto?
-Yes?

497
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,920
-I'm calling from Sorolla.
-What happened? Where's Patricia?

498
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,720
-Sorry?
-I'm trying to find her.

499
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,640
-No, she's not here, that's why--
-What do you mean?

500
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,720
-She was really dizzy.
-What?

501
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,200
She was feeling awful.

502
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,600
-What have we got?
-A big mess.

503
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,160
-Who should I go to?
-Him.

504
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,160
-Coming.
-Sorry.

505
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,080
All right.

506
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,040
Evening, sir. How are you feeling?
Does your stomach hurt?

507
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,000
Damn it, come on!

508
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,640
-Blanca! Hurry.
-Coming.

509
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,920
-Call an attending, he's vomiting blood.
-I will, but do something, Rodri.

510
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,040
Look, this isn't just blood.

511
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,480
Wine?

512
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,200
Cirrhosis? Okay.

513
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,840
His esophageal varices must have burst.

514
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,920
He needs a balloon
to stop the bleeding. Call Gastro.

515
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,960
Patricia!

516
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,600
Patricia!

517
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,320
-Patricia!
-Patricia!

518
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,280
Biel, look over there.

519
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,520
Patricia!

520
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,320
Patricia!

521
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,680
Patricia!

522
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,320
-Stay awake.
-No one's available.

523
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,720
-What? He needs an endoscopy!
-They're all busy.

524
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,520
We're losing her, Doctor.

525
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,840
Rodri!

526
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,320
Rodri! Eighty over forty.

527
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,320
He's dying! Someone has
to put in the balloon now!

528
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,160
-You're the doctor.
-I'm a fucking resident!

529
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,560
I see a doctor
who wants to save his patient.

530
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,840
You're all he's got.

531
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,200
Shit.

532
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,320
Shit. Okay, let's try it.
Tell me you can get a balloon.

533
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,520
Right away.

534
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,800
Sir, come on. I need you to sit up.

535
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,440
Patricia! She's in the bathroom!

536
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,960
-Low blood pressure and rapid pulse.
-Call an ambulance. Move aside.

537
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,600
Patricia.

538
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,200
Tell me your name.

539
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,320
What? Pedro?

540
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,080
You'll be fine.
Stay awake, Pedro. Look at me.

541
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,920
Okay, we've got it.

542
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,600
The balloon goes in through the nose.
It's uncomfortable, but hang in there.

543
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,600
Come on.

544
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,080
It won't go in.
I'll try through the throat.

545
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,240
-Okay.
-I need you to swallow.

546
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,480
There, swallow.
Just a moment. Hang in there.

547
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,840
Swallow. Good.

548
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,520
I think I'm in the stomach.

549
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,480
Come on.

550
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,320
This is…

551
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,960
thirty.

552
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,920
Sixty in the esophagus.
Come on, Pedro, hang in there.

553
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,360
Come on, sir.

554
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,000
Is he better?

555
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,720
Have we got it?

556
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,800
We've got it.

557
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,000
You showed real guts.

558
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,000
Patricia. That's it.

559
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,400
Open your eyes. Open them.

560
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,640
That's it. Look at me.

561
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,560
Good.

562
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,200
Are you with me?

563
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,080
Doctor?

564
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,080
Yes?

565
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,480
Are we on a first-name basis now?

566
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,040
It seems like it.

567
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:56,440
-What are you doing out of your room?
-I was going crazy in there.

568
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,920
Listen, you just had a craniotomy.
You shouldn't even be on your feet yet.

569
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,080
-Being like this sucks.
-You need to take it easy, stay in bed.

570
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,800
-You'll be back to normal in no time.
-Back to normal?

571
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,200
I don't think I'll ever be back to normal.

572
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
What happened to you sucks,
but it's not the end of the world.

573
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,800
You're not waiting
for life-changing results.

574
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,920
How do you know?

575
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,680
How do you know
I'm not waiting for results too?

576
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,520
Or I already got them
and I'm HIV positive?

577
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,680
No fucking way. You gave it to me?

578
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:41,000
Well, I hope not,
because I take pre-exposure prophylaxis,

579
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:45,560
but the reality is, Óscar,
when we have unprotected sex at a party

580
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,320
with strangers whose sex lives
we know nothing about,

581
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,600
we're taking a risk.

582
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,800
I don't even take PrEP, man.

583
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,840
I'm such an idiot.

584
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,520
Look.

585
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,640
Worst-case scenario?

586
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,560
You're confirmed positive.

587
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,200
And if that does happen,
it won't change your life that much.

588
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,480
Nowadays, there are worse diagnoses.
Diabetes, for example.

589
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,600
But whatever happens,
I know you'll be able to handle it.

590
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,680
You'll see.

591
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,360
All right.

592
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,200
Thanks.

593
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,760
-Hey, you've got something there.
-I think it's vomit.

594
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,800
Oh.

595
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,400
We'll stabilize you right away.

596
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,640
Can we say that we've won
the first battle, Doctor?

597
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,560
-Well, if you want to call it that.
-Yes, I do. Now to win the war.

598
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,440
-Malena.
-Doctor, can you look at my head?

599
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,560
One moment, please. Give me 16's chart.

600
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,320
-Thanks.
-The hero of the day.

601
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,560
-You can do up your shirt.
-I saved a drunk.

602
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,800
A patient, who would've died
if it weren't for you.

603
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,960
See how this hospital needs you?

604
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,480
When will we be seen? It's been hours!

605
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,920
Hey.

606
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,800
Hey.

607
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,600
What's up?

608
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,080
-How are you feeling?
-Well, tired.

609
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,600
And you? How's the little one?

610
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,320
Sick of being in a hospital, like her mom.

611
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,240
Go home. Don't you see
it's no good for the baby?

612
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,280
The last thing I need is Leo
giving me more of a hard time.

613
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,480
You knew her well, right?

614
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,840
Kind of.

615
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,840
Enough to know if she'd be
capable of forging a rape report?

616
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,480
Damn, that's a serious accusation.

617
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,040
Yeah, I know, Ro.
But I'm almost certain she did.

618
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,080
-I don't know what to do.
-Nothing. You don't have to do anything.

619
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,200
First, you don't want
to start a war with your attending.

620
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,200
And second, we doctors
always save each other's asses.

621
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,480
Always?

622
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,000
So you won't tell on Quique to Dr. Amaro?

623
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,480
To save his ass, I mean.

624
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,440
Eat something.

625
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,320
I have to go back to work. Bye.

626
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,760
See you later.

627
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,800
Police station, how can I help?

628
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,880
So, do you think you could
make a sketch of your attacker?

629
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,080
I have something better.

630
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,840
I have his profile.

631
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,120
-Mom, do you need help?
-What?

632
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,400
-Do you need help?
-No.

633
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:13,040
Do you want to watch the series
after dinner or will you study?

634
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,400
-Let's watch the series.
-All right.

635
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,040
I'll get it.

636
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,360
-Hugo Jornet?
-Yes, that's me.

637
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,400
-Come with us.
-I didn't do anything.

638
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,680
-Please.
-Mom! I didn't do anything.

639
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,480
-Sir.
-You're mistaken.

640
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,040
-I didn't do anything.
-What's going on?

641
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,360
-Mom!
-Can you explain, please?

642
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,520
We have a warrant
for his arrest for sexual assault.

643
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,040
-What?
-Mom, I swear I didn't do anything.

644
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,400
Mom!

645
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,880
JOAQUÍN SOROLLA HOSPITAL

646
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,440
VIRAL INFECTION SCREENING
NEGATIVE

647
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,800
Holy shit, thank God!

648
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,800
Come on, sweetheart.
It's not a death sentence.

649
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,880
Come on.

650
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,000
You're not going to die.

651
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,200
Really.

652
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,080
-Congrats, Rodri.
-Thanks.

653
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,160
Well done, Rodri.

654
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,960
Hey, Rodri. Great job in the ER.

655
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,600
-Thanks.
-Congrats, man.

656
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,920
-Thank you. See you later.
-Bye.

657
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,880
-Hey!
-What's up, Rodri?

658
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,360
Doctor.

659
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,560
-Good morning.
-Good--

660
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,560
You have to have very little shame
and dignity to threaten a minor.

661
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,560
I'm sorry? What?

662
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,760
A doctor went to his school
and said if he didn't sign a statement

663
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:18,880
admitting that he decided
to forge my signature at his own risk,

664
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,720
every lawyer in this hospital
would go after him and his family

665
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,600
and leave us with nothing.

666
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,600
I swear to you,
I had nothing to do with that.

667
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,200
I'm sorry, I had no idea.

668
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,960
You're sorry?

669
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:37,280
You have to be a real scumbag.
Wasn't killing her enough?

670
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,640
I'm sorry.

671
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,480
I didn't…

672
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,560
I'm sorry.

673
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,320
This is so you never forget her.

674
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,200
I hope you always carry her
on your conscience.

675
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,720
I don't know what to say.

676
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,960
-Álex.
-Neus!

677
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,840
-What is it?
-Can we talk?

678
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,360
-It's my turn!
-I'll be with you in a moment.

679
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,880
-He should wait!
-I'm so busy, honey. Wait 15 minutes.

680
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,360
-Doctor!
-I'm coming, Rebeca.

681
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,880
Fifteen minutes, Rodrigo.

682
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,840
-Wait for me, honey.
-Thank you.

683
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,400
As of today, I'm no longer a doctor.

684
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,640
I've been blaming the system

685
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:28,520
for leaving us in charge of patients
we don't know how to take care of yet.

686
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,120
It's just that we're so swamped,
we're so overwhelmed.

687
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:38,480
There are barely any attendings
to lead us and we're forced to work alone.

688
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,680
And we're not ready.

689
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,120
But…

690
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:51,040
it doesn't make sense
to blame the system because…

691
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,320
it's me who's the problem.

692
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,320
It's me who shouldn't be here.

693
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,640
I just wanted to say…

694
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:09,880
goodbye.

695
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:17,960
You've all been the best thing
that's happened to me on this journey.

696
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,360
Thank you.

697
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,960
And I love you all.

698
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:34,880
