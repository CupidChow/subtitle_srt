1
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,900
=Princess Across Time=

2
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,460
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,039
Mr. Yao,

4
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,039
later, bring the evidence back
to the police station...

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,719
No, I mean,

6
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,679
to that...

7
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:47,920
What bureau again?

8
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,079
Investigation Bureau.

9
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,240
Doesn't matter.

10
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:51,320
Anyway,

11
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,200
I will do a further investigation.

12
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:54,960
Well,

13
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:57,640
look for Situ Lian's close friend.
I'm going to question them.

14
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,479
Do as she says.
I will keep an eye on her.

15
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:04,380
Yes, Your Highness.

16
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,319
He seemed to have a fight
with Miss Situ that day.

17
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:34,959
Are you saying

18
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,159
that Wu San and Situ Lian
had an argument?

19
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,640
- Be good.
- Let go of me.

20
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,840
Otherwise, I won't let you off.

21
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,319
- You hear me?
- Let go of me!

22
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,319
Trying to run away?

23
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,159
Come here.

24
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,000
You bit me?

25
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,719
Where is Wu San?

26
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,120
I haven't seen him for a while.

27
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,799
How long is "a while"?

28
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,079
About

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,719
a month.

30
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,200
A month?

31
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,159
All right.

32
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,040
You may go.

33
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,280
Yao Tian.

34
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,380
Yes, Your Highness.

35
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:13,479
Look into this man called Wu San.

36
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:14,860
Yes, Your Highness.

37
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,080
Oh, you are quite smart.

38
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,039
All right.

39
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,319
As of now,

40
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:25,639
we have investigated and questioned
as much as we could.

41
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,290
Let's head back to Investigation Bureau
to check on the evidence.

42
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:28,960
Hold on.

43
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,159
Your Highness,

44
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,670
I don't mean to be offensive,

45
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,890
but you should stop interfering
with this case.

46
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,159
What do you mean?

47
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,919
I got it.

48
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,800
Are you afraid
that I will steal your credit?

49
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:42,960
Don't worry.

50
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,479
If His Majesty asks me,

51
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,400
I will surely say

52
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,400
it's all your credits.

53
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,159
Satisfied?

54
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,599
You misunderstood me.

55
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,520
I didn't want any credits.

56
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,390
I just want to seek justice
for the deceased.

57
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:57,039
The thing is,
you are related to this case,

58
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,390
so it's not appropriate for you
to continue investigating.

59
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,240
Didn't I look into the case?

60
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,240
How about this?

61
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:04,960
It's getting later.

62
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,290
Let's return to my residence.
We can talk while eating.

63
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,199
Back to the palace?

64
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,639
Wait.

65
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,879
Do you have a mood to eat
at a time like this?

66
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,439
Did you forget?

67
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,560
Ever since Father entrusted me
to supervise the investigation,

68
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:22,560
we have been living
in the suburban abode for convenience.

69
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,879
Also,

70
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,520
if you don't have the mood to eat,

71
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:30,520
go back to the prison with Mr. Yao
if you want.

72
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:04,639
You!

73
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:05,759
Demon Princess!

74
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:06,879
You...

75
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,879
You are Demon Princess.

76
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:10,800
How dare you speak rudely
to Crown Princess!

77
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,120
Never mind.

78
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,479
It's true I have done
terrible things in the past.

79
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,290
It's understandable
that people are afraid of me.

80
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:18,920
Don't.

81
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,800
No!

82
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:20,959
Spare me.

83
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,759
You... You cast demonic spells!

84
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,680
It's my fault, Your Highness.

85
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,950
I'll have the Investigation Bureau
stop the rumors as soon as possible.

86
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,199
Even if you gather

87
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,399
all the bureau officers here,

88
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,290
can you stop the people
from talking about that?

89
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,879
Mr. Yao,

90
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,160
whether or not I'm the Demon Princess,

91
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,120
I'm afraid you can't
be sure of that, can you?

92
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:44,199
Let's go.

93
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,160
(Zhuxuan Abode)

94
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,639
That one.

95
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,720
This. This one.

96
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:59,040
The food in Crown Prince's place
is indeed delicious.

97
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,399
Qin Xiyue, I thought you weren't in
the mood to eat.

98
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,480
Haven't you heard of this saying?

99
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:09,839
"Don't skip meals
no matter how busy you are."

100
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,040
Your Highness,

101
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,040
Please excuse me.

102
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,040
I need to return to the bureau
to look for evidence.

103
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,879
According to the law,

104
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:21,120
Her Highness must return with me.

105
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,800
Me?

106
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,758
As expected of you, Yao Tian.

107
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,990
You are loyal and bravely just.

108
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,240
Now let me ask you this.

109
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,360
A month ago,

110
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,040
did Crown Princess have a motive?

111
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,639
No.

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,560
Her Highness and Situ Lian
have only met for less than a month.

113
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,800
See?

114
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:41,759
Situ Lian

115
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,600
appeared to have died from a curse,

116
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,199
but in fact, she had already had someone
seal all the windows

117
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,920
a month ago.

118
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,319
What does this suggest?

119
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,959
It suggests she was already threatened

120
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,240
a month ago.

121
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,639
Whether the threat

122
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,560
was posed by a ghost

123
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,560
or a human,

124
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:00,439
the suspicion of me
was merely because someone

125
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:02,800
witnessed me at the crime scene
that night.

126
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,199
My poor reputation

127
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,079
has convinced people to believe
the rumor that I'm possessed by a demon.

128
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,079
Exactly.

129
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,519
The perpetrator has prepared the rumor

130
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,439
a month earlier.

131
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,399
A couple of days ago, Crown Princess
made a scene in Xianyin Pleasure House.

132
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
Your Highness,

133
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,399
Miss Situ Lian says she will wait
for you in the chamber as usual.

134
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,319
Your Highness.

135
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,920
Take her away and beat her to death.

136
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:44,690
Yes, Your Highness.

137
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,519
Stop.

138
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,000
Why stop?

139
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,160
Take her away.

140
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,000
Please spare me.

141
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,150
Don't shoot the messenger.
She has done nothing wrong.

142
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,490
I'm kind enough to discipline her.

143
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,639
She should feel honored
to be beaten to death by me.

144
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,920
The one who sent the message

145
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,550
isn't going to get away
with this easily.

146
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,000
Xianyin Pleasure House
was crowded that day.

147
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,519
Someone must've known

148
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,690
that Crown Princess and Situ Lian
were in bad blood.

149
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,720
So that person took advantage of this
and framed Crown Princess.

150
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,800
So

151
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,079
it's imperative now

152
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,399
to find Wu San.

153
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,900
I suppose Wu San
isn't significant in this case.

154
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,480
On that day, Situ Lian invited me
to her chamber,

155
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,319
saying she had confidential news for me.

156
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,680
It was probably
about the market price investigation

157
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,360
that Father tasked me with.

158
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,360
Situ Lian was likely
silenced by someone.

159
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,480
I see the point now.

160
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,759
I will do my best to capture Wu San.

161
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,130
I will take my leave.

162
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,519
He is a good man

163
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,360
but somehow stubborn.

164
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,690
He is widely known for being loyal,
just, and incorruptible

165
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:48,759
in the Heng State.

166
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,530
That's why he became
an assistant minister at a young age.

167
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,279
Let's go.

168
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,120
Where to?

169
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,360
Go back to sleep.

170
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,920
Sleep?

171
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,279
Who exactly are you?

172
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,959
I...

173
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,519
I'm... I'm Qin Xiyue.

174
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,440
Who else can I be?

175
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,279
I have known her since childhood.

176
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,799
We have been married
for more than a year.

177
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,140
Setting aside the body examination
and investigation,

178
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:51,559
she can't even
do simple arithmetics within 100.

179
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,200
On top of that,
since we got married,

180
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,320
we have been sleeping separately.

181
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:58,200
She has never entered my room.

182
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,440
If you were Qin Xiyue,

183
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,720
the commoner on the street earlier

184
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:06,159
would've been covered in bruises.

185
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,200
Own up now.

186
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:08,759
Who are you?

187
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:11,440
I'm Qin Xiyue.

188
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,039
That was in the past.

189
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:16,559
Now,

190
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,639
I have changed.

191
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:19,919
I have regretted my behavior.

192
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,399
Everyone makes mistakes, don't they?

193
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,960
Qin Xiyue regretted her behavior?

194
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,600
I'm afraid that's even harder to believe
than you casting demonic spells.

195
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,200
Fine, don't believe me.
I'm going back to my room.

196
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,000
No need.

197
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,840
Until I can trust you,

198
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,550
I'm not letting you out of my sight.

199
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,180
What are you trying to do?

200
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:51,759
I...

201
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,790
Blow out the candles and go to bed.

202
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,490
You can sleep with the lights on.

203
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,559
I can't sleep if there are lights.

204
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,279
No.

205
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,720
What's wrong with
blowing out the candles?

206
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,440
If the candles are off,

207
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,480
people might figure that I'm sleeping.

208
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,840
What if intruders barge in?

209
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,039
Such a pain.

210
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,039
I'm going to bed, then.

211
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:13,639
I'm sleepy.

212
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,240
Let me out!

213
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,720
I'm afraid of the dark.

214
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,759
I'm afraid of the dark.

215
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,840
Father, let me out!

216
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,519
I'm afraid of the dark!

217
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,480
What has happened?

218
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:15,480
Are you all right?

219
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,200
What's wrong?

220
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:23,679
One moment.

221
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:24,559
I will summon someone.

222
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,120
Don't go.

223
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,799
Your Highnesses,
why did all the candles go out?

224
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,519
Please continue.

Mother, look at this.

229
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,039
Let me untie it.

230
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:15,080
