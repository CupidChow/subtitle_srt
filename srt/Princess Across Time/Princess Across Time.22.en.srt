00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,900
=Princess Across Time=

2
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,460
=Episode 22=

3
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,159
Your Highnesses,

4
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,439
what are you looking for?

5
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:50,759
Surrender now.

6
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,200
Tell me

7
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:54,600
who is the mastermind,
and I will spare your life.

8
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,960
Your Highness,

9
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,280
this is my territory.

10
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,679
Don't you think

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,240
you sound somewhat funny?

12
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:05,560
After surviving the cliff last time,

13
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,590
you are actually turning
yourself over to me now, huh?

14
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,640
I will grant your wish.

15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,359
Many soldiers have surrounded this place.

16
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:13,319
There's no point resisting.

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,760
Soldiers?

18
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,760
They are coming for you instead.

19
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:00,760
You are twins?

20
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,519
You are indeed smart, Your Highness.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,760
But it's too late to find out.

22
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,000
Let go of her.

23
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,680
Just mind yourself.

24
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,080
Your Highness!

25
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,000
Sister, kill him!

26
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,879
Master will reward us handsomely.

27
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,439
Sister!

28
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,319
Bing'er!

29
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,280
Bing'er, are you all right?

30
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,280
Your Highness, the reinforcement

31
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,039
must've arrived as promised, right?

32
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,240
Exactly.

33
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,140
Yue Xin has already
deployed troops outside.

34
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:11,439
They are going to
capture them completely.

35
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,319
Right.

36
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,350
Protecting Crown Prince
is the biggest merit.

37
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,039
Yue Xin would rush here
with all his might

38
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,639
for this merit.

39
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,680
The butler won't get away.

40
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,080
You are not getting what you want.

41
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,199
Stop resisting.

42
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,039
Speak.

43
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,240
Who is the butler?

44
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,199
I would rather die than tell you!

45
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,080
Feng!

46
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,120
Let's go.

47
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,360
Quickly! Keep up.

48
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes.

49
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,240
Your Highness.

50
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,400
Now isn't the time to talk.

51
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,080
Let's go.

52
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,879
You all cover the rear.

53
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,919
Yes, sir.

54
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:04,479
Feng.

55
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,520
Qin Feng.

56
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,719
Feng.

57
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:08,800
Qin Feng.

58
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:09,680
How do you feel?

59
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,319
Are you all right?

60
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,120
Xiyue,

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,680
I know you have many questions for me,

62
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,560
but I can't answer everything for you.

63
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,160
Even so...

64
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,690
Even so, you have to believe me.

65
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,560
I never betrayed the country.

66
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,839
Stop talking now.

67
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,040
Xiyue,

68
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,720
promise me

69
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,279
that you will forgive Father,

70
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,560
no matter what he has done, all right?

71
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:36,879
Father?

72
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,879
Are you saying

73
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,120
that Father is behind all this?

74
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,439
Your Highness,

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,279
I implore you

76
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:54,480
to grant leniency to my father.

77
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,480
Qin Feng.

78
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,399
Feng.

79
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:04,759
Mountain

80
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,399
Deity

81
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,839
Temple.

82
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:12,680
Feng.

83
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:13,879
Feng!

84
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,639
Qin Feng!

85
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,079
An ungrateful fool.

86
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,000
What a shame.

87
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,959
He had a bright future,

88
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:25,519
yet he was determined to be loyal
to that darned Emperor.

89
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:29,720
Mr. Yao,

90
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,990
a word to the wise. Don't be reckless.

91
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,920
The soldiers below the mountain

92
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,360
follow my signal.

93
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,240
Once I give the command,

94
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,680
countless arrows will be released.

95
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:41,199
Arrows won't avoid unintended targets.

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,720
I only want the Crown Prince's life.

97
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,279
You should go.

98
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,480
Do I look like a coward to you?

99
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,439
A bunch of fools.

100
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,480
Mu Yuan,

101
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,040
let me ask you.

102
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,490
Are you aware of the crime
of killing Crown Prince?

103
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,090
The imperial court didn't mistreat you.

104
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,000
Why are you doing this?

105
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,839
Rascal!

106
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,920
I joined the army at 16.

107
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,430
I have been fighting wars
at the borders.

108
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,759
Half of the Heng State's lands
were secured by me.

109
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,319
However, after the darned Emperor
took power,

110
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,990
he didn't reward my contributions.
Instead, he punished me for nothing.

111
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,000
He sent me to be stationed
at the borders.

112
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,959
Obviously, he is wary of me.

113
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,759
Since he's so worried
that I would rebel,

114
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,759
I will do it.

115
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,279
I won't just kill you.

116
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,399
After I claim the capital,

117
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,800
I will personally take
the darned Emperor's life.

118
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,690
When a mutiny broke out
in the military camp,

119
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,750
my father defended you
despite mass opposition.

120
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,600
Is he the butler?

121
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,480
His Excellency serves two emperors.

122
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,680
He's the founding official.

123
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:43,199
Since the darned Emperor was young,

124
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,879
His Excellency has assisted him

125
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,199
to reach this far.

126
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,160
However, after taking power,

127
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:50,399
he weakened His Excellency's power.

128
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,000
Just how disheartening it is.

129
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,120
Your Highness,

130
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,800
if you turn back now

131
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,600
and not follow your stupid brother,

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,800
I won't harm you.

133
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,160
Father dotes on me and my brother.

134
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,759
He won't let you off
when he finds out that you kill us both.

135
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:06,800
Well,

136
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,839
for the sake
of His Excellency's grand cause,

137
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,519
I will have to beg
for his forgiveness later.

138
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,879
Who was that?

139
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:21,360
Mu Yuan, you rebel!

140
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,759
The rebel soldiers in the mountains
have all surrendered.

141
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,890
If you don't surrender now,

142
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,600
you will die a pathetic death.

143
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,860
I arrived late, Your Highness.

144
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,000
Please pardon me.

145
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,199
Here's the jade pendant.

146
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:42,240
The Falcon Army is fully
under your command now.

147
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,439
Good job, General Yue Xin.

148
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,240
Please follow me back
to the encampment to rest

149
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,270
before planning the next step.

150
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,399
There is no need.

151
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,890
The rebel soldiers
have just been quelled.

152
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,879
Besides,

153
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,920
we have to bury my brother well.

154
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,160
Yes, Your Highness.

155
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,759
Are you all right?

156
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,560
Your Highnesses,

157
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,639
are you all right?

158
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,850
Mr. Yao was telling me

159
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,959
about what you went through
on the way here.

160
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,360
I was so worried.

161
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,439
We are all right.

162
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,000
You shouldn't have scared her.

163
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,319
It's all in the past.

164
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,600
I...

165
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:24,000
Your Highness, you are injured.

166
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,759
Let me handle your wound.

167
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,079
It's superficial.

168
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:28,720
What about you?

169
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,990
You had been in the encampment.

170
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,519
Did Mu Yuan do something to you?

171
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,759
No.

172
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,080
Perhaps I'm only a maid,

173
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,600
so Mu Yuan didn't bother to kill me.

174
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,080
Miss Manyu, don't sell yourself short.

175
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:42,290
It's because he didn't know
the value you hold.

176
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:47,720
By the way,

177
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,480
do you think

178
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:52,840
my father is behind all this?

179
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,720
I have been wondering,

180
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,200
but the evidence isn't enough.

181
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,390
We can't jump to a conclusion yet.

182
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,039
By the way,

183
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,159
before your brother died,

184
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,279
he mentioned the Mountain Deity Temple.

185
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,360
Perhaps we can find answers there.
