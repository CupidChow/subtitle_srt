1
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,900
=Princess Across Time=

2
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,460
=Episode 24=

3
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:53,679
Here you go.

4
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,799
Her Highness taught me how to make them.
They are shumai,

5
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:59,000
shrimp dumplings,

6
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,159
and radish cake.

7
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:07,599
It smells great.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,290
Her Highness also taught me
how to brew this plum liquor.

9
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,840
It may pair well with the snacks.

10
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:22,159
The taste is indeed unique.

11
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,319
It seems you have learned

12
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:26,050
a lot of peculiar things
from Her Highness.

13
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,840
Exactly.

14
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,200
I don't know if you have noticed,

15
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,319
but Her Highness has changed a lot.

16
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,879
Her Highness

17
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,159
is very different from
when I first met her.

18
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,159
Maybe

19
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,040
people change.

20
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,439
Right.

21
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,879
People do change.

22
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:59,760
You seem down today.

23
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,319
Is it because of your work?

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,799
I have just walked too far

25
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,439
and felt lost.

26
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,800
I don't know how to deal
with unexpected things.

27
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,199
I'm Her Highness's handmaiden.

28
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,639
I have been in
the Grand Chancellor's Residence

29
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,439
since I left Divine Healer Valley.

30
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:25,360
His Excellency has been very kind
to us servants.

31
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,680
Unexpectedly...

32
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,479
And also my martial uncle.

33
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,240
He taught me a lot of skills
since I was young.

34
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,439
When my grandfather punished me,

35
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:40,400
he would stand up for me.

36
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,599
I didn't expect

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,280
that the people I trusted most

38
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,360
would all be culprits.

39
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:58,919
Manyu,

40
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,120
you must be very upset

41
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,879
that they betrayed you, right?

42
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,680
It's painful.

43
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,360
But fortunately,

44
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,639
I met the Crown Prince,

45
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,360
the Crown Princess,

46
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,400
and

47
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,120
you.

48
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,319
With all of you,

49
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,439
I feel less pain.

50
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,280
That's right.

51
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,520
No matter what I'm facing now,

52
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,159
I have you all.

53
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,639
No matter what has happened,

54
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:47,080
I will always help you.

55
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,879
Cheers.

56
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,879
Mr. Yao,

57
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,120
do you know this?

58
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,240
To me,

59
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,279
you are the best man in the world.

60
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,800
I will never betray you.

61
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,480
Smile.

62
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,839
Don't always pull the long face.

63
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,399
You still have me.

64
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,279
Miss Manyu,

65
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,079
thank you.

66
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,480
Your Excellency,

67
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,360
let me drink to you.

68
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:18,000
I have already reported
Mr. Qin's passing to Father.

69
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,759
Father permitted him an honorable burial

70
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,240
befitting a noble.

71
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,680
The matter of Mr. Qin escaping
has been thoroughly investigated.

72
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,360
It was Mu Yuan's scheme.

73
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:32,040
I appreciate the kindness
from His Majesty.

74
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,160
Also, thank you, Your Highness.

75
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:36,759
Father,

76
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,399
do you have anything else to say
other than a thank you?

77
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,680
I have so many things to say,

78
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:50,279
but I don't know where to start.

79
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,879
Why don't you start from
when you became the butler?

80
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:55,720
Well.

81
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,759
Well, well.

82
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,639
I did everything for my two children.

83
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:08,759
But in the end,

84
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,759
both of them

85
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,800
joined hands against me.

86
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,560
But

87
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,800
what have I done wrong?

88
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,839
I have dedicated myself to the country,

89
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:27,759
yet His Majesty is still wary of me

90
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,000
and continues
to suppress the Qin Family.

91
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,759
I pulled strings

92
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,839
to marry you off to His Highness

93
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,439
and placed Feng in the Ministry of War.

94
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,279
Do you understand

95
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,480
my kind intention?

96
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,920
Your Excellency,

97
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,319
Father never doubted you.

98
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,140
The thing is,
for the Heng State's prosperity to last,

99
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,399
the imperial court shouldn't
rely solely on you.

100
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:52,000
More talents need to be promoted.

101
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,600
Have you ever considered

102
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,360
who Father will entrust the country to
after your passing?

103
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,519
You overlooked this.

104
00:07:04,277 --> 00:07:06,238
Does His Majesty truly think this way?

105
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,639
Certainly.

106
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,790
If His Majesty didn't trust you,

107
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,519
why would he allow my marriage to Xiyue

108
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,759
and plan for her to become
the future Empress?

109
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,160
I'm such a dotard.

110
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,199
How foolish I have been.

111
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,759
Father,

112
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,000
it's not too late to regret

113
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,160
until a rebellion

114
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,759
erupts.

115
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,759
Rebellion?

116
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,879
Do you know how tortured I am

117
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,199
being torn between both sides?

118
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,920
Initially,

119
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,040
Yao Gao came to me

120
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,480
offering funds

121
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,079
to maintain the Qin Family's status.

122
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,090
But it was on the condition

123
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,370
that I use my influence
in the imperial court

124
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,439
to aid his business.

125
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,240
This is the palace procurement list

126
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,199
for this year.

127
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,790
You are fully in charge of the supplies.

128
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,360
Much obliged, Your Excellency.

129
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:07,959
Your Excellency,

130
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,120
I have already arranged
your son's position

131
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:12,360
in the Ministry of War.

132
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,160
Please rest assured.

133
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,439
No one will suspect you.

134
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,920
Yao Gao,

135
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,439
Handle your business modestly.

136
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,600
Don't compromise your principles.

137
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,120
If the imperial court ever investigates,

138
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,600
I won't be able to help you.

139
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,799
Your Excellency,

140
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,039
every single gift I gave you

141
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,080
(Ledger)

142
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,600
is recorded here.

143
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,600
I'm a merchant.

144
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,360
I have a habit of keeping records.

145
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,879
Please don't take offense.

146
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,879
If anything happens,

147
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:02,559
none of us can walk away unscathed.

148
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,639
Are you threatening me?

149
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,440
Your Excellency,

150
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,000
you can't turn back now.

151
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,720
Now that your daughter has married
into the Crown Prince's Residence,

152
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,960
if she becomes Empress one day,

153
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:19,000
no one will hold you accountable

154
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,440
for what you have done.

155
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,240
Come.

156
00:09:36,516 --> 00:09:37,116
Open it.

157
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,759
I brought a small gift from outside.

158
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,290
It's a small token of my gratitude.

159
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:50,039
Please accept it, Your Excellency.

160
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,519
Let's have tea.

161
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:55,440
Sure.

162
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,240
Let's have tea.

163
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,039
Yao Gao,

164
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,519
illegal salt trade

165
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,399
could cost your head, you know?

166
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,799
You conspired with Wu Shizheng
to raise the market price,

167
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,080
throwing the entire Heng State
into chaos.

168
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:17,080
I will not sit back.

169
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,039
All illegal sale trades

170
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:25,039
are under the name of Mr. Qin Feng.

171
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,200
Together with your income
over the years,

172
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:30,559
who do you think

173
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,360
His Majesty will think
is behind peddling illegal salt

174
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,720
and raising prices

175
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,519
to undermine the Heng State?

176
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:47,000
I think

177
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:51,720
this is your plot to seize power,

178
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:54,360
Your Excellency.

179
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:55,879
You!

180
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,799
Yao Gao,

181
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,039
you are indeed cunning.

182
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:03,080
I'm not cunning.

183
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:07,360
It's you who's too arrogant.

184
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,720
You thought you could
control everything,

185
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,799
but, in fact, you control nothing.

186
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,759
Dear Grand Chancellor,

187
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,960
the Emperor mistreats you,

188
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,320
so why serve him?

189
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:29,200
You should consider

190
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:34,360
your own future.

191
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,279
Yao Gao.

192
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,480
Yao Gao!

193
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,039
You must give me an explanation today!

194
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,279
Mr. Qin's death
has nothing to do with me.

195
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,080
Nothing to do with you?

196
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:51,240
If you hadn't spread
the news of Qin Feng's escape,

197
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:53,519
he would have been hunted down.

198
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,759
Qin Feng practiced martial arts
since little.

199
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,990
If it weren't
for your skilled martial artists,

200
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,120
why could he have been killed?

201
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:02,399
You can't put it that way.

202
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:05,000
Mu Yuan is your man.

203
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,399
I say you killed your own son.

204
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,159
You!

205
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,639
Didn't we

206
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,960
agree on this before?

207
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,919
You would provide funds
to the Qin Family,

208
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
and I would pave the way

209
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,399
for the Yao Family to become officials.

210
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:24,399
We are doing this
for the family's future.

211
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:28,279
We share glory and fate together.

212
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:30,159
Let's be fair.

213
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,120
Have I treated Yao Tian just as well

214
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,840
as I treated Qin Feng?

215
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:39,120
Yet you killed my son.

216
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,799
This is a misunderstanding.

217
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:45,600
I swear to Heaven,

218
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,720
I didn't kill

219
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,360
your son.

220
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:52,000
Yao Gao,

221
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:54,120
stop your pretense.

222
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,600
It was Mu Yuan who stabbed Qin Feng.

223
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:00,000
However, the real Mu Yuan died
a long time ago.

224
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,840
The current one is an impostor.

225
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,360
I only had business dealings
with Mu Yuan.

226
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:09,840
He helped manage
my military supply business.

227
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:10,799
Besides,

228
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,360
the profits also

229
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,440
go into your pocket.

230
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:17,279
I truly didn't know

231
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,919
that Mu Yuan stabbed Mr. Qin.

232
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,480
At our age,

233
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,080
sometimes we have to accept our fate.

234
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,600
Accept our fate?

235
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,000
Have you no shame when you say this?

236
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,960
If you hadn't sent assassins
to kill the envoy

237
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,440
and incited a war,

238
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:38,519
Qin Feng wouldn't have had to fight
on the front lines.

239
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,159
I can only make money

240
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,960
if there is a war.

241
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:48,360
Also, your son could have an opportunity
to fight enemies

242
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,480
and achieve merits.

243
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,559
If you want to talk about his death,

244
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,240
it's all because

245
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,960
of your greed.

246
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,399
I will seek an audience with His Majesty

247
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,000
and expose you.

248
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,279
Go ahead.

249
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,639
Let's go now.

250
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,080
You will face execution,

251
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:10,639
and your only daughter

252
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,120
will be neglected by the Crown Prince.

253
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:14,919
By then,

254
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,759
the Qin Family is completely done for.

255
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:24,759
Your Highness,

256
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:28,120
I know I have made a grave mistake,

257
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:29,399
and it's unforgivable.

258
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,679
I'm willing to redeem myself

259
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,399
by exposing Yao Gao to His Majesty.
