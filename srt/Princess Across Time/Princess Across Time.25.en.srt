=Princess Across Time=

2
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,460
=Episode 25=

3
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,200
Your Highness,

4
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,600
I know I have made a grave mistake,

5
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:45,719
and it's unforgivable.

6
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,039
I'm willing to redeem myself

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,600
by exposing Yao Gao to His Majesty.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,790
Please get up first.

9
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:01,119
But I have a request.

10
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:02,960
Yes, please.

11
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,840
I won't ask for too much.

12
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:09,040
I only hope

13
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,040
you can treat Xiyue well.

14
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,200
She knows nothing about this.

15
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,599
No worries.

16
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:19,840
I swear on imperial dignity

17
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,780
that I will never fail her
in this lifetime.

18
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,640
If so, I can put my mind at ease.

19
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:29,120
I have no more worries.

20
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,640
Please imprison me, Your Highness.

21
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,319
As for how to handle you,

22
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,239
I don't have a say in this.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,159
Father will decide.

24
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,799
Today's a family gathering.

25
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,090
Let's not talk about the state business.

26
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,359
Come, let's have a drink.

27
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,239
Thank you,

28
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,400
Your Highnesses.

29
00:02:07,178 --> 00:02:09,058
(Zhuxuan Abode)

30
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,280
Greetings, Your Highnesses.

31
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,000
Come, Manyu.

32
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,840
Mr. Yao, here's your tea.

33
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,360
Yao Tian.

34
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,240
Your Highness.

35
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,319
You look unhappy.

36
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:28,879
I...

37
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,599
You have been like this
since returning from home?

38
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:34,840
My father...

39
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,520
We know about that.

40
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,660
My father told us everything.

41
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:38,500
You know everything?

42
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,080
Your Highnesses,

43
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,560
it has nothing to do with Mr. Yao.

44
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,120
We know.

45
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,840
We won't do anything to your Mr. Yao.

46
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,790
My father has committed
an unforgivable crime.

47
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,680
I hereby promise
that I will investigate this thoroughly.

48
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,170
I will not play favoritism.

49
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,080
Don't worry too much.

50
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,000
If your father mends his way,

51
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,639
he will not suffer.

52
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,840
Thank you, Your Highness.

53
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,039
I have sent a message to Sun Yi,

54
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,080
asking her to keep an eye on my home.

55
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,120
This is called a candy.

56
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,919
Take one when you are upset.

57
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,159
Thank you.

58
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,800
Father said

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,560
that if His Excellency admits his crime,

60
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,360
he will turn himself in.

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,639
I didn't know he would lie to me.

62
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,759
Mr. Yao,

63
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,720
you still have us.

64
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:26,000
Even if your father

65
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,199
has done something wrong,

66
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,120
His Highness

67
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,800
has never doubted you.

68
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:37,000
But I'm so lost.

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,720
My father is so kind to me.

70
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:42,279
If he's arrested,

71
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:43,639
what about me?

72
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:45,759
What should I do?

73
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,879
If I remain impartial, I fail my family.

74
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,240
If I cover up my father's crime,
I fail justice.

75
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,600
I'm torn between them.

76
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,439
Yao Tian,

77
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,759
you used to be decisive and determined.

78
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:03,519
Why have you become so hesitant now?

79
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,720
Think about why the Crown Prince

80
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,959
and Princess came here today.

81
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:12,160
His Excellency is His Highness's
father-in-law

82
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,480
and Her Highness's father.

83
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,920
But they do not waver
when facing justice.

84
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,439
Do you really think they are not upset?

85
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,720
But they still try their best
to find the culprit.

86
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:27,959
What exactly are you troubled by?

87
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,879
You are not the only one

88
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,399
whose father is involved in this case.

89
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,360
Miss Manyu,

90
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,319
thank you for waking me up
with your reprimand.

91
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:58,920
Right.

92
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,360
Justice comes in big and small forms.

93
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,160
I shouldn't be troubled

94
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,160
by a small justice.

95
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,879
My father has caused
many families to separate.

96
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,839
He deserves his punishment.

97
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,839
As the assistant minister
of the Investigation Bureau,

98
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,759
I should stand up for the grand justice.

99
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,959
Master,

100
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,839
is everything done?

101
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,720
All set.

102
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,000
However, I just received the news

103
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:35,319
saying that the Grand Chancellor
confessed everything.

104
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,920
He is guarded
by the Crown Prince's soldier now.

105
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,439
Jeez, this old fellow.

106
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,959
If I had known he was so useless,

107
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,879
I would've killed him long ago.

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,600
Fortunately, we have allies
in Anxi State

109
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,360
who are going to escort us
out of the capital tomorrow.

110
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:03,240
I'm afraid we can't leave.

111
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,560
When I arrived,

112
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,399
I saw many new vendors outside.

113
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,800
These people walk firmly

114
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,079
and swiftly.

115
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,319
They are not ordinary people.

116
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:25,920
What a good son I have.

117
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,319
Master,

118
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,240
if the Investigation Bureau gets alerted

119
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,920
and the Crown Prince

120
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,759
mobilizes the Imperial Guards,

121
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,240
I'm afraid we could be in great trouble.

122
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,800
Why are you panicking?

123
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,000
He's not taking me down

124
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:50,240
so easily.

125
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,199
Your Highness,

126
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,820
I'm willing to return to the capital
to command the Investigation Bureau

127
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:56,920
and arrest my father.

128
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:58,240
I believe

129
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,240
that if the news of his arrest spreads,

130
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,240
his allies will be terrified.

131
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,160
More evidence

132
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,160
will come to light.

133
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:06,920
Mr. Yao,

134
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,480
I think

135
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,510
it's better to get someone else.

136
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,079
Are you worried that I might be unfair?

137
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,160
No.

138
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,519
I simply don't want to put you
on the spot.

139
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,839
I'm a court official.

140
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,959
I have failed my duty

141
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,160
to not notice my father's crime early.

142
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,639
Your Highness,

143
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,399
please grant me a chance to make amends.

144
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,000
If you don't give him this chance,

145
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,000
he will regret it for life.

146
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,879
Yao Gao is under the surveillance
of the Investigation Bureau,

147
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,600
I will leave the rest up to you.

148
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,720
Yes, Your Highness.

149
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:00,480
Mr. Yao.

150
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:10,360
I know you are going to
face something difficult

151
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,159
but I believe

152
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,080
you can definitely do it.

153
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,440
Miss Manyu,

154
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:19,080
I have something to tell you
before I leave.

155
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,000
Miss Manyu,

156
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,120
if it hadn't been for your care
and encouragement recently,

157
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,919
I would've been able to
accept everything calmly.

158
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:29,559
Thank you.

159
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:33,759
All right.

160
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:35,639
Also,

161
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,759
when this is over,

162
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,440
can you...

163
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,240
Can you travel the world with you?

164
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,360
I need to take care of
the Crown Prince and Princess.

165
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:48,919
How can I leave?

166
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:49,919
But...

167
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:00,840
But without you,

168
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,840
I can't eat

169
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,759
or sleep.

170
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,080
Because I can't control myself.

171
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,679
When I can't see you,

172
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:06,720
my mind is full of you.

173
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:07,639
I think...

174
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,600
I think I can't be without you.

175
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,919
What do you say?

176
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:22,840
Me too.

177
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,390
These two silly are finally
doing the right thing.

178
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:32,799
I was worried

179
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,279
that Yao Tian might've
given up on himself.

180
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:38,799
It seems I was overthinking.

181
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,440
I will wait for you to come back.

182
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,159
Oh, right.

183
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:57,000
How will His Majesty
deal with my father?

184
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,080
His Excellency committed
a grave mistake,

185
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:03,919
but fortunately,

186
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,159
he's only an accomplice.

187
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:07,759
Besides, given
his contributions earlier,

188
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,120
Father might show leniency.

189
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,360
Don't worry.
