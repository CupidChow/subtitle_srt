00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,900
=Princess Across Time=

2
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,460
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:41,840
He Gong? Why are you here?

4
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:43,320
Who's he?

5
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,280
He's He Cheng's younger brother.

6
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,119
Where's your brother?

7
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:50,359
Your Highness, please pardon me.

8
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,190
But this is urgent, I had no choice
but to take this action.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,399
- Someone wants to kill my brother.
- Who?

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,679
I don't know.

11
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,560
But I do know that Situ Lian, the courtesan
who died a few days ago,

12
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:04,519
gave my brother a package
before she died.

13
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,990
She said it was very important
and asked my brother to keep it safe.

14
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,740
But not long after,
someone wanted to hunt him down.

15
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,120
Situ Lian told him

16
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,480
to seek help from Crown Prince
if he was in danger.

17
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,480
That's why I came to you.

18
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,439
Where is the thing?

19
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,719
It's in a hut outside the city gate.

20
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,280
I have been hiding there these days.

21
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,100
How about this?

22
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,390
I follow you to get the thing.

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,200
Show me the way.

24
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,290
Yes, Your Highness.

25
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,290
Head back to tell His Highness
to meet me at the hut outside the city.

26
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:34,480
Your Highness.

27
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:35,959
Hurry up.

28
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,719
Have you found He Cheng?

29
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,140
We searched
inside and outside the city.

30
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,590
He family has been empty
for a long time.

31
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,079
There's news saying
that he has already left the city.

32
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,840
He left the city?

33
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:52,879
Dispatch more people.

34
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,000
He Cheng is the only clue we have.

35
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,959
Don't let the villains get ahead of us.

36
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:57,890
Yes, Your Highness.

37
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,959
Greetings, Your Highness, Mr. Yao.

38
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,239
Why are you back alone?

39
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,190
Where is Crown Princess?

40
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,439
We met He Cheng's brother,

41
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,640
He Gong, on the way.

42
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,280
He said He Cheng is in danger now

43
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,039
and requested to meet Her Highness

44
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,599
to present important clues.

45
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,080
It's at the hut outside the city.

46
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:14,039
So Her Highness followed him

47
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,599
and sent me back to call you.

48
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,020
We have already searched
around the hut area outside the city.

49
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,319
We didn't find He Cheng there.

50
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,439
This is bad.

51
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:35,879
Your Highness,

52
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:36,919
this is it.

53
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,280
I will keep watch outside.

54
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,990
My brother is waiting for you inside.

55
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,120
He Cheng?

56
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,039
Your Highness, please don't blame me.

57
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,879
Blame yourself for knowing too much.

58
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,319
Help!

59
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,719
Help!

60
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:56,879
He Cheng.

61
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,039
Who's there?

62
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,279
He Cheng.

63
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,160
Why did you leave me alone?

64
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:32,680
Lian!

65
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,480
Wu San is dead.

66
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:36,279
I have avenged you.

67
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:40,279
But I'm so lonely below there.

68
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:43,360
Why don't you come down
and keep me company?

69
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,839
Come here.

70
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,079
Come.

71
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,480
Come on.

72
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,279
Lian.

73
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,360
Sir.

74
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,279
Mr. Yao,

75
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,439
Yao Cheng is found,

76
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,959
but he's dead.

77
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,560
He's dead?

78
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,639
How did he die and where?

79
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,720
We just received the news
from Zishi County's yamen.

80
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,480
Last night, there was
a Female Ghost Murder

81
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,680
happened in Zishi County.

82
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,079
The deceased is He Cheng.

83
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,930
The local county yamen didn't dare
make a hasty judgment,

84
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,560
so they sent someone to the capital
overnight to report the case.

85
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:26,160
Female Ghost Murder?

86
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,200
Go there immediately with our men.

87
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,439
Before His Highness and I arrive,
don't act rashly.

88
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,680
Yes.

89
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,399
By the way,

90
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:38,160
bring along the cordon
Her Highness mentioned.

91
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:39,319
Yes.

92
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,240
Female Ghost Murder?

93
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,199
Your Highness,

94
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,560
the medicine is ready.

95
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,079
Let me do it.

96
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:11,199
Even though
Her Highness's pulse feels weak,

97
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:13,959
she is supposed to be awake
one day after taking the medicine.

98
00:06:16,452 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm too incompetent.

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,680
Manyu,

100
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,720
don't blame yourself.

101
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,319
Xiyue

102
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,399
will be all right.

103
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,800
You may go.

104
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,780
Yes, Your Highness.

105
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,240
Your Highness,

106
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,439
Mr. Yao is here.

107
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,790
It's about something important.

108
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,800
Let him in.

109
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:46,839
Yes.

110
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,319
Your Highness,
how's Her Highness's condition?

111
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,639
Still the same.

112
00:06:59,260 --> 00:06:59,959
Report now.

113
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:02,079
Your Highness, He Cheng is dead.

114
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,590
He died in Zishi County.

115
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,990
The county yamen reported it
as a case of Female Ghost Murder.

116
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:09,199
It seems they are one step ahead of us.

117
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,079
Are you suggesting

118
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,959
that the female ghost is a diversion?

119
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,079
Ghosts and deities
are superstitious nonsense.

120
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,190
How can you believe that?

121
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,959
I'm sure the mastermind

122
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,360
staged this show

123
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,040
to cover up their crimes.

124
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:24,600
Yao Tian,

125
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:25,600
you go first.

126
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,199
I need to look after Xiyue.

127
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:28,879
Yes.

128
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,839
Greetings, Your Highness, Mr. Yao.

129
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,040
Come in.

130
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:42,480
Your Highness,

131
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,160
over the last few days,
the rice price has trebled,

132
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,850
the salt price has been cut in half,

133
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:49,759
and fabric and firewood prices
have doubled.

134
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,079
Your Highness,

135
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,759
who do you think is behind this?

136
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:54,319
These price swings

137
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,519
have affected my father tremendously.

138
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,879
Even Mr. Yao is affected?

139
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,199
Exactly.

140
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,230
My father's business
spans multiple industries

141
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,240
and it has been affected
from many aspects.

142
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,560
Even a significant merchant like Mr. Yao

143
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,839
can be affected,

144
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,110
the foundation of the nation

145
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,560
will be shaken before long.

146
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:19,480
Ever since Xiyue's assassination

147
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,040
and He Cheng's death,

148
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,240
they have become bolder.

149
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,270
What else do you want to say?

150
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,790
According to the news from my scouts,

151
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,000
someone from the imperial court
got involved in this.

152
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,759
Of course.

153
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,200
They certainly need a mole
to cause unrest among the people.

154
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,519
Continue the search.

155
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,879
No matter who is involved,
get to the bottom of it.

156
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,580
Yes, Your Highness.

157
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,080
Yao Tian, remember what I told you.

158
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,039
Once Xiyue feels better,
I will head to Zishi County immediately.

159
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,370
Yes, Your Highness.
