00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,900
=Princess Across Time=

2
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,460
=Episode 6=

3
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:40,039
Qin Feng?

4
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:41,640
That can't be.

5
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:43,920
Who's Qin Feng?

6
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,159
Why do you guys look shocked?

7
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,520
Don't you even recognize
your own brother now?

8
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,640
He's Grand Chancellor's son.

9
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,660
Qin Feng treated you well since young.

10
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,240
My brother?

11
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:56,799
No wonder.

12
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,520
No wonder he wants Situ Lian
to abort her child.

13
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,240
He's just afraid
that his reputation might be ruined.

14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,159
That scum. I'll head back and find him.

15
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:04,680
Wait.

16
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,200
The case hasn't been concluded yet.

17
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,719
Calm down.

18
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:11,359
Isn't this clear enough?

19
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,719
He's the son of the Grand Chancellor.

20
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:15,280
How could he let a courtesan

21
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,319
bear his child?

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,319
It's not like he's a top-tier celebrity.

23
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,190
To think that he doesn't dare
to tell other people.

24
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:21,560
What kind of man is he?

25
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,519
Even if Vice Minister Qin and Miss Situ
did have an affair,

26
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:26,040
it doesn't mean

27
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,719
that he's related to her death.

28
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,760
I'll know when I ask him about it.

29
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,079
He's the son of the Grand Chancellor,
you know?

30
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:33,480
Lower your volume.

31
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,650
It's crowded here.

32
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:36,200
Let's talk over there.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,159
Mr. Qin does fit the
description of our suspect.

34
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,439
But now, we don't have
sufficient evidence.

35
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,780
We cannot conclude the case yet.

36
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,390
If you don't dare to ask him,
I'll ask him.

37
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,519
That's not it.

38
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,490
We have to phrase
our questions carefully.

39
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,959
I'll ask him this,

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,390
"Why did you abandon her
when you started the relationship?"

41
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,190
Have you ever considered this?

42
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,640
What if our deductions were wrong?

43
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,090
What if we misunderstood
Mr. Qin and alerted His Excellency?

44
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,520
What should we do by then?

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,479
His Highness does have a point.

46
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,599
Although Mr. Qin
is our prime suspect,

47
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,950
we don't have sufficient evidence.

48
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,280
All the more I need to ask him about it.

49
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,840
This tag

50
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,120
is our only clue right now.

51
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,240
And, Qin Feng is our only suspect.

52
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:23,690
What about this?

53
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,039
We've never visited your family

54
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,120
after you got in trouble.

55
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,690
We can investigate the case
using the visit as our excuse.

56
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:29,990
All right. You have a point.

57
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:30,840
Wait.

58
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,240
What now?

59
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,719
Remember,

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,159
do not act recklessly.

61
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:35,879
Got it.

62
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,759
Qin Xiyue!

63
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,759
We were the closest

64
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,800
since young!

65
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,319
What's wrong with you?

66
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,190
How could you suspect
that I killed someone?

67
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,990
How could you ask me
such a question directly?

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,520
You!

69
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:49,159
You broke my heart!

70
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,360
Tell me, then. Was it you?

71
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,199
Xiyue.

72
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,000
Your Highness.

73
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,380
You don't need to stop her.

74
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,479
Let her continue.

75
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,439
I didn't kill anyone anyway.

76
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,159
I'll take it as if
I no longer have a sister!

77
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,360
I!

78
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,439
I was supposed to do
the questioning, right?

79
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,790
You're turning this into a mess.

80
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,520
Mr. Qin, calm down.

81
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,159
Xiyue is just bent on solving the case.

82
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,439
Therefore,

83
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
she sounded offensive.

84
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,450
You shouldn't hold it against her.

85
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,960
Why is Crown Princess
trying to investigate a case?

86
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,520
You've been unruly since young.

87
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,590
I thought that you would be
more well-behaved

88
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,130
after getting married to His Highness.

89
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,240
I never expected you to turn out worse.

90
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:32,520
Now, you're even
maligning your own brother.

91
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:33,919
Think about it.

92
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,439
How did it feel when you were maligned
and was going to be executed for it?

93
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,400
Mr. Qin, that's enough.

94
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:43,319
We did see your name

95
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,439
on Situ Lian's tag.

96
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,680
We came here to ask you for leads.

97
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,550
If we did treat you as a suspect,

98
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,199
Mr. Yao would be here

99
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,039
instead of us.

100
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,360
(Lian, Qin Feng)

101
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,039
That's right.

102
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,240
My name

103
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,880
is on the tag indeed.

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,759
Lian and I were in love.

105
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,519
It's just that our families
are mismatched.

106
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,399
Father already arranged
a marriage for me

107
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,800
with the daughter of Mr. Xu Ding,
the Minister of War.

108
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,600
I just became
the Vice Minister of War too.

109
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,199
I had a bright future ahead of me.

110
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,399
At this moment,
Lian was pregnant with my child.

111
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,360
I...

112
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,680
I had to consider
the Qin family's reputation.

113
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,720
You scum!

114
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,399
What did you say?

115
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,040
I said, you're a scum!

116
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:49,990
What gives you the right to insult me?

117
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,319
I felt sorry for you
when Father betrothed you

118
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,600
to Crown Prince.

119
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,959
Do you remember what you said?

120
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:58,279
You said we couldn't decide
our own marriages.

121
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,839
Now, you're insulting me?

122
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,240
Qin Xiyue said that.

123
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,399
I didn't say that.

124
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,040
So, what did Situ Lian do after that?

125
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,240
Lian, she wanted me

126
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,360
to buy out her freedom.

127
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,399
But Father didn't agree to it.

128
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,800
He told Wu San

129
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,279
to make Lian suffer a miscarriage

130
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,560
and give her some money

131
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,890
so that she could leave
and lead a peaceful life elsewhere.

132
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,920
You're disgusting.

133
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:27,279
You actually killed your child
personally?

134
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:31,759
Did you think I was
able to make the call?

135
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,180
You're just shirking
your responsibilities.

136
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:33,959
Understood?

137
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,560
You shirked your responsibilities!
You cowardly scum!

138
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,170
Say that again!

139
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,290
So what if I did say that?

140
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:39,879
Say that again!

141
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:40,879
Fine by me!

142
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:41,399
You!

143
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,519
Xiyue. Do you still wish
to investigate the case?

144
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,319
Of course.

145
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,319
All right. Stop being angry, then.

146
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,780
It's not like you know nothing
about your father's character.

147
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,120
He's old-fashioned and prideful.

148
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,920
He would never let a courtesan

149
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,279
marry into his family.

150
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,000
However,

151
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,199
I don't think he'll resort

152
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,439
to killing a frail woman

153
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,519
because of something like this.

154
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,360
That's right.

155
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,079
Therefore,

156
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:15,480
our investigative direction
was wrong from the start.

157
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,040
Making Situ Lian suffer a miscarriage
and wanting her dead

158
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,199
are two different matters.

159
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,800
I assume that her culprit silenced her

160
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,160
because he didn't want her
to report the case.

161
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,519
Why would she come to you
instead of the Investigative Bureau

162
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,490
if she had a case to report?

163
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,439
What if the Investigative Bureau
cannot handle the culprit?

164
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:32,000
No wonder.

165
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,959
I thought that it was strange

166
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,120
for them to create such a commotion

167
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,879
just because of her pregnancy.

168
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,330
They intend to silence everyone
who knew about the case.

169
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:44,160
We still have to find the person
who delivered the letter

170
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,839
to Yao Tian.

171
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,040
She's our only lead.

172
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,480
Since she doesn't want to show herself,

173
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:49,920
we should find her.

174
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,639
It's easy to say.
Where can we find her?

175
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,170
Have you ever considered this?

176
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,120
Since she knew about

177
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,319
Situ Lian's personal affairs,

178
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,040
she must've been close to her.

179
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,690
Tonight's the seventh-day ceremony
of Situ Lian's death.

180
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,519
Don't you think she'll go there
and pay her respect?

181
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,839
You're smart indeed.

182
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,000
I've never taken a good look

183
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,240
ever since I arrived here.

184
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,399
Did you see that just now?

185
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,480
It was beautiful.

186
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,920
Look! It's so beautiful.

187
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,519
Candied hawthorns for sale!

188
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:20,040
Manyu, look. Candied hawthorns.

189
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:21,879
Candied hawthorns.

190
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,079
Miss, would you like some?

191
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,240
Do you want it?

192
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,319
No thanks.

193
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,510
Are you guys looking for some fabrics?

194
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,290
A new batch of silk and satin fabrics
had just arrived.

195
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:35,360
Mister,

196
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,600
do you sell any black fabrics?

197
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,240
Black fabrics?

198
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,199
The darker the better.

199
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,319
The darker the better?

200
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,639
Is this dark enough?

201
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,800
This will do.

202
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:55,660
We'll take this.

203
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:56,439
Mister.

204
00:07:58,439 --> 00:07:59,000
This,

205
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,319
and that one,

206
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:01,800
wrap them up for me.

207
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,079
We don't need that much.
It'll go to waste, you know?

208
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:07,199
I'll buy the entire street
for you as long as you like it.

209
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:11,990
It's around this price.

210
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,190
- Did the price increase again?
- Five?

211
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,759
No choice.

212
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,650
The commodity prices
are increasing every day.

213
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,100
I'm not the only shop doing this.

214
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,600
Fabric shops across the streets
are all doing the same thing.

215
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:24,240
We can't make a living
if we don't increase the price.

216
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,680
It's fine.

217
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,790
You can sell them to me
at that price, mister.

218
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,120
All right.

219
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,639
Let's go and check out the front.

220
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,600
Take care.

221
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,159
You!

222
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:01,480
What are you doing?

223
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:02,200
You see,

224
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,080
Manyu's cooking is ridiculously good.

225
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,159
My tummy is protruding
from all the food.

226
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,350
You're already thin enough.
You don't need to lose any weight.

227
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,399
No, I can't get back up.

228
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,600
Hold my legs for me.

229
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,080
Hold them down.

230
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,440
Hold them down like this.

231
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,399
That's right. Hold them down tightly.

232
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,679
This won't do.

233
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,759
Hey, I still need

234
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,080
to continue my workout.

235
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:57,200
I...

236
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,480
Continue.

237
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:09,799
Wait.

238
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,790
Stop right there.

239
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,919
We still have
important matters to attend to.

240
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:17,559
Isn't it too early for that?

241
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,759
What are you thinking?

242
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:22,480
I wasn't referring to that.

243
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,690
Aren't we going to visit
Xianyin Pleasure House?

244
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:25,960
Xianyin Pleasure House?

245
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:30,399
That's right.

246
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,290
That was precisely
what I was referring to.
