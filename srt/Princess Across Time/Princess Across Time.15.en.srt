2
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,460
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,580
(Zhuxuan Abode)

4
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:48,840
Here's today's dinner.

5
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:51,520
Braised yellow croaker,
spicy pig trotters,

6
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,000
and braised meatballs.

7
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,799
This is an extravagant meal.

8
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,079
Manyu, sit down.

9
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,400
That's right.

10
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,079
The case investigation was tough.

11
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,990
We should
treat ourselves to a good meal.

12
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,239
Your Highness,

13
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,599
these braised meatballs

14
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:21,599
are Her Highness's favorite dish.

15
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:31,400
I just finished an autopsy.

16
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:33,359
I have no appetite.

17
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,439
How did the investigation go, then?

18
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,079
I don't know.

19
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,560
It's been over four hours
since His Highness and I

20
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,920
have returned from the palace.

21
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:53,719
You two can't just keep mum like this

22
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:54,719
all the time.

23
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,840
We can't afford to delay
the investigation of the envoy's death.

24
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,519
In my opinion,

25
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,200
I think you two should
join hands to investigate the case.

26
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,120
This way, we can solve
the case more easily, right?

27
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,400
Crown Princess,

28
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,390
the Investigative Bureau
is investigating the envoy's death

29
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,639
under His Majesty's order.

30
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,190
Previously, you assisted us
in solving cases.

31
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,600
Therefore, His Majesty has permitted you
to join the case investigation.

32
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,560
Crown Princess, you should
put more effort into it.

33
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,490
Since His Majesty
has instructed me to do so,

34
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,190
naturally, I won't
shirk my responsibilities.

35
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,039
However, you see,

36
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,960
I'm actually better
at messing things up.

37
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,439
I'm afraid that someone might be upset

38
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,479
if I get myself involved.

39
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,599
Why don't we rest early today?

40
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,160
We should rest and prepare ourselves.

41
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,199
I'll come here tomorrow

42
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,080
and take you two to the crime scene.

43
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:04,840
Take care, Mr. Yao.

44
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:06,800
I shall take my leave.

45
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,520
Manyu,

46
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,960
are you troubled by something?

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,280
Your Highness.

48
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,919
You...

49
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,590
What's that in your hand?

50
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,080
What is this?

51
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,879
Her Highness wrote this.

52
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,790
It's very different from the storybooks
selling in the market.

53
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,000
It's very interesting.

54
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,279
If you run, I'll go after you.

55
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,160
There's no escape for you.

56
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,580
That was the wrong expression.

57
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,160
Girl, you're playing with fire here.

58
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,639
You...

59
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,680
What were those bossy quotes?

60
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,050
Isn't this the relationship you wanted?

61
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,439
Where did you learn that from?

62
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,240
Wait.

63
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:43,720
Don't tell me you came from
the future as well?

64
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:44,920
What?

65
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,360
Didn't you write them in your book?

66
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,759
Book?

67
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,639
You read the book I gave to Manyu?

68
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:54,680
That's right.

69
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,680
This is so embarrassing.

70
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,720
I do think it's pretty interesting.

71
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,279
Have you forgiven me, then?

72
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,680
Forgive you, huh?

73
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,040
Just you wish.

74
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,319
You'll still sleep on the floor today.

75
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,240
What happened?

76
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,240
I don't know.

77
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,639
Stop staring. Let's go.

78
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,279
Your Highness, Crown Princess,

79
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,839
this is the envoy's residence.

80
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:43,680
Let's head inside.

81
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,600
Your Highness, Mr. Yao.

82
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,160
You guys may continue.

83
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:16,990
Yes, Your Highness.

84
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,590
There are plenty of them over there.

85
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,720
Something's off.

86
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,590
Have you discovered something?

87
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,240
An autopsy report?

88
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,680
The victim was decapitated.

89
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,040
Logically speaking,

90
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,800
a huge amount of blood
would've been spilled.

91
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,519
But look at the walls.

92
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,319
There's no bloodstain at all.

93
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:21,199
If the victim wanted
to get rid of the bloodstain,

94
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,120
he has to use a large volume of water.

95
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,560
Although the security here isn't tight,

96
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,290
there are still plenty of people around.

97
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,990
The culprit has no way
to get rid of the bloodstain.

98
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,240
However, the victim
was decapitated indeed.

99
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,159
Isn't it obvious?

100
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,730
I'll check the surroundings.

101
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,919
Sun Yi,

102
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,000
how's your investigation?

103
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,200
We discovered the murder weapon.

104
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,879
It's a military saber.

105
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:52,960
The envoy kept

106
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,159
all of his offerings in this room.

107
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,919
There were many signs of rummaging.

108
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,759
Besides gold, precious pieces of jewelry

109
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,320
also went missing.

110
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,240
All the items that went missing
were portable and valuable.

111
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,360
Could this be a case of
murder for profit?

112
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:06,639
A case of murder for profit?

113
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,770
There was also one more
questionable point.

114
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,380
I investigated the envoy's background.

115
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,519
He's actually from our state.

116
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:15,490
He followed his father to Anxi State
20 years ago to conduct business.

117
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,840
Due to his proficiency
in both languages

118
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,090
and his expertise in business,

119
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,240
the king of Anxi State appointed him
as their state envoy.

120
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,679
He's from Heng State?

121
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,080
What's his name?

122
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,960
Lv Yan.

123
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,790
Send your men to retrieve his profile.

124
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,200
Find out about his background.

125
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:29,080
Besides that,

126
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,440
bring the rest of the envoys here.

127
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,519
Yes, Mr. Yao.

128
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,360
Lv Yan?

129
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,279
I examined just now.

130
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,540
It appeared to me that murder for profit
was just a false impression.

131
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:48,759
How could you tell?

132
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,799
Anxi State sent
an envoy group to our state.

133
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,600
Only Lv Yan was murdered.

134
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,840
The other envoys are safe and sound.

135
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,039
And, the way he was murdered
was questionable too.

136
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,559
This case may seem logical,

137
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,360
but in reality,

138
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,440
everything was done intentionally.

139
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,799
Someone's trying
to lead us by the nose here.

140
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,360
Crown Princess,
you make an excellent point.

141
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:18,639
If that's the case,

142
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,480
the culprit aims to mislead us
about his motive.

143
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,650
If so, that's what
we should investigate.

144
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,590
I've already sent my men
to retrieve

145
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,559
all the records
when he was still in Heng State.

146
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,080
Your Highness, Mr. Yao,

147
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,840
the remaining envoys have been
ruled out as suspects.

148
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,890
They said that this place
was no longer safe.

149
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,890
They hoped that we'd arrange
a new place for them.

150
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,120
Naturally.

151
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:51,240
This time, make sure
the security is tight.

152
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,250
Yes, Your Highness.

153
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,919
Thank you, Your Highness.

154
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,840
Mr. Envoy,

155
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:03,639
what does that hand gesture mean?

156
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,120
We use this hand gesture in Anxi State.

157
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,240
We use this to express thanks, respect,

158
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,840
and recognition.

159
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,360
I have one more thing to ask you.

160
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,440
Yiken...

161
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,000
Kenta Sayilai.
[*Anxi Language]

162
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,919
Your Highness, who are you
referring to as a traitor?

163
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:26,120
You already got rid of him?

164
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,080
So, when I uttered the sentence,
I actually said,

165
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:30,559
"I got rid of the traitor?"
