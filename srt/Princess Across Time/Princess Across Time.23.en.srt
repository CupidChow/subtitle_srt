1
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,900
=Princess Across Time=

2
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,460
=Episode 23=

3
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,240
Before your brother died,

4
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:43,280
he mentioned the Mountain Deity Temple.

5
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:45,380
Perhaps we can find answers there.

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,439
I found a hidden passage to a cave
in the Mountain Deity Temple.

7
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,679
There was a trail of blood.

8
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,359
When examining Mr. Qin's body,

9
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:55,920
I found a knife wound
that had been bandaged.

10
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,119
It must be from
when he was attacked there.

11
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,359
Qin Feng was attacked
in the Mountain Deity Temple.

12
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,519
It makes sense, then.

13
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,190
He discovered something wrong
in the encampment

14
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,390
and went to investigate alone,

15
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,599
but was discovered

16
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,690
and chased all the way to
the Mountain Deity Temple.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,570
Fortunately, Qin Feng knew martial arts,

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,120
so the assassination attempt failed.

19
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,040
Exactly.

20
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,239
The assassin must have been Mu Yuan.

21
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:21,680
When I saw him a few days ago,

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,120
he was injured.

23
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,079
It's likely caused by Mr. Qin.

24
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,359
As for the Mountain Deity Temple,

25
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,400
it must be the passage

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,200
the butler and Anxi State used
for smuggling.

27
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,560
After the temple was built,

28
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:34,200
landslides became frequent

29
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:36,719
due to their extensive digging
inside the mountains.

30
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,079
Your Highness,

31
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,280
Anxi State is attacking now.

32
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,079
The enemy launches an attack now

33
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,879
is likely to divide our forces

34
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:54,599
and use this opportunity
to withdraw from the arsenal.

35
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,719
Staying here

36
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,400
won't help the situation.

37
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,660
We must return to the capital.

38
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:01,920
Yue Xin,

39
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:04,719
there aren't many people
we can trust now.

40
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,239
But I believe

41
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,879
you will guard this place
without letting us down.

42
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:10,840
Besides,

43
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,680
seal off the area completely

44
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,199
and don't alert the enemy.

45
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,560
I won't disappoint you.

46
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,759
Yao Tian,

47
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,490
bring the bodies of Qin Feng
and Mu Yuan back to the capital.

48
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,680
We need Father's order to deal with them.

49
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:25,690
Yes, Your Highness.

50
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,479
Greetings, Your Highnesses.

51
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,560
Why are you here, Sun Yi?

52
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,919
Mr. Yao,

53
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,960
we received a letter from Chenzhou.

54
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,919
It's a serious case.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,390
The local yamen don't dare to handle it.

56
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,759
What case is it?

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,390
Mu Yuan, the defense general
of Chenzhou,

58
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,919
was killed a month ago.

59
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,120
What?

60
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:58,879
It's him?

61
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,039
Do you know him?

62
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,360
He was my martial uncle.

63
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,719
The last and most talented disciple

64
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,800
of Divine Healer Valley.

65
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,280
Sadly, due to his corruption,

66
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,520
he secretly refined
the forbidden Heart-Devouring Gu Poison.

67
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,719
In addition,
he was also skilled in using

68
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,520
various kinds of precious herbs
to make human-faced masks.

69
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,360
He was engaged in illegal trades.

70
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,639
After Grandfather found out,

71
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,400
he was thrown into Five-Venom Cave.

72
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,680
To my surprise,

73
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,919
he survived that.

74
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,280
Sun Yi,

75
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,879
who's the current defense general
of Chenzhou?

76
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,280
It's General Li Yue.

77
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:37,599
Li Yue?

78
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,879
Before Father's ascension,

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,680
Li Yue was the Grand Chancellor's guard.

80
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,080
After Father ascended,

81
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,639
the Grand Chancellor
kept recommending him,

82
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,960
and then he became a general.

83
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:51,840
He's also serving my father?

84
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,000
I didn't realize
he had already taken control of

85
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,439
the frontier troops on both sides.

86
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,520
Does he want to stage a coup?

87
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:01,970
It doesn't seem like it.

88
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,719
If he were planning a coup,

89
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,690
there wouldn't be any need
to start a war with Anxi State.

90
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,560
Qin Feng must've found out something

91
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,639
unspeakable

92
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,719
and didn't want to follow
the Grand Chancellor.

93
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,879
That's why Mu Yuan sent out the message,

94
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,560
saying Qin Feng intended to rebel,
and killed him.

95
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,240
But that doesn't sound
like something he would say.

96
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,160
Mr. Qin sacrificed for the country.

97
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,490
Bing'er, let's head to
the Grand Chancellor's Residence

98
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,079
to console your father.

99
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,399
All right.

100
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,399
But what are you planning?

101
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,600
Yao Tian, bring some...

102
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,079
Where's Yao Tian?

103
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,959
The figures

104
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,319
match.

105
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:09,680
Father,

106
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:14,199
you are the butler.

107
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,160
Tian,

108
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,879
I sent you to the government authorities
when you were a kid

109
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,560
to learn to be loyal
to the ruler and country.

110
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:28,839
Look at what you have done.

111
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:31,279
You and your sneaky behavior.

112
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,439
No more pretending.

113
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,879
Ever since the moment
Mu Yuan refused to kill me,

114
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,319
I figured it out.

115
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,079
I'm just a merchant.

116
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,560
I live slightly more comfortably
than commoners,

117
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,079
but I'm still being controlled.

118
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,439
Are you saying

119
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,439
that someone threatens you?

120
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,879
You can tell me.

121
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,260
If you come with me to identify them,

122
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,600
I can guarantee your safety.

123
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,199
You guarantee?

124
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,279
How?

125
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,959
I started as a street vendor

126
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:05,240
and now become the richest man
in the Heng State.

127
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,720
How much hard work
I paid to achieve all this.

128
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:11,519
Even if I tell you
who the mastermind is,

129
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,720
what can you do?

130
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,079
Do you dare capture them?

131
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,360
This person is controlling the troops

132
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,040
on all four borders.

133
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,600
With an order,

134
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,439
a massacre will erupt.

135
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,959
I'm just a merchant.

136
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,759
There isn't much I can do.

137
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,000
If you want to live a long life,

138
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,839
it's best to know less.

139
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,160
Father,

140
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:54,199
His Highness has already gotten
to the bottom of this.

141
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,990
He's going to report this
to His Majesty in no time.

142
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:59,600
Capturing the Grand Chancellor
is a done deal.

143
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,920
Look outside now.

144
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:04,959
Many people are losing their homes
and their lives due to hunger.

145
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,839
Enough.

146
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,879
Do you think no one else would do this

147
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,639
if I didn't?

148
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,040
I'm just a merchant.

149
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:16,199
I wouldn't dare criticize
the imperial court.

150
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:18,800
I just hate to see

151
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,879
people being displaced.

152
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,000
Also, I want to secure
a bright future for you.

153
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:26,399
That's why I actively help
build the marketplace

154
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,920
and set up congee stalls for the needy.

155
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,000
Look at what you have done.

156
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,879
Not only did you not understand me,

157
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:36,279
but you also suspected
and disparaged me.

158
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:40,600
You...

159
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,919
You are so disappointing.

160
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,600
But Father,

161
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,759
this ledger...

162
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,799
Enough.

163
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:51,320
Tian,

164
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,919
I'm a man with a clear conscience.

165
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,879
If you capture the Grand Chancellor
and the rest,

166
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,440
I will testify.

167
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,639
If not,

168
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:07,320
I won't say a word

169
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,759
even if you take me
to the Investigation Bureau.

170
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,840
If you want the Yao Family to fall

171
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,000
or even face annihilation,

172
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,080
if you can bear the thought

173
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,200
of becoming the son
of a corrupt merchant

174
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:21,279
with no future,

175
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,799
go ahead and tie me up.

176
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:36,840
Father,

177
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,360
mend your ways.

178
00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:02,340
(Investigation Bureau)

179
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,519
Miss Manyu,

180
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:06,279
are you looking for Mr. Yao?

181
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,440
Yes.

182
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,080
I won't disturb his work.

183
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,480
Can you announce me?

184
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,639
I will leave right
after giving him this.

185
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:15,919
That's too bad.

186
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:18,000
Mr. Yao has returned home.

187
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,840
