=Princess Across Time=

2
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,460
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,960
Sirs and madams,

4
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,590
are you stopping for refreshments
or staying the night?

5
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,100
We are staying the night.

6
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,570
Please serve us some liquor and food.

7
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,159
Please come inside. Follow me.

8
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:58,159
Come on in.

9
00:00:58,759 --> 00:00:59,570
Please come inside.

10
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,280
Have a seat.

11
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,159
We have been traveling all day.
We are exhausted.

12
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,560
Hurry and bring us

13
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:17,120
some of your signature dishes.

14
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:19,959
We are just an inn on the outskirts.

15
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,480
We don't have any signature dishes,

16
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:24,840
just some simple home-cooked food.

17
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,519
That's fine. Serve some liquor first.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,519
Waiter, bring some liquor.

19
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,640
Coming.

20
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,560
That's not enough.

21
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,000
Bring us a bigger jar.

22
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,640
Waiter, bring a bigger jar.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,599
All right.

24
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:49,840
Well, that's all.

25
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,840
Go and prepare some dishes for us.

26
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,359
Please enjoy, sirs and madams.

27
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,000
Manyu,

28
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:08,960
test the liquor and see if it's drugged.

29
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,639
The liquor isn't drugged.

30
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,840
Your Highness,
are you suspecting something?

31
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,039
He isn't suspecting.

32
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,439
These people aren't
actually running an inn.

33
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:33,520
The innkeeper didn't introduce us
to her special dishes

34
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,479
when we entered the inn.

35
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,400
Besides, she didn't even know
the famous local Ankang fish dish.

36
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,690
Obviously, she isn't
familiar with the business.

37
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:44,039
Also, those servants have heavy steps.

38
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,039
The man looked slim,

39
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,039
but didn't gasp when carrying a big jar.

40
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,280
This suggests he has some skills.

41
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:54,240
Is this an evil inn?

42
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:57,680
I think I have seen
the innkeeper before,

43
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,560
but I couldn't recall where.

44
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,960
Stay awake tonight

45
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,560
in case of an attack.

46
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,080
For our safety,

47
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,159
I have prepared some antidote pills.

48
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,919
You can take one in advance

49
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,479
for your own safety tonight.

50
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:27,719
Old geezer,

51
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,560
have you dealt with those at the back?

52
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:34,039
Villagers are easy to handle.

53
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:36,639
Have they arrived?

54
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,039
Yes,

55
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:39,560
they are inside.

56
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,840
Since they have a death wish,

57
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,360
let's grant it.

58
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,039
We have traveled all day,

59
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,360
I'm so exhausted.

60
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,759
You should take a rest.

61
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,240
I will keep watch at the door.

62
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,510
I will call you if there's anything.

63
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,240
All right.

64
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,840
You ought to be careful.

65
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,199
Don't worry.

66
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,199
Xiyue.

67
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,959
Xiyue.

68
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,360
Xiyue, come here.

69
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,199
Why are you here?

70
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:52,079
I have something for you.

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,120
What's it?

72
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,399
Is it beautiful?

73
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,240
Yes.

74
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,439
Very beautiful.

75
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,280
Let me put this on for you.

76
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,839
Come.

77
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,959
Let's put this on.

78
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,839
Xiyue!

79
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,079
Xiyue, are you all right? Xiyue.

80
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,279
You...

81
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,959
What's going on?

82
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,240
I should ask you that.

83
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,860
If I hadn't come in time,
you would've...

84
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:29,930
You would've hung yourself.

85
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,199
I...

86
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,959
The dinner wasn't drugged.

87
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,839
Plus, you were patrolling.

88
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,800
Why is this happening?

89
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,199
(Illusion?)

90
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,120
I think I figured out

91
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,959
how Wu Shizheng died.

92
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,560
Wu Shizheng?

93
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:08,959
Let's go.

94
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,319
You made those illusions. Surrender now.

95
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,480
Mr. Yao.

96
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,319
Mr. Yao, are you all right?

97
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,199
I'm fine.

98
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,040
Help His Highness.

99
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,720
All right.

100
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,959
Speak.

101
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,360
Who are you?

102
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:22,279
You are the assassin
who tried to kill me that day.

103
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,439
When I saw you at the entrance,

104
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,439
you looked familiar.

105
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,319
Out with it.

106
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,240
Who do you serve?

107
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:34,959
Where's the birthmark?

108
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,800
I won't tell you anything.

109
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,040
Fine. If you don't want to tell,

110
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,399
you tell us.

111
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,480
Who is the mastermind?

112
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,900
Tell us, and I will spare your life.

113
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,519
Fine. I will tell you.

114
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,240
Rope trick?

115
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:44,399
Xiyue,

116
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,799
I found several bodies in the back hall.

117
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,879
They should be
the innkeeper and waiters.

118
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,720
These people probably came after us.

119
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,200
Exactly.

120
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:56,080
Seeing how desperate they are now,

121
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,590
I suppose we have found something
they are concerned about.

122
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,600
Right. Look at this.

123
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,399
(Ledger)
This is Wu Shizheng's ledger.

124
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,600
He always carried it with him.

125
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,840
Also, those people
fought so desperately just now.

126
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,159
The information inside this
must be very crucial.

127
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,679
If that's the case,

128
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,679
the imperial court can
focus on the right target

129
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,279
and confiscate
all illegal salt licenses.

130
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,080
But why do I feel

131
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:25,679
that things are
getting more complicated?

132
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:27,559
You see,

133
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:28,919
up till now,

134
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,519
we still have no clue

135
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:32,600
about the mastermind.

136
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,890
Once the illegal salt business
is cut off,

137
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,879
they will get impatient
and expose themselves.

138
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,000
Anyway, with you around,

139
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,279
I have the confidence.

140
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,799
It should be the county magistrate.

141
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:45,440
Let's go.

142
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,240
Where's Master?

143
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,720
Master is aware of what happened.

144
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,879
He has already left

145
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,720
for something important.

146
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:12,200
What else did he say?

147
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,559
Master instructed us

148
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:17,679
to kill Wu Shizheng's family.

149
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:32,759
Miss Manyu,
your antidote pill is amazing.

150
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,759
My arm

151
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,279
has recovered overnight.

152
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,120
No. Don't move your arm.

153
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,840
You may not feel the pain,

154
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,240
but it takes some days
for blood veins to resume.

155
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,690
You ought to be extra careful.

156
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,679
I can't find much herbs here.

157
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,399
I need to get more herbs

158
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,720
once we are back in the capital.

159
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,039
Don't worry, Miss Manyu.

160
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:55,039
I'm a martial artist.

161
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,000
Injuries are common to me.

162
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,440
Some ointment will help.

163
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,639
No.

164
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,919
You were injured

165
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:04,639
because of me.

166
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,200
I feel indebted to you,

167
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,440
so I will do my best to heal you.

168
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:13,840
Don't let it get to you.

169
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,600
I'm a man.

170
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,559
It's my duty to protect women.

171
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,480
Why are you blushing?

172
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,759
I'm not.

173
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,990
Your face is very red.

174
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,279
Mr. Liu,

175
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,840
have painters create portraits
of the criminal I described

176
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,279
and issue the arrest warrant.

177
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,240
These two fugitives are highly skilled.

178
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,000
Once I return to the capital,
I will request reinforcement for you.

179
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,799
Thank you, Your Highness.

180
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,080
You're dismissed.

181
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,080
Yes, Your Highness.

182
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,000
How are things going on Wu's side?

183
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:58,759
Wu said

184
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,799
Wu Shizheng seemed worried
a few days before his death.

185
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,200
Before he ran off,

186
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,080
he sent a letter to his family.

187
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,159
The messenger said

188
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:10,279
the letter was sent to a hut
on the outskirts outside the capital.

189
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,159
A hut on the outskirts?

190
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,440
Something's wrong.

191
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:17,120
It seems that Wu Shizheng

192
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,759
escaped in a rush

193
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:20,279
after hearing something.

194
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,480
He's a salt administration officer.

195
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,440
Why would his family leave the mansion
in the capital

196
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:28,759
and come to a hut on the outskirts?

197
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,679
That's exactly what I'm thinking.

198
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,720
Wu Shizheng has already gotten used
to living a luxurious life.

199
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,720
Even if he wanted to escape,

200
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,000
he wouldn't have chosen
an inn on the outskirts.

201
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,879
I'm sure the person

202
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,440
lured him there.

203
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,480
Exactly.

204
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,159
Besides, the person also knew

205
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,000
we would come over for an investigation

206
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,480
after Wu Shizheng was killed.

207
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,000
Therefore,

208
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:51,240
killing us in a provincial inn

209
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,320
is easier than in the capital.

210
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,480
By the looks of it,
this person knows us and Wu Shizheng

211
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,679
like the back of their hand.

212
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:02,440
If I were them,

213
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,759
I wouldn't go easy
on Wu Shizheng's family.

214
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,399
What should we do now?

215
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,390
If we rush back to the capital now,
it might take at least three days.

216
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,000
No worry.

217
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,120
I have sent Yao Tian to deliver a letter

218
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,190
to the Investigation Bureau
as quickly as possible.

219
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:16,879
All right.
