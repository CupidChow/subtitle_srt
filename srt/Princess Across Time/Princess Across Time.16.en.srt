1
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,900
=Princess Across Time=

2
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,460
=Episode 16=

3
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,520
Your Highness, who are you
referring to as a traitor?

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,679
You already got rid of him?

5
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,000
So, when I uttered the sentence,
I actually said,

6
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:48,280
"I got rid of the traitor?"

7
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,240
Miss Sun.

8
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,100
Yes, Your Highness.

9
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:52,240
Take them to their quarters.

10
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,170
Yes, Your Highness.

11
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:54,719
Please.

12
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,159
So, people of Anxi State
appeared at the salt mine, huh?

13
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,560
But at this moment,

14
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,840
the envoy of Anxi State
was murdered in the capital.

15
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,640
Your Highness!

16
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:19,879
I've finally found you.

17
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:21,860
His Excellency went
to your residence just now.

18
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,920
He said he had something urgent
to discuss with you.

19
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:24,959
Understood.

20
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,359
Mr. Yao.

21
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,719
You have to uncover Lv Yan's background
as soon as possible.

22
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:33,590
Yes, Your Highness.

23
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:42,760
Father?

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,390
Your Highness, we received
an urgent report from the borders.

25
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,630
Anxi State has condemned our state
for being unruly and arrogant

26
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,390
after hearing that their envoy
was murdered here.

27
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,159
They've already invaded our borders.

28
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,560
Yue Xin, the general in charge of border
defense, sent us an urgent letter.

29
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,439
He said that the situation was urgent.

30
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,890
He's requesting reinforcements
from the imperial court.

31
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,280
I just sought an audience
with His Majesty not long ago.

32
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:08,080
His Majesty instructed me
to discuss this issue with you.

33
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,479
How could it be this quick?

34
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,120
It's as if it was premeditated.

35
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,280
Indeed.

36
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,159
I've also heard about

37
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,199
the envoy's murder.

38
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,879
There seems to be more
to it than meets the eye.

39
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,479
But no matter what,

40
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,180
we can't afford to let our borders fall.

41
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,280
Heng State is situated in a region
surrounded by conflicts.

42
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,080
We need to guard
all four of our borders.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,190
In addition, the economy in
the past few years has been faltering.

44
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,510
Our tax revenue isn't as much as before.

45
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,990
And, we're severely lacking in troops.

46
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,080
I'm afraid we have no great generals
at our disposal right now.

47
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,520
Indeed.

48
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,199
I intend to send this year's recruits

49
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,199
to the frontline.

50
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,490
After that, I'll appoint
a general to lead them.

51
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,120
This way, we can boost our morale.

52
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,120
After this, I'll write a letter

53
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,319
to Yue Xin personally.

54
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,319
Your Highness,
that's exactly what I thought.

55
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,680
I recommend Qin Feng, which is my son,
to lead the army.

56
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,680
You mean my brother?

57
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,140
Has he ever been to war before?
Are you serious about this?

58
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:05,360
You have no right to make comments
on the state affairs.

59
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,719
Your Highness,

60
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,240
my son does lack practical experience.

61
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,800
But just like what you've said,

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,860
we usually appoint generals
to monitor

63
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,850
the battle situation and boost the troops' morale.

64
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:20,400
I think Yue Xin should be
the one directing the frontline.

65
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,840
Qin Feng is a dignified nobleman.

66
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,199
He does fit the criteria.

67
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,000
And, he's serving the Ministry of War.

68
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,220
He needs a chance
to engage in real combat as well.

69
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,690
I think that's appropriate.

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,599
Thank you, Your Highness.

71
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:34,680
Spare the formalities.

72
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,599
Father.

73
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,759
Feng, you're here.

74
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,759
Father.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,390
You just came back from the palace.

76
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,520
What's so urgent?

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,039
It's good news.

78
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,580
His Majesty is going to send someone
to lead the reinforcements

79
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,439
meant for the border frontline.

80
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:57,280
I recommended you.
His Majesty has agreed to it.

81
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,719
The border frontline?

82
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,319
Are we going to war with Anxi State?

83
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,800
What's with the sudden news?

84
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,000
That's right.

85
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,319
Although Anxi State and Heng State

86
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,280
have maintained
a harmonious relationship

87
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:10,319
under His Majesty's rule,

88
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:13,199
they were never satisfied

89
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,800
being our subordinate state.

90
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,439
And now, the envoy of Anxi State

91
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,839
was murdered here
for no apparent reason.

92
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,439
Anxi State wouldn't miss out
on an opportunity like this.

93
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,600
Although I'm the Vice Minister of War

94
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,650
and that leading troops to the frontline
is one of my duties,

95
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:32,279
I'm still inexperienced.

96
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,690
I'm afraid I'm not good enough
to be the main general.

97
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,399
General Yue Xin is both
brave and intelligent.

98
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,300
Once you go there,

99
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:41,620
you just need to do your job
as the main general of the three armies.

100
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,600
You can leave the rest to him.

101
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,800
Besides,

102
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,000
I know that heading
to the frontlines is risky.

103
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,920
However, people in the imperial court

104
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,519
were doubting your validity
as the vice minister of war.

105
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,839
Now, you can use this opportunity

106
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:01,120
to prove yourself
in front of His Majesty.

107
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,480
Father, you're right.

108
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,720
I'll follow your arrangements.

109
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,000
I'll go and get ready.

110
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,360
Go now.

111
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:08,720
By the way,

112
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,000
head to Crown Prince's Residence

113
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,280
to obtain the letter of authorization
for the military supplies transfer.

114
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,800
Yes, Father.

115
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:27,160
Your Highness, Mr. Qin is here.

116
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:35,160
Greetings, Your Highness.

117
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:36,990
Spare the formalities.

118
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,920
I'm writing a letter to General Yue Xin.

119
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,839
Please wait a moment.

120
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,040
Feng.

121
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,420
I heard that you'll be heading
to the battlefield.

122
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:51,399
Are you ready?

123
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:56,360
I just lack His Highness's
letter of authorization.

124
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,079
I'm here to retrieve it.

125
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,610
I'm glad to hear that.

126
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,959
You must be very careful.

127
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,790
Since ancient times, how many
can return from the battlefield?

128
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,879
I'm just doing my best
to serve the state.

129
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,560
But please relay my message

130
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,000
to Mr. Yao.

131
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,319
Tell him to study ways
to improve his investigative abilities.

132
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,120
The envoy was murdered,

133
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,199
but we haven't caught the culprit yet.

134
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,439
That's why our borders were invaded.

135
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,490
I wouldn't even need
to head to the borders

136
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,199
to clean up his mess

137
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,270
had he been more efficient
in the first place.

138
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:31,399
Enough already. You should stop.

139
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,639
It's just one unsolved case.

140
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:36,800
You don't need to be this sarcastic.

141
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,760
His Highness
is supervising the investigation.

142
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,519
Are you trying to criticize him
for being inefficient?

143
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,439
Besides,

144
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,759
you already said so yourself.

145
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,399
You're the vice minister of war.
You're serving the state here.

146
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,550
How is this our fault now?

147
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,720
And, what did you mean by
cleaning up our mess?

148
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,319
You were idle most of the time anyway.

149
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,290
Don't you think it's time
for you to do something decent?

150
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,319
I didn't question you
that much back then.

151
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,500
You didn't need to be this petty.

152
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,740
You actually held your grudge until now?

153
00:06:58,759 --> 00:06:59,319
Enough.

154
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,390
Mr. Qin is heading on an expedition
for the state's sake.

155
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,090
He bears huge responsibilities.

156
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,959
Here's the letter.

157
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,360
Remember to give Yue Xin

158
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,530
a reminder when you see him.

159
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,199
Although Anxi State seems aggressive
this time around,

160
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,160
they're just a group of nobodies.

161
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,420
Our state has a small army.

162
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,800
Do not engage them directly.

163
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,490
Tell him to devise more strategies.

164
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:25,639
Anxi State will withdraw their troops
eventually.

165
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,490
Your Highness, you're well-versed
in strategies yourself.

166
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,360
Thank you for the advice.

167
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:02,240
Thank you for
speaking up for me just now.

168
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,399
Who said I was speaking up for you?

169
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:08,160
I just couldn't tolerate
how sarcastic Qin Feng was.

170
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,759
Tang Bing'er, let's reconcile
with each other.

171
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,160
You...

172
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,399
What did you call me just now?

173
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,879
Isn't your name Tang Bing'er?

174
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:25,040
Indeed.

175
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,959
You're completely different

176
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,079
from Crown Princess.

177
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,120
Although I don't know the reason,

178
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,759
it doesn't matter.

179
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,679
I like the current Tang Bing'er better.

180
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,080
Go to sleep.

181
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,759
You see,

182
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,279
the floor is quite cold.

183
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,159
Can I...

184
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:45,840
No.

185

196
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,399
Zhou Jian?

197
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,159
That's right.

198
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,710
I stayed up all night searching for files
in the Investigative Bureau.

199
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,799
I found out that Zhou Jian

200
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,759
had a deadly feud
against Lv Yan 20 years ago.

201
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,200
Zhou Jian is also one of the guards
in the envoy's residence.

202
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,360
Where is he now?

203
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:12,559
He escaped overnight.

204
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,679
Zhou Jian reported a case

205
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,700
to the Investigative Bureau
20 years ago.

206
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,600
He accused Lv Yan of seizing
the Zhou Family's land.

207
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:21,320
This case was later shelved,

208
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,540
and no definitive explanation was found.

209
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:24,960
The entire Zhou Family

210
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,279
died in a huge fire five days later.

211
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:30,360
The case was deemed as an accident.

212
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:33,279
It was said that the servants
of the Zhou Family

213
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,799
the straw beside the stove by accident.

214
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,290
At that moment,
Zhou Jian just joined the military.

215
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,390
He was fighting for the state.

216
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,230
That's why he was spared
from the tragedy.

217
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,990
He rushed back to the capital overnight

218
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,399
upon receiving the news.

219
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,919
He cried about his grievances every day.

220
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,590
The Investigative Bureau
didn't reopen the case

221
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,759
due to insufficient evidence.

222
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,080
Out of sympathy,

223
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,360
the imperial court

224
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,990
recruited him into the Imperial Guards.

225
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,759
He was in charge of
the capital's defense.

226
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,879
After that, Lv Yan changed
his name and identity

227
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,480
to proceed with his trading business.

228
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,360
And, he appeared in our state
as Anxi State's envoy.

229
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:05,440
That's right.

230
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,679
Something's off about the arson case.

231
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,960
The Zhou Family was alive and healthy.

232
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,960
Why would they not try to escape
or put out the fire when they saw one?

233
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,720
Why would they let the fire
burn them to death?

234
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,679
I assume Lv Yan was behind the incident.

235
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,600
The Zhou Family used to be
honest businessmen.

236
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:24,559
After that, Lv Yan took a liking

237
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:26,480
upon their ancestral land.

238
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,490
He stole it from them using
unscrupulous means.

239
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,279
He murdered the Zhou Family

240
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,190
as he was afraid that they might
seek revenge against them.

241
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,399
Zhou Jian was the only survivor.

242
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:36,679
And now, Zhou Jian
finally has the chance

243
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:38,000
to avenge his family.

244
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,770
There's one more thing
I can't figure out.

245
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,320
How did Zhou Jian find out

246
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,200
that Lv Yan was the envoy?

247
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,480
I checked the duty records
of the guards on that day.

248
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,279
Zhou Jian changed his shift long ago.

249
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,890
That means he planned for it long ago.

250
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,360
If so, maybe someone tipped him off.
