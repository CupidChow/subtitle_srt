2
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,460
=Episode 9=

3
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,399
Mr. Yao.

4
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:43,479
Mr. Yao.

5
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,320
Miss Manyu.

6
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:49,240
Mr. Yao,

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,280
I have a favor to ask of you.

8
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,880
Yes, please, Miss Manyu.

9
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,390
I want to learn martial arts skills
from you.

10
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,600
Martial arts skills?

11
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:00,280
Why?

12
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:03,119
If I had known martial arts skills,

13
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,760
I could've protected Her Highness.

14
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:10,990
Miss Manyu, practicing martial arts skills
is something men do.

15
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:13,480
Besides, you are well-versed
in medicine and poisons.

16
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,719
I truly admire your skills.

17
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:18,359
This incident is an accident.

18
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,079
I will send a few skilled guards

19
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,560
to keep Her Highness safe.

20
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,480
I don't agree with that, Mr. Yao.

21
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,380
Why can't women
practice martial arts skills?

22
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,760
This is a kind of disrespect for women.

23
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:30,480
Apart from that,

24
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:32,400
Her Highness is of a noble status.

25
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,599
It's inappropriate to be surrounded

26
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,439
by a few men.

27
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,519
Miss Manyu, you have a point.

28
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,400
I wasn't thinking.

29
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,490
It's just that practicing
martial arts skills are tough.

30
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,000
Besides,

31
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,799
I'm tied up with some work.

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,359
It's fine.

33
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,280
I can endure hardship.

34
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,239
I will wait for you.

35
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,400
Then we shall do as you say.

36
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,000
Your Highness, it's almost midnight.

37
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:16,479
Please eat something and get rest.

38
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,000
I will take over.

39
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:20,719
I'm fine.

40
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,120
You may go.

41
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,240
Yes, Your Highness.

42
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,319
Xiyue,

43
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,240
when will you wake up?

44
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:39,120
I order you

45
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,360
to wake up now.

46
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,280
Xiyue.

47
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,800
Xiyue, you are awake.

48
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,479
Why is your nose bleeding? Who hit you?

49
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,439
Bleeding...

50
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,680
It's fine. It doesn't matter.

51
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,039
How do you feel now?

52
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,960
I thought I wouldn't
be able to see you again.

53
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,990
Everything is all right now.

54
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,360
You won't be in danger anymore.

55
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,759
But you have to promise me

56
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,599
that you won't go anywhere alone again.

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,159
If so, I still...

58
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,840
You...

59
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,590
Are you not feeling well again?

60
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:41,800
Manyu...

61
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,100
I'm good. No need to summon her.

62
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,970
How many days have I been unconscious?

63
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,159
Seven days.

64
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,960
Seven days?

65
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:54,159
Your birthday has already passed.

66
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,400
I prepared you...

67
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:57,520
Where's the gift?

68
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,919
I...

69
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,560
Where's the folding fan?

70
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,159
Do you mean this?

71
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,360
Yes, this is it.

72
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,520
Manyu picked it up from the river.

73
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,479
Why is it all smudged?

74
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,959
I put so much effort into drawing this.

75
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,759
Did you go out that day

76
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,639
to buy this for me?

77
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,279
Didn't I tell you

78
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,879
that married couples
need some small surprises?

79
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:43,400
What did you

80
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,279
just say?

81
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,920
I heard me.

82
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,319
My dear.

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,079
Come, call me my dear.

84
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,279
I won't.

85
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:09,639
If so, don't blame me.

86
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,199
I'm going to pull the blanket off.

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,319
I'm coming.

88
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,360
Get out.

89
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:26,300
♪I will journey through ups and downs
to meet you as promised♪

90
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:29,720
Your Highness,

91
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,279
this is the pork and preserved egg congee
you taught me before.

92
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:33,480
Please try it.

93
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,490
Be careful. It's hot.

94
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,920
Your Highness, you are finally awake.

95
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,519
If you don't,

96
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,720
His Highness is going to collapse.

97
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,399
He didn't sleep much these days

98
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,279
while taking care of you.

99
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,399
All right, Manyu.

100
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:55,600
Go and check
if the other dishes are ready.

101
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,880
Yes, Your Highness.

102
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,240
By the way,

103
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,100
did you get a clear look
at what those people looked like?

104
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,839
Except for He Gong,

105
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,680
that person was masked.

106
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:16,399
I remembered.

107
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,199
On the right shoulder of that person,

108
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,120
there was a light green birthmark.

109
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,000
It's a shame that they got away.

110
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,240
However,

111
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,000
judging from the market price
fluctuation these days,

112
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,040
it should be their doing.

113
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,600
Let's go to Zishan County.

114
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,079
You can go,

115
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,360
but you need to promise

116
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,000
not to leave my sight.

117
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,319
All right.

118
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,079
I promise I won't do that again.

119
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,720
Since the moment I woke up,

120
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,490
you have already made me
promise so many times.

121
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,040
I give you my word.

122
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,639
Your Highness,

123
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,439
please let me go with you.

124
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,360
Mr. Yao agreed to teach me

125
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,279
martial arts skills
so that I can protect you.

126
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,079
I'm worried he will go back

127
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:59,160
on his word later.

128
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:03,120
All right. Let's go together.

129
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,399
Greetings, Your Highnesses.

130
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,839
What's the situation now?

131
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,390
Nothing strange has been found yet.

132
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,759
However, the way He Cheng died
seems fishy.

133
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:32,324
Manyu, bring me the toolbox.

134
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,160
Were those things taken?

135
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,639
We can't be sure of it yet.

136
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,240
But I suppose He Cheng wouldn't place
the important thing casually.

137
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,439
He probably hid it in a secret place.

138
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:06,480
Summon the witness.

139
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,430
I want to question them.

140
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,590
Yes, Your Highness.

141
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,360
Sun Yi, bring the witness.

142
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:11,439
Yes, sir.

143
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,319
Move the body to the morgue.

144
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,190
Yes, Your Highness.

145
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,990
No visible sign of external trauma.

146
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,120
The time of death is last night,

147
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,679
around eight to twelve hours ago.

148
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,960
Manyu,

149
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,879
when did the time teller find him?

150
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,240
At the hour of Zi.

151
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:44,840
It should be about right.

152
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,879
I have checked for fine details.

153
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,200
There are no small injuries
like needle marks.

154
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:51,919
The exact cause

155
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,360
will only be known
after the examination.
