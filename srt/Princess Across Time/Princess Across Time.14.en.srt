2
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,460
=Episode 14=

3
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:41,000
I've told you time and time again.

4
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,200
I told you not to be reckless.

5
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,520
Why didn't you listen to me?

6
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,799
I just wanted to help you out.

7
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,000
You don't have any evidence.

8
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,140
You have no evidence to back your claim.
Everyone would be angry!

9
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:51,439
Besides, even if it was him,

10
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,600
you'd still be alerting him
to our presence.

11
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,660
You're more likely to ruin things...

12
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:56,940
Than accomplish anything, right?

13
00:00:58,719 --> 00:00:59,359
Bring it on.

14
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,920
Go on.

15
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,079
That's right.

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,200
I'm more likely to ruin things
than accomplish anything.

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,400
I'm useless. Happy now?

18
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,319
This is who I am.

19
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:07,719
I can't keep things to myself.

20
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,690
Is it wrong for me
to be worried and upset?

21
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,830
Is it wrong for me to be worried
that he might be manipulated?

22
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,879
That's not what I meant.

23
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,140
I'm trying to reason with you.

24
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,799
Are you even showing the right attitude?

25
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,280
Xiyue.

26
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:21,159
Xiyue!

27
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,760
Xiyue, what are you doing?

28
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,480
Where are you going
in the middle of the night?

29
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:28,439
Stay out...

30
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,200
Xiyue!

31
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:30,599
Stay out of my business!

32
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,840
Stop following me!

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,799
Fine. I'm wrong.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,319
How could you be wrong?

35
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,580
It's all my fault? Happy now?

36
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,079
I wish to be alone!

37
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:38,760
Wait.

38
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:39,920
This is...

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,319
Xiyue!

40
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,620
(Chunlai Inn)

41
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:16,719
Wu!

42
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:17,960
Xiyue!

43
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,199
Xiyue!

44
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,439
Wu!

45
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,800
Wu?

46
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:27,319
Wu!

47
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:27,960
Wu!

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,950
Wu, what's wrong with you?

49
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,960
Wu!

50
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,080
Wu!

51
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,759
Your Highness,

52
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,560
although Wu was seriously wounded,

53
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,319
luckily, his vital organs
weren't damaged.

54
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,190
I'll give him some prescriptions
that'll help replenish his blood.

55
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,000
He'll be fine after taking it
for a few days.

56
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,960
All right.

57
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,520
I wonder who did that to him.

58
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,080
He could end up with tetanus

59
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,790
if his wounds aren't treated properly.

60
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,800
Your Highness.

61
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,290
You're doing this on purpose.

62
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,759
Crown Princess.

63
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,840
Don't call me that.

64
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,250
I'm not Crown Princess.

65
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,439
I'm Tang Bing'er.

66
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,439
Tang Bing'er?

67
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,479
Who's that?

68
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,759
Manyu.

69
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,639
It's my fault.

70
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,599
I must've terrified you.

71
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,790
How is it? Does it still hurt?

72
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,159
Manyu, it was an emergency.

73
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,100
Sorry for offending you.

74
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,120
Not at all.

75
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,959
You must've been worried about Wu.

76
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,380
Actually, you don't need
to go through all this trouble.

77
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,490
You could've told the servants
to brew the medicine.

78
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,560
I...

79
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,079
Do you still feel unwell?

80
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,839
I'm fine.

81
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,319
A lot of things have happened lately.

82
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,970
I wish to share your burden...

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,470
I wish to share His Highness's burden
and Her Highness's burden with them.

84
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,040
Compared to you guys,

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,560
this is the only thing I can do.

86
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,839
That's not true.

87
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,639
I would've lost my arm had you
not treated me with your medicine

88
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,519
in the wilderness back then.

89
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,439
You're indispensable.

90
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:57,959
Do you really think so?

91
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,639
Thank you, Mr. Yao.

92
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,839
I'll go and check on Wu.

93
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,160
How's Wu doing?

94
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,480
Relay my message to him.

95
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,040
Tell him

96
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:43,279
that Wu won't be having any infections.

97
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,959
He's much better than before.

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,260
Just waiting for him to wake up.

99
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,639
Your Highness,

100
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,639
Her Highness said Wu won't be
having any infections.

101
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,590
What did you say again?
I forgot the second half.

102
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,399
He's much better now.

103
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,759
Enough. You can stop now.

104
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,730
I've heard everything.

105
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,959
The medicine is almost ready.
I'll go and check it.

106
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,079
I'll join you.

107
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,199
Your Highness,

108
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,240
what's with you and Her Highness...

109
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:28,839
I said something offensive.

110
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,360
I think I offended her.

111
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,759
Wu.

112
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,639
Wu, how do you feel?

113
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,240
- Your Highness...
- Wu.

114
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,240
Your Highness.

115
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,680
There's a spy in the salt mine.

116
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,680
There's no rush. Take your time.

117
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:56,890
Take your time.

118
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,879
That day,

119
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,839
I was outside the
government's salt mine.

120
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,319
Wait.

121
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,690
I got rid of the traitor.
[*Anxi Language]

122
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,919
He spoke...

123
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,840
He spoke...

124
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,600
Kenta

125
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,200
Sayilai.

126
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:44,600
That's right.

127
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,840
Kenta Sayilai?

128
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,639
What language is that?

129
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,840
It sounded familiar to me.

130
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,470
I couldn't remember it at the moment.

131
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,519
A hand gesture.

132
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,639
That's right. There was a hand gesture.

133
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,320
A hand gesture?

134
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,240
A hand gesture.

135
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,399
(He's making a heart gesture at me.)

136
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,200
By the way,

137
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,840
Wu Shizheng's wife once said

138
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,440
that he made contact
with a group of foreign tribesfolk.

139
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:32,679
Are you saying

140
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,679
that the foreign tribesfolk

141
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,799
might be the ones who assaulted Wu?

142
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,559
Your Highness, we're in huge trouble!

143
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,370
The envoys of Anxi State
have been killed.

144
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,320
His Majesty is enraged.

145
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,350
Your Highness, he wants you
to investigate the case.

146
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,060
You have to find the culprit
in three days.

147
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,000
What?

148
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,960
What?

149
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,500
(Investigation Bureau)

150
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,320
Manyu.

151
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:11,519
Don't be afraid.

152
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,720
He died because he was beheaded.

153
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,519
But he didn't show signs

154
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,840
of major struggles.

155
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,440
He was killed

156
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:36,559
after the palace dinner.

157
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,840
Maybe he was murdered
after he got drunk.

158
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,399
Could it be

159
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,919
that he has offended someone?

160
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,240
Such execution methods are usually
employed by the imperial court

161
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,840
to execute criminals.

162
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,039
It's rare to find them at crime scenes.

163
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,919
It's because it'll leave
a huge amount of blood behind.

164
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,399
They won't usually do this unless
they have a deep feud.

165
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,919
So, the culprit beheaded him

166
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,759
in order to make him atone for his sins?

167
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,360
That doesn't make sense either.

168
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,120
Why did they choose
to strike at that time and place?

169
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,890
There's might be more
to it than meets the eye.
