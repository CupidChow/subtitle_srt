1
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,900
=Princess Across Time=

2
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,460
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,960
His Highness's prediction is correct.

4
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:45,159
This is a trap. Retreat.

5
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:49,719
Split into two squads.

6
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:50,399
- Yes.
- Yes.

7
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,920
Your Highness, Mr. Yao,

8
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,719
I have brought
Wu Shizheng's family here.

9
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,040
However,

10
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,200
the two villains fled.

11
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,480
It's all right. Good job, Miss Sun.

12
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:15,079
They are highly skilled.

13
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,959
Mr. Yao and I

14
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,000
don't have the confidence
to arrest them.

15
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,280
Fortunately, they are brought here.

16
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,040
It's very well done.

17
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:25,319
Your Highness,

18
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:28,200
please protect me and my daughter.

19
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,480
Don't worry, Mrs. Wu.

20
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,400
I will keep you safe.

21
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,599
It's just that you have to
tell us everything you know.

22
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,000
All right.

23
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,239
Please have a look.

24
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,680
Mother, where is this?

25
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:47,680
When will Father come back?

26
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:50,680
Ling'er, be good.

27
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,400
Father went to a faraway place.

28
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,359
He will only be back many years later.

29
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,359
What's wrong, Mother?

30
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,640
I'm fine.

31
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:01,879
Don't worry.

32
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:03,120
Manyu.

33
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,920
Ling'er,

34
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:09,599
let's go play over there, all right?

35
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,719
Go with her.

36
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,800
Mrs. Wu, please come inside.

37
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,719
All right.

38
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:30,319
When he first became
the salt administration officer,

39
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,639
he was upright.

40
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,560
Unfortunately,

41
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:37,080
we had no connections or backing.

42
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,719
We had a tough life.

43
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,240
Gradually,

44
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,879
he was lost in his role.

45
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,120
But I understand

46
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:47,319
he wanted to give us a better life.

47
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,039
Mrs. Wu,

48
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,000
do you know with whom
he was dealing the illegal salt trade?

49
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,240
I don't know.

50
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,159
He never told me about these things.

51
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,319
But those people all looked fierce.

52
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,360
Some of them were foreigners
who spoke weirdly.

53
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,319
Foreigners?

54
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,240
Do you know where exactly they are from?

55
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,319
I'm not sure.

56
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,439
I couldn't understand a word they said.

57
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,719
One day,

58
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,479
he suddenly asked me to move out

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,199
as he worried we might be in trouble
if his trade went wrong.

60
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,120
My daughter and I then lived on

61
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,400
his paltry salary for over a year.

62
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:31,039
We checked his ledger.

63
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,080
He was giving a few thousand taels
to the butler every month.

64
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:37,039
Butler? We didn't have a butler.

65
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,159
When he was in the residence,

66
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,879
I took care of all household matters.

67
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,400
We never hired a butler.

68
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,400
By any chance,

69
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:48,759
this butler

70
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,840
isn't a real person,

71
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,280
but a disguised name?

72
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,360
That makes sense.

73
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:58,840
Wu Shizheng transferred the embezzlement

74
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,240
to the so-called butler.

75
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,460
Naturally, he didn't have money
for his family.

76
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,360
Mrs. Wu, your husband is already died.

77
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,800
But he mustn't die for nothing.

78
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,879
You just talked about the money.

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,260
Why didn't he mention it before?

80
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,160
It's because he said

81
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,199
his business partner in the capital

82
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,680
found out

83
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,199
that his trades were exposed

84
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,560
and wanted to punish him,

85
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,560
so he planned to hide for a while.

86
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,560
He gave me the money

87
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,199
and told me to marry someone else.

88
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,680
It's exactly the same as what I thought.

89
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,279
Mrs. Wu, thank you for telling me this.

90
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,380
Please return and get rest.

91
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:44,759
I will still come to you
if I have any questions.

92
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:47,079
Thank you, Your Highness.

93
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,959
What are you going to do next?

94
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,490
Regain the trust
of the people.

95
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,439
Wu Shizheng, the salt administration
officer, was murdered.

96
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,879
Read this carefully, folks.

97
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:08,079
Wu Shizheng peddled illegal salt,

98
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,600
and had already been exposed.

99
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,560
Crown Prince found solid evidence

100
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,160
and reported it to His Majesty.

101
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,439
His Majesty has decreed
that from this day onwards,

102
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,920
all salt licenses bought from Wu Shizheng
are considered invalid.

103
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,600
Whoever surrenders
will have their punishment waived.

104
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,720
Otherwise, they will be treated the same
as those who peddled illegal salt.

105
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,519
It's a waste of our money.

106
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,839
If you can provide clues or evidence

107
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,160
regarding this illegal salt case,

108
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,490
the imperial court will reward you.

109
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,959
Excellent!

110
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,839
All merchants and folks

111
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,639
are the victims of illegal salt.

112
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,680
The illegal salt investigation
isn't only for the imperial court

113
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,079
but for yourselves.

114
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,319
Crown Prince has said

115
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:52,079
that anyone who is involved,

116
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,959
regardless of their status or position,
will be punished equally.

117
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,279
Well said!

118
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,600
Those bunch of illegal salt peddlers

119
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,839
are going to pay the price.

120
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:00,920
Rightfully so.

121
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,160
Folks, hurry and think about

122
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,600
any clue you might have.

123
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,170
That's right.

124
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,199
Yes.

125
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,920
Ever since the decree was issued,

126
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,560
many anonymous reports came in.

127
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:14,040
The majority of them complain
about Qin Feng.

128
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,900
What do you make of it?

129
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,319
I think that's possible.

130
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,980
As far as I'm concerned,

131
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,120
Mr. Qin has many properties
in the capital.

132
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,639
However, his living expenses

133
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,160
largely exceed his salary per month,

134
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,000
which is known by everyone
in the capital.

135
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,319
However, no one
has raised an issue about it

136
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,399
due to his identity.

137
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:40,279
I think he's not capable of that.

138
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:41,680
Even if he is,

139
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,040
he is only a pawn.

140
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,079
The Six Ministries are under the charge
of the Grand Chancellor.

141
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:53,000
Are you saying
it's Grand Chancellor?

142
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,079
No.

143
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,990
Grand Chancellor
holds great influence.

144
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,720
Disrupting the nation
won't do the Qin Family

145
00:06:58,839 --> 00:06:59,920
any good.

146
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,839
Could those reports against Mr. Qin

147
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,879
be because

148
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,790
of his private dealings with others
behind Grand Chancellor's back?

149
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,079
Mr. Qin may be reckless,

150
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:11,600
but he still has a clear mind.

151
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,879
Tomorrow is
Grand Chancellor's birthday.

152
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:15,990
Crown Princess is going home.

153
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,360
I will ask her to find a chance
and bring Mr. Qin back.

154
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,580
I'm going to ask him discreetly.

155
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:24,720
Be gentle.

156
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,879
You are hurting me.

157
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,160
Here.

158
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,240
Right.

159
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:34,600
This side.

160
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,560
Be gentle.

161
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,040
A bit higher.

162
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,900
- Who's there?
- Who's there?

163
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,079
Manyu?

164
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:57,600
Yao Tian?

165
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,360
What are you doing here?

166
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,000
Your Highness,

167
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,879
so you were doing your hair.

168
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,680
I have taught him so well.

169
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,319
He always complains
that I take too long to get ready,

170
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,079
so I must let him know

171
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,639
how troublesome it is
for a woman before going out,

172
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,279
especially in ancient times.

173
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,759
She's my wife.

174
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,240
I have to pamper no matter what.

175
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,120
Yes, right.

176
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,240
I didn't know you had a talent for this,
Your Highness.

177
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,560
Of course.

178
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,399
I'm going out.

179
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:34,879
By the way,

180
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,490
remember what I told you.

181
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,759
Okay.

182
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,960
Move.

183
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,559
Feng.

184
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,879
Xiyue.

185
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,750
It's late.
Why don't you go back?

186
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,960
Go home and get rest.

187
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,440
Do come back to visit Father
when you have time.

188
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:58,600
He misses you very much.

189
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,759
No problem.

190
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,639
Can you go back with me?

191
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,130
There were too many people earlier,

192
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,360
we didn't get a chance to talk.

193
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,480
Like you love to talk to me.

194
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,639
What's it again?

195
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,879
Nothing.

196
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,120
I just

197
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:18,360
want to chat with you.

198
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:21,320
His Highness hasn't seen you
in a long time.

199
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,000
Besides,

200
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,840
it's dark outside.

201
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,639
Aren't you worried that I go home alone?

202
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,039
Well, I will send you back.

203
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,559
You are the best, Feng. Let's go.

204
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,440
Come on.

205
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,279
Feng,

206
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,759
I have something to ask you.

207
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,919
I knew it.

208
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:50,000
Tell me, then.

209
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,039
What's it about?

210
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,279
Well,

211
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,799
do you know Wu Shizheng?

212
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,320
Wu Shizheng.

213
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,919
Are you referring

214
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,679
to the salt administration officer
who died a few days ago?

215
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:07,919
That's right.

216
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,600
I know him.

217
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,850
We met at the imperial court before,

218
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,440
but we weren't close.

219
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:15,639
Really?

220
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,540
What are you trying to ask?

221
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,919
Nothing.

222
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,519
Stop beating around the bush.

223
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,559
Well, I just...

224
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,399
I'm worried about you.

225
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,240
What's there to worry about?

226
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:33,919
I said it's nothing.

227
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,799
I see.

228
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,399
Wu Shizheng is dead,
and you worry about me.

229
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,120
Are you suspecting
that I'm related to this case?

230
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:50,840
Last time, when Lian died,

231
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,390
you suspected me,
I didn't want to say anything.

232
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:54,799
But this Wu Shizheng
is completely unrelated to me,

233
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:55,860
and you are suspicious again.

234
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:57,519
Do you really see me as...

235
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:59,480
No.

236
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:00,679
No?

237
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,279
Stop arguing.

238
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:03,360
I...

239
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,720
I just...

240
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,279
I'm just worried
that you are being used. I mean it.

241
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:13,000
His Highness suspects
that I colluded with Wu Shizheng

242
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,919
in corruption and illegal salt trade,

243
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,679
so he sent you to test me, right?

244
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:20,600
What a cooperative couple.

245
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,039
Look,

246
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:24,120
why are you dragging
His Highness into this?

247
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,559
Well, stop pretending.

248
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,360
Yes,

249
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,279
I do all the bad things.

250
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:32,879
Anyway, to you,

251
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:34,679
I'm a bad guy.

252
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:45,200
You are home.

253
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:47,519
Let's go inside.

254
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,080
There is no need, Your Highness.

255
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,440
Just say it here

256
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,960
if there is anything.

257
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,759
Xiyue, come here.

258
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,360
What has happened to Qin Feng?

259
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,320
I don't know.

260
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,440
It has been a while, Mr. Qin.

261
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,090
You are getting more spirited.

262
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,060
Your Highness,
I daren't refuse your summon,

263
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,440
that's why I'm here.

264
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,960
But I have nothing to do
with the illegal salt incident.

265
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,080
If you suspect me,

266
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,559
investigate it, and you will see.

267
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,919
Mr. Qin, what are you getting at?

268
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,480
I received two jars of fine brew today

269
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,320
and wanted to invite you for a drink.

270
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,399
Your Highness,

271
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,200
I don't deserve such honor.

272
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,360
If you have any questions,

273
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,879
I will tell you as much as I can.

274
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,360
Perhaps Xiyue said something wrong

275
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:55,840
and has upset you.

276
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,279
Well.

277
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,399
If you are not in the mood for a drink,

278
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,720
I won't force you.

279
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,919
Guard, see the guest out.

280
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,879
That's unnecessary.

281
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,120
I shall take my leave.

282
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,840
Feng.
