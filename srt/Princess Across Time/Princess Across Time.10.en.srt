00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,900
=Princess Across Time=

2
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,460
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,320
Your Highness.

4
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:47,280
Greetings, Your Highness.

5
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,880
Liu Er, let me ask you something.

6
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:51,079
What exactly happened on that night?

7
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:52,439
That night,

8
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,640
after I rang the midnight bell,

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,759
I heard rustling

10
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:58,840
near Mr. Shui's house.

11
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:00,920
I thought there was a thief.

12
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,200
I went there to check it out.

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,000
It turned out

14
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,280
to be a bridal procession.

15
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,719
All the palanquin bearers

16
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,920
were all made of paper.

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,780
They scattered paper money
while walking.

18
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,359
They even stared at me.

19
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:13,719
Although night watchmen like us

20
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:15,280
do encounter strange things often,

21
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,120
that was the first time
I encountered something that creepy.

22
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,439
Don't worry.

23
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,890
Since I'm here, that means

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,120
I'll uphold justice
under the imperial family's name.

25
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:25,760
Your Highness,
please uphold justice for us.

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,519
When I was young,

27
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,920
a master imparted
his exorcism techniques to me.

28
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,560
I can exorcise any spirits or ghosts.

29
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,640
The victim's heart and brain

30
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,120
show clear signs of congestion.

31
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,040
If that's the case,

32
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,040
it's likely that
he died from heart failure

33
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,000
due to excessive excitement.

34
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,680
Excessive excitement?

35
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,560
He Cheng came here to avoid pursuit.

36
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:03,000
Is there something
worth celebrating about?

37
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,690
It might not necessarily be an occasion.

38
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,690
Drugs can make people excited too.
They can even make them go berserk.

39
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,800
You do have a point.

40
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,080
Just from what I know,
there are at least dozens of kinds.

41
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,120
But Your Highness,

42
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,080
no matter what kind of drug was used,

43
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,000
the victim would suffer
extensively before dying.

44
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,599
They would never die

45
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,039
with a smile on their face.

46
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,550
That makes even more sense.

47
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,759
That means this kind of drug

48
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,479
can do more than just excite him.

49
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,400
It can also cause him to hallucinate.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,990
I'm sure he saw something

51
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,280
that made him happy before his death.

52
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,120
Manyu.

53
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,319
These are Gu poison crystals.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,680
I retrieved them from his nasal cavity
and lungs.

55
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,479
That means he died after taking

56
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,240
such a Gu poison.

57
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,240
This is Heart-Devouring Gu Poison.

58
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:52,919
However,

59
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:57,039
this is much more potent than
the one used to kill Situ Lian.

60
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:00,120
It was refined time and time again.

61
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,680
The one that was used
to kill Situ Lian still had

62
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,800
to be mixed with food.

63
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:08,039
But for liquid poison as such,

64
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,599
they can be released
in the form of mist.

65
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,520
Once a person absorbs it,
the poison will also take effect faster.

66
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,620
It's more potent as well.

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,599
But you said

68
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:21,400
it costs a fortune

69
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,800
to concoct such a poison.

70
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,120
Wouldn't it cost more

71
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,080
to refine it to such a pure level?

72
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,319
Naturally.

73
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,479
However,

74
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,080
I never expected anyone

75
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,240
to be this good at concocting poison.

76
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,520
A chess game?

77
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,080
Mr. Yao,

78
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:43,560
did you guys find things like chess manuals
around the place?

79
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,000
We found one.

80
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:45,919
Sun Yi.

81
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,700
(Lu Manual)

82
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,400
That's right.

83
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,480
This is the codebook for
solving the chess puzzle.

84
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,039
There are records of
various chess puzzles here.

85
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,080
But it's obvious that this page
has been referred to the most.

86
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,599
We might have to reenact

87
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,439
the chess puzzle.

88
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,080
Come. I'll join you.

89
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,879
Okay.

90
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,120
Cannon, 2 to 7.

91
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,079
Rook, 7 to 1.

92
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:27,600
Cannon, 4 to 3.

93
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,480
Rook, 7 to 3.

94
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,800
Rook, 2 to 8.

95
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:02,800
What is this?

96
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,220
(Salt Administration Bureau,
Ministry of Revenue)

97
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,570
This is the inventory list
for official salt.

98
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,519
The official in charge of salt,
Wu Shizheng, stamped the paper.

99
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,690
It's reasonable for Wu Shizheng to have
the inventory list

100
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,240
and salt transport permit.

101
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:30,560
But why did Situ Lian report him to me?

102
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:34,680
Unless it involves salt smuggling.

103
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,020
(Wu's Residence)

104
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,680
Greetings, Your Highness.

105
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,759
Greetings, Mr. Yao.

106
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,240
Where's Mr. Wu Shizheng?

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,399
Your Highness, Mr. Yao,

108
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,079
Mr. Wu left the capital two days ago
to patrol the salt mines.

109
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,750
He'll return in around
two or three days.

110
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,390
Tell him to return
to the capital immediately.

111
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,360
- We want...
- It's fine.

112
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,490
We just wanted to have a chat

113
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,079
with him since we were passing by.

114
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:57,560
If he's not around,

115
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,110
we'll visit again some other day.

116
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,240
Let's go.

117
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,519
Your Highness.

118
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,880
We were going to ask him about
the salt smuggling incident.

119
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,319
Why did you say that?

120
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,160
It's normal for Wu Shizheng
to patrol the salt mines.

121
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,560
However, it's not the start

122
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,680
or the end of the month.

123
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,190
Don't you think that something's off?

124
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,519
Are you saying that...

125
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,720
I'm afraid we've alerted them to our presence
due to your serious tone.

126
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,290
If so, should I head
to the salt mines

127
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,199
and arrest him?

128
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:31,879
No need for that.

129
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,160
We don't have sufficient evidence yet.

130
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,490
We can talk about it later.

131
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,260
Yes, Your Highness.

132
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,839
Sir, your dinner is ready.

133
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,360
Sir,

134
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,350
I'll enter the room now.

135
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,560
There's a dead person!

136
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:20,920
Your Highness, you scared me.

137
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,759
That's not it.

138
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,279
What were you smiling about?

139
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,639
It's nothing.

140
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,000
It's nothing?

141
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:34,990
Judging from your expression,
are you in a relationship?

142
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:37,600
A relationship?

143
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:39,879
It means

144
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,440
that you fancy someone.

145
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:45,840
That's not it.

146
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,940
That's not it, huh?

147
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,240
That's fine.

148
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,879
I have something to tell you.

149
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:53,080
I think the daughter
of the Minister of Rites

150
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,559
will be engaged to Mr. Yao soon.

151
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,759
When did that happen?

152
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,320
You fell for it.

153
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,759
You fancy Yao Tian, don't you?

154
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,120
Is it that obvious?

155
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:11,120
I'm not blind.

156
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,039
You visit
the Investigative Bureau every day.

157
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,919
When Yao Tian came here
to join us for a meal,

158
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,790
you served him with more passion
than anyone else.

159
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,840
I went to the Investigative Bureau

160
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,000
to learn martial arts from him.

161
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:24,639
I did it so that I could protect you.

162
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,480
Learn martial arts from him?

163
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,320
Wu knows martial arts as well.

164
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,090
Why didn't you learn it from Wu, then?

165
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:33,519
It's because...

166
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,039
- Because of what?
-  It's because...

167
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,399
It's okay to fancy him.

168
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,519
Why are you being shy?

169
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,919
Since you fancy him,

170
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,200
you should express
your feelings for him.

171
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,559
But,

172
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,559
Mr. Yao is a dignified official.

173
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,320
The gap between our status is too huge.

174
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,679
What are you saying?

175
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:56,159
So what if he's Mr. Yao?

176
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,120
Look at you.

177
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,759
You're the granddaughter
of Divine Healer Valley's leader.

178
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,600
You can serve a guest and cook as well.

179
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,790
You're more than good enough
for a blockhead like him.

180
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,240
Really?

181
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,759
Don't worry.

182
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,559
I'll be your guarantor.

183
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,159
Don't be scared. Just do it.

184
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,679
What should I do, then?

185
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:18,159
What should you do, huh?

186
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,600
Everyone says

187
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,960
that you need to win a man's heart

188
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:27,480
with

189
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,799
your cooking.

190
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:32,080
That's the gist of it.

191
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,440
Let's go.

192
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:50,039
Why do you guys look so down?

193
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:51,120
What happened?

194
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,759
The situation in the market
is worse than we thought.

195
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:57,399
That's right.

196
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,490
The people have surrounded the yamen.

197
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,990
It's been a long time since
the merchants opened their shops.

198
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,919
And, someone even sold
the official salt transport permit

199
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,279
to a merchant.

200
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,679
It was Wu Shizheng, right?

201
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,279
He should be related to the incident.

202
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:13,240
However, he can't do it all by himself.

203
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,679
What is this?

204
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,279
This is...

205
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's called a cookie.

206
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,080
It's food?

207
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:32,039
I'm sure Her Highness
came up with this too.

208
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,870
Let me give it a try.

209
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,759
You shouldn't.

210
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:40,960
If not, you won't be able

211
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,120
to finish your meal later.

212
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:43,480
You can try it.

213
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,840
Mr. Yao, you can try it.

214
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,679
Manyu made them especially for you.

215
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:49,679
Am I right, Manyu?

216
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,639
Her Highness made them.

217
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,080
I...

218
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,639
What's wrong with Manyu?

219
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,080
It's...

220
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,879
It's pretty good.

221
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,420
These two are definitely blockheads.
