00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,900
=Princess Across Time=

2
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,460
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:40,520
Please enjoy, Your Highness.

4
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,079
Your Highness,

5
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,840
this is prepared based on your recipe.

6
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:52,200
Manyu,

7
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,920
you are a talented cook.

8
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:56,439
You actually made it
after I told you once.

9
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:57,679
Please don't say that.

10
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:00,600
It's because you gave me a good recipe,
Your Highness.

11
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,799
Where are you going?

12
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,050
Sit down. Let's eat together.

13
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:10,560
Please spare me, Your Highness.

14
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,439
I wouldn't dare to sit.

15
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,000
I know my place.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,120
What's wrong with you, Manyu?
Get up. Come on.

17
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:17,680
Your Highness,

18
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,319
please spare me.

19
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,599
Hey, Xi Xiao...

20
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:22,879
Manyu,

21
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,200
look at me.

22
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:25,920
I'm not Crown Princess
from the past.

23
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,200
I'm not like her.

24
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,599
Don't kneel.

25
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:30,920
Let's be good friends from now on.

26
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,920
I wouldn't dare.

27
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:33,280
I wouldn't dare.

28
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,359
You...

29
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:36,560
- Get up first.
- Manyu.

30
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:37,959
You may go.

31
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,000
Uh...

32
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,120
What's this?

33
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,079
This is

34
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,560
a pan-fried crepe Manyu prepared.

35
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,120
Greetings, Your Highnesses.

36
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,920
Mr. Yao sent someone to inform you

37
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,519
that Wu San was found.

38
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:04,519
Mr. Yao.

39
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,159
He found the body?

40
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,159
Why is it a boy?

41
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,479
The body of Wu San

42
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,319
(Sun Yi, female constable)
was found by this boy and his mother.

43
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,159
Let me ask you.

44
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,879
When did you discover the body?

45
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,280
In the hour of Mao.

46
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:17,960
All right.

47
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,000
Thank you.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,800
Come here.

49
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,960
Send him home.

50
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,400
Make ways.

51
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,159
Greetings, Your Highnesses.

52
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,199
Sun Yi,

53
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,439
set up a perimeter.

54
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,450
Prevent the onlookers
from disturbing the scene.

55
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,479
Perimeter?

56
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,490
Have them take off their belts
and tie them together to form a circle.

57
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,960
Keep the crowd outside the circle.

58
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:49,690
Yes, Your Highness.

59
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,639
You three, take off your belts
and tie them together.

60
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:53,400
Step back.

61
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,280
Yes, Madam.

62
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,919
Step back.

63
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:59,520
Where did you learn about the perimeter?

64
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:00,879
Well...

65
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,199
I learned it from my dream.

66
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,000
(Froth in the nostrils.)

67
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,120
(Bleeding spots around the conjunctiva.)

68
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,000
(The skin is wrinkled and whitened.)

69
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,039
He was drowned.

70
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,840
How can you be sure he drowned

71
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,960
and wasn't dumped after death?

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,790
There is a mushroom-like froth
around his mouth and nose.

73
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,290
His skin shows redness and appears pale.

74
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,840
His lips have turned blue.

75
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,719
Look at this.

76
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,000
He's grabbing weeds,
and there's mud in his nostrils.

77
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,319
This shows that he struggled
before death.

78
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,560
It seems the murderer
stuffed him into a sack

79
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,240
after he was drowned
and then let him float down the river.

80
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,960
Your Highnesses,

81
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,479
it's my fault.

82
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,159
I was one step too late.

83
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,560
Don't blame yourself.

84
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,680
This only proves that our investigation
is on the right track.

85
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,360
Can you deduce the time of death?

86
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,400
Around 12 twelve hours ago.

87
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,680
Sun Yi, have someone bring the body
to the morgue.

88
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:08,970
Yes, Your Highness.

89
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,279
Your Highness,

90
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,519
what are you wearing?

91
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,600
Corpses have many bacteria.

92
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,759
I took precautions for my safety.

93
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,240
I went out in a rush,

94
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,780
so I only asked Manyu to prepare these.

95
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,600
Where did you learn that from?

96
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,959
It's very different from coroners

97
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:42,920
I have seen before.

98
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,399
Exactly.

99
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,360
I have never heard
that you were a coroner.

100
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,839
I wanted to be a coroner
since I was young,

101
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:54,480
so I learned
from an experienced coroner.

102
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,639
However, my father found out.

103
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,240
He thought it was useless

104
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,000
and stopped me from learning.

105
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,720
(Trauma from physical fights)

106
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,040
Mr. Yao,

107
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,759
these are likely bruises
caused by some martial artists.

108
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,190
I don't know about martial arts skills.
Please take a look.

109
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,959
The perpetrator has
profound internal strength

110
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,490
and is skilled in martial arts.

111
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,560
If that's the case, Wu San might

112
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,000
lose his strength to retaliate

113
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,279
after being attacked

114
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:35,360
and was then pushed into the water.

115
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,560
It smells like herbs.

116
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,439
It's also on this hand.

117
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,519
What's Wu San's identity?

118
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,100
I investigated him.

119
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,680
Wu San is likely an alias.

120
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,079
Yao Tian,

121
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,519
send someone to check

122
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,390
the wanted criminal list
from over the years.

123
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,959
He might be a fugitive.

124
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,560
Also,

125
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,160
check for anyone skilled
in healing and medicine.

126
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,399
Let's go to Wu San's place first.

127
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,290
Yes, Your Highness.

128
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:22,959
Master,

129
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,120
they have already found Wu San.

130
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,720
What should we do next?

131
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:29,279
Make sure everyone who knows about this

132
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,079
disappears

133
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,560
without leaving a trace.

134
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,920
It's Wu San's house.

135
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:37,879
Too bad.

136
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,000
Greetings,

137
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:46,839
Your Highnesses.

138
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,759
I asked around and everyone said
they hadn't seen the arsonist.

139
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,240
Since they are trying to remove traces,

140
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,480
no clue wouldn't be left behind.

141
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,550
The next target might be
the Xianyin Pleasure House.

142
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,160
What?

143
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,120
If our deduction

144
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,560
that the mastermind

145
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,319
hired Wu San to kill Situ Lian
is correct,

146
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,199
then judging by his current behavior,

147
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,360
he's trying to silence

148
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,839
all the witnesses.

149
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:13,639
Therefore, the next target might be
the maid at the Xianyin Pleasure House.

150
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,120
Let's go.

151
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,480
How's she?

152
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,140
She's breathing.

153
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,380
(Zhuxuan Abode)

154
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,959
Your Highness,
I lost track of that person.

155
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,399
But they seem very familiar
with the area.

156
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,800
They varnished after a few turns.

157
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,959
Don't blame yourself.

158
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,079
Once the maid is awake,

159
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,439
we will have a way to find them.

160
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,600
Your Highness,

161
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:58,120
I tried my best.

162
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:01,199
But I have never come across

163
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,600
the poison inside her in my life.

164
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:06,759
I'm afraid I can't save her.

165
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,560
All right. You are dismissed.

166
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:09,420
Yes, Your Highness.

167
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,759
(She's poisoned?)

168
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:14,240
Oh, right.

169
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,590
How could I have forgotten about her?

170
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,560
Greetings, Your Highnesses.

171
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,360
Greetings, Mr. Yao.

172
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,079
Lunch is ready.

173
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,890
Perfect timing.
I was about to look for you.

174
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,040
Check on her.

175
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,319
Do you know anything about this poison?

176
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,639
Heart-Devouring Gu Poison.

177
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,879
Heart-Devouring Gu Poison?

178
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,440
Manyu,

179
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,480
you know healing skills?

180
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:54,000
I learned them when I was five or six.

181
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:56,759
This is a rare Gu poison
found in Southern Xinjiang.

182
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,120
It's valuable

183
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,639
and deadly.

184
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,039
Fortunately, her poison isn't serious
and can be neutralized.

185
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,159
Wait.

186
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,559
Aren't you my maidservant?

187
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,399
Your Highness, did you forget

188
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,790
that my family has been practicing
medicine for generations?

189
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:14,639
I was taught to identify herbs
and poisons when I was a kid.

190
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,320
However,

191
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,799
Grandfather sent me to be your maid

192
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,240
to repay His Excellency's kindness.

193
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,240
His grandfather is well-known as

194
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,279
the Poison Healer King.

195
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,690
(She has become a maid
instead of a great healer.)

196
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,759
(Does she not care
about being a rich person?)

197
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,200
Miss Manyu,

198
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:35,000
since you recognized this poison,
do you know how to detoxify it?

199
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,160
Drain the poisoned blood with a silver
needle and give her an herbal bath.

200
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,799
She can be detoxified in three days.

201
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,279
The thing is,

202
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,440
Southern Xinjiang's poisons
are sinister and cruel.

203
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,559
Once they enter someone's body,

204
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,279
they crystallize.

205
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,290
Unless the patient constantly
takes medicine,

206
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,960
the poison can't
be completely eradicated.

207
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,559
Crystallize?
