=Episode 27=

3
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,200
Now that they're leaving,

4
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,439
I don't know when they'll return.

5
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:53,799
You're right.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,790
But Manyu did tell me
that they would still wish

7
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,479
to return to my residence
after their wedding.

8
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,159
I rejected them.

9
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:02,920
They're newlyweds.

10
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,840
Why would I try to separate them?

11
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:05,640
You do have a point.

12
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,640
Have you dealt with the court affairs?

13
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:12,799
I have.

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,799
Yao Gao will be executed after fall.

15
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,359
As for the Grand Chancellor,

16
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,220
Father has decided not
to reveal his misdeeds

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,480
to the public to protect his reputation.

18
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,040
As for Qin Feng,

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,200
Father will give him the title
of Marquis Martyr.

20
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,920
That's why you don't need to worry.

21
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,319
Your family's reputation
won't be affected at all.

22
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:35,239
I know that.

23
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,690
That's why I want to thank you guys.

24
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,159
Now,

25
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,760
since Manyu has left,

26
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:42,760
I'll make you some food

27
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,480
as a reward.

28
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,239
That's great.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,959
There's one more thing.

30
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,959
I've already applied for leave
from Father.

31
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:53,920
Leave?

32
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,239
From tomorrow onward,

33
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:56,719
I'll take you around.

34
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:58,959
We'll travel the world.

35
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:00,799
All right.

36
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,439
We'll try all the best food
in the world.

37
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,439
All right.

38
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,400
Let's do it here.

39
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,280
Say cheese.

40
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,039
Cheese.

41
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:16,879
Cheese.

42
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,280
One, two, three.

43
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,960
Cheese.

44
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,360
No.

45
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,460
You don't look good enough.

46
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:31,000
How could you scare me?

47
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,479
What do you think?

48
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,500
Let me put it on for you.

49
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,159
Do you know how to do it?

50
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,199
I learned how to do it before.

51
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,800
That hurts.

52
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,360
It's not mighty enough.

53
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,680
If so, I'll...

54
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,479
Are you not done yet?

55
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:51,919
This is nice!

56
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,190
What about this?

57
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,240
That's an excellent pose.

58
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,879
Don't move.

59
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,599
Don't move.

60
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,759
They look so beautiful.

61
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,360
They do.

62
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:23,520
Look at that.

63
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,500

64
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,140

65
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,680
Don't just eat the dishes.

66
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:33,319
Come.

67
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,280
Grab your cup.

68
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,690
I wish you guys a smooth journey.

69
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,220
A smooth journey to you all.

70
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,080
Yao Tian, you must visit us often
in the future when you're free.

71
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,240
Of course, Your Highness.

72
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,319
Just send me a letter
if you need anything.

73
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,199
Have a seat.

74
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,000
Come.

75
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,639
Manyu.

76
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,519
Your Highness,

77
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:17,759
let me offer you another toast.

78
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,560
What's wrong?

79
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,240
You're already married, you know?

80
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,199
You're no longer a young girl.

81
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,040
In the future, you have to manage
the Divine Healer Valley alone.

82
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,600
You shouldn't act like this.

83
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,639
I don't want to be the leader
of the Divine Healer Valley.

84
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,519
Your Highness, I only wish
to be with you.

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,399
Me too.

86
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,959
But Yao Tian will be upset
about it, don't you think?

87
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,439
How dare he do so?

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,040
You must cherish Yao Tian.

89
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:50,560
We've been through so much together.

90
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:53,000
This way, you know

91
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,040
who's sincere to you.

92
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,199
Your Highness, you too.

93
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,079
They've left, huh?

94
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,439
That's right.

95
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:21,480
However,

96
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,040
Yao Tian gave us something.

97
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,759
Let's take a look.

98
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,060
(Tales of Strange)

99
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,460
(Tales of Strange)

100
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,560
Tales of Strange?

101
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,079
Have you read it somewhere before?

102
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,360
So, Yao Tian was the author of the book.

103
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,879
He wrote down our encounter

104
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,120
and the cases

105
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,439
we solved together.

106
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,199
I couldn't tell at all.

107
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,660
I never expected Yao Tian
to write a book.

108
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:59,439
So, Yao Tian was the author of the book.

109
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,199
I was wondering why the author

110
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,430
left out the mastermind's story.

111
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,759
It seems like

112
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,920
you've read this book before.

113
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,399
But that's impossible.

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,519
He just finished the book not long ago.

115
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:20,199
You may not believe me,

116
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,000
but I only arrived at this world

117
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,399
because of this book.

118
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,120
Now that the book has appeared again,

119
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,639
does that mean

120
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm going to leave soon?

121
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,399

You're finally awake.

You've been bedridden for a few days.

172
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:36,480
What exactly happened?

173
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,440
I was so worried
when I received the phone call.

174
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,159
Someone pushed me into the water.

175
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,519
What?

176
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:45,480
That day...

177
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,879
Hello. I'm a fan of Xue Hanning.

178
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,260
I'm here to deliver flowers to her.

179
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,160
Xue Hanning was pronounced dead
despite resuscitation effort.

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,399
My goodness. That was scary.

181
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,120
Luckily, the crew discovered you

He has been arrested.

185
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,200
The culprit was a psycho.

186
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,440
He lost his mind upon discovering

187
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,680
Xue Hanning kissing her boyfriend.

188
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,960
He thought she made him a cuckold.

189
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,679
Therefore, he planned to kill her.

190
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,600
However, you found him.

191
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,399
Xiaoxiao,

192
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,240
I went to another world

193
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,080
when I fell into a coma.

194
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,600
Guess who I met there?

195
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,399
Who?

196
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:02,000
Don't tell me it's Luo Jingchuan?

197
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:03,960
How did you know?

198
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,360
Don't laugh at me. You were there too.

199
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,919
In that world,

200
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,840
he's the Crown Prince.

201
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,600
I was

202
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,440
the Crown Princess.

203
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:18,559
Don't laugh at me.

204
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:19,840
You...

205
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,480
You were my servant, Manyu.

206
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,320
I could tell that it was a dream.

207
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,080
It wasn't a dream. It did happen.

208
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:29,840
You should rest well.

209
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,110
I'll return to the school
for a study session.

210
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:34,000
I have a test on Monday.

211
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,200
I'll visit you again tomorrow.

212
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,480
Was that truly a dream?

213
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,720
Wait...

214
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,840
Wait here. I'll get help.

215
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,320
Don't go.

216
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,399
The entire street

217
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:08,279
is yours as long as you like it.

218
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,559
Didn't you say so yourself?

219
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,159
Husband and wife need
small surprises in their lives.

220
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,720
What did you

221
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:23,559
say just now?

222
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,879
You obviously heard it.

223
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:28,200
Dear.

224
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,159
Come. Call me Husband.

225
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:36,360
No.

226
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,159
If so, here I come.

227
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,200
Get out!

228
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:51,879

229
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:53,990

235

Stay out of my business!

Stop following me!

242
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,690

248

I don't know
when I'll return to my world.

249
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,440
And, once I go back,

250
