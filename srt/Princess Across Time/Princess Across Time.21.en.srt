1
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,900
=Princess Across Time=

2
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,460
=Episode 21=

3
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,290
Your Highness, please take a look.

4
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,079
Butler, please take note.

5
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,560
Yue Xin is starting to get suspicious
about the weapon supply.

6
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,090
He's a major threat.
He shouldn't be kept around.

7
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,880
I didn't expect Butler's influence

8
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,479
to have reached the military.

9
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,000
General Yue Xin,

10
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,039
how did you obtain this letter?

11
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,470
Your Highness, I was responsible for
coordinating the military supplies

12
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,959
after arriving at the military camp.

13
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,220
However, due to
Anxi State's massive attack,

14
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,270
our army couldn't deal with them.

15
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,410
We suffered several defeats.

16
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,270
Mu Yuan came to take over
the military camp

17
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,959
under the imperial court's order.

18
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:18,319
After that, Mu Yuan alone
was in charge of the military supplies.

19
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,760
When I found out
that the military supplies were inferior,

20
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,390
I asked Mu Yuan about their sources.

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,490
Mu Yuan said the imperial court
allocated them to us.

22
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:25,560
I didn't trust him.

23
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:26,879
I found out

24
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:28,560
that he colluded with outsiders

25
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,490
to secretly replace
the military supplies allocated

26
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:31,390
by the imperial court.

27
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,420
I intercepted the secret letter
he sent to the capital.

28
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,680
Only then, I found out
that the culprit was Butler.

29
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:37,319
Butler?

30
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,480
According to my knowledge,

31
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,319
Grand Chancellor had always
recommended Mu Yuan to Father.

32
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,480
Ever since I discovered the ledger

33
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:49,519
in the Grand Chancellor's Residence,

34
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,400
I thought

35
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,599
he was a suspicious individual.

36
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,079
One of their secret bases
is located right ahead.

37
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,439
I intend to explore it.

38
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,040
Maybe we'll discover new clues there.

39
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,439
Secret base?

40
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,319
That's right.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,890
I wanted to report Mu Yuan
to the imperial court

42
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,519
upon discovering his secret letter.

43
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,400
I never expected him
to try and silence me.

44
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,199
Hurry! Over here!

45
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,120
Don't fall behind! Hurry!

46
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,000
After him!

47
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,080
I've been hiding in this cave
after I was wounded.

48
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,400
I wanted to infiltrate the secret base

49
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,479
but to no avail.

50
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,560
But then, I encountered you
and Her Highness.

51
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,639
It makes sense now.

52
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,190
They invested the enormous profits
from the salt mine

53
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,840
to the armory.

54
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,879
This is a massive conspiracy
involving Anxi State.

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,080
If they get their way,

56
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,960
the border will soon fall.

57
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,680
Once that happens,

58
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:30,240
our state's last line of defense

59
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,759
will cease to exist.

60
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,560
If so, they'll invade
the capital eventually.

61
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,400
General Yue Xin,

62
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,560
do you know where
their armory is located?

63
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,970
It's not too far away.

64
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,380
We can reach there in around two hours.

65
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,319
General Yue Xin, bring me there.

66
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,719
Your Highness, you mustn't do so.

67
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,599
It's dangerous up ahead.

68
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,919
I've made up my mind. Let's go.

69
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,439
Yes, Your Highness.

70
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:57,240
Check that area.

71
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,199
Yes, sir.

72
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,080
Mr. Yao,

73
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,180
we've searched the area
for one day and one night.

74
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,950
We've already searched
the entire cliff as well.

75
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,500
Please pardon me for being blunt.

76
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,520
There are many wild animals
in the vicinity as well.

77
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:11,599
I'm afraid they are...

78
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,990
But there are no traces of wild animals
preying on people in the vicinity.

79
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,519
Anyway, I'll never believe

80
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,260
that such a tragedy
has fallen upon His Highness.

81
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:21,480
Mr. Yao,

82
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:24,240
a young and talented individual like you

83
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,199
is rare indeed.

84
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,120
But why did you join the government

85
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,040
instead of inheriting
Mr. Yao's enormous wealth?

86
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:32,480
According to what I know,

87
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,120
you're his only son.

88
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,879
He has great hopes for you.

89
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,490
Father and I made a promise long ago.

90
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,240
His business has nothing to do with me.

91
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,690
My goal in life is to punish evildoers
and rid the world of evil.

92
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,800
General Mu,

93
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,920
seems like you know my background well.

94
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,959
Mr. Yao is the wealthiest person
in Heng State.

95
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,399
Naturally, there are
plenty of rumors related to him.

96
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,240
I'm merely relying on hearsay.

97
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,319
General Mu,

98
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,160
there are two paths here.

99
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,860
Let's split up and search for them.

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,920
Whoever finds them first
should launch a signal.

101
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,490
If they're nowhere to be found,

102
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,399
let's rendezvous here after four hours.

103
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,279
Mr. Yao,

104
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,160
you're new to the place.

105
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,920
You're not familiar
with the surroundings.

106
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,120
The terrain here is steep and dangerous.

107
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,079
I think you should let me
search the mountain path.

108
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:20,839
No need for that.

109
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,040
I'll take the mountain path.

110
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,680
I assume His Highness

111
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,279
is trapped within the mountains.

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,680
General Mu.

113
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,879
Are you injured?

114
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,000
I fell during my rounds a few days ago.

115
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,199
It's nothing.

116
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,399
Let's go.

117
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,560
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

118
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,360
Be careful.

119
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,759
Your Highness, this is the place.

120
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,959
The cave to the left is their armory.

121
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,490
As for the two caves to the right,

122
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,600
they use one of them
to transport the materials here

123
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,600
and the other

124
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,079
to transport their goods outside.

125
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:37,279
It seems that
they've hidden the military supplies

126
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,920
close to the ferry terminal.

127
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,670
Once the military supplies arrive,

128
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,800
they'll swap them out
on the way to the military camp.

129
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,879
I never expected them
to take advantage of the terrain here

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,600
to smuggle their goods.

131
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:50,759
General Yue Xin,

132
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,560
we can no longer trust
the soldiers in the military camp.

133
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,360
Head outside, look for Yao Tian,

134
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,290
and tell him to deploy
the Falcon Army nearest from here.

135
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,720
We'll launch a surprise attack
and destroy their nest.

136
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,759
They'll trust you

137
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,120
when they see this jade pendant.

138
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,959
Yes, Your Highness.

139
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,040
I'm sure security is tight here.

140
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,920
We mustn't barge in by force.

141
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,380
I know what to do. Come with me.

142
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,600
Let's go.

143
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,879
You two, check that area.

144
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:58,519
Yes, sir.

145
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:03,360
Why is this mountain temple so worn out?

146
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,360
You might not know,

147
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,890
but we're located in the deep mountains.

148
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,759
Many natural disasters occur here.

149
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,560
This temple was only built

150
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,710
after enough people
had donated to the cause.

151
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,380
It was built to ensure
our peace and safety.

152
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,399
However, more and more disasters occurred

153
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,000
after the temple was built.

154
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,330
Gradually, fewer and fewer people
came to offer incense.

155
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,639
Who donated money to the cause?

156
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:21,959
When did it happen?

157
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,160
I don't know.

158
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,879
I think it was an imperial official.

159
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,199
I think it was about two years ago.

160
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:29,879
Two years ago?

161
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,679
Mr. Yao, we found a secret tunnel.

162
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,759
Come with me.

163
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,690
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

164
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:48,000
