1
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,900
=Princess Across Time=

2
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,460
=Episode 17=

3
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,960
How did Zhou Jian find out

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,159
that Lv Yan was the envoy?

5
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,399
I checked the duty records
of the guards on that day.

6
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,240
Zhou Jian changed his shift long ago.

7
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:48,890
That means he planned for it long ago.

8
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,520
If so, maybe someone tipped him off.

9
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:55,280
I understand now.

10
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,410
I'll return to the Investigative Bureau

11
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,479
to find out whom Zhou Jian
has been in contact with.

12
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:00,840
Go now.

13
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,760
Don't be angry.

14
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,840
I'm apologizing to you sincerely.

15
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,599
I was too harsh with my words last time.

16
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,840
You're very important to me.

17
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,439
How important?

18
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:46,719
You...

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,140
You help me to solve my case.

20
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,159
And,

21
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,040
you help me to...

22
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:52,239
I understand now.

23
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,480
I'm just a tool to you.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,359
No. That's not what I mean.

25
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,439
You're not a tool.

26
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,719
You're my crown princess.

27
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,159
Although you were unruly, willful,

28
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,439
and ruthless,

29
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,760
and I hate you a lot,

30
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,519
you did become

31
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,840
intelligent, sensible,

32
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,280
gentle, and kind.

33
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,360
You're super cute as well.

34
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,680
And, you're...

35
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,280
That's enough.

36
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:18,759
Stop complimenting me.

37
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,120
It's not that I cannot

38
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,599
forgive you.

39
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,719
But you need to promise me one thing.

40
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,639
Say,

41
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,919
what if, one day,

42
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,120
if I'm gone

43
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,560
or if I vanish,

44
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,840
you have to remember me forever.

45
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,840
What does that mean?

46
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:45,560
I don't wish to hide this
from you any longer.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,520
Actually, I'm from
1,000 years in the future.

48
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,120
I don't know what happened,

49
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,240
but I traveled back in time

50
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,639
and got into Qin Xiyue's body.

51
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,639
I don't know when I'll return.

52
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,150
And, I might not come back again

53
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,960
after returning to the future.

54
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:00,759
I know.

55
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,719
It's difficult for you
to believe my words.

56
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:03,719
But I'm still sane.

57
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,439
I believe you.

58
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,360
I believe your every word.

59
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:13,439
Really?

60
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,960
However,

61
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,120
I've been here for quite some time.

62
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,439
And, I'm still here.

63
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,280
I don't know
if I can return to the future.

64
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,680
I've been really happy

65
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,719
during my time here.

66
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:31,400
I'll make you happier in the future.

67
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,230
Since we don't know

68
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,560
when you'll return to the future,

69
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,639
I'll cherish

70
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,990
every single day I get to spend with you

71
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,039
even more.

72
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,719
Now that you've avenged your family,

73
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,120
have you come up with a way to repay me?

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,560
I've been in the military
for over 20 years.

75
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,490
I offer all my family's assets
in gratitude.

76
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,319
You're just a lowly soldier.

77
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,879
Your money

78
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,480
means nothing to me.

79
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:42,120
However, you guys have already
obtained the things you desire.

80
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,120
And, I've helped you out as well.

81
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,079
Since that's the case,

82
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:52,360
why don't you do me another favor?

83
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,079
Something's off.

84
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,690
I need to head to the Zhou Family's
ancestral grave with you.

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,800
The more I think about it,
the stranger it feels.

86
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,759
There's not much bloodstain

87
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,000
on the knife.

88
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,490
There's not much bloodstain
at the crime scene as well.

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,199
It didn't look like
a decapitation occurred there.

90
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,530
There's Zhou Jian as well.

91
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,390
I'm sure he'll pay respect
to his ancestors' grave

92
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,560
after avenging his family.

93
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,959
After that, he'll go on the run.

94
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:32,439
Maybe he'll leave some clues behind.

95
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,420
We have no time to waste.

96
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,240
Let's depart.

97
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:34,839
All right.

98
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:36,800
Manyu, what's the matter?

99
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,600
Your Highness, Crown Princess,

100
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,600
the envoys are here to visit you guys.

101
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,550
It's as if they have
an urgent matter to discuss.

102
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,990
You guys lost something?

103
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,240
That's right.

104
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,800
On the night of the murder,

105
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,079
our storeroom was robbed as well.

106
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,720
Due to the chaos,

107
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,120
we couldn't do a thorough
inventory count.

108
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,839
We thought we only lost
some jewelry and gold.

109
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,600
But after we settled down
on the second day,

110
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,120
we found out that a precious
treasure chest was missing.

111
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,920
You guys lost plenty of valuable items.

112
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,290
Why are you guys panicking
over a treasure chest?

113
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,959
Your Highness, you might not know,

114
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,660
the treasure chest wasn't one
of our offerings to your state.

115
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,860
It contained some
confidential financial records

116
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:14,930
of our trading association.

117
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,319
This time, Mr. Musi
intends to do some trades

118
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:21,040
with the merchants in the capital after

119
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,380
presenting our offerings to His Majesty.

120
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,319
Musi?

121
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,759
You mean the late Lv Yan?

122
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,839
That's right.

123
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,079
Do you know who he made the trades with?

124
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,160
I don't know.

125
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,319
Such deeds

126
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,519
are usually arranged by
Mr. Musi himself.

127
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,759
However,

128
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,120
Old Camel once helped Mr. Musi
to deliver several letters.

129
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,079
Where's Old Camel now?

130
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,519
He was seriously injured

131
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,780
when Mr. Musi was murdered.

132
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,720
His Majesty sent an imperial physician
to tend to his wounds.

133
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,590
However, he hasn't
regained consciousness yet.

134
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,600
Envoy, there's no need to panic.

135
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,279
I'll surely locate the treasure chest
for you all.

136
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:01,079
Thank you, Your Highness.

137
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:08,959
It may seem like the culprit
ransacked the place,

138
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,270
but in reality, he was
searching for the treasure chest.

139
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,780
We have to locate Zhou Jian immediately.

140
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:17,439
Seems like seeking revenge
wasn't his only goal.

141
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,720
Let's go.

142
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,519
Your Highness! Crown Princess!

143
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,920
You guys have been busy
all day without eating.

144
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,800
You guys should take these with you.

145
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,519
All right.

146
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,079
What happened?

147
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,279
Your Highness, Crown Princess.

148
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,560
Zhou Jian is dead.

149
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,340
He hung himself
on top of the ancestral grave.

150
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:50,720
Where is his body?

151
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,600
It's still there.

152
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,860
Your Highness,
I was intending to invite you two

153
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:54,800
to head there together.

154
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,090
This is common beyond the ordinary.

155
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:56,959
What did you say?

156
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,590
Zhou Jian succeeded in seeking revenge.

157
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,680
He knew that he couldn't
escape from the death penalty.

158
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,470
Therefore, he took his own life
at his family's ancestral grave

159
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,590
so that he could return to his roots.

160
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,480
Don't you think
that makes too much sense?

161
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,560
We were planning to head there anyway.

162
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,879
Let's depart immediately.

163
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,839
Your Highness, please allow me
to join you guys too.

164
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,839
I could help you guys out

165
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:20,439
if the victim had consumed
any poison or drugs.

166
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,430
That's right. When it comes
to drugs and poison,

167
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:25,800
I don't think anyone else in the capital
is as good as Manyu.

168
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:31,079
Mr. Yao, I didn't say that I wasn't
going to bring her there.

169
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,679
Why are you so nervous?

170
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,440
I...

171
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:35,480
What?

172
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,600
The carriage is ready.

173
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,240
Let's depart.

174
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:58,960
How is it?

175
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,970
He committed suicide by hanging.

176
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,840
The marks around his neck are deep.

177
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,730
There's severe
internal bleeding as well.

178
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,679
But I still think it's strange.

179
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,200
Zhou Jian took the treasure chest,

180
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:15,960
but he died without
doing anything with it.

181
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,279
Don't tell me he took it
because he thought it looked pretty?

182
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,559
If that's the case,

183
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,039
where did the treasure chest go?

184
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,600
Moreover, Lv Yan's secret

185
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,000
is hidden within the treasure chest.

186
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,330
It's pointless for Zhou Jian
to take the treasure chest.

187
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,000
Your Highness, Crown Princess.

188
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,559
This was found on
the downstream riverbank.

189
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,090
The treasure chest is empty.

190
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,600
Who would be interested in his secrets?

191
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,720
I suspect this must be related to
the people who assaulted Wu.

192
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,480
Do you still remember
what the envoy said?

193
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,279
Lv Yan came here

194
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,879
to do some trades.

195
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:03,360
It's likely that the suspect
is one of his trading partners.

196
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,660
Let's transport the body
back to the morgue first.

197
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,990
There are no tools for an autopsy here.

198
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,000
Yao Tian, take all the evidence back
to the Investigative Bureau.

199
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,890
Yes, Your Highness.

200
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,159
Be gentle.

201
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,190
I'll teach you a lesson
if you damage the evidence.

202
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,720
This rope is strange.

203
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:22,039
The knot cannot be undone.

204
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,159
Wait.
