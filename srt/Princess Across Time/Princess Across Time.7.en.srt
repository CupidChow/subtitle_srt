3
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,380
(Xianyin Pleasure House)

4
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,880
Won't we look weird in this getup?

5
00:00:58,759 --> 00:00:59,359
Let's go.

6
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,780
Shouldn't we light a lantern
when it's this dark out here?

7
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,920
We're sneaking around.

8
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,190
It's not like we...

9
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,580
People will discover us
if we light a lantern.

10
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,580
We're just doing a secret visit.

11
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,400
Moreover,

12
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:16,640
thieves might mistake us
for their accomplices.

13
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,239
Let's head to
Xianyin Pleasure House's backyard.

14
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,640
Come.

15
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,400
Lian.

16
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,599
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,840
I couldn't do anything to help you out.

18
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,400
Lian.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,919
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,360
Wu San is dead now.

21
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,879
I've avenged you.

22
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,120
Don't haunt me!

23
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,280
It wasn't me!

24
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,360
Ruyi!

25
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,400
Ruyi!

26
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,599
It wasn't me!

27
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,560
- It wasn't me!
- Ruyi!

28
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,520
Don't haunt me!

29
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,680
Ruyi!

30
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,159
I died a wrongful death!

31
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,360
Lian!

32
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,080
- Lian, is that you?
- Ruyi!

33
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:24,240
Stop scaring me!

34
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,919
Ruyi!

35
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,680
I'm Lian.

36
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,319
You have to avenge me.

37
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:34,360
Ruyi!

38
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,000
Hasn't He Cheng already avenged you?

39
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,319
Who's He Cheng?

40
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,840
The guy who fancied you!

41
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,520
If so, why didn't you tell
His Highness about it?

42
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
Crown Princess?

43
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,400
He Cheng is the son
of Crown Princess's nanny.

44
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,039
If I report him to the authorities,

45
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:01,319
Crown Princess will
definitely cover up for him.

46
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:03,000
Who said I would cover up for him?

47
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,590
Do you know that the culprit

48
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:07,599
might get away just because
you didn't report him to the authorities?

49
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,850
Your Highness, please spare me!

50
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Why are you kneeling?

51
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,080
You, get up.

52
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,159
Get up.

53
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,520
Get up and speak.

54
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:18,680
Miss Ruyi,

55
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,160
you can tell us everything you know.

56
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,199
We won't cover up any wrongdoings.

57
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,720
We'll certainly enforce the law.

58
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,480
After Lian got pregnant,

59
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,910
Mr. Qin wasn't willing to marry her.

60
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,480
He even forced her to abort the child.

61
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,399
Lian was heartbroken.

62
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,160
Lian,

63
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,290
since you're insisting on
keeping the child,

64
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,639
I'll tell Wu San about it.

65
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,399
I'll buy out your freedom, marry you,

66
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,290
and raise the child together with you.

67
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:41,399
No.

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,439
I will not marry anyone else

69
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,600
except for Qin Feng.

70
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,439
You have your own life to lead.

71
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,190
You don't need to sacrifice
everything for my sake.

72
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,390
I tried to persuade Lian to say yes.

73
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,959
It was a great opportunity
for her to stop suffering.

74
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,319
But she said

75
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,959
Mr. He was a kind person.

76
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,639
Kind people shouldn't be bullied.

77
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,620
Therefore, she rejected his proposal.

78
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:05,240
Have you told us everything, then?

79
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,120
I have.

80
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,990
I've already told you
everything I know.

81
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:13,319
Miss Ruyi, take this jade pendant
and head to the Investigative Bureau.

82
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:14,839
They'll protect you.

83
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,839
Hurry!

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,290
He Cheng hasn't been arrested yet.

85
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,450
Now that he knows about
your relationship with Situ Lian,

86
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,690
I'm afraid he might try to harm you.

87
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,560
Thank you, Your Highness.

88
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,860
(Zhuxuan Abode)

89
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,279
Manyu.

90
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:00,959
What is this?

91
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,079
Your Highness,

92
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,560
this is the birthday gift

93
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,190
Consort Hui delivered to you
this morning.

94
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,780
Why didn't you wake me up, then?

95
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,759
Consort Hui told me
that there was no need

96
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,200
for you to thank her personally
as you were busy with state affairs.

97
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,350
She said His Majesty
will be holding a birthday banquet

98
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,279
for you in three days.

99
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:18,040
You can thank her by then.

100
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,650
You're kind of a tsundere.

101
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,079
Don't tell me you're a Virgo?
[*Constellation]

102
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,120
Virg...

103
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,240
What are you saying?

104
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,399
I...

105
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,460
How could I be a virgin...

106
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,240
Buddy, what are you thinking?

107
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,920
I wasn't referring to that.

108
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,780
Virgo is a constellation.
Do you understand?

109
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,199
By the way, Your Highness,

110
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,959
I also prepared a birthday gift for you.

111
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,240
Although it's not valuable,

112
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,720
it's quite rare as well.

113
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,890
This is a Smoke Bug, which is
cultivated by Divine Healer Valley.

114
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:51,680
I think

115
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,040
we're bound to encounter danger
in future investigations.

116
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:56,519
By then, you just need
to crush its outer shell,

117
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,190
and it'll release a huge cloud of smoke.

118
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,270
You can use the chance to escape.

119
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,879
It does release smoke.

120
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,240
Just look at you.

121
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,879
Manyu, thank you.

122
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,490
The items in Divine Healer Valley
are magical indeed.

123
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,480
However, I can still look after myself.

124
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,160
You can have it.

125
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:36,920
Stop showing off.

126
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,959
I know martial arts too, you know?

127
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,590
Let's forget about him.

128
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,120
Manyu, I'll take you somewhere.

129
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,160
Wait.

130
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,319
Where are you guys going?

131
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,319
Candied hawthorns for sale.

132
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,959

133
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,360
Come and take a look!

134
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,390
Do you want some candied hawthorns?

135
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,560
No thanks.

136
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,560
Quality fans for sale.

137
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,790
We sell all kinds of designs.

138
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,839
Come and take a look.

139
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,319
Miss, do you want a lantern?

140
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,639
It costs ten wen.

141
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,319
Manyu.

142
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:09,959
Come.

143
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,079
Miss, take a look.

144
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,680
So, you want to buy a fan for him?

145
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,360
He always carries a fan with him.

146
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,879
And,

147
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,120
I think it works as a birthday gift.

148
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,200
I broke his fan last time.

149
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,279
I felt guilty about it.

150
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,559
This looks good.

151
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,470
"As bestowed upon
within the Book of Songs,

152
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,200
as shown in the verses of
A Wife Waiting."

153
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:45,440
This describes the longing
of a wife towards her husband.

154
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,039
No.

155
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,960
This won't do.

156
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,000
This is too mushy.

157
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,639
It doesn't look like something I'll say.

158
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,080
This is good.

159
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:06,000
Your Highness, are the two figures
you and His Highness?

160
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:09,759
Why do they look strange?

161
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,480
These are cute versions of us.

162
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,960
Adorable.

163
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,720
Cute? Adorable? What do they mean?

164
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:18,399
