1
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,900
=Princess Across Time=

2
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,460
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:49,719
Father.

4
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,479
This ginseng tea is freshly brewed.

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,320
You should have it while it's hot.

6
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,280
All right.

7
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:57,920
Tian.

8
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,200
It's rare for you to come back.

9
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,840
Father, even after all these years,
you still retain the habit

10
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,190
of checking the ledgers yourself, huh?

11
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:09,719
Indeed.

12
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:12,760
It's best to pay attention
to your own business.

13
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,680
Right now, the border conflict
is very intense.

14
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,480
I'm afraid our market there

15
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,079
will be done for.

16
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,159
Forget it.

17
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,439
Let's drop the topic.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,200
I assume you're not just here

19
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:30,359
to serve me a cup of tea.

20
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,959
Father, I can't hide anything from you.

21
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,150
Father, you've done business
for many years.

22
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:37,760
Have you ever heard of
a codename called Butler?

23
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,439
Butler?

24
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,840
I've never heard of that before.

25
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:46,840
Tian,

26
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,879
here's a piece of advice.

27
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,239
You should stay out of
other people's affairs

28
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,840
and just mind your own business

29
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,840
so that you won't
get yourself in trouble.

30
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:55,959
Yes, Father.

31
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,879
Father,

32
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,519
I need to head to the frontlines.

33
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,480
I might not return here for some time.

34
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,640
Please take care of yourself.

35
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,550
It's right to prioritize state affairs.

36
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,000
Now, the border isn't peaceful.

37
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,420
My son, you must remember this.

38
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,439
Don't try to show off.

39
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,039
Prioritize your own safety.

40
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,039
Yes, Father.

41
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,110
Father, please have it while it's hot.

42
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,759
All right.

43
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,879
It's delicious.

44
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,960
The rice has become infested with bugs.

45
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,240
Is this what our soldiers
wore to the battlefield?

46
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,280
Take a good look!

47
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,840
Our soldiers are fighting
at the frontlines

48
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,599
for the sake of our state,

49
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,319
yet these are what you feed

50
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,159
and provide to them?

51
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,280
You're sending them to their deaths!

52
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,080
Your Highness,

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,840
I was only in charge
of the military training

54
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,199
and the actual battle
after coming to the frontlines.

55
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,800
Regarding the military provisions,

56
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,400
they were handled by
Mr. Qin and General Yue Xin.

57
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,280
Where's Yue Xin, then?

58
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:53,280
General Yue Xin went out with his men
in search of Mr. Qin.

59
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,840
It's been three days since then.

60
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,160
Why didn't you report it
to me yesterday?

61
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,159
Your Highness, I wanted
to report it to you

62
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,719
after your arrival.

63
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,080
Yao Tian.

64
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,190
Yes, Your Highness.

65
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,719
Tell your men to locate Yue Xin.

66
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:08,700
Yes, Your Highness.

67
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,520
Your Highness.

68
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,360
The terrain here is dangerous.

69
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,120
I'm afraid Mr. Yao isn't
familiar with the surroundings.

70
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:17,439
Why don't I search for him instead?

71
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,360
No need for that.

72
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,240
A military camp
must always have a commander.

73
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:24,639
You should stick to your duties.

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,790
Yes, Your Highness.

75
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:27,199
Bing'er,

76
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,120
come with me.

77
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,639
Don't you think something
was off about Mu Yuan?

78
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:42,920
Indeed.

79
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:45,839
He said that Yue Xian
and Qin Feng were the ones

80
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,850
who provided the troops
with inferior equipment.

81
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,800
But both of them weren't around.

82
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:51,519
It was just his accusation.

83
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,560
Now, everyone knows that
Qin Feng has defected and escaped.

84
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,439
Now, he can push all the blame

85
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,519
on him.

86
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,839
However, I know
Yue Xin's character well.

87
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,199
He would never harm his troops.

88
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,639
And,

89
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,839
he would never collude with any crooks.

90
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:08,879
I'm sure Yue Xin was framed.

91
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,120
He went missing for three days.

92
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,120
Even so, they weren't anxious at all.

93
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,290
That's what I thought too.

94
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,800
Bing'er, wake up.

95
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:57,959
Bing'er.

96
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,279
How could you bear

97
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,519
to leave me

98
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,319
in the dark alone?

99
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,720
Bing'er.

100
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:16,959
Please wake up.

101
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:27,920
Bing'er!

102
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,399
Bing'er!

103
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,160
Are you okay?

104
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,199
I'm fine.

105
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:36,800
Bing'er.

106
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,480
We're still alive.

107
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:50,519
Bing'er.

108
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,759
Are you okay?

109
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,360
I'm fine.

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,879
I'm glad to hear that.

111
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,120
As long as you're fine.

112
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,680
Are you hurt?

113
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,480
I'm fine.

114
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,160
Are we trapped inside a cave?

115
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,720
That's right.

116
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,160
But luckily,

117
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,240
the air circulation here is great.

118
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,639
There should be an exit.

119
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:24,639
Let's go.

120
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:26,279
Slowly.

121
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:29,959
Be careful.

122
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:33,279
It's so dark in here. Are you scared?

123
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,839
No. I have you with me.

124
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,519
Who's there?

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,680
Who's there?

126
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:46,759
Yue Xin?

127
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,160
Yue Xin, it's actually you.

128
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,079
Your Highness, Crown Princess.

129
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:57,319
What are you guys doing here?

130
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,639
It's a long story.

131
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,680
What about you?

132
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,230
The soldiers in the military camp
said that you...

133
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,490
They said I went missing, right?

134
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:03,480
That's right.

135
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,519
Feng as well.

136
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,079
Of course Mu Yuan wants me

137
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,439
to be dead.

138
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:08,800
As for Mr. Qin,

139
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,680
I suspect that he was captured.

140
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:12,519
Seems like we disrupted Mu Yuan's plan

141
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,240
with our sudden arrival.

142
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,160
That's why he has no choice

143
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,319
but to silence us.

144
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,690
Seems like other forces
are at play here.

145
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,959
Who'll receive the most benefit

146
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,390
after Mu Yuan
takes over the military camp?

147
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,639
Anxi State.

148
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:26,759
That's right.

149
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,279
However, what I want to say is

150
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,550
that the person who'll truly
benefit from this event

151
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,190
should be the one who's paying
for Anxi State's military expenses.

152
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,390
