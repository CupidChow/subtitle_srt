1
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,900
=Princess Across Time=

2
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,460
=Episode 26=

3
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,119
Father.

4
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,719
You're here.

5
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,390
Follow me to the Investigative Bureau.

6
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:56,320
What?

7
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,399
Has His Excellency pleaded guilty?

8
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,840
I'm sure you know

9
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:01,560
what you have done.

10
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,920
This time, I won't trust you again.

11
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,519
The Investigative Bureau
has surrounded the residence.

12
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,680
I suggest you stop struggling.

13
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:16,719
Forget it.

14
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,959
I was careful and cunning all my life.

15
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,840
But in the end,

16
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,799
I was brought down by my own son.

17
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:30,439
I guess this is a worthy death.

18
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:36,000
All of these are the pieces
of evidence I've organized.

19
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:37,879
You can check them.

20
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,840
Let me

21
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,760
take a good look at the residence.

22
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,239
I'm afraid

23
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,480
I won't be able
to come back in the future.

24
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,120
Father,

25
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,200
I promise you this.

26
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,519
I won't let you suffer
in the Investigative Bureau.

27
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,239
That's the last filial deed
I can perform for you.

28
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,240
Tie him up.

29
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,879
With him around,

30
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,350
I assume the Investigative Bureau
doesn't dare to act against us.

31
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,479
Master, this is
an excellent move indeed.

32
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:24,240
Those who wish to achieve great deeds
have to be able to slay their own kin.

33
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,240
Back then, Heng State
annihilated Jiang State.

34
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,759
We had to tolerate grievances
and suffer hardships

35
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,639
for many years.

36
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,240
And now,

37
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,680
Heng State is in a state of confusion.

38
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,840
We can't allow him to jeopardize
the revival of our state.

39
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,639
Is the carriage ready?

40
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,759
Yes, Master.

41
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:53,000
If so, put them on the carriage.

42
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes, Master.

43
00:02:59,520 --> 00:02:59,919
Hurry!

44
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:01,400
Over here!

45
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:01,960
Yes, sir!

46
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,800
Master, we're surrounded.

47
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,240
Who dares to obstruct me?

48
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:19,400
Mr. Yao, where are you going
at this late hour?

49
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,080
Your Highness,
I have a favor to ask of you.

50
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,039
Go ahead and tell me.

51
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,919
I'll proceed ahead
when we're near the capital.

52
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,990
Please wait for me
in the Investigative Bureau.

53
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,960
I wish to persuade my father.

54
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:32,759
After all, he...

55
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,520
I understand.

56
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,080
Try your best to persuade him.

57
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,599
Try and see if
he can turn over a new leaf

58
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,719
on account of you

59
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,190
so that he could avoid
committing a larger mistake.

60
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,960
If I haven't returned by the hour of Xu,

61
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,439
intercept him at the south entrance
with your men.

62
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,520
If Father wishes to escape,

63
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,230
I'm sure he'll head toward
the borders of Anxi State.

64
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,190
Someone will surely receive him
on his journey.

65
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,159
We can't afford to let him escape.

66
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,280
Your Highness,
you're looking for me at this hour?

67
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,599
Is it something urgent?

68
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,560
Unfortunately,

69
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:13,599
I'm going on a trip with my son.

70
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,879
- Mr. Yao...
- Yao Gao.

71
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:17,399
You should stop.

72
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,399
He's lying to you.

73
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,490
You've already committed
plenty of heinous sin.

74
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,839
Release Yao Tian.

75
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,480
Your Highness.

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,230
We'll ask him to explain himself.

77
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,879
One of the carriages contains money

78
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:35,279
while the other contains
the purest Heart-Devouring Gu Poison.

79
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,439
- Heart-Devouring Gu Poison?
- This is a residential area.

80
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:43,720
Say, if I blow the whistle now,

81
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,519
do you think the folks here
can escape in time?

82
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,600
We can negotiate a deal.

83
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,120
Do not harm the people.

84
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,720
Your Highness, you do love your people.

85
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:59,800
Let's negotiate a deal, then.

86
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,000
Speak.

87
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,519
Let me go.

88
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,990
Do you think that's possible?

89
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,639
If not, everyone within a ten-li radius

90
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,720
shall perish together with me.

91
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,920
At least I won't die alone.

92
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:17,720
What about this?

93
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,120
Release Yao Tian.

94
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,439
I shall be your hostage.

95
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,519
Your Highness,

96
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,839
do you know what you're talking about?

97
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,639
Deal? Or no deal?

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,199
You better be quick
before I change my mind.

99
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,680
Deal.

100
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,319
Wait.

101
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,879
There's one thing
that I want His Highness

102
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,680
to take with him.

103
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,560
You two are loving indeed.

104
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,160
Your Highness,

105
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,439
I shall take my leave now.

106
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,839
Come.

107
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,160
Let's go.

108
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,319
Your Highness.

109
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:01,319
I suggest you close your eyes

110
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,399
and rest for now.

111
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,240
I'm afraid you won't enjoy such benefits

112
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:08,000
when we reach Anxi State.

113
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:09,800
Yao Gao,

114
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:11,879
I don't understand at all.

115
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,490
The imperial court
has never mistreated you.

116
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,160
Father has also appointed you
as the leader of the merchants.

117
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:20,040
Why are you doing this?

118
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,000
Truth is often cruel.

119
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,480
Your Highness,

120
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,079
it's better for you
to be kept in the dark.

121
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,399
Anyway,

122
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,959
you and your father forced me

123
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,519
to do everything I did.

124
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,040
You'll harm Yao Tian

125
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,199
by doing so.

126
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:41,879
Is it even worth it?

127
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,040
He's a member of the Yao Family.

128
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,319
He has to make sacrifices

129
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,000
for the Yao Family's sake
when it's necessary.

130
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,820
You're not from Heng State, aren't you?

131
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,720
Your Highness, what makes you think so?

132
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,490
I've encountered plenty
of heartless merchants

133
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,560
and corrupt officials.

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,319
They're either doing it for money

135
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,560
or power.

136
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,360
But you?

137
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,160
You gave most of your assets

138
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,720
to Anxi State.

139
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,319
Moreover,

140
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:19,360
you're just a commoner in Heng State.

141
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,199
You weren't even willing
to be an official.

142
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:25,040
I could never figure that out.

143
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,839
If so, there's only one possibility.

144
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,000
You're not from Heng State.

145
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,279
Tell me, then.

146
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,720
Which state should I be from?

147
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,759
I suppose it's Jiang State.

148
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,120
Judging from your age,

149
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,960
I suppose you witnessed the process
when Jiang State was eradicated.

150
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,399
Your Highness, you're observant indeed.

151
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:50,279
If so, why don't you take another guess?

152
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:53,039
Try and guess my identity.

153
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,720
I'm still young.

154
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:59,200
I don't know much about Jiang State.

155
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,360
Father rarely brings it up either.

156
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,519
Who exactly are you?

157
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,480
I'm Yao Songting,
the grand chancellor of Jiang State,

158
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,799
the state that you guys annihilated.

159
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:16,200
Although Jiang State wasn't massive,

160
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,559
it's very prosperous.

161
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,759
But your father?

162
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:23,399
Since he ascended
the throne not long ago,

163
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,480
he was in a hurry
to establish a foothold.

164
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,279
Therefore, he listened
to Qin Yi, that old fox.

165
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,720
He launched an attack on Jiang State

166
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,960
under the guise of trade.

167
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,080
We weren't prepared for it at all.

168
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:40,639
Our palace was captured soon after.

169
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,279
His Majesty was murdered.

170
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:44,279
You guys wiped out Jiang State

171
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,840
without a fight.

172
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,639
Dear!

173
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:16,720
Dear, you're finally back!

174
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,799
Tian!

175
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,759
Dear, listen to me.

176
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,790
That Ling fellow has murdered
His Majesty and the princes!

177
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,350
The people of Heng State
will be here soon!

178
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,710
I've already arranged for someone
to pick us up.

179
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,580
Let's hurry and leave!

180
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,080
Search the area thoroughly!

181
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,759
Yes, sir!

182
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,120
We must eliminate all of them!

183
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,399
Dear, hurry and leave!

184
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,600
Over here!

185
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:47,960
Hurry!

186
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,799
Dear, hurry!

187
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,250
It was a complete success.

188
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,519
You said you're doing it
to avenge Jiang State

189
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:39,720
and your wife.

190
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,200
But do you know

191
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,360
what you've done?

192
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,720
You bribed senior officials with money

193
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,790
so that they could
sell contraband salt on your behalf.

194
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:50,320
You also stockpiled a large amount
of grain, cloth,

195
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,960
and other essential supplies.

196
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,879
You disrupted the market.

197
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,159
Do you know how many people
you've harmed?

198
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:56,160
Do you know how many people
want to seek revenge against you?

199
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,919
I don't care how many people will die

200
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:05,840
as long as I can ruin Heng State.

201
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,080
The soldiers of Anxi State

202
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:10,679
will arrive outside the city
in the near future.

203
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,559
Your Highness,

204
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,279
I will make you witness
the destruction of Anxi State yourself.

205
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,080
Your Highness, please.

206
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,919
Where are we?

207
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,000
This is one of my small villas
in the suburbs.

208
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,159
It can't compare to your residence.

209
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,600
Let's rest here for now.

210
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,960
Aren't you afraid of the pursuers?

211
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,990
How could you still be
in the mood to rest here?

212
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,320
I have the Crown Prince as my hostage.

213
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,799
They dare not do something reckless.

214
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,519
Let's go.

215
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:00,120
Don't move!

216
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,970
Stop right there!

217
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,440
Father.

218
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,960
Tian?

219
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,320
What are you guys doing here?

220
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,559
We received a secret letter.

221
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,200
A group of soldiers from Anxi State
have infiltrated the capital's vicinity.

222
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,890
And, you guys will rendezvous
with each other here.

223
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,960
It's good that you know that.

224
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:30,639
The elite soldiers of Anxi State
will arrive soon.

225
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,340
I suggest you guys leave the place

226
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,799
if you guys wish to survive.

227
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,519
If not, none of you
will be able to survive.

228
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,990
They won't be able to come here.

229
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,600
The soldiers of Anxi State
have fallen for my trap.

230
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:47,279
Our forces had annihilated them
in the mountain valley half an hour ago.

231
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,540
You don't believe me, right?

232
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,990
I brought you something.

233
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,600
The blue headscarves

234
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:55,240
are the signal
for tonight's operation, right?

235
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:56,759
This is impossible.

236
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,120
Impossible!

237
00:13:58,679 --> 00:13:59,320
Yao Gao.

238
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,480
Your last hope has been shattered.

239
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,320
You better surrender.

240
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:07,960
You won't be able to leave Heng State
even if you kill me.

241
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,720
Since that's the case,

242
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,559
let's perish together!

243
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,720
Manyu, what's going on?

244
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,180
Didn't you put the antidote
in His Highness's sack?

245
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:28,480
This...

246
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,519
This makes no sense.

247
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:34,559
These petty tricks of yours

248
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,759
are truly laughable.

249
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,440
My Heart-Devouring Gu Poison

250
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:42,440
has been re-cultivated.

251
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,600
Your antidote no longer works.

252
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,799
All of you shall perish
together with me!

253
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,279
The world is once again plagued
by the Heart-Devouring Gu Poison because

254
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,840
the Divine Healer Valley was negligent
in keeping their disciples in check.

255
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,140
Today, I shall step into
the martial arts world once again

256
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:05,879
and get rid of
all Heart-Devouring Gu Poison.

257
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:09,720
I'm also fulfilling my wish by doing so.

258
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:15,120
Grandfather. It's Grandfather.

259
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:19,600
Master!

260
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,039
Are you okay?

261
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,519
I'm fine.

262
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,560
The traitor, Yao Gao, has been arrested.

263
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:34,320
Those who are his accomplices,
you all better surrender now!

264
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:44,639
Your Highness,

265
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:47,159
may I speak with Father for a moment?

266
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,080
Father.

267
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,690
As the assistant minister
of the Investigative Bureau,

268
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,820
I have imperial orders to follow.

269
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:06,879
I have no choice but to do this.

270
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,240
In the future,

271
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,200
please take care of yourself.

272
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:19,600
Tian.

273
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,320
I always thought of you as a child.

274
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:26,799
Actually, you grew up long ago.

275
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,919
You no longer need me.

276
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,000
You're all grown up.

277
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:39,679
You no longer need me.

278
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:46,799
Go!

279
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,559
Hurry! Go!

280
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:50,240
Stay put!

281
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:52,559
Go!

282
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:54,600
Mr. Yao.

283
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:56,360
Are you okay?

284
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:00,960
Who's there?

285
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,759
Kid.

286
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,839
You're a skilled martial artist.

287
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:07,559
You're loyal too.

288
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,400
Once this case is over,

289
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,680
return to your residence
and marry Manyu immediately.

290
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,559
Grandfather is still messing around

291
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,000
even at this age.

292
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,920
Mr. Yao, are you injured?

293
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,039
I'm not.

294
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,920
Since your grandfather
wanted to test my skills,

295
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,690
I'm sure he wouldn't hurt me for real.

296
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:30,640
