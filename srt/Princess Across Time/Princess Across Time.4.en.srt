00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,900
=Princess Across Time=

2
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,460
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,690
Thank you for saving my life,
Your Highness.

4
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,200
I will not forget your kindness.

5
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,550
No need for the formalities.

6
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:54,479
Miss,

7
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:56,200
do you know

8
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,200
any secrets related to Situ Lian?

9
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,560
Sirs and madams,

10
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,200
I'm just a servant.

11
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,000
I...

12
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:04,920
I don't know anything.

13
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,840
Tell the truth.

14
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,000
What are you panicking?
Obviously, you know something.

15
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,040
Uh...

16
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:10,920
Confess now.

17
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,560
Sir,

18
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:15,840
I truly know nothing at all.

19
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,170
Stop forcing her.

20
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,560
Seeing your panicked face,

21
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:22,480
I suppose you truly don't know anything.

22
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:23,280
You may go.

23
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:27,560
Your Highness, are you letting her leave
just like this?

24
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,519
It's fine. Let her be.

25
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,719
The murderer failed and will surely

26
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,690
be waiting for her
in the Xianyin Pleasure House.

27
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,359
I feel bad for this young lady.

28
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:37,640
After returning there,

29
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:40,239
she might have a good fight

30
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,840
with that person.

31
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,519
Please save me, sirs and madams.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,280
I don't want to die.

33
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:49,319
If so, answer Her Highness honestly.

34
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:50,359
Yes, sir.

35
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,000
That day,

36
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,439
while I was tidying up Miss Situ's room,

37
00:01:55,959 --> 00:02:00,040
I found a prenatal tonic prescription
that was partially burned.

38
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,159
Not long after that,

39
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,000
Wu San kept harassing her.

40
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,719
They often argued,

41
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,000
but Wu San always kept us downstairs

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,060
and wouldn't let us listen.

43
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,280
After that,

44
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,919
Miss Situ seemed to be possessed.

45
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,159
One day, she woke up bleeding heavily.

46
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,280
During that time,

47
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,840
she seemed to lose her mind,

48
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,879
kept saying there was a ghost
in her room,

49
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,680
and had all the windows sealed.

50
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,290
She wouldn't show up for performances.

51
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,879
Situ Lian.

52
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,240
Situ Lian.

53
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,240
Who's that?

54
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,280
Situ Lian.

55
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,719
Situ Lian.

56
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,280
Her health worsened

57
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,840
until the day His Highness visited.

58
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:20,159
Before going on stage,
Miss Situ came to me

59
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,639
and gave me some money,

60
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:24,360
asking me to find a chance

61
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,199
to send a message to His Highness

62
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,680
while everyone was focused

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,560
on her performance.

64
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,560
How much do you know about Wu San?

65
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,680
Wu San.

66
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,280
He ran the brothel,

67
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,790
but we didn't see him often.

68
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,060
Did he know martial arts?

69
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:41,639
He said he did.

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,919
There was once he got drunk and told us

71
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,319
that he could jump onto rooftops
when he was younger.

72
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,360
Anything else?

73
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,560
I remember something.

74
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,840
He also knew healing skills

75
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,639
and acupuncture.

76
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,919
Acupuncture?

77
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,890
The two bodies should be re-examined.

78
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,319
Manyu, come with me.

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,719
Miss Manyu,

80
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:10,599
if you don't feel well,
we can wait outside.

81
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,120
It's fine.

82
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:13,520
I can bear this.

83
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,740
It's more important
to assist Her Highness.

84
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,240
Manyu, take a look at this.

85
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,079
Is this the crystal
caused by Southern Xinjiang's Gu poison?

86
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,480
Precisely.

87
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,990
However, this is different
from the one on the waiter's body.

88
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,680
This is the Carefree Gu Poison.

89
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:33,160
A type of Gu poison
that causes hallucinations

90
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,560
and gradually causes one
to lose their sanity.

91
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,000
Hallucination?

92
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:57,519
There is a sign of miscarriage.

93
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,399
Situ Lian's miscarriage was likely
due to being in the early pregnancy stage

94
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,199
and fright.

95
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,720
However, if the mastermind's only goal
is to get rid of her child,

96
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:11,360
all of his actions
seem rather illogical.

97
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:18,920
Lian,

98
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,839
how many times do I have to tell you?

99
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,560
Be obedient.

100
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,920
All right.

101
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,240
I will give you what you deserve.

102
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,759
Manyu, take a look at this.

103
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,399
Is this a wound also
caused by the Gu Poison?

104
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,079
I don't think so.

105
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,240
If the Gu poison doesn't cause this,

106
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,790
given that the redness around the wound
hasn't gone off,

107
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,319
it might be something inside.

108
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,879
A broken needle?

109
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,319
Now I see.

110
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,600
This is an ordinary acupuncture needle.

111
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,199
It's probably the weapon
Wu San used to kill her.

112
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,639
Wu San must be good at using needles.

113
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,199
He inserted this needle
into Situ Lian's body

114
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,319
for a delayed effect.

115
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,560
On the night of Situ Lian's death,

116
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,290
he pretended to be a ghost
to scare Situ Lian

117
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,319
and pushed the needle further
into her lungs,

118
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,240
which caused her death.

119
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,120
She died from suffocation,

120
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,480
which made it seem
like she died from fright.

121
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:53,519
In that case,

122
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,519
the one impersonating you is Wu San.

123
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,279
Because he wanted to
give the public the illusion

124
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:00,240
that you showed up
at Xianyin Pleasure House that night.

125
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,519
What's this?

126
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,079
Mr. Yao,

127
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,600
we found some white powder

128
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,040
inside Wu San's room.

129
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,000
Go and ask

130
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,199
if there are any discoveries.

131
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,220
Yes, Your Highness.

132
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:33,959
You mentioned before
that Wu San's hands had an herbal smell.

133
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,240
Plus, he knew
how to perform acupuncture.

134
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,319
We can deduce

135
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,279
that the Gu poison he used
to confuse Situ Lian

136
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,920
and the other Gu poison
used to kill the maid

137
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,920
both came from him, right?

138
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,839
No.

139
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,519
Wu San looked

140
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,399
like an ordinary brothel keeper.

141
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,600
These two Gu poisons are rare

142
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,959
and costly per usage.

143
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,120
They aren't something he could afford.

144
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,199
There must be someone behind him.

145
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,040
But why would
they want to kill Situ Lian?

146
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:05,279
Is it because she was pregnant?

147
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,079
Or perhaps

148
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:09,160
Situ Lian knew some secrets.

149
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,879
Both are possible.

150
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,560
People who can afford to use Gu poisons

151
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,680
are either dignitaries

152
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,079
or affluent merchants.

153
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,639
If Situ Lian had a relationship
with this kind

154
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:20,519
of person and got pregnant,

155
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,370
it would be possible.

156
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,590
Besides, she would
surely know many secrets

157
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,639
from a long-term relationship.

158
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,120
Hence, Situ Lian threatened the man

159
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,319
to keep her child safe.

160
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,920
But that man wouldn't agree.

161
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,519
So after her miscarriage,

162
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,320
Situ Lian became vengeful

163
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,790
and tried to tip you off
to land him into big trouble.

164
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,720
On the contrary,
she ended up being silenced.

165
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,000
The results are out.

166
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,320
The white powder
came from dried fish maws.

167
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,279
Besides, we also found
a ball of silk string under Wu San's bed.

168
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,260
You head to
the Xianyin Pleasure House first.

169
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:53,080
I will be there soon.

170
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,960
(Fish maw?)

171
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:09,759
(Locked room.)

172
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,600
(I see.)

173
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:15,480
(Turns out it was a simple device.)

174
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,600
This...

175
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,679
Mr. Yao.

176
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,159
