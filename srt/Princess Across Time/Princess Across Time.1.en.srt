=Episode 1=

3
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,159
Situ Lian.

4
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,560
Situ Lian.

5
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:07,840
Situ Lian.

6
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,640
Stop calling me.

7
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,280
Stop it.

8
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,239
Situ Lian.

9
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:15,080
Stop calling me.

10
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:16,359
Let me go.

11
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,680
Let me go.

12
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,590
It's the Demon Princess!

13
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,460
The Demon Princess!

14
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,490
It's the Demon Princess!

15
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,239
Rumors have it

16
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,840
that a demon possessed
Crown Princess.

17
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,920
As a result, Crown Princess

18
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,840
wreaked havoc in the human realm.

19
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,319
(Tang Bing'er, Forensic Science Department)
The story is great.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,959
Lend me the book.

21
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,380
What are you doing to do?

22
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,680
(Xi Xiaoxiao, bestie)
Buy one if you are curious.

23
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,890
I haven't finished reading it yet.

24
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:47,000
Lend me yours. I just take a look.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,359
Let me take a look.

26
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,900
(Luo Jinchuan, the popular senior)

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,690
Do forensic science students
believe in nonsense?

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,920
Come and practice with me.

29
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,239
I have to go
to Xue Hanning's fan meeting later.

30
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,670
You can get the book back if you win.

31
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,239
Come on.

32
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,079
Xue Hanning is here.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,159
Xue Hanning!

34
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,039
(Xue Hanning Fan Meeting)
Hello, everyone. I'm Xue Hanning.

35
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,360
I'm very happy
to meet you all here today.

36
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,520
In the future,

37
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,090
I will continue to strive
and become a better version of myself.

38
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,840
I hope you will keep supporting me.

39
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:18,990
Please look out for me...

40
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,039
Xue Hanning!

41
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:25,360
Xue Hanning!

42
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,719
News flash.

43
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,599
Xue Hanning had an emergency case

44
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,919
during the fan meeting.

45
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,280
We just received the news

46
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,180
that the famous actress, Xue Hanning,
died despite resuscitation efforts.

47
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,840
The lipstick is fishy.

48
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:47,960
Excuse me.

49
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,240
I'm Xue Hanning's fan.

50
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,360
I brought her flowers.

51
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,719
It was you!

52
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,959
Kill the Demon Princess!

53
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,399
Kill her!

54
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,279
Kill her!

55
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:37,319
Kill the Demon Princess!

56
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,839
Kill the Demon Princess!

57
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,439
Kill her!

58
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:42,639
Kill the Demon Princess!

59
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,879
Kill the Demon Princess!

60
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,319
Kill her!

61
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,000
What's going on here?

62
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,000
Hey, dude.

63
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,040
Dude.

64
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,199
What's going on here?

65
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,199
Kill her!

66
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,839
Kill the Demon Princess!

67
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,439
Why did you tie me up?
Is this a shooting or what?

68
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,759
The hour has arrived.

69
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,920
Execute her!

70
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,160
Wait...

71
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,390
Who disturbs the execution ground?

72
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,700
(Ling Xuan, Crown Prince)

73
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,160
Luo Jinchuan?

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,240
Greetings, Your Highness.

75
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,959
Regarding Situ Lian's case,

76
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,759
the witness and evidence
have been found.

77
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,040
Besides, it was examined by His Majesty.

78
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,360
- Your Highness,
- (Situ Lian...)

79
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,480
please don't make things
difficult for me.

80
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,319
(The Tales of Strange?)

81
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,360
Nonsense.

82
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,319
This case is highly suspicious.

83
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,079
If Crown Princess is found guilty,

84
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,959
I won't play favoritism.

85
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:47,680
But...

86
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,680
If you still have doubts,

87
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:52,279
you may report this to His Majesty.

88
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,319
I will take the responsibility
if anything happens.

89
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,279
As you say, Your Highness.

90
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,600
Release her.

91
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,439
Let's go.

92
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,959
(Manyu, maidservant)

93
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,879
Your Highness, please spare me.
I'm to blame.

94
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,639
I'm too careless.

95
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,480
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

96
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,399
Uh...

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,759
Xi Xiaoxiao.

98
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,480
Xi Xiaoxiao...

99
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:19,000
What are you and Luo Jinchuan up to?

100
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,040
Your Highness,

101
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,160
I don't understand
what you are talking about.

102
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,480
Stop this silly game.

103
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,730
I have already found new clues
in Xue Hanning's case.

104
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:31,439
I must go to the police station
right away and provide the clue.

105
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,199
This is not the talking place.

106
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,759
We will talk about that later.

107
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,040
Wait.

108
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,360
(I'm in the ancient era?)

109
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,879
Manyu.

110
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,800
You said your name is Manyu, right?

111
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,519
My name is Manyu, Your Highness.

112
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,360
I'm the maidservant
from your maternal family.

113
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:07,439
Don't...

114
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,839
Don't tell me
I'm Demon Princess, Qin Xiyue.

115
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,120
I wouldn't dare say your name,
Your Highness.

116
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:16,839
(Oh no! Crap!)

117
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,240
(Why am I in the Tales of Strange?)

118
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,879
(I must find a way to go back.)

119
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,600
(Water.)

120
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:36,199
(Got it.)

121
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,240
Stop the carriage.

122
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,120
Wu, go and check it out.

123
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,240
I will report you to the yamen now.

124
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,759
Go away. Don't make a fuss at my stall.

125
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,759
Sir, I must tell you this.

126
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,079
The people can't afford to eat now.

127
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,480
This is only the fourth day,

128
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,000
and the rice prices went up crazily.

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,800
How are we going to carry on?

130
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,519
Sir, please get justice for us.

131
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,759
Farewell!

132
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,120
(Qin Yi, Grand Chancellor)
This is outrageous.

133
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,319
Xiyue has been unruly since little.

134
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,759
I have failed to disciple her.

135
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,040
That's why Xiyue made
such a grave mistake.

136
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,800
Many people saw

137
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,399
Xiyue leaving the Xianyin Pleasure House

138
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,279
on the day of Situ Lian's death.

139
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,160
However,

140
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,319
Feng and I

141
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,800
distinctly saw Xiyue eating with us
during the family banquet.

142
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,480
Right.

143
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,890
This is where I find it suspicious.

144
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,040
The thing is, you and Mr. Qin

145
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,320
are Xiyue's family.

146
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,600
Your testimonies
aren't considered valid.

147
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,440
Besides,

148
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,200
Xiyue was away for one hour
during the feast.

149
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,480
Judging by the distance,

150
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,230
it should be sufficient for her to make
a round trip to Xianyin Pleasure House.

151
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,679
Still, with my understanding of Xiyue,

152
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,370
she wouldn't have been able
to come up with a meticulous plan.

153
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,399
Precisely, Your Highness.

154
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,960
Your Highness,

155
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,679
we count on you
to seek justice for the Qin Family.

156
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:56,279
Right.

157
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,360
His Majesty ordered to kill Xiyue...

158
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,080
(Why am I still stuck in this place?)

159
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,759
(I see.)

160
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,039
(It seems I must get to the bottom
of Situ Lian's case to leave here.)

161
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,159
(This must be it.)

162
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:11,759
(This is how things work)

163
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,720
(in time-traveling novels.)

164
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:17,990
I want to take a look at the body.

165
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,940
(Investigation Bureau)

166
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,120
(Yao Tian, assistant minister of Investigation Bureau)
Greetings,

167
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,770
Your Highnesses.

168
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,730
How is the progress?

169
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,070
According to the examination
of corpse, the people's testimonies,

170
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,679
and the gown left by Crown Princess
at the Xianyin Pleasure House,

171
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,730
Crown Princess still
remains the suspect.

172
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,559
I have looked into it.

173
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,039
On the night of Situ Lian's death,

174
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,390
Crown Princess went to the Grand
Chancellor's Residence for a banquet.

175
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:45,799
I know the Grand Chancellor's testimony
isn't valid,

176
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:49,440
so I request to re-examine the body.

177
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,440
You know how to do that?

178
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:54,080
Of course. I didn't attend the course
for four years for nothing.

179
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,600
What I mean is,
I know a little bit about it.

180
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,840
Xue Hanning?

181
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,559
What did you call her?

182
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:24,039
Isn't her name Situ Lian?

183
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,759
Isn't this the important clue
you mentioned?

184
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,799
I was talking nonsense.

185
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,360
(Nothing in her mouth.)

186
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,630
(No sign of trauma around her neck.)

187
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,519
(Bulging eyeballs.)

188
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:45,720
The time of death should be around

189
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:48,039
12 to 16 hours.

190
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,879
It aligns with the deduction.

191
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,679
What is "hours"?

192
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,279
It's "shichen" you use.

193
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:56,919
Six to eight "shichens".
[*One shichen equals two hours]

194
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,440
Your deduction is correct.

195
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,490
Miss Situ's death time was at the first half
of the Hai hour last night.

196
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,330
Now is the latter half of the Wei hour.
Exactly sixteen hours ago.

197
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:08,480
How did you make deductions?

198
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,000
This is the "Corpse Examination"

199
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,790
with a mnemonic passed
through many generations.

200
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,320
"At the hour of Zi, Wu, Mao, and You,
the thumb pressed the middle finger.

201
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:15,159
At the hour of Chen, Xu, Chou, and Wei,
the palm is open.

202
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:16,919
At the hour of Yin, Shen, Si, and Hai,
the fist is clenched.

203
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,679
The time of death is precise."

204
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:21,320
Miss Situ was found
with her fist clenched,

205
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,990
so it should have been around the first
half of the Hai hour last night.

206
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,679
(The ancient people)

207
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,679
(has a systematic autopsy procedure.)

208
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,399
Since you don't know the mnemonic,

209
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,039
how did you make your deduction?

210
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,559
The deceased's face looks contorted.

211
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,679
Her muscles are stiff,
and her eyeballs bulge.

212
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,680
She seems to have been scared to death.

213
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,440
This matches

214
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,240
the rumor that Situ Lian died
due to a curse.

215
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,679
You made a point.

216
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:45,519
But with due respect,
despite all this deduction,

217
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:47,799
Your Highness still remains
the prime suspect.

218
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:50,080
How do you not get it?

219
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm not the murderer,

220
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,759
but

221
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:55,000
it might be this Crown Princess.

222
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,840
Because I'm me but not entirely me.

223
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,399
Now I'm different
from the past me.

224
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,720
To sum up, I'm not the murderer.

225
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,790
Do you understand now?

226
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,440
Are you trying to feign madness

227
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,679
to clear yourself?

228
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,039
Forget it.

229
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,039
Do you have a scalpel?

230
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,320
What is a scalpel?

231
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,690
A surgical one is also fine.

232
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:13,990
What do you mean by a surgical one?

233
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:21,799
What are you doing?

234
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:22,679
Dissection.

235
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,639
(What is this?)

236
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,039
Inside the deceased's stomach,

237
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,790
there's a small white
crystalline substance.

238
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,370
And some redness in her lungs.

239
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,360
But there's no professional
instrument,

240
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,679
I need time to investigate.

241
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,730
Let's go to the Xianyin Pleasure House.

242
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:54,360
Mr. Yao,

243
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,240
did you seal all the windows here?

244
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,559
No.

245
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,200
According to the members here,

246
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,919
a month before Situ Lian's death,

247
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,279
she was mentally unstable

248
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:05,919
and constantly had nightmares
about seeing a ghost at the back window.

249
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:08,639
Later, she had someone seal and lock

250
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:09,639
all the windows.

251
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,200
(This is a freak behavior.)

252
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:22,960
(But it's impossible the scene
has nothing left behind.)

253
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,519
(All physical evidence
wouldn't appear out of nowhere)

254
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,360
(or disappeared.)

255
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,600
(A traceless crime scene doesn't exist.)

256
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,399
(The murderer must have left traces)

257
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,559
(somewhere.)

258
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,200
(Found it.)

259
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,360
You!

260
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:35,559
This is...

261
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,000
(A broken needle.)

262
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:38,480
Yao Tian,

263
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:41,039
is there only one entrance
in Situ Lian's room?

264
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,090
Is there no other entrance?

265
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:42,960
No.

266
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,799
(Only one entrance.)

267
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:51,039
(But on the day of Situ Lian's death,)

268
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,080
(the door was locked.)

269
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:55,759
(Could it be a locked-room murder?)

270
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,279
(Something must be wrong
with the door.)

271
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,919
(This isn't ordinary dust.)

272
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,559
(It seems)

273
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,600
(to be some kind of ash.)

274
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:42,440
Your Highnesses,

275
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,360
do you have any discoveries?

276
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,560
Let's go to the terrace.

277
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,600
All are sealed.

278
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,320
(This building is quite tall.)

279
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:25,190
(But no one mentioned Crown
Princess knew martial arts skills.)

280
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,039
(How did she escape?)

281
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,440
It's a locked-room murder case.

282
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,799
The murderer isn't Qin Xiyue.
