00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,900
=Princess Across Time=

2
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,460
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:40,079
Mr. Yao.

4
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,079
You...

5
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,119
Greetings, Your Highness.

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,640
Who is this?

7
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:54,079
Your Highness?

8
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:58,960
I know now.

9
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,380
That's how Wu San managed
to impersonate Crown Princess.

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,480
In addition, it was dark.

11
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,280
No one could tell the difference at all.

12
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:07,319
That's right.

13
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:11,680
I figured out the mystery
of the secret room as well.

14
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,359
Wu San removed

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,879
the door lock

16
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,719
when Situ Lian wasn't around.

17
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:20,640
He also removed the rivets as well.

18
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,190
After that, he applied glue to it.

19
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:23,239
This way,

20
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,159
even if Situ Lian locks the door,

21
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:27,439
the door will open
once he gives it a light push.

22
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:29,400
After Wu San completed the murder,

23
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,640
he reinstalled the door lock.

24
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,920
After that, he moved it outside the door

25
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:34,879
using a thread.

26
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,360
He brought the door together
by pulling the thread.

27
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,560
Lastly, he burned the thread.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,920
The black powder

29
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,640
I found on the ground last time

30
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,760
should be the remnants
of the burned thread.

31
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,560
If that was how Wu San
impersonated Crown Princess,

32
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:52,280
how did he fly away
when everyone was looking?

33
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,750
Mr. Yao, do you still remember
the large amount of thread

34
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:57,519
we found in Wu San's house?

35
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:02,239
And the scratch marks on the
wooden railing on the terrace?

36
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,079
Before this, I couldn't understand why.

37
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:05,760
Why would Wu San keep

38
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,879
such a large amount of thread when he

39
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,680
was only using it
to bring the door together?

40
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,479
Now, it seems like

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,680
he tied the silk thread
to the wooden railing

42
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,879
and secured the other end at a distance.

43
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:20,479
He glided along the thread
during nighttime,

44
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,240
causing people to think
that he could fly.

45
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,560
Crown Prince, Crown Princess,

46
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,660
your deductions are thorough
and insightful.

47
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,360
It was as if I was watching a show.

48
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:45,520
Thank you,

49
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,199
Crown Prince, Crown Princess.

50
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:53,240
Are you dense?
Are you only thanking the two of us?

51
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,000
Thank you, Manyu.

52
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,360
Your Highness,

53
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,879
according to Wu's investigation,

54
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,590
the commodity prices
in many areas of Heng State

55
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:11,919
have risen rapidly.

56
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,520
Should we report this to His Majesty?

57
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,039
I have an idea

58
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,400
why we're in such a situation.

59
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,039
Remember, investigate this case secretly.

60
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,730
Don't alert the enemy to our presence.

61
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,120
I'm sure the mastermind
is someone influential.

62
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:27,990
Yes, Your Highness.

63
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:28,919
Understood.

64
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,120
Wu, come and join me.

65
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,639
I dare not do so, Your Highness.

66
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,510
It's fine. There are no outsiders here.

67
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,199
Come and join us.

68
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,159
Yes, Your Highness.

69
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,360
By the way, Yao Tian,
don't you think Crown Princess

70
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,960
has been acting strange lately?

71
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:55,360
This...

72
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,919
You know this too.

73
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,080
Crown Princess
was a tyrant before this.

74
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:03,400
She mistreated
her servants all the time.

75
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,650
But now, it's as if
she's a completely different person.

76
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,759
I dare not make assumptions.

77
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,319
But Her Highness suddenly knew
how to perform an autopsy.

78
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,990
She could make case deductions too.

79
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,960
I was perplexed as well.

80
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,120
That's right.

81
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,279
Not only did she become intelligent,

82
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,600
but she's also friendly to the people.

83
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,600
She actually taught Manyu how to cook.

84
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:29,040
The people are fortunate
that Her Highness

85
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,360
has turned over a new leaf.

86
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,120
It's the fortune of Heng State.

87
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,199
I'm afraid

88
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,900
there's more to it than meets the eye.

89
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:55,759
Why did you end up like this?

90
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,490
Don't say
you turned over a new leaf.

91
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,399
I won't buy that.

92
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,800
I came from another world.

93
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,399
What are you wearing?

94
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,759
A sleep mask.

95
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,160
You said you were afraid of the dark.

96
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,079
I can't sleep with the candles on.

97
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,740
I have no choice
but to make a sleep mask.

98
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,990
Who said I was afraid of the dark?

99
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:26,199
Yeah, yeah.
You're not afraid of the dark.

100
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:28,040
You're just afraid of assassins.

101
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,000
Thank you.

102
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,890
Where did you go
this early in the morning?

103
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,079
What?

104
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:18,270
Were you worried about me
because you couldn't find me?

105
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,959
Don't get ahead of yourself here.

106
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,680
I'm just worried

107
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,519
that you won't get the chance
to try my new breakfast recipe.

108
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,439
This morning, I requested
Father to clear your name.

109
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,959
Thank you.

110
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:35,959
Your Highness.

111
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,480
Mr. Yao, you're here.

112
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,790
You haven't eaten yet, right?
Join us.

113
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:40,780
Thank you, Your Highness.

114
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,879
Your Highness, someone handed this to
the Investigation Bureau this morning.

115
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,600
Do you remember

116
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,160
what he looked like?

117
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,000
No.

118
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,920
Seems like that person
doesn't want his identity

119
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,199
to be revealed.

120
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,160
An affinity charm?

121
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,370
This belongs to Situ Lian.

122
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,480
Situ Lian?

123
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,319
Don't tell me she got it for that man?

124
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,920
Mr. Yao,

125
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,920
do you know which Buddhist temple
or Taoist shrine

126
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,990
this affinity charm comes from?

127
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,959
I have no idea.

128
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,890
But when it comes to affinity
and marriages,

129
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,690
the Tree of Love
is the most effective of them all.

130
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,720
The Tree of Love?

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,720
You're quite clear about it.
Have you been there before?

132
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,759
No.

133
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:39,920
Mr. Yao.

134
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,000
You're quite late today.

135
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,600
Mr. Yao.

136
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,160
Mr. Yao.

137
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:52,759
Mr. Yao.

138
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,519
Didn't you say that you've never
been here before?

139
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,240
Why does everyone here know you, then?

140
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,560
Even the puppy barked at you
when we were passing by.

141
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,780
Most people who visit this tree
have wishes in their hearts.

142
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,040
Therefore, they'll hang
a charm on the tree.

143
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,180
Rumor has it that
this tree grants people their wishes.

144
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,160
Crown Prince, Ling Xuan?

145
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,839
Seems like there are plenty of girls

146
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,759
who want to get married
to Crown Prince.

147
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:33,480
Your Highness,

148
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,360
are you jealous?

149
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,360
Not at all.

150
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,399
Guys, come and take a look.
Isn't this Mr. Yao?

151
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,799
Yao Tian,

152
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,240
don't worry.

153
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,960
I'll definitely find you

154
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,840
an excellent lady in the future.

155
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,759
Thank you, Your Highness.

156
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,039
But I believe that our affinities
are predestined.

157
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,679
Look.

158
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,919
All of these charms have names
except for this one.

159
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,799
"Gazing at the moon outside the window,

160
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,120
cherishing our feelings for each other.

161
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:50,159
Reminiscing about the past
in the plains of Qin,

162
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,000
weathering the stormy weather
for a brighter future."

163
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,519
It's implying something.

164
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:54,799
Is it Lian

165
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:55,840
and Qin Feng?
