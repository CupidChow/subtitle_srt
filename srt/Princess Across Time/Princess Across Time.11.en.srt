00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,460
=Episode 11=

3
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,260
(Zhuxuan Abode)

4
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,520
Father,

5
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,240
have you gained anything
from your long trip away?

6
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,840
I dare not say that
I've gained something.

7
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,119
However, after I visited
the marketplaces all around the state,

8
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,159
I did come up with a way
to save the marketplaces.

9
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,039
Mr. Yao, please go ahead and tell us.

10
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:01,359
Right now,
the prices of commodities are chaotic.

11
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:04,400
It might be better to centralize
essential goods

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,159
like grain, oil, salt,
charcoal, and silk

13
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,159
in a single market.

14
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,970
The imperial court will manage them
and come up with reasonable prices.

15
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,359
This way,

16
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:16,319
the prices of commodities
can be stabilized.

17
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,439
From a short-term perspective,
this can help stabilize the prices.

18
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,460
If you look at it
from a long-term perspective,

19
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:24,280
it can even increase
the imperial court's tax revenue.

20
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,239
It's just that this plan
sounds too ambitious.

21
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,000
We can't achieve this in a short period.

22
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,890
Destruction is necessary for creation.

23
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:35,400
I've been doing business for many years.

24
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,120
Please pardon me for being frank.

25
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:40,840
At present, the economy of Heng State
has already rotted to the core.

26
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,560
Although the court
has powerful measures,

27
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,719
it's not addressing
the root of the issue.

28
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:46,640
Naturally.

29
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,400
When it comes to managing the economy,
Mr. Yao, we have to learn from you.

30
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:51,680
What about this?

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,719
In my opinion,

32
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,680
we can perform a test in a certain area.

33
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,840
If we fail, the plan will be scrapped.

34
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,079
If we succeed,

35
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,040
we'll introduce the solution
to the entire Heng State.

36
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:03,519
But where should we perform the test?

37
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,599
Mr. Yao, do you have any suggestions?

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,800
Why don't we perform it at the border
between Heng State and Anxi State?

39
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,080
The two states are on good terms.

40
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,690
If we could form
a successful market there,

41
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,919
it could also boost the trading
relationship between the two.

42
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:22,120
That location is too distant.

43
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,990
It'll be hard for the imperial court
to manage it.

44
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,800
That's right, Father.

45
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,120
Even if we were to rush there,
it'd take us at least two days

46
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,790
before we could reach there
from the capital.

47
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,800
Managing the market
isn't that difficult.

48
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,599
You may send a member of
the Ministry of Revenue there.

49
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,599
And, the border generals can be
in charge of the market's safety.

50
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:44,400
I wanted to perform the test
at the border area

51
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,240
precisely because it would
be distant from the capital.

52
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,280
Even if the test does fail,

53
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,960
it won't affect the imperial court
and its core.

54
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,039
You do have a point.

55
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,159
You do live up to your name
as the top merchant of Heng State.

56
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,800
This is an important issue.

57
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,360
I'll tell Father about this

58
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,759
at the morning court tomorrow.

59
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,280
If so, Your Highness,
I shall await your good news.

60
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:13,199
I shall take my leave now.

61
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,599
Your Highness,

62
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,590
I shall send Father back home for now.

63
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:20,919
Go ahead.

64
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,319
Who was that?

65
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,090
That was Yao Tian's father.

66
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,570
He's the top merchant of Heng State.

67
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:43,990
He's as wealthy as the state itself.

68
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,120
Are you serious?

69
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:49,080
I never expected Yao Tian

70
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,159
to be the son of a rich man.

71
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,240
But now that I think about it,

72
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,599
I guess he's good enough for Manyu.

73
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,360
"Good enough?"

74
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,560
Aren't they both losers
who have to go back and inherit

75
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:06,360
the family inheritance
if they don't get a good job?

76
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,680
For example...

77
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,680
How could you describe
people like them as losers?

78
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,639
It's because...

79
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,079
How should I put it?

80
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,800
These are examples of Internet slang.

81
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,650
You won't understand anyway.
Stop asking questions.

82
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,639
Your Highness!

83
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,319
Did something happen?

84
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,839
Wu Shizheng was found dead.

85
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,510
Didn't I tell you
to keep a close eye on him?

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,060
Your Highness, please spare me!

87
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:38,920
Speaking of which,

88
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,600
I went to the salt mine first.

89
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,199
But Wu Shizheng wasn't there.

90
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,680
After that, I found out

91
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,920
that he was living in an inn.

92
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,199
But Wu Shizheng was already dead
when I was there.

93
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,100
According to the waiter
who reported the case,

94
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:56,600
the inn was haunted.

95
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,199
He said he saw a ghost
on the night of Wu Shizheng's death.

96
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,480
But the coroner said

97
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,959
that Wu Shizheng took his own life.

98
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,590
It's another killing
by a ghostly entity?

99
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,519
But why did he take his own life?

100
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:11,120
I know why.

101
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,480
I'm sure he was bewitched by a ghost.

102
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,519
So he took his own life.

103
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,160
I don't think he took his own life.

104
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,240
It's just a murder case.

105
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,639
The inn that he lived in
is very far away.

106
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,519
And, we found our leads not long ago.

107
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,170
The news can't possibly
spread that fast.

108
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,240
Besides, even if he wanted
to take his own life,

109
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,150
why did he have to go to
somewhere as remote as the inn?

110
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,040
Isn't it easier for him to run away?

111
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,590
We have no time to waste.

112
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,780
We shall depart immediately.

113
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:33,920
Wu,

114
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,439
notify the local yamen staff

115
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,600
to preserve the crime scene
before our arrival.

116
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,690
I'll head inside the palace

117
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,470
and report to Father
about the market incident.

118
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:44,000
You guys should get ready.

119
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,759
Preserve the scene, huh?
You're a quick learner.

120
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,319
Your Highness,

121
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,319
I have a lowly identity.

122
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,480
I think I shouldn't
stay inside the carriage.

123
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,040
I told you to sit here.

124
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,319
You can sit here.

125
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,319
But isn't it too cramped
for us to sit here together?

126
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,990
You can sit over there.
It's more spacious.

127
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,720
Go now.

128
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,720
Be careful.

129
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,920
Father was happy about
the strategy we devised.

130
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,639
He'll issue an imperial edict soon.

131
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,639
Besides that, Father said the envoys

132
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,519
of Anxi State
would be visiting our state.

133
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,090
He'll hold a welcoming banquet for them.

134
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,290
Since His Majesty is paying
a lot of attention to this,

135
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,040
Father will surely not let him down.

136
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,290
Your Highness, let me thank you
and His Majesty on Father's behalf.

137
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,990
These are all good deeds that
will benefit the state.

138
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,740
We're just going with the flow here.

139
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:39,600
Later,

140
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,480
just follow my instructions.

141
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,800
Understood?

142
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,759
Mister,

143
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,600
please slow down later.

144
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,160
Your Highness,

145
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,639
Yao Tian.

146
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,519
I know it's exhausting to ride horses.

147
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,360
Coincidentally,

148
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,199
Manyu and I have nothing to do inside.

149
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,519
Why don't you guys join us?

150
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,519
Manyu, go.

151
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,160
Go.

152
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,399
Manyu.

153
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,519
If you think the carriage
is too cramped,

154
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,639
I can exit the carriage.

155
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,759
If so, you can stretch your legs.

156
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,840
That's not it.

157
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,559
I'm just...

158
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,519
Greetings, Your Highness.

159
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,519
Crown Princess.

160
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,650
Spare the formalities.

161
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,039
Thank you, Your Highness.

162
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:15,879
Mr. Liu,

163
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,320
where's Wu Shizheng's body?

164
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,879
Please lead the way.

165
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,799
Your Highness,
it must've been a long trip.

166
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,840
I've already prepared
a feast for you all.

167
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,480
Although Ankang County
is considered a rural area,

168
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:28,279
our local specialty, monkfish,

169
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:30,080
is quite unique and delicious.

170
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,279
No need for that.

171
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,260
Investigate the case first.

172
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,480
Yes, Your Highness.

173
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,080
His bones are fractured.

174
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,799
He died from mechanical asphyxiation.

175
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,990
There are no obvious external injuries
except for the mark on his neck.

176
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,120
There weren't even any
signs of struggles.

177
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,360
Judging from the surface,

178
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,120
he did take his own life.

179
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,759
Manyu.

180
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,039
Take a look.

181
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,390
See if he's poisoned by any chance.

182
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,480
Yes, Your Highness.

183
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,559
Everyone, please leave the place.

184
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,690
I'm going to start the autopsy.

185
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,799
Autopsy?

186
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:19,159
What does that mean?

187
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,759
That means she'll take apart
the victim's body

188
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:22,759
and examine his organs.

189
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,080
Take apart

190
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,360
the victim's body?

191
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:29,120
Mr. Liu, let us speak in private.

192
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,879
Yes, Your Highness.

193
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,120
Mr. Liu,

194
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,279
who's the owner of the inn

195
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:40,679
that Wu Shizheng died in?

196
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,679
Your Highness,

197
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,200
Ankang County is located on the border.

198
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,830
The citizens here lead a rough life.

199
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,600
However, Mountain Yuding
is scenic and popular.

200
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,159
Plenty of travelers visit there.

201
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:56,320
Due to that, the people there
opened an inn to make some pocket money.

202
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,559
Although we intend to supervise them,

203
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,039
we don't have enough manpower.

204
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:04,159
Due to that, we allowed them
to provide for themselves.

205
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,679
This way, they could make a living too.

206
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,600
That's just an excuse.

207
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,919
As a local official,

208
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,000
how can you be so negligent?

209
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,879
Mr. Yao,

210
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:14,240
it isn't as simple as you think.

211
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,290
If Mr. Liu uses extreme measures
to keep them in check,

212
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,190
the people living in the mountains
cannot make a living.

213
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,720
By then, he'll incur their wrath.

214
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:22,519
I'm afraid it'll worsen the issue.

215
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,759
Moreover, Ankang County
lacked manpower in the first place.

216
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,039
This is already the best solution.

217
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,200
Your Highness, thank you
for being understanding.

218
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,720
Mr. Liu, have you
obtained any new leads, then?

219
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
I was incompetent.

220
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,480
I failed to obtain any new leads.

221
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,559
Moreover, ghosts and the occult
are involved in the case.

222
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,919
The yamen staff are terrified as well.

223
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:47,600
The staff in charge of supervising
the inn have many complaints.

224
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,080
Naturally, they...

225
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:52,080
Since that's the case,
you may stop the investigation.

226
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,919
Tell all of the yamen staff to return.

227
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,350
Yes, Your Highness.

228
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,279
Your Highness,

229
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:57,480
why are you doing so?

230
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,159
The truth hasn't been revealed yet.

231
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,120
Mr. Liu, tell your men to draw me a map.

232
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:07,120
I'll visit the inn myself.

233
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,080
Your Highness.

234
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:22,799
There are no traces of drugs

235
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:24,399
in Wu Shizheng's mouth and nose.

236
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:26,679
How's your autopsy result?

237
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,990
It's different from
Situ Lian's and He Cheng's.

238
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,240
There are no residues

239
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,879
Heart-Devouring Gu Poison
in his stomach.

240
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,279
But that's impossible.

241
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,879
Wu Shizheng would never
take his own life.

242
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,890
Judging from your expression,

243
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,990
I assume you didn't
get the answer you desire.

244
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,759
If so, I'm sure you know

245
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,320
what I'm going to do next.

246
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,960
Sirs, madams, are you guys here for a meal?
Or are you guys here to stay?

247
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,290
We're spending the night here.

248
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,799
We'll get some food as well.
