00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,900
=Princess Across Time=

2
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,460
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,159
This knot isn't common.

4
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:46,840
Mr. Yao, is this commonly used
in the Investigation Bureau

5
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,119
or the military?

6
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:51,759
No.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,359
They use

8
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,000
the simplest handcuff knot.

9
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,679
This strange knot

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,079
is new to me.

11
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,280
Are you saying that Zhou Jian would
rather use a familiar knot

12
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:04,319
to kill himself

13
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,480
after all his years
of service in the army?

14
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,120
You deduce

15
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,040
that he was first strangled

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,519
and then made to appear
as if he hanged himself?

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,599
But you said it wasn't a dead body.

18
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,920
Could it be possible

19
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,640
that he was also strangled,

20
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:22,159
but the murderer tied
the most familiar knot

21
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,599
out of haste

22
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,120
to cover up

23
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,079
the real cause of death?

24
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:30,040
However, this knot has given them away.

25
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,400
Yao Tian.

26
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,280
Find a painter

27
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,319
to draw this knot

28
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,599
and post a notice.

29
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,400
Offer a reward if anyone recognizes it.

30
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,190
Yes, Your Highness.

31
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,120
Who do you think it might be?

32
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,280
I'm not sure,

33
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,640
but I feel it's someone
we dealt with before.

34
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:56,319
We can't just sit around and wait.

35
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,239
We need to see Old Camel

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,220
to find out the person
Lv Yan was actually dealing with.

37
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,799
Bing... Bing'er.

38
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,599
Someone!

39
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,400
You are awake.

40
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,400
How do you feel now?

41
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:31,000
What has happened to me?

42
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,439
Manyu said

43
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,479
you didn't sleep

44
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,520
or eat anything.

45
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,530
You overexerted yourself.

46
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,220
You have been unconscious
for eight hours.

47
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,400
Eight?

48
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,719
Don't strain yourself.

49
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,919
I will take care of the case,

50
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,240
so don't worry.

51
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,520
Were you here with me all the time?

52
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,000
I was afraid

53
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,560
that you might return to that world
and never come back.

54
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,400
Don't worry.

55
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,960
Perhaps I

56
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,840
won't return to that world again.

57
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,439
If you want to go back,

58
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:12,280
I will help you.

59
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,280
If no,

60
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,199
I will always be with you.

61
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:24,400
But we have something crucial
at hand now.

62
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:25,840
I...

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,120
You should rest well.

64
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,660
You haven't recovered yet.
You can't get out of bed now.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,599
I know my health well.

66
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,199
His Majesty only gave us three days,

67
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,990
and my brother is on the front lines.

68
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,680
I can't rest.

69
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,400
We need to head to the inn now

70
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,479
to find those envoys.

71
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,620
(Yuelai Inn)

72
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,039
Why is it so quiet?

73
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,199
Strange.

74
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,159
It's just after the hour of You,

75
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,400
and this place is dead.

76
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,159
The guards at the entrance are gone.

77
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,479
No! Old Camel is in danger.

78
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,199
Let's go.

79
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,720
It's you again.

80
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:24,240
You got away last time,

81
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:27,519
but not this time.

82
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,360
Quick!

83
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,959
Let's go.

84
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,279
How is he?

85
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,759
He's breathing.

86
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,079
Yao Tian,

87
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,399
go after that man

88
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,279
and capture him.

89
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,200
Yes, Your Highness.

90
00:04:58,959 --> 00:04:59,720
Are you all right?

91
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,160
I'm good.

92
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,160
As long as you are safe.

93
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,860
(Zhuxuan Abode)

94
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,240
What's on your mind, Yao Tian?

95
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,800
Why were you in the inn?

96
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,120
I ran into

97
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,879
the female assassin
from the inn earlier,

98
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,839
so I knew they would take action.

99
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,079
Come in and have a seat.

100
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:39,879
No thanks.

101
00:05:49,973 --> 00:05:55,580
(Huitong Bank)

102
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,480
Huitong Bank?

103
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:30,600
Are you sure?

104
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,680
Absolutely.

105
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,480
What's with that look?

106
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,000
Hurry up and investigate it.

107
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,370
That's your brother's property.

108
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,680
Qin Feng?

109
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:44,000
Why is it him again?

110
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,480
I suspected him,

111
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,319
but I know

112
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,319
Qin Feng too well.

113
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,880
I doubt he dares do something that would
bring a disaster to his family.

114
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,680
The assassin showing up at Huitong Bank

115
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:58,480
isn't enough to accuse Mr. Qin.

116
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,600
Besides, he's fighting
on the front lines now.

117
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,120
If we are wrong about him,

118
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:05,240
it will hurt the military's morale.

119
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,000
How about this?

120
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,160
Send someone
to keep an eye on Huitong Bank

121
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:11,879
and his other properties.

122
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,519
However, the timing is
too much of a coincidence.

123
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,480
The envoy is killed,

124
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,639
Anxi State's invasion,

125
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,680
and the assassins show up
in the capital right at this time.

126
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,290
Besides, Qin Feng was sent
to the front line,

127
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,170
which was strongly recommended
by your father.

128
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,120
Are you suspecting my father?

129
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,519
I just find that the timing
is too convenient.

130
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,600
How's Old Camel now?

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,959
Manyu is treating him.

132
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,290
The guards are watching over him.

133
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,040
Any luck with the knot?

134
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,399
Not yet.

135
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,120
I sent my men to ask around,

136
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,480
but nothing was found.

137
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,680
When I fought the murderer last time,

138
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,600
I noticed they were very skilled

139
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,959
with using this rope.

140
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,279
It seems

141
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:52,560
this person is the one
who killed Zhou Jian.

142
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,480
Do you remember

143
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:55,959
how they escaped from the inn

144
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,680
using the rope trick?

145
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,839
If we can find the leader
of the juggling troupe,

146
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,560
we might get some clues.

147
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,160
Makes sense.

148
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,319
You shouldn't push yourself.

149
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,959
Mr. Yao and I can handle this.

150
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,399
He's with me, so don't worry.

151
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,839
I know my condition well.

152
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:17,040
Besides, Father only gave us three days,

153
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,590
and your brother is on the front lines.

154
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,800
I can't rest.

155
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,439
Why did you copy my lines?

156
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,920
Master,

157
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,480
I'm incompetent.

158
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,439
I failed to kill Old Camel.

159
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,679
You are incompetent

160
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,440
not because of your failure

161
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:38,480
but because you were caught.

162
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,960
Master,

163
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,200
this old geezer almost succeeded,

164
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,600
but Crown Prince suddenly showed up.

165
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,440
He was so close to killing him too.

166
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:51,159
Please forgive him.

167
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,000
You are the fine one to talk.

168
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,190
You weren't even aware
that someone was following you.

169
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,759
If it weren't for the secretive passage
in Huitong Bank,

170
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:04,440
you would've been
in the Investigation Bureau right now.

171
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,690
I deserve a thousand death, Master.

172
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,279
Since your cover is exposed,

173
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,600
you can't stay in the capital anymore.

174
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,120
Secretly transport
these boxes of gold and silver

175
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,799
to the front lines.

176
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,440
I will persuade the imperial court
to send reinforcement.

177
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,039
Someone will contact you afterward.

178
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,399
Yes, Master.

179
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,759
If you fail this,

180
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:33,759
just kill yourselves.

181
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,210
Troupe leader,
the Investigation Bureau is on duty now.

182
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,480
Have you seen this kind of knot before?

183
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,679
I don't recognize this.

184
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,200
Sir, I have never seen a knot like this.

185
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:58,120
Do you use this knot

186
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,559
during juggling or performance?

187
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:01,519
No, we never.

188
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,159
Is there any magic trick

189
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,440
used on this knot?

190
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,000
Let me think.

191
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,399
Anxi State has a rope magic
called the rope arts.

192
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,799
However, it has become a lost art.

193
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,759
Could it make the rope stretch

194
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:17,799
or shrink?

195
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,960
Yes, that's right.

196
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,840
I didn't expect you to know
so much about magic tricks.

197
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,279
This knot

198
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,600
seems to be one from the rope art.

199
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:30,559
I only read about it in a book
when I was a kid.

200
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:31,840
If you hadn't mentioned it,

201
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,159
I would've forgotten about it.

202
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,360
All right, you may leave.

203
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,919
It seems the ghostly assassin

204
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,600
used this knot.

205
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,490
Lv Yan was also killed by this person,

206
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,919
but they

207
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,759
cleverly hid the knot.

208
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,840
Then they went to Zhou Jian

209
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,840
and told him
about Lv Yan's true identity,

210
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,240
misleading the former
into cutting off Lv Yan's head.

211
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,879
Otherwise,

212
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,039
Zhou Jian wouldn't have been killed.

213
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,039
There was only faint moonlight
in the room.

214
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,320
The body was supported by a rope

215
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,840
to remain in a seated position.

216
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,279
With one cut,

217
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,799
the rope broke.

218
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,919
In that case,

219
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:22,559
that person could return
to get back the cut rope.

220
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,039
That way,

221
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,039
even Zhou Jian would believe

222
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,559
he had killed Lv Yan,

223
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,960
then fled desperately
and was hanged later.

224
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,399
Everything adds up.

225
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,799
However, this knot
gave that person away.

226
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,080
I believe this is the truth.

227
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,639
Fortunately,

228
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,559
we cracked the case within three days

229
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,600
and didn't embarrass the Heng State.

230
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,120
I will enter the palace
and report this to Father.
