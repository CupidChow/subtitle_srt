00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,560
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,420
(Zhuxuan Abode)

4
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,320
What's wrong?

5
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,759
Why do you look upset?

6
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,880
Father said

7
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,920
he didn't expect you to solve the case.

8
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:01,280
He was very pleased.

9
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,000
You're upset just because

10
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:04,920
your father praised me?

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,920
You're so petty.

12
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,439
I'm not a child, you know?

13
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:08,959
From today onward,

14
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,439
Father will appoint you
as a special envoy.

15
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:14,840
Your role is to monitor those
who might disrupt our state.

16
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,959
If so, are you
under my disposal as well?

17
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:17,920
How could that be?

18
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm Crown Prince.

19
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:22,439
You'll be very busy in the future.

20
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:24,200
I'm worried

21
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,390
that we might not be able
to spend time together in the future.

22
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,710
Cases have been occurring
one after another

23
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:31,480
ever since I encountered you.

24
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,640
I'm worried that you might vanish
once the cases are over...

25
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,400
Don't worry.

26
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,599
I told you already.

27
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,640
I might not be able to
go back in time forever.

28
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,040
Don't worry.

29
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,719
What's wrong?

30
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,920
Did I touch your wound by accident?

31
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:47,840
Let me see.

32
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,460
The Investigative Bureau
has been keeping a close eye

33
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,439
Mr. Qin's property.

34
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,240
We found out that they were very active.

35
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,290
There seems to be
a large movement of goods.

36
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,280
Is that uncommon?

37
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,120
There are two strange points.

38
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,990
Firstly, they rarely transport their goods
during daytime.

39
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,220
Secondly, they only use
the northern city entrance.

40
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,490
And, they transport their goods
every other day.

41
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,080
According to the rules
of the city entrance,

42
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,660
two officials will keep watch
over one entrance.

43
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,320
And, they're on duty every other day.

44
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,990
Seems like they only managed
to bribe one of the officials.

45
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:50,360
That's right.

46
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,400
And, I've investigated
the official as well.

47
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,370
It seemed like he was
leading a luxurious life.

48
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:55,680
So, are you saying

49
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,800
that Feng bribed the official in charge

50
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,690
and transported his goods
outside of the city at night?

51
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,110
That should be the case.

52
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,039
If not, he wouldn't need
to be this sneaky.

53
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,479
It's simple.

54
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,080
I'll return to
Grand Chancellor's Residence tomorrow.

55
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,080
Feng isn't around anyway.

56
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,080
I'll inspect his room

57
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,280
to see if he's hiding anything.

58
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,820
(Ledger)

59
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,900
(Recipient: Butler)

60
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,600
Unfilial girl! What are you doing?

61
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:45,439
Speak!

62
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,759
Who sent you here?

63
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,040
No one sent me here.

64
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,720
Father, how could you not differentiate
between right and wrong?

65
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,839
Now, it's likely that Feng

66
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,759
is mingling with a group of rebels.

67
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,090
Aren't you going to keep him in check?

68
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,879
Even if he's framed,

69
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,000
shouldn't he stand up
and speak up for himself?

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,959
Speak up for himself?

71
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,959
Did you know
that your brother lost the battle

72
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:09,690
at the frontlines?

73
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,680
Our forces suffered a major defeat.

74
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,120
We lost three keeps in a row!

75
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,360
His Majesty is enraged.

76
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,390
He intends to capture your brother
and punish him.

77
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,480
Losing a battle warrants
the death penalty, you know?

78
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,079
Initially, I wanted him

79
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,000
to get some experience out there.

80
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:29,680
But I actually harmed him instead.

81
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,560
Father,

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,439
don't be upset first.

83
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,639
Wasn't Anxi State

84
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,560
comprised of useless fools?

85
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,990
How did they become
this powerful out of the blue?

86
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,319
For some reason,

87
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:45,279
they got their hands
on many advanced firearms.

88
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,279
Your brother and his army
weren't prepared for them at all.

89
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:52,560
If that's the case,
that's not Feng's fault.

90
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,959
I'll explain this to His Highness.

91
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,390
I'll tell him to report it
to His Majesty.

92
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:58,879
But,

93
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,079
you see,

94
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,800
we still have to deal with
the ledgers, don't you think?

95
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,790
Even if we can be spared
from the battle we lost,

96
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,160
we can't avoid this.

97
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,260
Have you gone berserk
upon checking all the ledgers?

98
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,800
Why don't you send me

99
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,879
to the Investigative Bureau as well?

100
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,079
That's not it. Father, calm down.

101
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,000
Hear me out.

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,680
Stop it!

103
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,959
Your brother and
those cunning friends of his

104
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,920
were doing some business.

105
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,480
They made a small fortune.

106
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,439
I know that.
I inspected the ledgers too.

107
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:27,920
It's nothing major.

108
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,360
But as a child of the Qin Family,

109
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:32,160
you should prioritize the Qin Family.

110
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,240
Why did you think

111
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,390
I betrothed you to
His Highness in the first place?

112
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,519
I did it so that the Qin Family

113
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:39,920
could receive some glory

114
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,580
when you become the empress
after His Highness ascends the throne!

115
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:44,480
But once your father is convicted,

116
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,000
I will be the father of a criminal.

117
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,439
You'll be the sister of a criminal.

118
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,040
The consequences will be dire!

119
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,800
This is the end of the case.

120
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,360
Did you hear me?

121
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,519
Your Highness, you're here.

122
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,399
How did it go?

123
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,759
I found Qin Feng's ledger.

124
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,390
It contained the transaction records
conducted by him and Butler.

125
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,000
It's similar to Wu Shizheng's ledger.

126
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:18,550
However, all of them are merchants who only
transported their goods at night.

127
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,279
All of these are important clues.

128
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Why do you look upset?

129
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,199
Yeah, right?

130
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,240
Father doesn't want me
to investigate the case.

131
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,800
I don't understand why.

132
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,079
Isn't it obvious?

133
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,399
Firstly,

134
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,959
you don't have any direct evidence
to prove that Mr. Qin

135
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,850
is in cahoots with
the salt-smuggling merchants.

136
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,480
Secondly,

137
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,439
your brother is in huge trouble now.

138
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,040
You should know about that.

139
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,319
I know.

140
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,800
But something feels off.

141
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,120
Where did Anxi State

142
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,600
get all these firearms all of a sudden?

143
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,320
I did an investigation.

144
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,279
Gunpowder is very costly.

145
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,890
Heng State doesn't have much either.

146
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,890
From the commodities' price increase
to the smuggling of salt

147
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,079
and your brother's property,

148
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:01,079
it's actually a huge net.

149
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,319
Their goal is to procure
a vast amount of wealth.

150
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,879
Are you saying

151
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:11,290
someone is making money for Anxi State
so that they could go to war with us?

152
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,120
That's right.

153
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,350
Now that they've made enough money,
they just lack a reason to initiate a war.

154
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,720
Therefore, Lv Yan was murdered.

155
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,800
If so, I'm sure it's not Qin Feng.

156
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,560
Why would he risk his life

157
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,439
if he knew that Anxi State

158
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,279
had procured new firearms?

159
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,480
Therefore, we have to find out

160
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,279
who's the mastermind.

161
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,000
If so, only Old Camel will know.

162
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,639
Let's go.

163
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,200
Let's go.

164
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,279
Manyu.

165
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:45,720
How is he?

166
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:47,320
He's much better now.

167
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,720
But he can't speak for too long.

168
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,879
Old mister,

169
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,120
can I ask you some questions?

170
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,200
You must be

171
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,720
Crown Prince.

172
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,159
Thank you for saving me.

173
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,990
There's no need to be courteous.

174
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,279
I heard from the envoy

175
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,919
that you delivered letters
to Lv Yan twice.

176
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,600
Where did you deliver them to?

177
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:13,720
Lv Yan?

178
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,600
It's Musi.

179
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,919
You mean Mr. Musi?

180
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,480
Regarding the two letters,

181
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,759
the first letter was delivered
to Huitong Bank in the capital.

182
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,320
The other letter was delivered
to the border salt mine.

183
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,390
To whom did you deliver the letter?

184
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,720
There was no name.

185
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:35,639
I only know that they call him Butler.

186
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,320
Have you seen Butler before, then?

187
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:42,759
No.

188
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,799
Someone else took the letter.

189
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,279
It was a seductive woman.

190
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,039
She even has her face painted as well.

191
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,919
A seductive woman, huh?

192
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,279
Seems like Butler
was the one behind everything.

193
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:06,840
I'll send my men
to bring your brother back now.

194
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,639
If he's innocent,

195
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:10,080
he should explain himself.

196
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,590
If he reveals someone important
to the case,

197
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,000
at least he can atone for his mistake.

198
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,919
Thank you

199
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,279
for helping out
that useless brother of mine.

200
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:23,399
I just don't want them
to put you on the spot.

201
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:26,240
The imperial edict has arrived.

202
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,600
Ling Xuan, Crown Prince,

203
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,559
is to bring Yao Tian
of the Investigative Bureau

204
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:35,320
and Qin Xiyue, Crown Princess,

205
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,240
to the frontlines of Anxi State

206
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,399
to investigate the defection and escape
of the main general, Qin Feng.

207
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,440
They are to escort Qin Feng
back to the capital.

208
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,279
If Crown Princess
practices favoritism,

209
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,960
she shall be convicted
of treason as well.

210
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,120
I shall receive the edict.

211
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,200
Feng actually ran away?

212
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:13,200
That useless fool.

213
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,559
At this moment,
it's better for him to die than to escape.

214
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,919
Since Qin Feng has escaped,

215
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,559
that means he fears prosecution.

216
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,360
What do you think I'll do

217
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,440
if I'm Butler?

218
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:26,879
Butler will kill him

219
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,159
and dispose of his corpse
in the wilderness.

220
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:31,600
Or maybe

221
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,320
Qin Feng didn't escape.

222
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,360
Maybe he was captured.

223
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:36,990
We have no time to waste.

224
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,519
Tell Mr. Yao and Manyu to come.

225
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,490
We'll depart immediately.

226
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,279
All right.
