1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:10,100

2
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,440
♫  Baby, come on  ♫

3
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:15,900
 Ga Du Ri Restaurant

4
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,400
Hey, do you have to take it this far?

5
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,207
Why tarot all of a sudden?

6
00:01:23,207 --> 00:01:26,039
Of course! And the line's relatively short today!

7
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:29,992
But the line is too long for just a tarot reading.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,700
I don't even stand in line for popular restaurants.

9
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,478
But your eyes are saying otherwise.

10
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:37,780
Stop that, will you?

11
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,800
What? Is the food that good here?

12
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,800
What's with this long line?

13
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:47,204
What's the best menu item here?

14
00:01:47,204 --> 00:01:50,300
Wow... Haven't you heard about this place?

15
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,494
Excuse me?

16
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,406
Heard what?

17
00:01:53,406 --> 00:01:56,500
Kind Ji Sung will tell you all about it!

18
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,800
Okay! I'm leaving.

19
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,000
Over there! Can you see the super charismatic lady over there?

20
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,939
Oh, is she the owner?

21
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:11,300
Enjoy!

22
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,800
Wow, she's prettier than most celebrities!

23
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,190
So is this place famous because she's pretty?

24
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,829
No, no, no, it's not just that!

25
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:23,850
The owner is amazing at it!

26
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,500
What? Amazing at what?

27
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,500
Tarot reading! Especially the love tarot.

28
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,100
I guess you haven't heard the news.

29
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,990
She's already famous in our campus for reading love tarot cards.

30
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,843
Right! Love tarot!

31
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:42,600
Of course, we're here because we heard about it.

32
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,500
Right? Then you must have heard about that, too!

33
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,910
The owner's specialty!

34
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,100
Oh... No...

35
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,200
What's her specialty?

36
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,500
She's a legend at keeping men dangling on the hook.

37
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,700
Why on the hook?

38
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,100
Wow! Then Ji Sung has no other choice but to tell you about it.

39
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,200
For the umpteenth time (too many to count)!

40
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,723
My cousin's friend's sister went to college with the owner.

41
00:03:13,723 --> 00:03:16,667
 Seven years ago

42
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:21,461
 And ever since entering the school until graduation,

43
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:23,348
 she was the prettiest girl on campus.

44
00:03:23,348 --> 00:03:27,200
 Every guy's first love! The Campus Goddess!

45
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,633
Hey, Du Ri!

46
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:30,712
Yes?

47
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:32,601
Why are you carrying something so heavy?

48
00:03:32,601 --> 00:03:34,500
- Then will you carry it for me? 
 - Sure.

49
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,800
 She didn't even care if they would come and go. She's the legendary goddess!

50
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Hey, Du Ri! Here you are.

51
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,500
- Impressive! 
 - Stunning!

52
00:03:55,262 --> 00:03:56,762
Hello!

53
00:03:56,762 --> 00:03:58,200
Hey there!

54
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,500
Give me your hand!

55
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,870
 Ga Du Ri

56
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,430
So why did that legendary goddess open a raw fish restaurant here?

57
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,900
Geez... After all that I've told you...

58
00:05:12,902 --> 00:05:15,081
She does more than just run this restaurant!

59
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,372
This raw fish place is just a side job!

60
00:05:17,372 --> 00:05:20,635
The main dish here is her legendary love tarot reading.

61
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,900
Pardon my memory! It isn't that great.

62
00:05:26,983 --> 00:05:29,558
Customer #17, please come in.

63
00:05:29,558 --> 00:05:31,584
Here! Ji Sung is #17!

64
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:33,200
Please come in.

65
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:37,223
There's the Ga Du Ri Special on the menu!

66
00:05:37,223 --> 00:05:41,000
Please don't forget to order it!

67
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Thank you!

68
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,960
 Ga Du Ri Restaurant

69
00:05:53,006 --> 00:05:55,759
Here! Ji Sung's special, coke cider cocktail!

70
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,121
Have a glass!

71
00:05:58,121 --> 00:05:59,255
Oh my, what's this?

72
00:05:59,255 --> 00:06:03,600
Just take a sip. It's sweet and amazing.

73
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,803
Hey, Jung Ji Sung! You're nervous, aren't you?

74
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,614
That's why you can't sit still, right?

75
00:06:11,614 --> 00:06:16,238
Geez, just confess! Just dive right into it!

76
00:06:16,238 --> 00:06:18,900
Wasn't that your plan?

77
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:28,828
That was the plan... It was...

78
00:06:28,828 --> 00:06:31,554
But I just need a little bit of affirmation.

79
00:06:31,554 --> 00:06:34,721
The affirmation from an expert!

80
00:06:34,721 --> 00:06:36,231
You're impossible!

81
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:38,302
Hey! Then what about you?

82
00:06:38,302 --> 00:06:41,600
Don't you have anything to ask her, since you're here anyway?

83
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,400
Are you interested in anyone?

84
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,000
No! I don't rely on things like tarot reading.

85
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,100
Okay, only Ji Sung gets a tarot reading today.

86
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,200
Don't you regret it.

87
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,600
Here's your raw fish platter. Please enjoy.

88
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,453
And... the table that ordered the Ga Du Ri Special...

89
00:07:04,453 --> 00:07:06,653
- Over here! 
 - Here...

90
00:07:06,653 --> 00:07:10,459
Hey! What was that?

91
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:12,469
It was by instinct...

92
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:13,403
- Here! 
 - Here!

93
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,000
Me, too! I ordered it, too!

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,080
Oh, okay.

95
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,000
Heavenly Father, Buddha, Allah, Confucius, Mencius, every single god in this universe,

96
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,200
please give me the chance to be picked by her today!

97
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,596
- Please! Let her choose me! 
 - Please!

98
00:07:29,596 --> 00:07:31,700
- Please! 
 - Please!

99
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,358
Hey, I'm so nervous. Oh... Geez!

100
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,168
I really want to get dating tips from the legend.

101
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:44,300
Why should you be nervous?

102
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:50,400
Isn't she so charismatic?

103
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,600
I'm sure she'll solve things between my boyfriend and me.

104
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,700
We're closed for today.

105
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,900
We ran out of fresh fish. I'm sorry.

106
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,300
 Oh, we've been waiting for so long.

107
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,300
Good night. Please visit again! 
  Closed.

108
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,700
 Authorized Personnel Only

109
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,300
Please follow me.

110
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,900
Come in.

111
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,600
What is your name?

112
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,510
I'm Soon Jeong. Oh Soon Jeong!

113
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,600
- Okay, Soon Jeong. What is it? 
 - What?

114
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,500
What's troubling you? Relax, let it all out.

115
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,200
What I'm curious about is...

116
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:26,300
First, pick three cards from the spread while thinking about your boyfriend.

117
00:10:53,001 --> 00:10:54,608
 Closed Early. Sold Out.

118
00:10:54,608 --> 00:10:57,200
To heck with sold out!

119
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,700
This place is sold out almost half of the week!

120
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,490
I'm never giving up.

121
00:11:07,492 --> 00:11:10,587
Maybe it was just a rumor.

122
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,662
There's nothing special about this place!

123
00:11:12,662 --> 00:11:15,154
Didn't you see those two girls sitting behind our table?

124
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:17,803
I thought they were going to the restroom, but they didn't come back.

125
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:19,526
They were chosen!

126
00:11:19,526 --> 00:11:21,962
Oh, I can't stand this.

127
00:11:21,962 --> 00:11:23,554
This won't do.

128
00:11:23,554 --> 00:11:25,354
Even if it means I have to spend the night in front of this place,

129
00:11:25,356 --> 00:11:27,400
I must meet the owner again!

130
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:32,900
Geez, please! You're embarrassing me! Let's just go, okay?

131
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,200
Come here, you!

132
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
Have you been working out?

133
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,200
That hurts! Ouch!

134
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,200
Are there any leftovers from last night?

135
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,400
I don't want store-bought raw fish for two days in a row.

136
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,800
Okay.

137
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,200
What's that?

138
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,350
 No matter how...

139
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,800
 No matter how I...

140
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,100
What the...

141
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,800
What's that noise?

142
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,400
Why is she crying so loudly?

143
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,200
Please don't cry.

144
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,700
I should have expected this with such cheap rent!

145
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,400
This is a fake wall.

146
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,020
Have you calmed down a bit?

147
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,300
I'm sorry.

148
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,246
Talking about it filled me with sorrow all of a sudden.

149
00:14:00,246 --> 00:14:04,448
My boyfriend tells me that it's just because he's busy,

150
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:07,242
but I can tell something is different.

151
00:14:07,242 --> 00:14:09,954
Something is definitely fishy.

152
00:14:09,954 --> 00:14:13,318
Can you tell me why you think that?

153
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:18,096
No matter how busy he was, he used to come over to my house every night.

154
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,950
But lately, it's been hard to reach him,

155
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:24,800
especially at night.

156
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,700
Not even a full year has passed since we started dating,

157
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,384
but I think he's already seeing another girl.

158
00:14:31,384 --> 00:14:35,200
How can I make him come back to me?

159
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,800
Why would you want that cheater to come back to you?

160
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,600
Don't waste your tears on that b*stard! That son of a b*tch!

161
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,568
 He's no better than a halibut!

162
00:14:44,568 --> 00:14:47,632
 B*stards like him should be sliced like raw fish.

163
00:14:47,632 --> 00:14:50,700
 Those kinds of b*stards are always somewhere in this world!

164
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,000
 You can't leave him be! You have to fillet him!

165
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,400
The woman next door is a weirdo (strange).

166
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,900
Let's pick your last card.

167
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,400
Is it bad?

168
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,100
"The World" card points to a new start.

169
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,900
I think something new will happen to you...

170
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,800
The room next door should be empty.

171
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,900
I guess it's under construction.

172
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,600
This will make her become quiet!

173
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,079
 Wow! How did you know that?

174
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,595
 Seong Woo and I became a campus couple in my freshman year!

175
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:16,500
The two of us and Mi So have been friends since then.

176
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,700
- Is that right? 
 - Oh? Right.

177
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,419
 I had a huge crush on him,

178
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:35,254
 and Mi So was the one who set me up with him.

179
00:16:35,254 --> 00:16:37,500
Don't they realize how late it is?

180
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,240
 "Seong Woo! Soon Jeong has a crush on you!"

181
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,730
Oh... It's driving me crazy!

182
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:47,000
So much for my precious time...

183
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,190
 When I think of how charismatic Mi So was then,

184
00:16:50,192 --> 00:16:53,300
 I feel like I should have had a crush on Mi So and not Seong Woo,

185
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,469
 right?

186
00:16:55,469 --> 00:16:59,100
 Wow, what a loyal friend you have.

187
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,900
 It's not easy to stand up for your friend like that.

188
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:51,500

189
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,193

190
00:17:57,193 --> 00:17:59,571
 How long have you been working?

191
00:17:59,571 --> 00:18:00,993
 Can I have your number?

192
00:18:00,993 --> 00:18:03,114
 She's really popular nowadays.

193
00:18:03,114 --> 00:18:04,959
 Isn't that the definition of a pervert?

194
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,347
 Hey!

195
00:18:06,347 --> 00:18:09,300
 - Look here! 
 - Look at what?

196
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,900
