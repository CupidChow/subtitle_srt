1
00:00:12,557 --> 00:00:14,757
What's all this?

2
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:29,094
- My goodness! 
 - Oh! Oh!

3
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,310
 Fila Underwear CEO, Cha Woo Bin

4
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:47,646
Why didn't you tell me? This is so embarrassing.

5
00:00:47,646 --> 00:00:50,343
I didn't get the chance.

6
00:00:50,345 --> 00:00:52,545
 Oh! I usually like to wear comfortable—

7
00:00:52,545 --> 00:00:56,218
 Twins! Right? Identical, at that!

8
00:00:58,067 --> 00:01:00,410
I'm sorry about that.

9
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,946
But you owe me an apology, too.

10
00:01:02,946 --> 00:01:04,017
What for?

11
00:01:04,017 --> 00:01:05,945
I'm probably not the only one who thought that way.

12
00:01:05,945 --> 00:01:08,840
When did you start dressing like that?

13
00:01:12,428 --> 00:01:14,559
I developed the habit since I began a job.

14
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:17,340
I wear suits at work to be polite,

15
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,840
but usually, I don't like being confined in clothes.

16
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,075
Oh! I shouldn't have imagined that.

17
00:01:39,075 --> 00:01:40,675
What did you imagine?

18
00:01:40,675 --> 00:01:42,563
Nothing.

19
00:01:43,325 --> 00:01:44,841
Then...

20
00:01:44,841 --> 00:01:50,375
That full 75B bra (34B USA) was a product from your company, right?

21
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:53,575
What about it? Did you like it?

22
00:01:54,368 --> 00:01:56,911
It did look good on you.

23
00:01:56,911 --> 00:02:00,248
I'm also sorry about misunderstanding that.

24
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:04,298
Okay. Then I'll apologize, too.

25
00:02:05,352 --> 00:02:07,090
I'm sorry!

26
00:02:12,713 --> 00:02:14,413
Here.

27
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,394
I'm sorry for some of the things that happened,

28
00:02:19,394 --> 00:02:22,060
but I'm also grateful to you for many things.

29
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,000
 Thank you :)

30
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:29,399
I'll eat it well, thank you.

31
00:02:35,037 --> 00:02:36,537
What's inside?

32
00:02:36,537 --> 00:02:39,896
My sincere apologies and thanks.

33
00:02:39,896 --> 00:02:41,696
Thanks.

34
00:02:41,696 --> 00:02:43,724
Thanks.

35
00:02:45,141 --> 00:02:46,273
What will you do now?

36
00:02:46,273 --> 00:02:49,347
I got my project proposal approved by the director because of you!

37
00:02:49,347 --> 00:02:51,583
You said you'll bring Du Ri back no matter what!

38
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,775
By what I saw yesterday, it won't be easy.

39
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:55,027
Don't worry.

40
00:02:55,027 --> 00:02:58,239
I found someone even better than her, a real big deal!

41
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,898
What? A big deal? What do you mean?

42
00:03:00,898 --> 00:03:03,698
Geez!

43
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,056
 CEO Cha Woo Bin

44
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,862
Look at this!

45
00:03:10,862 --> 00:03:13,460
That raw fish restaurant must really be popular.

46
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,203
This guy came by last night.

47
00:03:15,205 --> 00:03:19,008
He was so competent that he got job offers from companies while just a staff employee,

48
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:20,818
but he chose to stay at FILA.

49
00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:22,573
Cha Woo Bin.

50
00:03:22,573 --> 00:03:23,960
Yes, I also heard of him.

51
00:03:23,962 --> 00:03:28,267
Youngest CEO ever, very cute, plus super qualified!

52
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:30,601
How on earth are you going to convince him?

53
00:03:31,193 --> 00:03:34,693
I think something's going on between him and Du Ri.

54
00:03:34,693 --> 00:03:35,543
Really?

55
00:03:35,543 --> 00:03:37,954
He came dressed very casual.

56
00:03:37,954 --> 00:03:40,259
I almost didn't recognize him at first.

57
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:42,656
Nobody else could recognize him, but I did.

58
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:45,297
You've always had a sharp eye!

59
00:03:45,297 --> 00:03:46,752
Just trust me!

60
00:03:46,752 --> 00:03:48,985
I'll bring both of them here.

61
00:03:48,985 --> 00:03:50,330
I won't let them escape.

62
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,509
I'm really counting on you this time.

63
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:55,625
You've got to be promoted as the main writer!

64
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,706
- Like me! 
 - Like you?

65
00:03:57,706 --> 00:04:00,987
Producer Ma! You know me!

66
00:04:00,987 --> 00:04:02,840
I'm Park Hyo Jeong!

67
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,623
Yes, and I'm Ma Jong Min.

68
00:04:04,623 --> 00:04:06,834
If you can't get both, please just get one, got it?

69
00:04:06,834 --> 00:04:09,540
- Yes. 
 - You have to succeed! You got this!

70
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:25,827
 Wow... I never thought I'd live to see this part of Cha Woo Bin.

71
00:04:27,514 --> 00:04:32,062
 At this rate, he might suddenly announce that he's getting married.

72
00:04:32,068 --> 00:04:34,550
 Hello, I'm Writer Park Hyo Jeong from WBC.

73
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:39,015
Sir, your phone keeps ringing.

74
00:04:39,015 --> 00:04:42,272
It's from Writer Park Hyo Jeong of WBC.

75
00:04:42,272 --> 00:04:44,223
Who is that?

76
00:04:44,223 --> 00:04:46,023
No idea.

77
00:04:47,027 --> 00:04:49,431
"This is Park Hyo Jeong, a writer at WBC."

78
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:52,537
"I don't seem to be able to reach you."

79
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,921
 I guarantee that our show is going to be a big hit.

80
00:04:58,406 --> 00:05:01,090
 It's called "Real Dating Rehearsal."

81
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:05,046
 And I want to discuss the details in person, not over the phone.

82
00:05:05,046 --> 00:05:08,050
 As I said before, I won't go on your show!

83
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:13,237
 You did that interview for a magazine! Air time will be even better.

84
00:05:13,237 --> 00:05:16,096
 Take this chance to get some publicity!

85
00:05:16,096 --> 00:05:20,217
 I'll take this as a tentative "yes"!

86
00:05:23,254 --> 00:05:26,392
Who on earth is she?

87
00:05:26,956 --> 00:05:30,990
Excuse me... Are you Mr. Cha Woo Bin?

88
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,279
- Yes. 
 - Some lady is here for you, Sir.

89
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,428
She said she will wait at the table over there.

90
00:05:38,428 --> 00:05:39,870
A... lady?

91
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,206
She said you'll know when I tell you it's Writer Park Hyo Jeong.

92
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:48,105
Very aggressive...

93
00:05:48,105 --> 00:05:50,105
She's over there.

94
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,520
I think he's very angry.

95
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,398
I know, right?

96
00:06:10,316 --> 00:06:12,960
Writer Park Hyo Jeong of WBC, oh?

97
00:06:14,064 --> 00:06:16,179
WBC?

98
00:06:41,755 --> 00:06:43,423
- Hello? 
  - Du Ri!

99
00:06:43,423 --> 00:06:46,389
 Do you know Writer Park Hyo Jeong from WBC?

100
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:47,892
How do you know her?

101
00:06:47,892 --> 00:06:49,962
She came to our company building café.

102
00:06:49,962 --> 00:06:52,515
She's telling our CEO... No, Woo Bin

103
00:06:52,517 --> 00:06:54,386
to appear on her variety show.

104
00:06:54,386 --> 00:06:56,589
She's almost blackmailing him.

105
00:06:56,589 --> 00:06:58,666
- What? 
  - O-O-Oh, my!

106
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:02,084
I think she's mentioning your name, too!

107
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,452
 Real Dating Rehearsal

108
00:07:08,452 --> 00:07:10,341
Please take some time to read through it.

109
00:07:10,341 --> 00:07:12,732
I think you'll change your mind after reading it.

110
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:15,590
I think I made it clear that I won't go on your show.

111
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:20,655
From up close, I can tell you'll look more handsome on the screen!

112
00:07:20,655 --> 00:07:24,238
That's likely why Du Ri really suggested you for the show.

113
00:07:24,238 --> 00:07:27,670
You know Ms. Ga Du Ri, right?

114
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,049
So what about it?

115
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,865
Then again...

116
00:07:30,865 --> 00:07:33,746
Du Ri was always great at picking guys.

117
00:07:33,746 --> 00:07:38,720
That's the only reason she was able to survive when she was working for me.

118
00:07:42,746 --> 00:07:44,711
You said your name was Park Hyo Jeong, right?

119
00:07:44,711 --> 00:07:49,211
Oh, my. Do you remember my name?

120
00:07:49,211 --> 00:07:51,070
What an honor!

121
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,717
Is this the way you always work?

122
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:56,133
Pardon me?

123
00:07:56,133 --> 00:08:00,532
If you try to cast people like this, nobody will want to come on your show.

124
00:08:00,532 --> 00:08:01,832
No...

125
00:08:01,832 --> 00:08:05,660
no... look here, Mr. Cha Woo Bin,

126
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,182
isn't that rather rude?

127
00:08:08,182 --> 00:08:09,282
Oh.

128
00:08:09,282 --> 00:08:14,445
You were being rude so I decided to tell you outright, too.

129
00:08:14,445 --> 00:08:16,890
Me? Rude?

130
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:21,579
People have told me that I'm chill, but I was never called rude!

131
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:23,414
I'll tell you again.

132
00:08:23,414 --> 00:08:27,334
I will never,

133
00:08:27,334 --> 00:08:29,718
ever go on your show.

134
00:08:30,436 --> 00:08:31,695
HEY!

135
00:08:31,695 --> 00:08:33,195
Oh!

136
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,434
Just one more thing,

137
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:40,607
you don't seem to know what "chill" means.

138
00:08:42,032 --> 00:08:45,593
What you're doing right now is not being "chill,"

139
00:08:45,593 --> 00:08:49,634
but very rude!

140
00:08:49,634 --> 00:08:51,292
That's how most people think,

141
00:08:51,292 --> 00:08:53,040
and

142
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:58,575
do not go around using Ms. Ga Du Ri's name!

143
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,790
Oh! What the heck!

144
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,456
Hey, Ga Du Ri!

145
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:20,058
What is it between you and Cha Woo Bin?

146
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,929
There's nothing between us.

147
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:27,331
Wow, I can't believe you! Pretending to be innocent as always!

148
00:09:27,331 --> 00:09:31,057
You always say there's nothing, and behind my back, you're...

149
00:09:31,057 --> 00:09:33,257
He's just a neighbor.

150
00:09:33,257 --> 00:09:34,929
I guess you're a writer after all.

151
00:09:34,929 --> 00:09:37,329
You became more imaginative since then.

152
00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:39,431
Wow.

153
00:09:39,431 --> 00:09:43,364
You think you're a big deal now, right?

154
00:09:43,364 --> 00:09:46,148
I was bigger than you to begin with.

155
00:09:46,812 --> 00:09:48,207
Whatever!

156
00:09:48,207 --> 00:09:50,152
I'm not going to say this twice.

157
00:09:50,152 --> 00:09:53,604
Do whatever you can to get Cha Woo Bin or yourself to the show.

158
00:09:53,604 --> 00:09:56,960
I'm telling you all this because I'm looking out for you.

159
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,612
For your benefit.

160
00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:00,698
Okay?

161
00:10:00,698 --> 00:10:02,244
Unnie.

162
00:10:02,244 --> 00:10:04,476
Do you think I don't know you?

163
00:10:07,435 --> 00:10:11,451
 Three Years Ago

164
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,129
 Unnie Hyo Jeong.

165
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,356
 Those rumors...

166
00:10:17,356 --> 00:10:20,050
 they're really getting out of hand now.

167
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,482
 What about them?

168
00:10:23,527 --> 00:10:25,343
 Don't fuss over such a trivial thing.

169
00:10:25,345 --> 00:10:28,804
 What if Du Ri really gets fired?

170
00:10:29,632 --> 00:10:32,405
 We were the ones who started those rumors!

171
00:10:33,595 --> 00:10:36,737
 Hey, say it properly.

172
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:39,873
 It wasn't us. It was you who wrote it.

173
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:42,230
 Unnie!

174
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:44,212
 What I mean is...

175
00:10:44,212 --> 00:10:46,809
 There's no need for you to worry about it.

176
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:48,580
 It's all true.

177
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,378
 Ga Du Ri butted in when you were interested in Producer Kim of the other team,

178
00:10:52,378 --> 00:10:54,615
 and she has a bond with Woo Jin as well.

179
00:10:54,615 --> 00:10:55,676
 Am I wrong?

180
00:10:55,676 --> 00:10:58,854
 But there seemed to be nothing going on between her and Woo Jin,

181
00:10:58,854 --> 00:11:00,978
 or with Producer Kim!

182
00:11:00,978 --> 00:11:04,384
 To be exact, it was just me having a crush on him.

183
00:11:04,384 --> 00:11:08,140
 Seriously, just trust me!

184
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,109
 If you and I keep quiet,

185
00:11:11,109 --> 00:11:13,854
 no one is ever going to find out.

186
00:11:13,854 --> 00:11:15,220
 Okay?

187
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,804
 Oh, you're so cute.

188
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,600
 Geez! You're too soft-hearted.

189
00:11:52,394 --> 00:11:55,062
I'm not going on the show and neither will Mr. Cha Woo Bin.

190
00:11:55,062 --> 00:11:56,671
Don't try to use me.

191
00:11:56,671 --> 00:11:59,565
I told the producer already anyway.

192
00:11:59,565 --> 00:12:01,572
Hey!

193
00:12:02,537 --> 00:12:04,742
You've gone completely crazy, haven't you?

194
00:12:04,744 --> 00:12:05,944
No.

195
00:12:05,944 --> 00:12:09,951
I've never been more sane in my life! Now leave!

196
00:12:09,951 --> 00:12:12,691
Hey! How could you treat me like this?

197
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:15,750
Please leave. You're disrupting my business.

198
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:18,021
Goodbye.

199
00:12:18,021 --> 00:12:20,965
Hey, I'm Park Hyo Jeong! Open up!

200
00:12:20,965 --> 00:12:23,421
Hey! Aren't you even scared?

201
00:12:23,421 --> 00:12:24,268
 Oh, my! Oh, gosh!

202
00:12:24,268 --> 00:12:25,695
Oh, gosh!

203
00:12:25,697 --> 00:12:26,679
Goodbye.

204
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:27,757
Hey! You–

205
00:12:27,757 --> 00:12:28,585
She's throwing salt (to ward off evil)!

206
00:12:28,587 --> 00:12:29,476
 She must be out of her mind!

207
00:12:29,478 --> 00:12:31,378
Goodbye!

208
00:12:56,549 --> 00:12:58,390
Aren't you going home?

209
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,469
No.

210
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,700
I still have some work to do. You go ahead.

211
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,187
Sir! No, Woo Bin!

212
00:13:10,187 --> 00:13:12,418
You can just confide in me.

213
00:13:12,418 --> 00:13:14,107
What was with that writer from earlier?

214
00:13:14,107 --> 00:13:16,687
And why was she talking about Du Ri?

215
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,312
You did hold it in for quite a long time.

216
00:13:19,312 --> 00:13:20,312
I know, right?

217
00:13:20,312 --> 00:13:22,309
I, who can't stand not having answers,

218
00:13:22,312 --> 00:13:24,703
waited five hours before asking!

219
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:25,585
No.

220
00:13:25,585 --> 00:13:28,292
In fact, I've been curious for more than a week.

221
00:13:28,292 --> 00:13:30,312
What is going on between you and Du Ri?

222
00:13:30,314 --> 00:13:33,006
And why does she have your sunglasses?

223
00:13:33,006 --> 00:13:37,522
Do you know how much I restrained from asking you?

224
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,737
Do you remember that girl?

225
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:48,384
That girl from seven years ago whom I saw on the bus.

226
00:13:48,384 --> 00:13:49,734
How could I forget her?

227
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,500
She was the first girl you ever talked about.

228
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,054
Could it be...

229
00:13:59,054 --> 00:14:01,556
Is she actually Du Ri?

230
00:14:03,788 --> 00:14:05,970
- Yes. 
 - Wow!

231
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,717
Wow! I have goosebumps!

232
00:14:07,717 --> 00:14:09,301
I knew my hunch had scientific proof.

233
00:14:09,301 --> 00:14:12,140
I knew there was something special between you two!

234
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,806
What is it?

235
00:14:13,806 --> 00:14:15,242
You two are dating, right?

236
00:14:15,242 --> 00:14:16,531
You finally quit being single in life, right?

237
00:14:16,533 --> 00:14:18,017
Hey,

238
00:14:18,034 --> 00:14:19,271
it's not like that.

239
00:14:19,271 --> 00:14:20,909
What?

240
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,520
Not yet...

241
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,893
There's nothing between us yet.

242
00:14:24,893 --> 00:14:26,109
Oh!

243
00:14:26,111 --> 00:14:28,978
Cha Woo Bin, you're so crazy!

244
00:14:28,978 --> 00:14:30,740
Is there nothing yet?

245
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,040
Did I hear that right?

246
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,109
"Not yet."

247
00:14:35,111 --> 00:14:36,190
Go home now.

248
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,010
Again!

249
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,226
Say it again.

250
00:14:39,226 --> 00:14:40,570
Why aren't you going home?

251
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,400
I'll go when you go.

252
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,400
Secretary Mo, go home now.

253
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,310
- This is an order from your boss. 
 - No.

254
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,027
- Please. 
 - Goosebumps!

255
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,328
The Tower card...

256
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,568
It's all or nothing.

257
00:15:17,568 --> 00:15:20,259
Geez, this is so stressful.

258
00:15:23,077 --> 00:15:25,077
Hey, Genie.

259
00:15:25,077 --> 00:15:28,343
My tarot game is really off today.

260
00:15:28,343 --> 00:15:30,737
Can you read tarot cards for me instead?

261
00:15:30,737 --> 00:15:32,325
How's my luck tomorrow?

262
00:15:32,325 --> 00:15:35,019
 I think you've already read your cards well.

263
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:37,895
 You should brace yourself though,

264
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:43,460
 because tomorrow is that kind of day when all you've worked hard for may turn to nothing.

265
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,566
Geez, Genie! Can't you say something comforting, at least?

266
00:15:46,566 --> 00:15:47,889
 Think about it.

267
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:51,621
 Maybe it means that something could come up.

268
00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:54,970
Okay, you smarty pants.

269
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:59,005
Genie. Please clean up the house.

270
00:15:59,005 --> 00:16:00,643
 Okay.

271
00:16:26,316 --> 00:16:28,016
Excuse me.

272
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:31,417
 Ms. Ga Du Ri?

273
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:33,378
Am I hearing things?

274
00:16:33,378 --> 00:16:36,157
Gosh. Now I hear things too.

275
00:16:37,161 --> 00:16:38,461
No.

276
00:16:38,461 --> 00:16:39,996
 It's probably real.

277
00:16:39,996 --> 00:16:42,415
Oh, it's real.

278
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,378
What? Oh!

279
00:16:51,697 --> 00:16:53,835
Mr. Cha Woo Bin?

280
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:08,210
This is a fake wall so I hear everything.

281
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,271
I'm sorry.

282
00:17:10,271 --> 00:17:13,043
I really had no idea.

283
00:17:13,043 --> 00:17:15,554
You could have told me earlier.

284
00:17:15,554 --> 00:17:17,915
I was really loud, right?

285
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,700
Well... It's fine.

286
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:26,600
When I can't hear anything, it actually worries me.

287
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,138
Right...

288
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,900
Today... Nothing weird happened, right?

289
00:17:48,378 --> 00:17:50,478
No.

290
00:17:50,478 --> 00:17:51,995
Of course not.

291
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,220
How about you?

292
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:01,846
Not to me either.

293
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,500
Good job on living through another day.

294
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,204
You, too...

295
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,612
Great job.

296
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:30,910

 There was a really cute guy standing next to her.
