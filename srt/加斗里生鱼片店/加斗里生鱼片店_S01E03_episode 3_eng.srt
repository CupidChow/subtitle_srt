1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,980

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,975
He's a pervert, a total pervert!

3
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:11,888
He looks slimy just like a spoon worm (sea worm)!

4
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,131
 - Geez. 
 - Oh.

5
00:00:22,131 --> 00:00:23,776
 These are new products.

6
00:00:23,776 --> 00:00:25,513
 This is driving me nuts.

7
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,304
 Why are you just standing there?

8
00:00:30,304 --> 00:00:32,199
 Help me pick them up.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,363
 Me? These? With you?

10
00:00:36,363 --> 00:00:39,065
 Yes, who else is here?

11
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,634
 Who would wear this?

12
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,630
 Hold on!

13
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,284
 Stay like that just for a moment.

14
00:01:00,284 --> 00:01:02,104
 What? Stay like what—

15
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:03,335
 Oh...

16
00:01:03,335 --> 00:01:05,357
 So that's what it would look like.

17
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,188
 You're a full 75B (34B USA), right?

18
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,382
 Gosh! You pervert!

19
00:01:14,382 --> 00:01:16,445
 Nice catch.

20
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,261
 Oh! Oh, no!

21
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,690
 Okay!

22
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,321
 Oh, my!

23
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,776
 I wear a 90C (40C USA).

24
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,344
She's doing it again!

25
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,120
♫ I'll sweep, sweep everything away

26
00:02:06,122 --> 00:02:07,753
♫ I'll sweep, sweep away

27
00:02:07,755 --> 00:02:10,245
♫ I'll sweep, sweep everything away

28
00:02:11,245 --> 00:02:13,868
♫  Because it's different now

29
00:02:13,868 --> 00:02:17,516
♫  Because I know and I’ve seen it all

30
00:02:17,516 --> 00:02:21,258
♫ I'll sweep, sweep everything away. Sweep, sweep away

31
00:02:21,258 --> 00:02:24,794
♫ I'll sweep, sweep everything away

32
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,209
Night after night, what's wrong with her?

33
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,150
Oh, no!

34
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,050
♫  Be jealous all you want cause I’ll be the best

35
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:45,494
♫  I'm off to the sky like a ray of light

36
00:02:45,494 --> 00:02:46,995
Yes, wow!

37
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:53,380
♫  I'll sweep, sweep everything away

38
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,159
♫ Because I know it all now

39
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:58,372
I have seen it all!

40
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,890
♫  I'll sweep, sweep away

41
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,950
 Ga Du Ri: phone number

42
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,252
That woman

43
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:08,640
is such trouble for the whole neighborhood!

44
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,570
♫  Blow everything away.

45
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,960
♫   I’ll begin anew

46
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,708
I thought she would stop after singing one song.

47
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,086
I didn't expect her to sing all night long.

48
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,358
Thank goodness, it's the weekend.

49
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,887
 Geez...

50
00:03:49,887 --> 00:03:52,785
 I'm running into that pervert early in the morning.

51
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,063
Do you live in this building?

52
00:04:04,063 --> 00:04:05,674
On the second floor?

53
00:04:05,674 --> 00:04:07,506
It's been vacant for quite some time.

54
00:04:07,506 --> 00:04:10,381
Yes, I moved in last week.

55
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,991
Oh!

56
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,830
Your restaurant will be open today, right?

57
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:18,967
Yes.

58
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,640
Probably.

59
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,564
Seriously, where are his manners?

60
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,255
 Unnie.

61
00:04:42,255 --> 00:04:45,188
 Oh Soon Jeong: I debated it all last night.

62
00:04:45,188 --> 00:04:47,630
 I don't know if I can do it well,

63
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,681
 but I'm going to talk to them in person.

64
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:53,610
 I don't know about that b*stard who ran away,

65
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,351
 but Mi So is a friend like no other.

66
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,138
A friend like no other...

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,676
Friends...

68
00:05:03,676 --> 00:05:05,379
They're nice to have.

69
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,001
 Seven years ago

70
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:12,194
 Hey, Woo Joo.

71
00:05:12,194 --> 00:05:13,889
 What should we have for dinner?

72
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,400
 Well, I'm fine with anything.

73
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,000
 What do you want to have, Du Ri?

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,984
 Well...

75
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,781
 Maybe freshly made Tteokbokki (spicy rice pasta).

76
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:24,817
 Or freshly made Tteokbokki.

77
00:05:24,817 --> 00:05:27,251
 Or freshly made Tteokbokki.

78
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,403
 What a wide range of options to choose from!

79
00:05:30,403 --> 00:05:32,763
 Why not? You also like Tteokbokki.

80
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:34,623
 Are you saying no?

81
00:05:34,623 --> 00:05:35,613
 No.

82
00:05:35,613 --> 00:05:37,535
 I love the idea.

83
00:05:37,535 --> 00:05:38,896
 Yes? Wait a minute.

84
00:05:38,896 --> 00:05:40,542
 I'll look for Tteokbokki places.

85
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,785
 Hey, Du Ri, look here.

86
00:06:04,785 --> 00:06:06,788
 Wow, I look great there.

87
00:06:06,788 --> 00:06:08,775
 You're the best photographer ever.

88
00:06:08,775 --> 00:06:09,825
 Shall I take more photos?

89
00:06:09,825 --> 00:06:11,122
 No, it's fine.

90
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:13,258
 Why do you take photos of me all the time?

91
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,466
 Hey, that's because you're pretty.

92
00:06:15,466 --> 00:06:16,889
 I'm telling the truth.

93
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:18,432
 I heard it's true

94
00:06:18,432 --> 00:06:19,951
 that Ga Du Ri is pretty.

95
00:06:19,951 --> 00:06:21,372
 Oppa!

96
00:06:21,372 --> 00:06:22,865
 I thought you had one more class today!

97
00:06:22,865 --> 00:06:24,178
 - Did I surprise you? 
 - Yes.

98
00:06:24,178 --> 00:06:25,969
 The class was canceled suddenly.

99
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,364
 I found this on my way here.

100
00:06:29,364 --> 00:06:31,008
 Thanks!

101
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,249
 - Do you like it? 
 - Yes.

102
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,015
 - It doesn't have a scent. 
 - No, it doesn't.

103
00:06:37,015 --> 00:06:38,641
 That's my love and consideration for you.

104
00:06:38,641 --> 00:06:39,744
 Hey, Woo Joo! Right now!

105
00:06:39,744 --> 00:06:41,188
 Please take a photo of us.

106
00:06:41,188 --> 00:06:42,383
 Oh...

107
00:06:42,383 --> 00:06:43,687
 Sure, I will.

108
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,720
 Okay, I'll take it now.

109
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,517
 One, two, three.

110
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,641
To heck with friends!

111
00:06:56,641 --> 00:06:57,964
To heck with friendships!

112
00:06:57,964 --> 00:07:00,290
Sounds just as ridiculous as an inflating flatfish!

113
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,360
 Oh Soon Jeong:

114
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,521
 Thank you again

115
00:07:14,521 --> 00:07:18,934
 for worrying about it as if it were your own problem.

116
00:07:18,934 --> 00:07:21,181
 Where are you going to meet her?

117
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,334
Geez, I should have filleted that halibut!

118
00:07:32,195 --> 00:07:35,207
 Seven years ago

119
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,389
 I'm sorry.

120
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,540
 I mean...

121
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:45,288
 Are you saying we should break up because of that reason?

122
00:07:45,288 --> 00:07:49,867
 I know it doesn't make sense but in one way, it does.

123
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:51,686
 Because of the tarot reading?

124
00:07:51,686 --> 00:07:53,983
 Are we breaking up just because of that?

125
00:07:53,983 --> 00:07:55,382
 Just because?

126
00:07:55,382 --> 00:07:56,457
 For my family

127
00:07:56,457 --> 00:07:59,718
 this is a really important issue, especially for my mom.

128
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,780
 But it doesn't make any sense.

129
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,834
 Who breaks up because of a tarot reading? I never heard such a thing!

130
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:10,507
 My mom said

131
00:08:10,507 --> 00:08:12,449
 tarot reading is a field of study, like statistics.

132
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:14,461
 Who cares if it's a field of study?

133
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,460
 Are you saying we must break up

134
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,299
 because of that statistic?

135
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:21,231
 Can you accept that?

136
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:22,476
 Then what should I do?

137
00:08:22,476 --> 00:08:24,940
 Do you want me to die while seeing you?

138
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,026
 Who says you're going to die?

139
00:08:26,051 --> 00:08:28,200
 Why would you die by dating me?

140
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,674
 My mom says so!

141
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,244
 She saw a fortune teller about our marital compatibility.

142
00:08:36,244 --> 00:08:38,340
 They said I'll die soon if I keep seeing you.

143
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,093
 And that fortune teller is really famous.

144
00:08:40,093 --> 00:08:41,996
 Every fortune teller that my mom visited

145
00:08:41,996 --> 00:08:43,456
 said the same thing.

146
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,534
 Hey, they say that's our fate. What can I do?

147
00:08:45,534 --> 00:08:47,145
 Should I just die?

148
00:08:49,783 --> 00:08:51,651
 Woo Joo

149
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,093
 My mom's calling me.

150
00:08:59,093 --> 00:09:00,395
 You've nothing to say, right?

151
00:09:00,395 --> 00:09:01,926
 Bye.

152
00:09:01,926 --> 00:09:04,110
 Oppa!

153
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,720
 I mean... Oppa!

154
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,031
 - Hey, Woo Joo. 
 - Oppa!

155
00:09:08,031 --> 00:09:10,075
 - I'm on my way. 
 - Where are you going?

156
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,653
 Oppa!

157
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,741
You said you have something to say.

158
00:09:22,741 --> 00:09:24,006
Say it quickly.

159
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,800
Why are you sitting there... so proud of yourself?

160
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,469
I'm the only person here who deserves to be proud.

161
00:09:33,469 --> 00:09:36,064
What is the reason not to be proud?

162
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,197
What?

163
00:09:37,197 --> 00:09:39,347
I was going to tell you everything!

164
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,050
I was just waiting for the right time.

165
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,763
The right time?

166
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,461
Mi So, do you agree with him?

167
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,517
I'm sorry.

168
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,613
I...

169
00:10:00,613 --> 00:10:02,515
I thought...

170
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,194
Maybe, just maybe...

171
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,201
Because you never know...

172
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:11,976
If you start crying again, I'll just leave.

173
00:10:11,976 --> 00:10:14,769
Do you know how annoying you were when you cried like that?

174
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:16,667
That's exactly why we couldn't tell you.

175
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:19,288
Is this something you can resolve by telling me?

176
00:10:19,288 --> 00:10:21,563
I'm just not into you anymore. What can you do about it?

177
00:10:21,563 --> 00:10:23,610
You thought I was...

178
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,130
Was I going to marry you or something?

179
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,674
Stop it.

180
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,189
I thought...

181
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,285
I just thought...

182
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,739
I just knew it!

183
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,032
Hi, we meet again.

184
00:10:45,032 --> 00:10:47,658
You're Bang Seong Woo, right?

185
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,761
Let go of me!

186
00:10:52,761 --> 00:10:55,323
Oh! Want me to let go of you?

187
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,114
Do you think I'll let this slide?

188
00:10:59,114 --> 00:11:00,628
I'll report this to the police–

189
00:11:00,628 --> 00:11:02,100
Go ahead, report me.

190
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,037
Before that, let's stop by FILA Underwear.

191
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,212
Would you like to be humiliated at your workplace?

192
00:11:09,212 --> 00:11:11,861
A-Are you threatening me?

193
00:11:11,861 --> 00:11:13,224
Threatening you?

194
00:11:13,224 --> 00:11:15,397
No, I was simply asking.

195
00:11:15,397 --> 00:11:17,225
You f**king–

196
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:23,343
Hey!

197
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,756
You... look the best like that.

198
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,679
Let's go, Du Ri.

199
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,194
Soon Jeong!

200
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,574
I'm sorry.

201
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,136
It was hard for me, too.

202
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,228
Deal with it...

203
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,091
alone.

204
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,182
 Ga Du Ri Restaurant

205
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,130
Hello.

206
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,429
I'd like a dish of raw flatfish to go.

207
00:12:31,429 --> 00:12:32,461
To take out.

208
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:33,783
Oh, okay.

209
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,182
Raw flatfish.

210
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,960
Well, a customer is a customer.

211
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,398
Wow...

212
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,056
Is he even drawing stars on them now?

213
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,609
Will it be a test, or what?

214
00:13:02,609 --> 00:13:04,582
He's acting like a pervert in public now.

215
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,010
Why are you craving raw fish all of a sudden?

216
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,963
You don't even eat it that often.

217
00:13:34,963 --> 00:13:36,950
- Why? Don't you feel like eating it? 
 - Hello!

218
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,437
No, I'm fine with anything.

219
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,720
 Ex-boyfriend, the mama's boy.

220
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,107
 Ex-best friend, who stole him from me.

221
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,021
 In addition, the next-door pervert.

222
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,210
 No need to watch crazy dramas on TV.

223
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:34,493
 Oh... I want to go home.

224
00:14:34,493 --> 00:14:37,509

225

226
00:14:47,258 --> 00:14:49,411
 We're getting married next month.

227
00:14:49,411 --> 00:14:50,565
 Congratulations.

228
00:14:50,565 --> 00:14:53,791
 I knew you would congratulate us.

229
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,565
 What a traitor!

230
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,107
 How can you deceive even me?

231
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:03,144
 You have someone to bring as your date, right?

232
00:15:03,144 --> 00:15:04,488
 Darling, who is she?

233
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,133
 I'm Cha Woo Bin.

234
