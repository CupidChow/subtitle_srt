1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,070

2
00:00:10,957 --> 00:00:13,507
I didn't know we would run into each other like this.

3
00:00:13,507 --> 00:00:16,093
Have you been well, Du Ri?

4
00:00:16,761 --> 00:00:18,462
Yes. It's been a while.

5
00:00:18,462 --> 00:00:20,993
- How about you? 
 - I've been doing great.

6
00:00:20,993 --> 00:00:22,943
You look great, too.

7
00:00:22,943 --> 00:00:26,481
What? Yes, it's been a while, Du Ri.

8
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:27,777
Hey, Du Ri,

9
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:30,700
we're getting married next month.

10
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,295
I was thinking of inviting you.

11
00:00:34,295 --> 00:00:37,200
Oh! I think I have a wedding invitation here somewhere.

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,470
Hey...

13
00:00:39,471 --> 00:00:41,055
Congratulations.

14
00:00:41,055 --> 00:00:42,455
Wow...

15
00:00:42,455 --> 00:00:46,053
I knew you would congratulate us.

16
00:00:46,053 --> 00:00:47,685
Thanks.

17
00:00:47,685 --> 00:00:51,312
Are you... married?

18
00:00:52,691 --> 00:00:53,791
Oh, my!

19
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:56,210
Is this your restaurant?

20
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,493
It said "Ga Du Ri Restaurant."

21
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:01,045
Is it yours?

22
00:01:01,045 --> 00:01:02,014
Correct.

23
00:01:02,016 --> 00:01:03,916
Do you want something to eat?

24
00:01:05,522 --> 00:01:07,219
I thought that if you opened a restaurant,

25
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:09,912
you would sell fast tteokbokki or something like that.

26
00:01:09,912 --> 00:01:12,156
You loved it.

27
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:15,148
We both loved it.

28
00:01:15,148 --> 00:01:18,154
Yes, you both... loved it.

29
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,245
We will sit down. Hey, Woo Joo!

30
00:01:29,245 --> 00:01:30,759
Hey!

31
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:32,857
Sorry! We'll come back later.

32
00:01:32,857 --> 00:01:36,069
Woo Joo! Hey, Woo Joo!

33
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:37,624
Hey! Woo Joo!

34
00:02:06,986 --> 00:02:08,786
Excuse me!

35
00:02:13,161 --> 00:02:14,861
Hey there!

36
00:02:18,134 --> 00:02:20,239
Is my order ready yet?

37
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,439
Oh, I'm sorry!

38
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:23,806
I'll be right back with your order!

39
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,002
Here you go.

40
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,746
 Seven years ago

41
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:02,887
 What if someone sees us?

42
00:03:42,059 --> 00:03:44,039
 Look over there.

43
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,867
 She's crying.

44
00:03:45,867 --> 00:03:47,283
 What? Why is she crying?

45
00:03:47,283 --> 00:03:49,751
 Did she get dumped?

46
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:52,042
 Do you not feel well?

47
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:15,418
Don't you think this lacks proper form?

48
00:04:15,418 --> 00:04:16,773
It will cave in easily.

49
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:21,343
I think the straps are too tight.

50
00:04:21,343 --> 00:04:23,885
I'll go check with the development team.

51
00:04:23,885 --> 00:04:25,934
Oh, you know

52
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:28,564
the writer we met back then.

53
00:04:28,564 --> 00:04:29,381
Oh...

54
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:31,275
Have you contacted her yet?

55
00:04:31,275 --> 00:04:32,058
No.

56
00:04:32,058 --> 00:04:33,350
She's not normal.

57
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,859
Pardon? What do you mean?

58
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,122
Oh, well,

59
00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:39,668
I have my reasons.

60
00:04:39,668 --> 00:04:40,509
Yes, Sir!

61
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:43,684
Then should I contact the first model from the previous five candidates?

62
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:45,567
Inform me when you fix the date for the photo shoot.

63
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:48,960
Of course! Then I'll drop by the development team!

64
00:05:01,482 --> 00:05:03,703
Pretending to be all right...

65
00:05:41,318 --> 00:05:43,858
I've sliced up so many of them.

66
00:06:44,552 --> 00:06:45,983
 This bus is returning to the garage.

67
00:06:45,985 --> 00:06:48,483
 Please get off and take the next bus.

68
00:07:13,426 --> 00:07:15,431
I don't know whose cap this is,

69
00:07:15,431 --> 00:07:17,773
but it really comes in handy.

70
00:07:32,222 --> 00:07:34,563
When will you stop following me?

71
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,108
And when will you stop dressing like me?

72
00:07:38,108 --> 00:07:40,528
Even if I try, I lack that 2%.

73
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:42,099
It's not a cartoon where nerds change into cute guys.

74
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:43,761
Are you really the same person?

75
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:45,751
You're the very definition of a casual lounger.

76
00:07:45,751 --> 00:07:47,430
I still have a long way to go

77
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,712
if I want to be like you.

78
00:07:48,712 --> 00:07:50,006
I'll try harder to catch up to you.

79
00:07:50,008 --> 00:07:51,828
Stop following me now.

80
00:07:51,828 --> 00:07:53,350
It's over twenty minutes since work ended.

81
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:56,478
Hey, don't be so distant!

82
00:07:56,478 --> 00:07:58,610
Are you really going home just like that?

83
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,010
How many times must I tell you?

84
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:04,053
You're not supposed to meet colleagues after work hours.

85
00:08:08,545 --> 00:08:09,470
Seriously!

86
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,641
I can't take this anymore!

87
00:08:12,282 --> 00:08:13,694
Am I just a co-worker?

88
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:15,935
Let's go out for a-a-a drink!

89
00:08:16,883 --> 00:08:17,883
I...

90
00:08:17,885 --> 00:08:19,891
was dumped again!

91
00:08:19,891 --> 00:08:21,002
Oh?

92
00:08:21,004 --> 00:08:22,041
Woo Bin!

93
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,439
Woo Bin!

94
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,657
Don't go!

95
00:08:24,657 --> 00:08:26,217
I can't let you go!

96
00:08:26,217 --> 00:08:29,692
Please drink with your heartbroken friend

97
00:08:29,692 --> 00:08:32,392
and comfort him.

98
00:08:32,392 --> 00:08:34,200
Tae Kyung

99
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,717
wants to

100
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:38,180
drink with Woo Bin.

101
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,504
Please?

102
00:08:43,504 --> 00:08:45,374
Really?

103
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:49,703
Bye. See you tomorrow.

104
00:08:51,071 --> 00:08:52,171
Are you really going?

105
00:08:52,171 --> 00:08:53,607
Just like that?

106
00:08:53,607 --> 00:08:54,740
Hyung (older brother, male friend)!

107
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,455
Hyung! Hyung!

108
00:08:56,455 --> 00:08:59,694
HYUNG!

109
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,950
 Ga Du Ri Restaurant

110
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,847
Welcome–

111
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,139
You have time to talk with me, right?

112
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:17,405
There aren't any customers yet.

113
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,129
What's up?

114
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,499
This.

115
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:29,319
Most people from college know about us three

116
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,383
so you probably can't make it.

117
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,000
But I wanted to give this to you no matter what.

118
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,980
There's no reason for me not to attend

119
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,749
if you're being sincere about inviting me.

120
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,006
So are you not going to take this?

121
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,960
Leave it there.

122
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,547
You have someone to bring as your date, right?

123
00:10:07,547 --> 00:10:09,522
It can't be that you're still single.

124
00:10:09,522 --> 00:10:14,589
You're the Ga Du Ri whom every guy pursued back in school.

125
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:15,571
No way.

126
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:18,245
Yes, I mean, the tarot prediction was that you'd be popular with guys.

127
00:10:18,245 --> 00:10:20,839
That's why when my mother-in-law went to the fortune teller–

128
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,182
Oh!

129
00:10:23,182 --> 00:10:24,752
My mistake.

130
00:10:24,752 --> 00:10:27,460
That was going too far, right?

131
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,160
Sorry!

132
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,709
Darling,

133
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:35,221
who is she?

134
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,841
 What is the...

135
00:10:38,841 --> 00:10:40,128
 What's wrong with this pervert?

136
00:10:40,128 --> 00:10:41,579
Is he...

137
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:44,467
your boyfriend?

138
00:10:48,673 --> 00:10:51,792
Hey, Sweetie. Did you get off work?

139
00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:53,750
Say hello. This is Yeo Woo Joo.

140
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,852
This is my boyfriend...

141
00:10:55,852 --> 00:10:57,430
and his name is...

142
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,914
 Oh, sh*t... What's his name?

143
00:10:59,914 --> 00:11:00,979
 What is it?

144
00:11:00,979 --> 00:11:02,481
I'm Cha Woo Bin.

145
00:11:02,481 --> 00:11:03,983
This is Woo Bin.

146
00:11:03,985 --> 00:11:06,578
Even his name is so cool, right?

147
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:36,614
How long have you been seeing Du Ri?

148
00:11:36,614 --> 00:11:38,623
- A long– 
 - Not for long–

149
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,142
Looks like it, right?

150
00:11:41,142 --> 00:11:42,752
We're still very affectionate.

151
00:11:42,752 --> 00:11:43,553
Don't even mention it.

152
00:11:43,553 --> 00:11:45,655
We're crazy about each other.

153
00:11:45,655 --> 00:11:47,724
Oh...

154
00:11:47,724 --> 00:11:49,282
Is that so?

155
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,205
Did you think I can't track you if you left me like that?

156
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,892
So this is...

157
00:12:17,965 --> 00:12:19,365
Secretary Mo.

158
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:21,825
What brings you here?

159
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,436
Oh, oh!

160
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,400
Sir, I need you to confirm something.

161
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,369
You shouldn't have left work in such a hurry.

162
00:12:35,369 --> 00:12:36,249
Oh, my!

163
00:12:36,251 --> 00:12:40,622
My baby must have missed me a lot!

164
00:12:40,622 --> 00:12:42,989
Go ahead, hurry back!

165
00:12:42,989 --> 00:12:44,586
Oh... Oh!

166
00:12:44,586 --> 00:12:49,142
Oh, so you're his girlfriend!

167
00:12:49,142 --> 00:12:51,055
I've heard a lot about you.

168
00:12:51,055 --> 00:12:53,222
Great to meet you in person.

169
00:12:53,222 --> 00:12:54,700
I'm CEO Cha's secretary,

170
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,388
Mo Tae Kyung.

171
00:12:58,754 --> 00:13:01,470
I'll be right back.

172
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,867
I hope to see you again.

173
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,702
Look at your boyfriend and his secretary's outfits!

174
00:13:28,021 --> 00:13:29,325
 Mother-in-law

175
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,056
Hello, Mother-in-law?

176
00:13:32,056 --> 00:13:34,745
I'll be right there!

177
00:13:34,745 --> 00:13:38,569
He just wanted me to go get something.

178
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:46,331
See you at my wedding.

179
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,591
What were you doing?

180
00:14:07,773 --> 00:14:08,773
Wow!

181
00:14:08,773 --> 00:14:10,158
I knew it!

182
00:14:10,158 --> 00:14:12,099
I knew you were hiding something.

183
00:14:12,099 --> 00:14:14,031
This is why you've been so eager to get off work.

184
00:14:14,031 --> 00:14:18,322
She's... that... writer from WBC. The one who gave you her number!

185
00:14:18,322 --> 00:14:19,520
Since when?

186
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,327
When did you start seeing her?

187
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:22,573
Hold on!

188
00:14:22,573 --> 00:14:23,524
Wow!

189
00:14:23,526 --> 00:14:24,526
Oh, wow!

190
00:14:24,528 --> 00:14:27,128
Did you lie about never having dated anyone

191
00:14:27,128 --> 00:14:29,178
and met girls behind my back like this?

192
00:14:29,178 --> 00:14:30,531
It's not like that.

193
00:14:30,531 --> 00:14:32,286
What a traitor!

194
00:14:32,286 --> 00:14:33,966
How can you deceive even me?

195
00:14:33,966 --> 00:14:35,627
Who's the other girl?

196
00:14:35,627 --> 00:14:38,058
Oh! In addition, a love triangle?

197
00:14:38,058 --> 00:14:39,474
Right? Right?

198
00:14:39,474 --> 00:14:42,465
As soon as I walked in, I knew what was going on!

199
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,610
I told you, it's not like that.

200
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,967
Shall we...

201
00:14:48,967 --> 00:14:51,102
have a drink today

202
00:14:51,102 --> 00:14:52,483
at that place

203
00:14:52,483 --> 00:14:54,800
with your girlfriend?

204
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,930
Just the three of us!

205
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,632
Let's have a drink!

206
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,750
I'm in trouble.

207
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,074
Let's talk tomorrow.

208
00:15:10,074 --> 00:15:12,086
I'm leaving.

209
00:15:12,086 --> 00:15:14,547
Hey, Hyung! I will really get sulky!

210
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:16,803
You know I can sulk for weeks, right?

211
00:15:16,803 --> 00:15:18,985
Hyung! Hyung!

212
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:21,077
Hey! Cha Woo Bin!

213
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,248
Yes, thank you.

214
00:15:27,248 --> 00:15:28,272
We want to order.

215
00:15:28,272 --> 00:15:29,074
Yes.

216
00:15:29,074 --> 00:15:31,999
We want a raw fish platter.

217
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:44,008
 Those sunglasses...

218
00:15:54,990 --> 00:16:04,970

219
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,920

220

♫  Will my tears stop?  ♫

221
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:27,260
♫  Can I become happy? Oh  ♫

222
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:31,410
♫  I want to see you, just for today  ♫

223
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:39,300
♫  And laugh like this  ♫

224

 Episode 5 Preview

228
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,170
♫  Even lame jokes  ♫

229
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:59,925
 Why am I the only one in the dark?

230
00:16:59,925 --> 00:17:01,475
 Is it the Wheel of Fortune?

231
00:17:01,475 --> 00:17:03,031
 More like the Wheel of Craziness!

232
00:17:03,031 --> 00:17:04,194
 For seven years...

233
00:17:04,194 --> 00:17:05,747
 Has she kept it all these years?

234
00:17:05,747 --> 00:17:07,231
 You might be able to fool everyone else,

235
00:17:07,231 --> 00:17:08,686
 but you can't fool me.

236
00:17:08,686 --> 00:17:10,388
 Don't you know me?

237
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,305
 It's mine, right?
