1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,090

2
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:17,309
That's not my alarm...

3
00:01:22,915 --> 00:01:24,124
Geez...

4
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,202
Wake up!

5
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,820
It's the morning!

6
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,501
What's with the construction since yesterday?

7
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:52,789
Day and night!

8
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,210
CEO. 
  Charlotte (lingerie model)

9
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,462
Here are the profiles for the VR model candidates.

10
00:03:04,462 --> 00:03:06,485
The marketing team conducted an internal meeting

11
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:09,210
and selected five candidates.

12
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,410
How about that model?

13
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,677
She's really popular nowadays.

14
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,058
Isn't she too sexy?

15
00:03:17,058 --> 00:03:19,745
Is that right? She's also my favorite!

16
00:03:19,745 --> 00:03:21,926
I said, "Too sexy."

17
00:03:21,926 --> 00:03:23,662
Excuse me?

18
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,256
Who are our main clients?

19
00:03:25,256 --> 00:03:28,591
Ladies who think about what underwear to put on every day.

20
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:32,727
If the model is too sexy, it may seem slightly overbearing,

21
00:03:32,727 --> 00:03:33,603
and...

22
00:03:33,605 --> 00:03:35,324
what's the theme of our brand?

23
00:03:35,324 --> 00:03:40,317
Underwear that always makes you feel comfortable, natural, and relaxed.

24
00:03:40,317 --> 00:03:44,269
Exactly. We need that kind of a model.

25
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:48,850
Someone bubbly, energetic and radiates healthy vibes,

26
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,347
while also being someone who makes people's heads turn to look.

27
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,300
Yes, Sir. I'll do more research and get back to you.

28
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,160
 CEO (Chief Executive officer)

29
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,720
♫  Baby, come on  ♫

30
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,096
 She's taking forever in the restroom.

31
00:04:50,096 --> 00:04:51,669
 Why isn't she coming?

32
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:53,434
 Ms. Mi So,

33
00:04:53,434 --> 00:04:57,473
 do you have Soon Jeong's boyfriend's number,

34
00:04:57,473 --> 00:04:58,765
 by any chance?

35
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:01,284
 What? Why do you ask?

36
00:05:01,284 --> 00:05:04,016
 Well, Soon Jeong said you three are close friends.

37
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:06,670
 Oh, right.

38
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,067
 I guess I do have his number.

39
00:05:08,067 --> 00:05:11,955
 Or do you know where he works?

40
00:05:11,955 --> 00:05:17,141
 Oh, well, an underwear company or something.

41
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:18,852
 Is that so?

42
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:21,003
 Do you have a picture of him?

43
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:24,016
 Don't you?

44
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,300
 Oppa Seong Woo

45
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,640
 You can take the call!

46
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,571
 No, I can take it later.

47
00:06:14,054 --> 00:06:18,538
 The guy with his hair slicked back is Seong Woo.

48
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:22,713
 He always carries a tablet.

49
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:28,214
He must be full of himself.

50
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:36,329
Hello!

51
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:39,311
I'm a writer for WBC's show, Love Naggers.

52
00:06:39,311 --> 00:06:43,355
Oh! I know that show! I watch it all the time.

53
00:06:43,355 --> 00:06:45,891
Wow, you're really pretty.

54
00:06:46,895 --> 00:06:49,287
It's a TV show. It's a reality show about dating.

55
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,600
I'm so honored that you know about our show!

56
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,053
I was wondering if you could answer a survey for us, if you have some time.

57
00:06:58,053 --> 00:07:01,989
It's how men aged 20-39 think of dating and their ideal types.

58
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:03,304
It won't take long.

59
00:07:03,304 --> 00:07:05,363
Please write your name and contact details here,

60
00:07:05,363 --> 00:07:08,356
and feel free to ask me any questions you may have.

61
00:07:15,304 --> 00:07:17,495
 Sexy...

62
00:07:17,495 --> 00:07:21,467
 cute and youthful.

63
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,699
How long have you been working?

64
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,221
Three years. Why do you ask?

65
00:07:30,221 --> 00:07:32,393
Can I have your number?

66
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,685
Excuse me?

67
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,147
What's wrong with him?

68
00:07:52,147 --> 00:07:56,898
Why hasn't he called me yet? He should be calling me right away when he got my number.

69
00:08:01,555 --> 00:08:06,904
Geez, cute guys always play hard to get!

70
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,009
 Oh Soon Jeong: Hey, are you busy?

71
00:08:14,755 --> 00:08:16,023
 Don't you have anything, Mi So?

72
00:08:16,023 --> 00:08:18,297
 Excuse me? Have what?

73
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:21,553
 Well, is there anything you want to know or ask me?

74
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,660
 I said I'm not interested. I'm just here for her.

75
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,538
 Come on, just pick a card.

76
00:08:44,487 --> 00:08:46,197
 "The Fool."

77
00:08:46,197 --> 00:08:48,058
 It's "The Fool" card.

78
00:08:48,058 --> 00:08:50,854
 Top side up, it means an innocent

79
00:08:50,854 --> 00:08:53,045
 and free spirit.

80
00:08:53,047 --> 00:08:56,602
 But upside down like this...

81
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:59,600
 it's not very good.

82
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,878
 A liar,

83
00:09:00,878 --> 00:09:03,107
 two-faced,

84
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:06,738
 and foolish, that's how it's interpreted.

85
00:09:06,738 --> 00:09:08,789
 Excuse me? What are you saying?

86
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:41,624
 One minute until end of work.

87
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:47,576
Aren't you going home?

88
00:09:47,576 --> 00:09:49,569
Can't you see that I'm about to leave?

89
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:51,574
Then I'm going with you.

90
00:09:51,574 --> 00:09:54,316
I don't meet co-workers after work.

91
00:09:54,316 --> 00:09:56,983
We're not just co-workers.

92
00:09:56,983 --> 00:09:59,807
Why are you always so busy?

93
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,858
 Yes, I'm off work.

94
00:10:01,858 --> 00:10:05,355
 Okay, Babe. I'll be coming over.

95
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,418
Is there anything you want to eat?

96
00:10:06,418 --> 00:10:08,199
He's the really busy one.

97
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:11,320
Who is it this time? His baby talk became worse.

98
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,006
I heard she's much younger. He knew her back in college.

99
00:10:15,006 --> 00:10:17,814
Wasn't his ex-girlfriend also from his college days?

100
00:10:17,814 --> 00:10:20,835
- It wouldn't be... 
 - The same person.

101
00:10:20,835 --> 00:10:23,549
What a busy guy.

102
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:25,202
So?

103
00:10:25,202 --> 00:10:26,580
Are you jealous?

104
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,182
No! Of course not.

105
00:10:29,182 --> 00:10:30,820
Don't be jealous of that.

106
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,614
It won't last long.

107
00:10:32,614 --> 00:10:35,764
I don't want to hear it from you, Sir.

108
00:10:35,764 --> 00:10:38,985
I didn't take a break from dating as long as you have.

109
00:10:38,985 --> 00:10:41,975
If you're going to waste your face like that, then please give it to me.

110
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,402
With that face, I don't know why you can't date anyone.

111
00:10:44,402 --> 00:10:47,163
It's not that I can't date.

112
00:10:47,163 --> 00:10:48,898
I just don't date.

113
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,240
Just take this.

114
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,915
These are new product samples for the photo shoot.

115
00:10:59,252 --> 00:11:02,111
- Thank you. 
 - Thanks.

116
00:11:20,285 --> 00:11:22,651
Mi So lives here, right?

117
00:11:22,651 --> 00:11:25,854
Yes, but why are we here?

118
00:11:25,854 --> 00:11:27,746
Quiet.

119
00:11:27,746 --> 00:11:30,425
 I'll head home now.

120
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,400
I don't want to send you home. I want to stay with you.

121
00:11:38,033 --> 00:11:40,354
We can see each other tomorrow.

122
00:11:41,418 --> 00:11:45,167
Seong Woo doesn't want to be away from his Mi So, even for a second.

123
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:49,471
Hey, you haven't gone home for three days already!

124
00:11:49,471 --> 00:11:54,037
But I can stay with you for a whole week!

125
00:11:54,037 --> 00:11:56,273
Can't I stay for just one more night?

126
00:11:56,273 --> 00:11:58,409
That's what you said last night.

127
00:11:58,409 --> 00:12:01,508
That was last night...

128
00:12:03,593 --> 00:12:05,683
Are you all right?

129
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,376
 Sorry for not being able to stay by your side.

130
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:27,664
 But I did love you a lot.

131
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,090
Hey!

132
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:01,778
Soon Jeong!

133
00:13:01,778 --> 00:13:03,608
Oh Soon Jeong?

134
00:13:06,855 --> 00:13:08,971
You f**king halibut!

135
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:10,088
F**k!

136
00:13:10,088 --> 00:13:10,878
Seong Woo Oppa!

137
00:13:10,878 --> 00:13:12,763
Sorry! I'll call you! Love you!

138
00:13:12,763 --> 00:13:15,621
Hey, where are you going? Come back here!

139
00:13:16,847 --> 00:13:18,351
Hey!

140
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:30,158
Let's go.

141
00:13:30,158 --> 00:13:32,384
I want to go.

142
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,644
What?

143
00:14:06,033 --> 00:14:08,791
Is a raw fish restaurant... your second job?

144
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,934
Who are you?

145
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,744
Don't you recognize me?

146
00:14:16,744 --> 00:14:19,099
 Well, I am hardly recognizable.

147
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:23,301
When is this place closed?

148
00:14:23,301 --> 00:14:26,356
Please go look up our social media account.

149
00:14:26,363 --> 00:14:27,342
Hey, wait a minute.

150
00:14:27,342 --> 00:14:31,166
This isn't how you should run a business!

151
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:34,934
 What is that? Is it a bra strap?

152
00:14:34,934 --> 00:14:38,109
As someone in a similar line of work,

153
00:14:38,109 --> 00:14:42,344
I think you shouldn't push away your customers!

154
00:14:42,344 --> 00:14:46,352
 Why would a guy carry around a box of women's underwear?

155
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:48,582
 Isn't that the definition of a pervert?

156
00:14:48,582 --> 00:14:50,199
Hey there!

157
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:53,217
- Look here! 
 - Look at what?

158
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:20,000

159
00:15:57,668 --> 00:15:59,668
 Episode 3 Preview

160
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,425
 To heck with friends!

161
00:16:11,425 --> 00:16:14,108
 To heck with friendships!

162
00:16:14,108 --> 00:16:17,313
 - Let go of me! 
 - Would you like to be humiliated at your workplace?

163
00:16:17,313 --> 00:16:19,881
 Geez, I should have filleted that halibut!

164
00:16:19,881 --> 00:16:22,518
 - Geez. These are new products. 
 - Oh.

165
00:16:22,518 --> 00:16:24,989
 I'm going crazy.

166
00:16:24,989 --> 00:16:28,364
 Night after night, what's wrong with her?

167
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,500
 Ga Du Ri Restaurant
