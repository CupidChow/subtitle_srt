1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:07,020

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,469
Mr. Woo Bin,

3
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:11,243
I'll tear down this wall

4
00:00:11,243 --> 00:00:13,282
if I have to!

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,207
Ga Du Ri! What are you thinking? What's going on inside your head?

6
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,164
Pull yourself together!

7
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,136
Genie,

8
00:00:30,136 --> 00:00:34,471
can you recommend very romantic movies to watch on a date?

9
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:37,214
What about the well-made zombie movie, Train to Busan?

10
00:00:37,214 --> 00:00:39,365
Hey, that's not a Rom-Com!

11
00:00:39,365 --> 00:00:41,882
Then I'll recommend recently trending movies.

12
00:00:41,882 --> 00:00:46,832
How about Director Bong Joon-ho's movie (Parasite)? It sounds good.

13
00:00:46,832 --> 00:00:48,335
Are you doing this on purpose?

14
00:00:48,335 --> 00:00:51,496
Don't go for romantic movies when you're on a date.

15
00:00:51,496 --> 00:00:55,564
That dramatic suspense really helps with dating!

16
00:00:55,564 --> 00:00:57,684
Didn't you know that?

17
00:00:57,684 --> 00:01:01,234
Okay, thanks a lot.

18
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:18,846
 Something must have happened last night.

19
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:21,667
 It's an aura I never saw before in Cha Woo Bin,

20
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:24,239
 a single guy for thirty years.

21
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,534
Are we renovating our company building?

22
00:01:37,534 --> 00:01:38,890
You never mentioned it.

23
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,764
This is a very personal matter.

24
00:01:41,764 --> 00:01:42,916
So don't mind it.

25
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:46,093
Wow... Are you keeping secrets from me already?

26
00:01:46,093 --> 00:01:49,139
Were you the type to change completely when you start dating?

27
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,523
How did you know I was dating?

28
00:01:51,523 --> 00:01:53,092
You were being so obvious.

29
00:01:53,092 --> 00:01:55,123
Even the neighborhood dogs would know by now.

30
00:01:55,123 --> 00:01:57,667
What's with the renovation estimate?

31
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,306
Secretary Mo,

32
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,489
you don't need to know.

33
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,690
Really,

34
00:02:07,776 --> 00:02:09,817
you're unbelievable!

35
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,657
Ms. Ah Young...

36
00:02:19,657 --> 00:02:21,446
Are you doing well?

37
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,077
Yes...

38
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:26,014
I am fine (in Japanese).

39
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,629
Now, whenever I see a cup of coffee

40
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:33,731
it reminds me of Ms. Ah Young.

41
00:02:33,731 --> 00:02:35,671
It breaks my heart

42
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,887
that I can't drink coffee anymore.

43
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,779
Oh, Secretary Mo! You were here.

44
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:46,165
Why didn't you answer my calls?

45
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:48,398
You're supposed to mentor newbies on the job today.

46
00:02:48,398 --> 00:02:49,846
Is that so?

47
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,968
I don't feel like myself these days.

48
00:02:52,968 --> 00:02:55,212
Still, you must say hi to our new employee.

49
00:02:55,212 --> 00:02:58,211
This is Secretary Mo from the Strategy Planning Team.

50
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:01,271
I guess you must work even when sad and lonely.

51
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,577
Hello.

52
00:03:10,577 --> 00:03:12,397
I'm Mo Tae Kyung... Oh!

53
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:13,930
Hello.

54
00:03:13,932 --> 00:03:16,406
I'm Kim Ah Young, the new employee.

55
00:03:16,406 --> 00:03:18,918
This is Ms. Kim Ah Young who just joined the Finance Team.

56
00:03:18,918 --> 00:03:20,138
She looks familiar, right?

57
00:03:20,138 --> 00:03:22,293
Then please take good care of her for on-the-job training.

58
00:03:22,293 --> 00:03:24,226
I'll leave now.

59
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,779
Secretary Mo.

60
00:03:38,779 --> 00:03:39,561
Yes?

61
00:03:39,561 --> 00:03:41,796
Yes! Ms. Kim Ah Young.

62
00:03:41,796 --> 00:03:45,142
The men's underwear is also very simple yet stylish!

63
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,554
W-W-Well...

64
00:03:46,554 --> 00:03:48,687
Our men's briefs

65
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,239
are so comfortable

66
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,429
and feel good to the skin

67
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:54,912
that once you try it, there's no going back.

68
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,912
 I was fine when I was with the CEO.

69
00:04:01,912 --> 00:04:03,353
 Why am I so embarrassed today?

70
00:04:03,353 --> 00:04:05,109
Secretary Mo.

71
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:07,340
 Okay, Tae Kyung! Mo Tae Kyung!

72
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,898
 Please try to act natural this time.

73
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,843
This one doesn't have a size tag.

74
00:04:16,843 --> 00:04:18,550
It does look like 80B (32 small USA).

75
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,126
I-I-If there's

76
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:21,739
anything... like that,

77
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:24,773
please put it a-a-aside.

78
00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:27,153
Yes, Sir.

79
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,715
I can see it's very comfortable and fits perfectly by putting it against my clothes!

80
00:04:32,715 --> 00:04:34,000
Oh...

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,643
Is... is that so?

82
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,693
I really like the design too.

83
00:04:38,693 --> 00:04:41,720
I'm sure this will be super popular when it's launched.

84
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,554
Of course.

85
00:04:43,554 --> 00:04:46,946
It's a product of our brand...

86
00:04:49,332 --> 00:04:50,792
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:53,029
Did I laugh too much?

88
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,971
Not at all.

89
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:56,162
It's fine.

90
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,765
It was because you were a bit cute.

91
00:04:57,765 --> 00:04:59,679
Well... It could happen.

92
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,495
Excuse me?

93
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,860
What... W-W-What did you say?

94
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,656
You, Secretary Mo,

95
00:05:08,656 --> 00:05:10,834
I was thinking this since when you came to the café.

96
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:13,159
You're really, really cute.

97
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,668
You get that often, don't you?

98
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,611
It must be really stressful being the CEO's secretary.

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,100
Geez. Poor Secretary Mo.

100
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,461
My goodness!

101
00:06:57,461 --> 00:07:00,639
How can a person change so much just because he's dating someone?

102
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,006
You're the CEO of a company! You have no backbone!

103
00:07:08,006 --> 00:07:09,460
Why did you change into a suit?

104
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,000
I thought you said suits were uncomfortable! You can't stand how they suffocate you!

105
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,461
How will the employees be able to trust a boss like you?

106
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,040
Secretary Mo.

107
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,411
Hey there, Secretary Mo,

108
00:07:28,411 --> 00:07:30,636
remember your work-life boundaries!

109
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,519
That's right! I forgot my work-life boundaries!

110
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:37,363
I'm so... very sorry!

111
00:07:37,363 --> 00:07:39,355
Mr. C... E... O.

112
00:07:39,355 --> 00:07:44,271
Since you were getting personal renovation price quotes during work hours,

113
00:07:44,271 --> 00:07:46,319
I guess I was cutting some slack.

114
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,725
Okay, I lose.

115
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,747
Why did you follow me today?

116
00:07:51,747 --> 00:07:53,158
What are you talking about?

117
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:55,797
I didn't follow you here!

118
00:08:19,872 --> 00:08:21,508
What's wrong with you two?

119
00:08:21,508 --> 00:08:25,105
Du Ri! One Ga Du Ri Special,

120
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,841
please!

121
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:29,219
Ga Du Ri Special?

122
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,040
 Ga Du Ri Special

123
00:08:33,044 --> 00:08:35,844
Then me, too! I also want to order that!

124
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,158
Mr. CEO!

125
00:08:41,455 --> 00:08:45,780
Ga Du Ri Special isn't something you can order like that.

126
00:08:45,782 --> 00:08:49,413
Have you still no idea why Ga Du Ri Restaurant is famous?

127
00:08:49,415 --> 00:08:51,261
It's no average raw fish restaurant.

128
00:08:51,261 --> 00:08:52,772
Just order your usual

129
00:08:52,774 --> 00:08:55,531
halibut or something.

130
00:08:58,411 --> 00:08:59,711
Hey.

131
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,430
What?

132
00:09:06,092 --> 00:09:07,592
What now?

133
00:09:07,592 --> 00:09:09,756
You got dumped again, didn't you?

134
00:09:09,756 --> 00:09:12,285
No... I didn't!

135
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,194
Not... not yet.

136
00:09:14,196 --> 00:09:15,626
Then you'll be dumped soon.

137
00:09:15,626 --> 00:09:17,563
Hey! It could be different this time!

138
00:09:18,998 --> 00:09:20,936
Things might really be different this time.

139
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:22,292
It could be different this time.

140
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:24,139
For real this time!

141
00:09:24,141 --> 00:09:25,894
She feels like my

142
00:09:25,894 --> 00:09:28,608
♫ Destiny!

143
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:34,289
Aren't you sick and tired of talking about destiny?

144
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,432
So, Du Ri... there's this thing about me.

145
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,458
 Tae Kyung Oppa.

146
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,723
 Can you buy me this?

147
00:10:06,723 --> 00:10:08,256
 Please? Pretty please?

148
00:10:08,281 --> 00:10:10,945
 Please? I want it!

149
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,000
 How much is it? How much would be enough for you?

150
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,800
 A necklace? Accessories?

151
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,236
 I'll buy you everything!

152
00:10:19,236 --> 00:10:21,267
 I'll buy my way to destiny.

153
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:22,212
 How much is it?

154
00:10:22,212 --> 00:10:24,497
 32,000 won ($29 U.S.)

155
00:10:29,412 --> 00:10:32,632
 Thank you, Oppa.

156
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,966
 Thanks, Oppa!

157
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,411
 I'm so happy!

158
00:10:35,411 --> 00:10:37,308
 That was nothing!

159
00:10:41,869 --> 00:10:43,296
 I missed you.

160
00:10:43,296 --> 00:10:46,666
 Me, too.

161
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,270
 Here!

162
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:55,541
 Voila!

163
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,470
 Flower Bank Account: 125-5959-12-12

164
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:05,422
 That's my account number, Tae Kyung Oppa.

165
00:11:05,422 --> 00:11:07,766
 I'm in a real pinch here.

166
00:11:07,766 --> 00:11:10,535
 Can you lend me just one million won? ($100,000 U.S.)

167
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,513
 I don't think I heard you right.

168
00:11:12,513 --> 00:11:14,257
 Babe.

169
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,888
 You know you're the only one for me, right?

170
00:11:16,888 --> 00:11:19,895
 Please?

171
00:11:23,635 --> 00:11:25,535
 Just one million won?

172
00:11:25,535 --> 00:11:27,160
 I'll give it to you.

173
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,708
 I'll buy my way to destiny!

174
00:11:32,656 --> 00:11:34,608
 Tae Kyung!

175
00:11:34,608 --> 00:11:36,562
 Thank you!

176
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:56,754
 I'm sorry, Tae Kyung.

177
00:11:56,754 --> 00:11:59,787
 They said I can't receive the operation in Korea.

178
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,122
 I'm going to a different country.

179
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:06,133
 Thank you for the five million won you sent me for the operation.

180
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:08,852
 And I'm... sorry.

181
00:12:08,852 --> 00:12:11,300
 I guess we weren't destined to be.

182
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,057
 Please forget about me. I wish you all the best.

183
00:12:15,057 --> 00:12:16,442
 My Tae-ppi.

184
00:12:16,457 --> 00:12:19,450
 Goodbye, my precious.

185
00:12:20,551 --> 00:12:23,444
 Not even death can part us.

186
00:12:23,444 --> 00:12:25,053
 Eun Joo...

187
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,239
 Don't die!

188
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:31,911
 Why? "Death" again?

189
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,709
 "How much would it cost?"

190
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:38,602
 "I will buy everything with money."

191
00:12:38,602 --> 00:12:39,848
 That's your usual line!

192
00:12:39,924 --> 00:12:42,687
 Oh, my... She looks in so much pain.

193
00:12:42,687 --> 00:12:43,711
 What should I do?

194
00:12:43,711 --> 00:12:47,361
 What should I do? Poor Eun Joo!

195
00:12:58,175 --> 00:13:01,955
 Geez, that was so exhausting!

196
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:05,349
 They should nominate me for the Cannes Film Festival.

197
00:13:09,886 --> 00:13:10,970
 Woo-ppi! Babe!

198
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,279
 Yes.

199
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:13,954
 - Are you finished? 
 - Yes, I'm done!

200
00:13:13,979 --> 00:13:15,970
 You're so cute. You can be an actress.

201
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,297
 I should be going to Cannes.

202
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:17,966
 Let's go!

203
00:13:17,966 --> 00:13:21,014
 Let's go to Bali!

204
00:13:26,802 --> 00:13:30,496
How much... can you give me?

205
00:13:30,496 --> 00:13:32,914
Because I... need money.

206
00:13:32,914 --> 00:13:35,403
Oh! Don't be like that. Not you, too!

207
00:13:35,403 --> 00:13:38,017
I really thought they were all my destiny!

208
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,910
And this time, it's for real!

209
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,196
She is my destiny! I have a hunch!

210
00:13:44,196 --> 00:13:48,641
Oh, really? So this time, is it real?

211
00:13:49,432 --> 00:13:51,428
If a coincidence is repeated three times,

212
00:13:51,428 --> 00:13:53,868
then they call it true destiny.

213
00:13:53,868 --> 00:13:57,599
So are you an innocent guy who believes in destiny?

214
00:13:57,599 --> 00:14:00,423
Yes, thank you.

215
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:03,231
I'll live happily ever after.

216
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,669
But I'm still scarred by my past.

217
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:11,990
Just a bit... You never know.

218
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,156
I'm anxious.

219
00:14:14,156 --> 00:14:15,494
Do you think

220
00:14:15,494 --> 00:14:18,452
Ms. Ah Young is a decent person? That's what I'd like to know.

221
00:14:18,452 --> 00:14:20,930
If you say so,

222
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,810
she'd be your true destiny, right?

223
00:14:37,197 --> 00:14:40,192
D-D-Death?

224
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:45,309
Am I going to die?

225
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:49,449
Or... I-I-Is... is

226
00:14:49,449 --> 00:14:53,136
Ms. Ah-Ah Young... going to die?

227
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:57,338
You're not going to die just because you picked this card.

228
00:14:57,338 --> 00:14:59,799
Actually, it's a card that says

229
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:04,264
you can get a new start if you overcome a certain problem.

230
00:15:04,264 --> 00:15:05,384
Oh, a new start?

231
00:15:05,384 --> 00:15:06,892
A new start?

232
00:15:06,892 --> 00:15:10,855
So that means Ms. Ah Young is my destiny, right?

233
00:15:10,855 --> 00:15:13,093
We don't know that yet.

234
00:15:13,093 --> 00:15:14,391
Du Ri,

235
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:19,027
you spoil the mood... just like Woo Bin.

236
00:15:19,027 --> 00:15:22,257
Okay, let's pick two more cards!

237
00:15:37,325 --> 00:15:39,429
The pictures on these cards don't look that bad!

238
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:42,779
Both of these cards are related to money.

239
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:45,467
Money could be an issue this time as well!

240
00:15:45,467 --> 00:15:47,311
That can't be.

241
00:15:47,311 --> 00:15:50,499
Ms. Ah Young really doesn't seem like that kind of person.

242
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:53,646
Maybe your tarot game is a little off today.

243
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,518
 Woo Bin: Mo Tae Kyung,

244
00:15:56,518 --> 00:15:59,232
 cut the nonsense and go home already.

245
00:15:59,232 --> 00:16:00,297
I don't want to!

246
00:16:00,322 --> 00:16:03,979
I'm going to get dating advice from Du Ri all night long!

247
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:08,845
 Du Ri, I want to ask Ms. Ah Young

248
00:16:08,845 --> 00:16:11,529
 out on a date.

249
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:15,436
 How should I ask her out?

250
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,219
 If you go home right now, a 10% pay raise starting next month.

251
00:16:21,219 --> 00:16:22,492
Wow!

252
00:16:23,112 --> 00:16:26,268
Du Ri! No, Ms. Du Ri.

253
00:16:26,268 --> 00:16:28,616
I'll be leaving now.

254
00:16:28,616 --> 00:16:31,121
So suddenly? Weren't you getting dating advice all night?

255
00:16:31,121 --> 00:16:32,766
No.

256
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,000
How dare I come between you two?

257
00:17:02,353 --> 00:17:06,007
What did you say to Tae Kyung? He left right away.

258
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,700
It's nothing. He was going to get it anyway.

259
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,099
The air's so fresh tonight.

260
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,208
The air?

261
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,733
Correct!

262
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,389
Where should we go?

263
00:17:28,389 --> 00:17:29,625
- This way? 
 - This way?

264
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,023
- That way? 
 - That way?

265
00:17:31,023 --> 00:17:32,956
Where are we going?

266
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,340
This way.

267
00:17:39,499 --> 00:17:42,231
Nice... air.

268
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:45,485
The air always feels fresh when I'm with you.

269
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:53,420

270
00:17:54,169 --> 00:17:56,057
 Epilogue

271
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,180
♫  I don’t remember   ♫

272
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,230
♫  The last time I laughed   ♫

273
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:08,390
♫  As much as I wanted  ♫

274
00:18:08,392 --> 00:18:11,953
♫  Sometimes I may be smiling  ♫

275
00:18:11,953 --> 00:18:15,025
Don't you feel hungry after that walk?

276
00:18:15,025 --> 00:18:17,694
Do you want a snack? I'll make one.

277
00:18:18,668 --> 00:18:22,020
Something simple, yet filling...

278
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,519
What would it be?

279
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,958
How about stuffed squid?

280
00:18:27,961 --> 00:18:29,461
Great!

281
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:30,957
Genie,

282
00:18:30,957 --> 00:18:33,649
search stuffed squid on "10,000 Recipes."

283
00:18:33,649 --> 00:18:35,621
 I'll find you the easiest recipe!

284
00:18:35,621 --> 00:18:37,598
 I'm the expert for cooking!

285
00:18:37,598 --> 00:18:39,123
Thanks.

286
00:18:39,964 --> 00:18:42,567
Now, let's get ourselves ready...

287
00:18:49,934 --> 00:18:52,386
Do I do it like this?

288
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,600
 Ga Du Ri Restaurant
