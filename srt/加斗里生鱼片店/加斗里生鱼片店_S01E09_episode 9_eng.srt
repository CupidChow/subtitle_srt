1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,301
 Closed just for today! 
 Ga Du Ri Restaurant

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,000
Cheers!

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,100
By the way, Du Ri,

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,200
about that writer,

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,800
how did it go with her?

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:31,730

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,600
 Hey! Ga Du Ri!

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,000
 What do you think you're doing?

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,976
 Do you think I'll let this slide?

10
00:00:38,976 --> 00:00:40,656
 I'm going to sue you for assault–

11
00:00:40,656 --> 00:00:41,846
 Ms. Park Hyo Jeong,

12
00:00:41,846 --> 00:00:46,775
 you've been posting hate comments and rumors on various websites, right?

13
00:00:46,775 --> 00:00:48,715
 You fabricated that Singer D sexually harassed someone

14
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,900
 and spread rumors of idol group member Y being pregnant.

15
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,300
 You spread quite a lot of trashy rumors around.

16
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,853
 How did you know?

17
00:00:55,853 --> 00:00:57,800
 Ms. Park! You were a really bad person!

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,900
 No, no!

19
00:00:59,908 --> 00:01:02,600
 If you want me to reveal all you did and make your life hard in Korea,

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,951
 then continue being like that.

21
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:07,200
 Hey, Ga Du Ri! What proof do you have?

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,780
 Proof?

23
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,900
 If you want to see that, then I'll see you in court!

24
00:01:31,704 --> 00:01:33,500
That's Du Ri for you!

25
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,000
A total girl crush!

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,600
The best of the best!

27
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,572
It's all thanks to you two. Today, it's on the house!

28
00:01:39,572 --> 00:01:41,200
Oh...

29
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,200
Du Ri!

30
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,700
What was that, Woo Bin?

31
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,000
Why did you do that?

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,017
What? What did I do?

33
00:01:51,017 --> 00:01:54,037
Wow... How could you change so much?

34
00:01:54,037 --> 00:01:56,517
Why don't you start acting while you're at it?

35
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:58,600
You'll act like Song Kang Ho or Lee Byung Hun.

36
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,300
Here you go!

37
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,000
You guys are a perfect pair already.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,100
Anyway eat to your heart's content.

39
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,000
Cheers!

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,900
Cheers!

41
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,830
Then I'll be going now.

42
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,452
I wish you two all the best!

43
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,900
Fighting!

44
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,000
 Ga Du Ri Restaurant

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,300
Ms. Du Ri, would you like me to walk you home?

46
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,474
I live right upstairs though.

47
00:03:13,474 --> 00:03:15,474
Oh, right.

48
00:03:15,474 --> 00:03:17,600
You live upstairs.

49
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,900
Oh... I must have eaten too much.

50
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,741
Don't you feel so full?

51
00:03:25,741 --> 00:03:30,581
I... think I'll go for a walk... a walk!

52
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:31,729
A walk!

53
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,400
The air is just...

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,600
What?

55
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,700
Sure, let's take a walk together.

56
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,557
Ms. Du Ri. Can I ask you something?

57
00:03:56,557 --> 00:04:00,000
Sure, of course. What is it?

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,400
That cap and the sunglasses,

59
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,000
why did you keep them all this time?

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,500
Well... One day, if I saw him again, I wanted to return them to him and say

61
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,971
thank you.

62
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:19,800
I really wanted to thank him.

63
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,700
Though I never thought I'd really get to meet him again.

64
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:29,100
I think that's the best thing I've ever done in my life.

65
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,800
What?

66
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,700
Mr. Woo Bin, you head home first.

67
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,400
I left something at the restaurant.

68
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:19,600
Okay. Then I'll get going first.

69
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,400
Yes.

70
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,400
Good night.

71
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,800
Du Ri!

72
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,045
Why are you here?

73
00:06:01,045 --> 00:06:02,200
I must be dreaming.

74
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,400
Du Ri, hold on.

75
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,400
How dare you come back here!

76
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,400
No, at that time...

77
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,450
We didn't see each other a long time.

78
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:15,553
And I felt bad about not saying hello properly.

79
00:06:15,553 --> 00:06:17,900
I was just in the neighborhood

80
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,200
and dropped by to say hi.

81
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,576
Well, we're not exactly on friendly terms, are we?

82
00:06:24,576 --> 00:06:26,490
Hey, Du Ri, don't do that.

83
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,162
It's not like you.

84
00:06:28,162 --> 00:06:29,200
Do you know me?

85
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,100
Geez! Don't be like that.

86
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,000
I found this on my way here.

87
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,100
Take it! It's your favorite tteokbokki.

88
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,800
A gift!

89
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,514
Look here!

90
00:06:46,514 --> 00:06:49,200
I haven't had tteokbokki in more than seven years.

91
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,100
You can eat it with that girlfriend of yours.

92
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:59,303
Didn't you... miss me?

93
00:06:59,303 --> 00:07:02,356
I missed you from time to time.

94
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,269
Are you kidding me right now?

95
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,278
I guess you still feel uncomfortable with me.

96
00:07:18,818 --> 00:07:20,420
I'm sorry.

97
00:07:21,318 --> 00:07:24,746
I was just so curious if you were doing well.

98
00:07:24,746 --> 00:07:26,170
Stop it.

99
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,042
If you're drunk, just go home and sleep–

100
00:07:28,042 --> 00:07:30,083
Oh... I have to get this.

101
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,307
 My Woo Joo

102
00:07:33,178 --> 00:07:35,800
- Answer it. 
 - No, no, no.

103
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,545
- I'll answer it later. 
 - Answer it!

104
00:07:37,545 --> 00:07:41,040
No, no. I'll come back later, and then...

105
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,264
I hope we can be more comfortable.

106
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,892
I have to answer this.

107
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,203
- Hey... hey, Woo Joo. 
 - What just happened?

108
00:07:54,203 --> 00:07:56,707
  No! I'm on my way.

109
00:08:05,878 --> 00:08:07,660
Yes...

110
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,222
I'm to blame for everything.

111
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,903
Does she like macaroons?

112
00:08:23,621 --> 00:08:26,321
Hasn't she come to work yet?

113
00:08:26,972 --> 00:08:30,057
I think she was always here around lunchtime.

114
00:08:30,057 --> 00:08:31,822
- Who? 
 - Geez! You scared me!

115
00:08:31,822 --> 00:08:33,688
Who are you looking for?

116
00:08:33,688 --> 00:08:37,088
Ms. Kim Ah Young, who works here?

117
00:08:37,088 --> 00:08:39,097
Ms. Ah Young?

118
00:08:39,097 --> 00:08:41,827
How would you even know the name of a part-timer at the café?

119
00:08:41,827 --> 00:08:44,707
Well, we ran into each other. We exchanged names.

120
00:08:44,707 --> 00:08:47,463
- Mr. Bang! Again? 
 - No! That's not it.

121
00:08:47,463 --> 00:08:49,838
I only have eyes for my Mi So now.

122
00:08:49,838 --> 00:08:52,200
I've settled down, for real.

123
00:08:52,728 --> 00:08:54,808
Well... Anyway

124
00:08:54,808 --> 00:08:59,191
Ms. Kim Ah Young didn't come to work yet, right?

125
00:08:59,191 --> 00:09:01,669
What? Didn't you know?

126
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:03,493
She said yesterday was her last day of work.

127
00:09:03,493 --> 00:09:05,449
What?

128
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:07,135
Did she quit?

129
00:09:07,988 --> 00:09:09,778
J-J-Just like that?

130
00:09:09,778 --> 00:09:12,311
Yes! She quit work yesterday.

131
00:09:14,636 --> 00:09:17,476
She... quit...

132
00:09:18,736 --> 00:09:21,201
I can't believe this!

133
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:24,567
She quit the part-time job, but she'll be working at our company starting tomorrow.

134
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:26,897
She's at the Finance Team right now to say hi–

135
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,265
Where did he go? I haven't even finished talking yet.

136
00:09:41,393 --> 00:09:43,684
She quit just like that.

137
00:09:44,531 --> 00:09:46,917
I don't even have her number yet.

138
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:49,262
Stupid Mo Tae Kyung.

139
00:09:49,262 --> 00:09:51,552
You should reflect on yourself.

140
00:09:53,353 --> 00:09:55,665
She was my destiny.

141
00:09:56,776 --> 00:09:59,447
How could I let her go?

142
00:09:59,447 --> 00:10:02,484
You don't deserve to eat these macaroons!

143
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:10,732
How are you (in Japanese)?

144
00:10:10,732 --> 00:10:15,185
I am fine (continues in Japanese)!

145
00:10:15,185 --> 00:10:20,263
Without you, this world is h*ll!

146
00:10:20,263 --> 00:10:24,367
Where on earth are you? (Refers to the Japanese movie "Love Letter.")

147
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,957
When you get stressed while working,

148
00:10:28,957 --> 00:10:31,996
we have a rooftop where you can scream like that.

149
00:10:33,609 --> 00:10:37,172
But not in that disturbing kind of way.

150
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:43,317
De-stressing is fine, but just look around before you do it.

151
00:10:44,068 --> 00:10:46,168
Shall we go down now?

152
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,795
Ms. Ah Young!

153
00:11:00,795 --> 00:11:03,365
Thank you! Please come again!

154
00:11:29,036 --> 00:11:31,153
Did you just get here?

155
00:11:31,153 --> 00:11:32,714
Nothing bad happened today, right?

156
00:11:32,714 --> 00:11:36,738
No! And I saved a big one for you.

157
00:11:37,253 --> 00:11:41,024
Instead of taking it to go, I'll be eating here.

158
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,128
Then please sit here.

159
00:11:44,128 --> 00:11:46,486
- I'll be right back with it. 
 - Okay.

160
00:11:46,486 --> 00:11:48,909
Oh, and a bottle of beer, please.

161
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,216
Okay!

162
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,357
Enjoy!

163
00:12:00,357 --> 00:12:01,767
Thank you.

164
00:12:10,286 --> 00:12:12,343
Is there something you need?

165
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:23,783
Ms. Du Ri, have you had dinner yet?

166
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,347
Excuse me!

167
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:31,074
Can we order chopped live octopus?

168
00:12:31,074 --> 00:12:33,674
Can we have one more bottle of Soju?

169
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:39,569
Yes, I'll bring it right over.

170
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,741
Great job on getting through another day.

171
00:13:48,553 --> 00:13:50,762
I'm sorry, Mr. Woo Bin!

172
00:13:50,762 --> 00:13:53,707
I forgot, and I was loud again.

173
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,646
No.

174
00:13:55,646 --> 00:13:57,600
It's fine.

175
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:09,190
The restaurant was pretty busy today.

176
00:14:10,668 --> 00:14:13,180
At least tomorrow's my day off.

177
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,191
Then what are your plans for tomorrow?

178
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,057
Tomorrow?

179
00:14:24,354 --> 00:14:27,090
Nothing special.

180
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,291
Well, then tomorrow...

181
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:38,641
Well...

182
00:14:43,828 --> 00:14:45,583
Would you like to go on a date with me?

183
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,104
What?

184
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,217
Yes! I'd like that.

185
00:15:15,232 --> 00:15:17,684
Excuse me, Mr. Woo Bin?

186
00:15:19,216 --> 00:15:21,274
Mr. Cha Woo Bin?

187
00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:26,206
Are you asleep?

188
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,519
Who is it?

189
00:15:45,372 --> 00:15:48,489
Mr. Woo Bin, why all of a sudden...

190
00:15:49,398 --> 00:15:51,479
Tell me again.

191
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,142
What?

192
00:15:53,142 --> 00:15:54,547
What you said earlier.

193
00:15:54,547 --> 00:15:56,617
Answer me again.

194
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,235
I'd like that?

195
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:01,356
I'd like that!

196
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,380
Yes.

197
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,716
Me, too.

198
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,182
I also like you,

199
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:14,904
Ms. Ga Du Ri.

200
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:29,080

201
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,920
♫  I want to live every day  ♫

202
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:45,690
♫  Like today, while laughing  ♫

203
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:51,490
♫  After smiling, my frustrated heart  ♫

204
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:58,310
♫  Slowly, slowly, slowly   ♫

205
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,820
♫  Becomes calm  ♫

206
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,990
 Preview: How did you know I was dating?

207
00:17:08,992 --> 00:17:10,438
 You were being so obvious.

208
00:17:10,438 --> 00:17:13,220
 Even the neighborhood dogs would know by now.

209
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,516
 I'm Mo Tae Kyung... Oh!

210
00:17:15,516 --> 00:17:18,143
 Money could be an issue this time as well.

211
00:17:18,143 --> 00:17:19,948
 You got dumped again, didn't you?

212
00:17:19,948 --> 00:17:21,970
 No... I didn't!

213
00:17:22,853 --> 00:17:28,133
 Mr. Woo Bin, I'll tear down this wall if I have to.

214
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,305
