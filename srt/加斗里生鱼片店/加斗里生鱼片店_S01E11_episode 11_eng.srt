1
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,809
It must be closed.

2
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:17,710
Hey, Woo Joo, this place is closed. I think it's her day off.

3
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,981
- Really? 
 - Yes.

4
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,321
Should I call her?

5
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:25,466
There's no need to call her. Let's go.

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,388
Why?

7
00:00:27,388 --> 00:00:29,882
Are you hiding something from me?

8
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,370
Hiding what? What could I be hiding?

9
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,834
- Babe. 
 - What?

10
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:38,257
If you don't want to humiliate yourself after coming all the way here, then just tell me.

11
00:00:38,257 --> 00:00:39,101
What do you mean?

12
00:00:39,101 --> 00:00:42,673
You came here again after coming with me then, right?

13
00:00:42,673 --> 00:00:43,780
Hey!

14
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,860
What business would I have to come here?

15
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,013
You can't look me in the eye when you lie.

16
00:00:50,013 --> 00:00:52,927
- Do you think I don't know that? 
 - I know.

17
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:57,178
Then why couldn't you make eye contact with me on the way here?

18
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,491
There! Are you happy?

19
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:03,060
Hey, what on earth are you talking about? You're starting to blame me for nothing.

20
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,594
Who are you trying to fool?

21
00:01:04,594 --> 00:01:08,642
Since college, you could fool that idiot Ga Du Ri, but you weren't able to fool me!

22
00:01:08,642 --> 00:01:11,772
Babe, don't call her an idiot. That's too harsh.

23
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,111
Of course, she's an idiot! Is she smart?

24
00:01:14,111 --> 00:01:18,065
Who believes you saying, "Break up because of the Four Pillars of Destiny"?

25
00:01:18,065 --> 00:01:21,327
Both who used that as an excuse, and who fell for it...

26
00:01:21,327 --> 00:01:23,745
Hey! That's because you made me–

27
00:01:23,745 --> 00:01:27,977
Yes! Because gullible Ga Du Ri would totally believe you!

28
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,899
 Hey... What if someone sees us?

29
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,739
 Why?

30
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:45,481
 Are you worried Du Ri might see you or something?

31
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:48,269
 No, I like this.

32
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,385
 But I don't know if she fell for my story.

33
00:01:54,385 --> 00:01:58,754
 As you said, I told her we must break up due to the Four Pillars of Destiny,

34
00:01:58,754 --> 00:02:00,709
 but she was a bit dumbfounded.

35
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:04,015
 She was likely stunned by the situation. She'll believe your story.

36
00:02:04,015 --> 00:02:06,158
 Do you know how superstitious she is?

37
00:02:06,158 --> 00:02:07,773
 You're right.

38
00:02:07,773 --> 00:02:10,894
 I was the only person with a lucky charm at the reserve forces training.

39
00:02:10,894 --> 00:02:16,380
 Apparently, she got it from a famous place that reveals the Four Pillars of Destiny.

40
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,635
 That's so old-fashioned, just like Ga Du Ri.

41
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,794
 Where do you want to go now?

42
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,435
Hey, Woo Joo, why would you talk like that?

43
00:02:33,435 --> 00:02:35,123
Why?

44
00:02:35,123 --> 00:02:36,327
After seeing her, do you have second thoughts?

45
00:02:36,327 --> 00:02:39,494
You were just fine after I told you to break up with her!

46
00:02:39,494 --> 00:02:42,188
But now do you think Ga Du Ri seems a much better option?

47
00:02:42,188 --> 00:02:44,332
Then how did you know about that?

48
00:02:44,332 --> 00:02:46,098
Don't tell me...

49
00:02:46,098 --> 00:02:47,700
Did you have me followed again?

50
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,196
So what if I did?

51
00:02:49,196 --> 00:02:52,378
We can't cancel our wedding when we sent out invitations already!

52
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:54,337
We're getting married in a few days.

53
00:02:54,337 --> 00:02:57,094
Hey, please... Let's stop.

54
00:02:57,094 --> 00:03:00,150
I don't want to be yelling at you in front of a restaurant.

55
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,523
You mean you don't want to fight where Ga Du Ri can see us, right?

56
00:03:03,523 --> 00:03:05,816
Hey, I can't believe you!

57
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,355
Why are you running away?

58
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,470
Try standing right here.

59
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:27,000
♫  Oh, why?  ♫

60
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,780
One, two, three.

61
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,970
♫  From your one to ten  ♫

62
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,710
♫  Everything is perfect, love you  ♫

63
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,010
♫  I've fallen for you  ♫

64
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,940
♫  You're pretty when you're annoyed  ♫

65
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,450
♫  Your worries are so cute  ♫

66
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,040
♫  Stay by my side  ♫

67
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,160
♫  Forever  ♫

68
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,420
♫  From your one to ten  ♫

69
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,270
♫  I love it all  ♫

70
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,840
What's this?

71
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,090
It looks great on you.

72
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,658
Well, you know, everything looks great on me.

73
00:04:05,658 --> 00:04:07,004
- What? 
 - Never mind.

74
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,420
- What's with that face? 
 - It's nothing.

75
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,950
♫  From your one to ten  ♫

76
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,510
♫  Love you  ♫

77
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,499
Mr. Woo Bin!

78
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:44,585
Woo Bin!

79
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:46,456
Cha Woo Bin!

80
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,205
Genie, play "Sweep Sweep."

81
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,915
 That's my specialty!

82
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:54,640
 I'll play it using this awesome speaker with premium sound effects.

83
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,860
♫  I’ll sweep, sweep everything away. Swept, swept away  ♫

84
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,010
♫  I’ll sweep, sweep away.  ♫

85
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:07,850
♫  Because it’s different now. Because I know and I’ve seen it all  ♫

86
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,571
This needs your final confirmation for next week's product launch.

87
00:05:18,571 --> 00:05:21,123
There's quite a lot. What then?

88
00:05:21,123 --> 00:05:22,910
Do you think you can finish looking over it by tomorrow?

89
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,849
Sure. I can.

90
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:27,608
It's all right.

91
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:32,680
You're glowing a pink aura, which makes me feel queasy.

92
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,865
What? Why?

93
00:05:33,865 --> 00:05:35,747
I couldn't go on a date over the weekend!

94
00:05:35,747 --> 00:05:38,851
And here you are, so happy yourself!

95
00:05:38,851 --> 00:05:40,564
You could ask her out again.

96
00:05:40,564 --> 00:05:43,062
I was going to anyway.

97
00:05:48,235 --> 00:05:51,060
 One text message from Kim Ah Young. We definitely clicked!

98
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,771
 She's my... ♫ Destiny!

99
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:59,096
 Secretary Mo, could you meet me on the rooftop?

100
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,049
This is unbelievable.

101
00:06:02,049 --> 00:06:04,565
What? What is it?

102
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,429
Pardon? It's nothing.

103
00:06:06,429 --> 00:06:07,767
It's nothing special.

104
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:10,519
Then I'll take my leave.

105
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:18,479
 The best part about office romance is keeping it a secret!

106
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:32,839
Excuse me... Secretary Mo.

107
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,947
Yes.

108
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,138
Did you want to see me, Ms. Ah Young?

109
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,102
Excuse me...

110
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,716
Feel free to talk to me about anything.

111
00:06:50,716 --> 00:06:53,371
 So when are we going on a date?

112
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,543
Excuse me. So...

113
00:06:56,543 --> 00:06:58,540
 So?

114
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:05,296
Please give me some money!

115
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,095
What?

116
00:07:14,095 --> 00:07:15,576
To be exact

117
00:07:15,576 --> 00:07:18,502
it's 3,251,000 won (about $3,000 U.S.)

118
00:07:32,344 --> 00:07:35,944
 We collect your unpaid bills for you.

119
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,306
 Tae Kyung Oppa, can you buy me this?

120
00:07:49,306 --> 00:07:51,845
 Oppa, can you lend me just one million won?

121
00:07:51,845 --> 00:07:54,639
 Thank you for the five million won you sent me for the operation.

122
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,888
 And... I'm sorry.

123
00:07:56,888 --> 00:07:59,709
 Both of these cards are related to money.

124
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:03,409
 Money could be an issue this time as well!

125
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,331
What's wrong? What happened?

126
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,801
N-No...

127
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,194
Is it about Ms. Ah Young?

128
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,583
Oh... I can suddenly feel the alcohol in me.

129
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,277
I-I'll be off now.

130
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,772
Okay.

131
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,916
Hey, Secretary Mo!

132
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,230
I thought you went home because you took a half-day.

133
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,076
Were you fooling around here again?

134
00:08:45,076 --> 00:08:46,875
Yes...

135
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,911
I apologize.

136
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,598
Goodbye.

137
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:54,117
Yes.

138
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,359
Did something happen to him?

139
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:09,426
I'm not sure either.

140
00:09:09,426 --> 00:09:12,959
He was very quiet, which is not at all like him.

141
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,949
That's weird.

142
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,816
I'll ask him tomorrow.

143
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:20,117
Don't worry about it.

144
00:09:20,117 --> 00:09:21,732
Okay.

145
00:09:32,018 --> 00:09:33,602
Now I know why Tae Kyung told me

146
00:09:33,602 --> 00:09:38,366
to ask you to read my tarot cards.

147
00:09:38,366 --> 00:09:40,020
Why?

148
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:42,541
Because you're so pretty.

149
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,843
Will you keep staring at me like that?

150
00:09:46,843 --> 00:09:47,965
Ms. Du Ri.

151
00:09:47,965 --> 00:09:49,314
Yes?

152
00:09:49,314 --> 00:09:53,302
Why don't you stop reading tarot cards for customers?

153
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:55,120
All of a sudden, why?

154
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,900
You look so pretty doing it. I want to be the only one who sees you like this.

155
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,722
Here! Why don't you pick out two cards?

156
00:10:08,722 --> 00:10:11,675
Hurry! And focus your attention on the cards.

157
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,540
Then I'll...

158
00:10:17,295 --> 00:10:19,020
pick this one,

159
00:10:20,263 --> 00:10:21,955
and this one.

160
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,160
 The Sun

161
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,652
From now on, the sun will shine on your future.

162
00:10:32,652 --> 00:10:35,999
This card means that the sun will shine brightly over you.

163
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:40,184
Wow, the sun will also be shining down on your romantic relationship!

164
00:10:40,184 --> 00:10:43,364
