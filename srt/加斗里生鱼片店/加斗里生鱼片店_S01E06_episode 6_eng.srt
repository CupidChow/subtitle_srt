1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,880
Here you go.

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:17,080

3
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,931
It's been so long since I drank.

4
00:00:25,931 --> 00:00:28,496
I'm not the type to act up when I'm drunk.

5
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:31,287
Honestly, I'm not.

6
00:00:31,287 --> 00:00:32,244
Oh...

7
00:00:33,258 --> 00:00:34,758
Okay.

8
00:00:34,758 --> 00:00:37,218
Back in school, when the party was over,

9
00:00:37,218 --> 00:00:40,407
I was so sober that I sent my friends off to their homes.

10
00:00:42,472 --> 00:00:44,812
Who said otherwise?

11
00:00:54,264 --> 00:00:56,407
But...

12
00:00:56,407 --> 00:00:59,453
How is it that you remember me?

13
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:01,712
What?

14
00:01:01,712 --> 00:01:03,914
It was a long time ago.

15
00:01:03,914 --> 00:01:06,890
It's been seven years.

16
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,294
And to be honest, I didn't really get to see your face.

17
00:01:10,294 --> 00:01:12,778
That's understandable.

18
00:01:14,295 --> 00:01:15,990
You were crying a lot

19
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,590
that day.

20
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,752
Still,

21
00:01:23,752 --> 00:01:26,884
I tried really hard to find the person who gave them to me,

22
00:01:27,474 --> 00:01:29,526
after that,

23
00:01:29,526 --> 00:01:32,481
whenever I was on that bus,

24
00:01:32,481 --> 00:01:34,348
every day.

25
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,121
Why?

26
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:44,600
I was...

27
00:01:46,426 --> 00:01:48,857
I was really grateful to him.

28
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:48,932
Those sunglasses

29
00:02:48,932 --> 00:02:51,024
look good on you,

30
00:02:51,024 --> 00:02:53,132
back then, and even now.

31
00:02:54,054 --> 00:02:56,076
Well, you know...

32
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:58,056
I'm sort of like a model.

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,400
For now, take them off.

34
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,087
What?

35
00:03:16,087 --> 00:03:17,729
Well...

36
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:21,676
Sunglasses are for really sunny days.

37
00:03:21,676 --> 00:03:24,615
Well, you're supposed to wear them on days like that.

38
00:03:25,586 --> 00:03:26,686
Right.

39
00:03:26,686 --> 00:03:28,739
So...

40
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:31,577
Since it's dark right now,

41
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,140
and I hope you don't cry anymore,

42
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,100
from now on, wear them only on sunny days.

43
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,870
♫  And laugh like this  ♫

44
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:59,670
♫  While smiling, I realize my frozen heart  ♫

45
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:08,530
♫  Slowly, slowly, slowly will melt  ♫

46
00:04:23,538 --> 00:04:25,469
Excuse me!

47
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:27,365
Good morning!

48
00:04:27,365 --> 00:04:29,325
Good morning.

49
00:04:29,943 --> 00:04:32,310
 What? Wait a minute...

50
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,557
 Is it him?

51
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,872
 Or not?

52
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:49,834
Pardon me, how's your hangover?

53
00:04:49,834 --> 00:04:51,399
Oh, my! I'm sorry!

54
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,599
Pardon me?

55
00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:56,076
I mistook you for someone I know. You look so much like him.

56
00:04:56,076 --> 00:04:57,822
Who?

57
00:04:57,822 --> 00:04:59,022
No, wait!

58
00:04:59,022 --> 00:05:01,418
You look exactly like...

59
00:05:01,418 --> 00:05:03,679
him, or do you?

60
00:05:04,251 --> 00:05:06,509
Oh, by any chance, do you live on the second floor?

61
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:08,021
Sure, I do.

62
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:09,382
I live next door to you.

63
00:05:09,384 --> 00:05:12,532
Oh! Then do you live with that guy from yesterday?

64
00:05:12,532 --> 00:05:14,046
What guy from yesterday?

65
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:15,382
You know,

66
00:05:15,384 --> 00:05:18,112
the one who's always in a tracksuit!

67
00:05:18,112 --> 00:05:20,359
What do you mean?

68
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:22,246
 It's not a cartoon where nerds change into cute guys.

69
00:05:22,246 --> 00:05:24,922
 Are you really the same person?

70
00:05:24,922 --> 00:05:25,922
Oh!

71
00:05:25,924 --> 00:05:27,031
I usually like to wear comfortable–

72
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:28,636
Twins! Right?

73
00:05:28,636 --> 00:05:30,116
Identical, at that!

74
00:05:30,116 --> 00:05:32,576
- Excuse me? 
 - I've never met identical twins before!

75
00:05:32,578 --> 00:05:36,209
Wow, you guys look exactly the same!

76
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:37,765
Even your voices are identical!

77
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:39,591
So your brother wears tracksuits all the time,

78
00:05:39,591 --> 00:05:41,762
and do you wear suits all the time?

79
00:05:41,762 --> 00:05:44,548
Then again, I guess twins can have different preferences, too!

80
00:05:44,548 --> 00:05:45,291
Right?

81
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,671
No. That's not it.

82
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:54,659
Hello?

83
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:56,255
 Sir! When are you coming?

84
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,996
 Company YY's Director Kim is waiting for you!

85
00:05:57,996 --> 00:05:59,550
We still have time until the meeting.

86
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,159
 I don't know why, but he's here early!

87
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:03,782
Tell him to wait a bit.

88
00:06:03,782 --> 00:06:05,797
I can be there in ten minutes.

89
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,876
I'll get going.

90
00:06:10,876 --> 00:06:13,115
Oh, okay! Go ahead!

91
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:18,400
I don't know what...

92
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,725
But something is weirdly...

93
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:31,451
familiar about him.

94
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,673
 Come on, think about it.

95
00:06:37,673 --> 00:06:39,307
 Really, don't you know me?

96
00:06:39,307 --> 00:06:43,286
 I used to be sort of famous back in those days.

97
00:06:43,286 --> 00:06:47,454
 The Goddess of S University, Ga Du Ri!

98
00:06:47,454 --> 00:06:50,754
 Ga Du Ri. Ga Du Ri.

99
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,750
 So she does know that she's pretty, right?

100
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:02,380
 Cha Woo Bin

101
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,031
 Twins! Identical, at that!

102
00:07:06,031 --> 00:07:09,283
 - Excuse me? 
 - I've never met identical twins before!

103
00:07:09,283 --> 00:07:11,974
Identical twins...

104
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:16,974
How does she have such an imagination?

105
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:42,531
What's wrong with him now?

106
00:07:42,531 --> 00:07:46,692
I can't tell if he's in a good mood or a bad one.

107
00:07:56,235 --> 00:07:57,335
Hey, Du Ri!

108
00:07:57,335 --> 00:07:59,780
Stop pretending to be busy and come over here!

109
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,376
Right, Ms. Du Ri, our writer!

110
00:08:01,376 --> 00:08:03,569
It's been quite a while. We want to feel welcomed!

111
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:05,823
I'm close to being disappointed.

112
00:08:06,955 --> 00:08:08,555
Writer?

113
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:11,039
Du Ri quit being a writer a long time ago.

114
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,382
And she quit shortly after starting as a junior.

115
00:08:13,382 --> 00:08:16,833
Du Ri would feel awkward if you continued to call her a writer.

116
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:17,835
Is that so?

117
00:08:17,835 --> 00:08:21,615
Then should I call her the CEO of a raw fish restaurant or the owner?

118
00:08:21,615 --> 00:08:24,428
Oh, what nonsense!

119
00:08:24,428 --> 00:08:26,815
CEO?

120
00:08:28,273 --> 00:08:30,195
It's just a tiny food joint!

121
00:08:30,195 --> 00:08:32,336
Just call me however you like.

122
00:08:32,336 --> 00:08:34,937
You should order first.

123
00:08:34,937 --> 00:08:37,037
What would you like?

124
00:08:37,037 --> 00:08:38,304
I'm sorry, Du Ri.

125
00:08:38,304 --> 00:08:42,024
She caught me looking at your social media account.

126
00:08:42,024 --> 00:08:44,243
It's fine.

127
00:08:44,243 --> 00:08:46,089
But the food here tastes good, right?

128
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:47,553
I looked it up on social media,

129
00:08:47,553 --> 00:08:49,787
and they said this place is famous for something other than raw fish.

130
00:08:49,787 --> 00:08:52,284
I heard this is a great place to get dating advice!

131
00:08:52,284 --> 00:08:55,287
That's so like Ga Du Ri.

132
00:08:57,951 --> 00:09:00,084
- Hey! 
 - What?

133
00:09:00,084 --> 00:09:02,240
We'll start with what you recommend.

134
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,756
How about a bottle of Soju and two beers?

135
00:09:03,756 --> 00:09:04,756
Yes.

136
00:09:04,758 --> 00:09:05,758
Give us those, too.

137
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:07,860
Got it, thank you.

138
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,366
 Three years ago

139
00:09:13,223 --> 00:09:14,020
 Hello!

140
00:09:14,022 --> 00:09:15,024
 - Oh! Ms. Du Ri! 
 - Yes?

141
00:09:15,024 --> 00:09:16,453
 - How are you? 
 - Good.

142
00:09:16,453 --> 00:09:18,384
 Do you remember what we discussed?

143
00:09:18,384 --> 00:09:19,940
 How did that go?

144
00:09:21,414 --> 00:09:22,914
 Just in time! They're here!

145
00:09:22,914 --> 00:09:24,990
 Please put in a good word!

146
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:36,306
 Goodness, the hottest group is here!

147
00:09:36,306 --> 00:09:37,967
 - Two, three! 
 - Various colors!

148
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:40,391
 Hello! We're the Men in Black!

149
00:09:40,391 --> 00:09:42,923
 Wow... I heard you guys are super popular abroad these days.

150
00:09:42,923 --> 00:09:44,628
 - You must be really busy. 
 - We're fine.

151
00:09:44,628 --> 00:09:46,334
 We have to work harder.

152
00:09:46,334 --> 00:09:47,672
 Mr. Woo Jin!

153
00:09:47,672 --> 00:09:49,952
 That's the right attitude!

154
00:09:49,952 --> 00:09:51,962
 So have you seen our show?

155
00:09:51,962 --> 00:09:52,892
 Of course!

156
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,511
 We try to catch up on your show, Producer Kim, whenever we can.

157
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,092
 Then instead of just watching,

158
00:09:57,092 --> 00:09:59,022
 why don't you come on our show whenever you can?

159
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:03,350
 I mean, Mr. Woo Jin, you were a regular on Ms. Du Ri's show!

160
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:09,087
 Please find some time to come on our show.

161
00:10:09,087 --> 00:10:11,576
 Yes, Producer Kim's new item

162
00:10:11,576 --> 00:10:14,021
 seems like a great fit for you, Woo Jin.

163
00:10:14,021 --> 00:10:15,536
 Really?

164
00:10:15,536 --> 00:10:18,793
 If it's your recommendation, then I can't miss it.

165
00:10:18,793 --> 00:10:19,750
 Really?

166
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,639
 Mr. Woo Jin, I knew you would!

167
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:23,255
 I like that attitude!

168
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:26,381
 We're a big fan of your show.

169
00:10:26,381 --> 00:10:28,147
 Could we also be on your show?

170
00:10:28,147 --> 00:10:28,930
 Sure!

171
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,503
 Two is better than one,

172
00:10:30,503 --> 00:10:32,878
 and four is better than two, right?

173
00:10:32,878 --> 00:10:34,491
 We promise we'll do our best!

174
00:10:34,491 --> 00:10:35,803
 - Want to sign on it? 
 - Let's go!

175
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:37,753
 Great!

176
00:10:37,753 --> 00:10:38,966
 What else do you have up your sleeve?

177
00:10:38,966 --> 00:10:40,191
 I can do this!

178
00:10:40,191 --> 00:10:42,214
 This? What's this?

179
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,700
 Hey! Here's your coffee!

180
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,918
 Did you grind the beans yourself? What took you so long?

181
00:11:04,018 --> 00:11:05,518
 It's cold.

182
00:11:05,518 --> 00:11:07,168
 It's awful. You're right.

183
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:09,781
 The ice is all melted, too.

184
00:11:09,781 --> 00:11:11,790
 I'm sorry.

185
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,503
 This time I'll be back faster!

186
00:11:13,528 --> 00:11:15,405
 Unnie (big sister, female friend).

187
00:11:15,405 --> 00:11:17,098
 I'll go get coffee this time.

188
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,289
 Did you finish sorting that data?

189
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:21,047
 Almost!

190
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,367
 I'll go!

191
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:23,600
 It's okay.

192
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,768
 I'll be right back with it.

193
00:11:27,495 --> 00:11:28,895
 Whatever, it's fine.

194
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,818
 I'll go buy coffee on my own once the meeting's over.

195
00:11:32,728 --> 00:11:34,271
 What if our Emcee Woo Jin finds out

196
00:11:34,296 --> 00:11:37,128
 that we're making you do all the work?

197
00:11:37,128 --> 00:11:38,143
 What do you mean?

198
00:11:38,145 --> 00:11:40,796
 You're the reason Woo Jin comes on our show.

199
00:11:40,796 --> 00:11:43,231
 So how can I dare tell you to do something?

200
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:47,079
 What if you tell on us to Woo Jin?

201
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:49,093
 It's not like that.

202
00:11:49,093 --> 00:11:50,371
 What's not like that?

203
00:11:50,371 --> 00:11:52,703
 Does Woo Jin only come on our show because of you?

204
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,128
 Or that you'll tell on us?

205
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,654
 I'll be right back with the coffee.

206
00:12:02,842 --> 00:12:06,676
Ms. Du Ri! Please come to our show! Just once!

207
00:12:06,676 --> 00:12:09,598
You know me. My shows used to have high ratings.

208
00:12:09,598 --> 00:12:12,326
The highest ratings, right?

209
00:12:15,684 --> 00:12:18,484
With the new time window,

210
00:12:18,484 --> 00:12:20,970
I-I-I'll get this show trending.

211
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,318
Producer,

212
00:12:22,318 --> 00:12:24,831
I'm not a celebrity.

213
00:12:24,831 --> 00:12:25,795
I just have a normal life–

214
00:12:25,795 --> 00:12:27,251
That's why you're perfect for the show!

215
00:12:27,251 --> 00:12:30,268
Our show isn't a program featuring celebrities.

216
00:12:30,268 --> 00:12:33,217
It's a dating reality show with non-celebrities!

217
00:12:33,217 --> 00:12:37,062
For our show, Ms. Du Ri is the perfect person!

218
00:12:37,062 --> 00:12:38,121
Perfect casting!

219
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:39,223
Producer,

220
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,025
I'm not doing it.

221
00:12:41,025 --> 00:12:43,801
Geez, she is

222
00:12:43,801 --> 00:12:47,180
always so selfish.

223
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,668
Even when her seniors come to ask her,

224
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,270
look how she says no.

225
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:55,820
Oh! This is so humiliating!

226
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,700
Now, even my juniors... do this to me?

227
00:13:02,622 --> 00:13:06,086
Ms. Du Ri, why are you making Ms. Hyo Jeong upset?

228
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:07,088
Well?

229
00:13:07,088 --> 00:13:08,131
Tell her you'll come to the show!

230
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:11,720
What? Say you'll come to our show!

231
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,692
Ms. Lee.

232
00:13:12,694 --> 00:13:13,994
Did you bring the inkpad?

233
00:13:14,063 --> 00:13:15,063
What?

234
00:13:15,065 --> 00:13:17,059
You didn't tell me to bring one.

235
00:13:17,061 --> 00:13:18,565
Here!

236
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:20,665
Here it is.

237
00:13:20,665 --> 00:13:23,659
Oh, this will work.

238
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,885
Oh, there we go!

239
00:13:31,885 --> 00:13:35,248
Stamped it! Deal, deal!

240
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:38,157
So it works when you ask her.

241
00:13:38,157 --> 00:13:41,207
Is it because he's a guy?

242
00:13:42,012 --> 00:13:43,312
Unnie,

243
00:13:43,312 --> 00:13:44,435
Producer,

244
00:13:44,443 --> 00:13:47,215
it won't work even if you keep asking me like this.

245
00:13:47,217 --> 00:13:48,217
Hey, Ga Du Ri!

246
00:13:48,219 --> 00:13:50,040
See what happens if you don't come to our show!

247
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,437
I'll report you for operating an unregistered business here!

248
00:13:53,437 --> 00:13:54,937
Why are you doing this?

249
00:13:54,937 --> 00:13:57,946
You're the one disrupting my business!

250
00:13:57,948 --> 00:14:00,082
How dare you talk back to your superiors like that?

251
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,700
Do you think we came not knowing about your backdoor tarot reading?

252
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,151
Hey! Where are you going? I'm still here, you know!

253
00:14:06,151 --> 00:14:08,757
Hey, get out of my way! Geez!

254
00:14:11,326 --> 00:14:14,282
Oh, no. I have hot sauce coming out of my nose.

255
00:14:14,282 --> 00:14:15,229
Is this blood?

256
00:14:15,231 --> 00:14:18,045
Producer! Producer!

257
00:14:19,706 --> 00:14:22,070
The blood isn't what matters!

258
00:14:22,082 --> 00:14:23,574
You come over here!

259
00:14:23,574 --> 00:14:27,489
I'm still talking to you! How dare you...

260
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:45,292
You seem busy. I'll come back another time.

261
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,481
 What? Who's that guy?

262
00:15:04,481 --> 00:15:09,118
 Isn't that Cha Woo Bin, the CEO of FILA Underwear?

263
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,704
Ms. Du Ri, see you again!

264
00:15:58,704 --> 00:16:02,309
I'll be back with your casting contract tomorrow!

265
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:05,199
Goodbye.

266
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,985
Please, go.

267
00:16:06,985 --> 00:16:08,996
Mr. Chauffeur, please blow into the breathalyzer!

268
00:16:08,996 --> 00:16:09,998
Blow on it!

269
00:16:09,998 --> 00:16:11,928
Blow, blow.

270
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:14,359
Such a nuisance...

271
00:16:15,151 --> 00:16:17,151
They haven't changed.

272
00:16:22,444 --> 00:16:26,176
 Ms. Park, aren't you too wary of Ms. Du Ri just because she's pretty?

273
00:16:26,178 --> 00:16:29,021
 Didn't you read the tabloids recently?

274
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,660
 She ought to know her place.

275
00:16:30,662 --> 00:16:33,934
 The Ms. Ga in this rumor is Ms. Ga Du Ri.

276
00:16:33,936 --> 00:16:37,756
 Ms. Ga, the stunning Black Widow from W Network.

277
00:16:37,756 --> 00:16:40,976
 Is there anyone else with the surname Ga on our network?

278
00:16:40,976 --> 00:16:41,918
 But...

279
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,164
 the rumor might not be true.

280
00:16:44,164 --> 00:16:47,306
 I think they're just on friendly terms.

281
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,496
 Oh, our youngest is so innocent I can't even say!

282
00:16:49,498 --> 00:16:54,018
 Oh, whatever. Anyway the fact is Ms. Ga Du Ri can cast big names on our show.

283
00:16:54,018 --> 00:16:55,209
 That's her talent.

284
00:16:55,209 --> 00:16:57,890
 Producer Ma! This isn't a joking matter!

285
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,873
 Do you know how many men she's messing around with right now?

286
00:16:59,873 --> 00:17:02,317
 She has men on the hook everywhere!

287
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:05,746
 PDs, actors, K-pop stars, even their managers...

288
00:17:05,748 --> 00:17:07,410
 Oh, I can't...

289
00:17:07,412 --> 00:17:11,556
 It's so humiliating to be on the same team as her!

290
00:17:11,556 --> 00:17:12,723
 Then

291
00:17:12,723 --> 00:17:15,946
 is it true she's dating Woo Jin from the Men in Black, too?

292
00:17:15,946 --> 00:17:18,395
 I thought she was dating PD Choi from the other team!

293
00:17:18,396 --> 00:17:19,995
 Oh, this is shocking!

294
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:22,762
 If an article gets out about this,

295
00:17:22,763 --> 00:17:25,717
 our show might be canceled!

296
00:17:25,717 --> 00:17:28,334
 It's only a matter of time until the director finds out.

297
00:17:28,334 --> 00:17:30,356
 Producer, deal with this before it gets to the director!

298
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,762
 We can't have our show canceled.

299
00:17:33,764 --> 00:17:35,910
 Should I really fire her?

300
00:17:45,145 --> 00:17:46,245
Oh...

301
00:17:46,245 --> 00:17:49,801
About that, I think he stopped here to buy raw fish.

302
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,239
What should I have with my beer tonight?

303
00:18:29,893 --> 00:18:31,993
Excuse me!

304
00:18:31,993 --> 00:18:34,404
Is anyone home?

305
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:37,049
Oh, please leave it there!

306
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:39,734
Did he know I was coming?

307
00:18:39,734 --> 00:18:41,978
How did he know I would bring something?

308
00:18:44,574 --> 00:18:47,528
Then excuse me!

309
00:19:05,105 --> 00:19:07,249
What's all this?

310
00:19:20,165 --> 00:19:22,117
- My goodness! 
 - Oh! Oh!

311
00:19:22,117 --> 00:19:23,957

312
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:32,100
 Episode 7 Preview

313
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:35,676
 What was with that writer from earlier?

314
00:19:35,684 --> 00:19:37,395
 And why was she talking about Du Ri?

315
00:19:37,397 --> 00:19:38,543
 How on earth are you going to convince him?

316
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:40,006
 You know Ms. Ga Du Ri, right?

317
00:19:40,006 --> 00:19:43,171
 Do you know Writer Park Hyo Jeong from WBC? She came to our company building café.

318
00:19:43,178 --> 00:19:44,856
 Why didn't you tell me?

319
00:19:44,858 --> 00:19:47,278
 I didn't get the chance.

320
00:19:47,278 --> 00:19:48,236
 Excuse me.

321
00:19:48,236 --> 00:19:49,139
 Ms. Ga Du Ri?

322
00:19:49,139 --> 00:19:51,139
 Mr. Cha Woo Bin?

323
00:19:52,865 --> 00:19:56,689
 Ga Du Ri Restaurant
