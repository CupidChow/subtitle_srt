00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,500
 Ga Du Ri Restaurant

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,400
I'll be right back!

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:19,970

4
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,904
The onions are really burning my eyes.

5
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,300
It hurts so much.

6
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,600
 Ga Du Ri Restaurant

7
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,800
 It's her. It's definitely her.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,800
 The girl who was sobbing on the bus.

9
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,900
 Are you feeling unwell?

10
00:01:03,447 --> 00:01:05,400
 Oppa, look at her.

11
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,050
 She's crying.

12
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,500
 What? Why is she crying? Did she get dumped?

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,900
 This bus is going back to the terminal. Please get off and take the next bus.

14
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Geez, Dude! Where are you? What's taking you so long?

15
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,006
 Oh, sorry.

16
00:02:45,006 --> 00:02:47,031
 I dozed on the bus.

17
00:02:47,031 --> 00:02:48,972
 I'll be right there.

18
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,600
Has she kept that

19
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,100
for seven years?

20
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,163
What is this?

21
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,300
To hell with fate.

22
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,900
I'm so sick and tired of it!

23
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,500
The Wheel of Fortune? Yes, right.

24
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,700
More like the Wheel of Craziness!

25
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,500
Sir?

26
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
What is it?

27
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,300
Don't you owe me an explanation?

28
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,913
About yesterday!

29
00:05:35,913 --> 00:05:37,231
Last night, at Ga Du Ri Restaurant–

30
00:05:37,231 --> 00:05:39,300
Charity!

31
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,800
It's like charity work. Don't worry about it.

32
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,800
What charity work?

33
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,500
You know, like how any normal human being

34
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,000
would have compassion for others, right?

35
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,600
Like when you see a lost child, you want to help find his or her parents.

36
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,489
It's just like that, nothing else.

37
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,624
You might be able to fool everyone else,

38
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:02,428
but you can't fool me. I've known you all these years!

39
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:04,371
Your eyes are slightly shaking!

40
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:06,900
Your lips are tight! Pretending you're not...

41
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,900
Pretending nothing happened worth telling!

42
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,680
And that chin, held up at a 15° angle!

43
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,700
That face tells me I should be concerned about this.

44
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,748
There's something else you should be concerned about.

45
00:06:15,748 --> 00:06:20,020
What about that marketing report you were supposed to give me today?

46
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,500
Oh, wow...

47
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,800
Wow... That's so petty!

48
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,153
Are you dropping honorifics? We're at work right now.

49
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,500
Oh, fine, fine. I'll be back with a report before the end of the day.

50
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,000
I can investigate on my own!

51
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:56,786
Are you still sulking?

52
00:06:56,786 --> 00:06:58,300
Is it because I didn't tell you what happened last night?

53
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,300
Oh! Why would you think so? I am not sulking!

54
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,219
Then why are you coming with me?

55
00:07:04,219 --> 00:07:06,141
I'm just going my own way.

56
00:07:06,141 --> 00:07:10,400
So, Sir, you can also go your own way!

57
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,900
Oh! And don't forget

58
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,266
that I never hold grudges!

59
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:17,417
Fine.

60
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,800
Here you go, a bottle of Jinro!

61
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:33,800
- Hello! 
 - Welcome–

62
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,900
Are you Mr. Cha Woo Bin's secretary?

63
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,500
I knew it! I knew you'd remember me!

64
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,200
Of course, I would!

65
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,888
Are you here on your own?

66
00:07:42,888 --> 00:07:44,500
Yes! I'm here as a guest!

67
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,000
I heard the raw fish here is really famous.

68
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,600
That's right!  Please sit here.

69
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,000
What would you like?

70
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,361
A raw fish platter

71
00:07:51,361 --> 00:07:52,706
and a bottle of Soju, please!

72
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,900

Drink it up!

77

Drink it up! Drink it up, drink!

78
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,454
W-W-Wow!

79

This is so good!

80
00:08:35,701 --> 00:08:37,500
Right? Another glass? Deal?

81
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,193
- It's a deal! 
 - Okay!

96
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,400
Why are you just sitting there?

97
00:09:56,574 --> 00:09:57,900
Oh? O-O-Oh?

98
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,500
These... these sunglasses...

99
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,500
This is the only luxury item Woo Bin had

100
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,600
that I couldn't buy for myself!

101
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,800
These are definitely the sunglasses!

102
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
Why are they here?

103
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,910
Cheers!

104
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,141
 Sunglasses...

105
00:10:52,313 --> 00:10:54,844
sunglasses...

106
00:10:54,844 --> 00:10:56,617
What did you say?

107
00:10:56,617 --> 00:10:58,128
No...

108
00:10:58,128 --> 00:11:00,479
Those sungl... No.

109
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,151
Th-th-those... them...

110
00:11:03,151 --> 00:11:04,886
Where did you get–

111
00:11:04,886 --> 00:11:07,112
What are you saying?

112
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:10,678
Hey, Little Brother, Tae Kyung, since I'm in a good mood,

113
00:11:10,678 --> 00:11:13,171
I'll read your tarot cards.

114
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:15,104
Oh! Wow!

115
00:11:16,693 --> 00:11:18,531
You're so cool.

116
00:11:18,531 --> 00:11:20,256
Right?

117
00:11:24,086 --> 00:11:25,478
So cool!

118
00:11:25,478 --> 00:11:27,595
I can do this without even looking.

119
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,644
Okay! Pick one.

120
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,682
This one...

121
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:46,303
Oh... oh...

122
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,877
We...

123
00:11:48,877 --> 00:11:51,183
have "Hope."

124
00:11:51,183 --> 00:11:54,940
We have hope!

125
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,028
Is that good?

126
00:11:56,028 --> 00:11:58,738
Yes. It's super good!

127
00:11:59,574 --> 00:12:00,987
Well, then...

128
00:12:02,581 --> 00:12:04,518
- You can have it. 
 - What?

129
00:12:04,518 --> 00:12:07,148
The hope that I picked,

130
00:12:07,148 --> 00:12:09,178
I'll give it to you.

131
00:12:10,933 --> 00:12:12,970
Really?

132
00:12:13,688 --> 00:12:15,849
- For real? 
  - You can have as much as you want.

133
00:12:15,849 --> 00:12:17,986
Hope. Here you go!

134
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,498
Hope!

135
00:12:20,498 --> 00:12:22,227
Hope...

136
00:12:22,227 --> 00:12:24,023
Instead...

137
00:12:25,349 --> 00:12:27,965
Those sunglasses,

138
00:12:27,965 --> 00:12:30,324
where did you... get...

139
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,475
No way.

140
00:12:33,805 --> 00:12:35,270
Where did they go?

141
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,739
Where did my sunglasses go?

142
00:12:37,739 --> 00:12:39,681
They're up there.

143
00:12:39,681 --> 00:12:40,884
Up there–

144
00:12:40,884 --> 00:12:43,618
Did you see my sunglasses?

145
00:12:43,618 --> 00:12:46,405
There... up there... up there.

146
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,495
 Mo Tae Kyung

147
00:13:24,853 --> 00:13:26,554
Why are you calling this late?

148
00:13:26,554 --> 00:13:28,760
Does Mo Tae Kyung never hold any grudges?

149
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,820
 What's up with you?

150
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,363
 What is it?

151
00:13:32,363 --> 00:13:35,985
If you're drunk then shut up and go home.

152
00:13:35,985 --> 00:13:37,274
What are you talking about?

153
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,291
 What is it?

154
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:42,299
Why am I the only one in the dark?

155
00:13:43,507 --> 00:13:44,947
He's still upset.

156
00:13:44,947 --> 00:13:50,100
 Why does Du Ri have your sunglasses?

157
00:13:58,036 --> 00:14:00,110
Wow, Tae Kyung,

158
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,540
your boss is here.

159
00:14:03,114 --> 00:14:06,194
Whatever, I'm not at work anymore.

160
00:14:06,194 --> 00:14:09,068
Sh*t. Bite me.

161
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:11,704
Does he usually get drunk this easily?

162
00:14:11,704 --> 00:14:13,141
So hilarious!

163
00:14:13,141 --> 00:14:16,513
I think you two are similarly drunk.

164
00:14:17,384 --> 00:14:19,729
Hey, that hurt my pride.

165
00:14:19,729 --> 00:14:23,609
I can hold my liquor at least better than my little bro here.

166
00:14:23,609 --> 00:14:26,626
- Your little bro? 
 - Yes.

167
00:14:26,626 --> 00:14:28,816
He's my little bro, Tae Kyung.

168
00:14:28,816 --> 00:14:33,439
Starting today, he's my brother from another mother.

169
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,971
- We are! 
 - Siblings!

170
00:14:36,957 --> 00:14:38,734
Look at him.

171
00:14:38,734 --> 00:14:41,097
I can hold my alcohol better than he can.

172
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:43,084
Come on...

173
00:14:43,084 --> 00:14:44,455
Sibling? You just met.

174
00:14:44,455 --> 00:14:46,208
We get along really well,

175
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,416
and...

176
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,314
we also might have met each other in the past

177
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,781
because our schools were located close to each other.

178
00:14:52,781 --> 00:14:56,531
I went to S University near the intersection over there,

179
00:14:56,531 --> 00:14:59,749
and my bro, Tae Kyung, went to the school right next to it–

180
00:14:59,749 --> 00:15:00,752
H.

181
00:15:00,752 --> 00:15:02,765
Yes, H University.

182
00:15:02,765 --> 00:15:06,398
In that case, you could have run into me more often.

183
00:15:06,398 --> 00:15:07,747
What?

184
00:15:09,305 --> 00:15:11,962
I went to your school.

185
00:15:11,962 --> 00:15:13,281
Really?

186
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:16,496
Awesome, that's so interesting!

187
00:15:16,496 --> 00:15:18,951
Then you could have known me then.

188
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,825
Don't you know me?

189
00:15:23,015 --> 00:15:24,043
I don't.

190
00:15:24,043 --> 00:15:27,012
Come on, think about it. Really, don't you know me?

191
00:15:27,012 --> 00:15:30,952
I used to be sort of famous back in those days.

192
00:15:30,952 --> 00:15:35,035
The Goddess of S University, Ga Du Ri!

193
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:37,597
Ga Du Ri. Ga Du Ri.

194
00:15:52,728 --> 00:15:55,579
No. You were ugly.

195
00:15:58,368 --> 00:16:00,363
Who was?

196
00:16:00,363 --> 00:16:02,083
Was I?

197
00:16:03,938 --> 00:16:06,243
That can't be.

198
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:11,850
You were really ugly when you cried.

199
00:16:13,384 --> 00:16:14,725
Excuse me?

200
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:47,198
It's mine, right?

201
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:49,032
These sunglasses...

202
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:17,880

203
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,079

204
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,583
 So she does know that she's pretty, right?

205
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,233
 I heard this is a great place to get dating advice.

206
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:26,711
 - Hey! 
 - Is this blood?

207
00:17:26,711 --> 00:17:28,612
 How dare you talk back to your superiors like that?

208
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:29,829
 Why are you doing this?

209
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:32,095
 Those sunglasses look good on you,

210
00:17:32,095 --> 00:17:33,618
 back then, and even now.

211
00:17:33,618 --> 00:17:37,502
 But... How is it that you remember me?

212
00:17:40,113 --> 00:17:43,485
