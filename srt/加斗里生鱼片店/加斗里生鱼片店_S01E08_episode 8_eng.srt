1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,920

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,980
Good morning!

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,380
Morning!

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,090
We talked until too late last night, didn't we?

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,415
Since you have work today, you must be tired.

6
00:00:18,415 --> 00:00:20,263
You, too.

7
00:00:26,476 --> 00:00:28,599
 This...

8
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:31,359
 feels very weird.

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,100
 What does?

10
00:00:35,556 --> 00:00:39,051
 I'm so used to living alone,

11
00:00:40,616 --> 00:00:43,366
 and now when someone tells me

12
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:47,186
 that I did a good job today,

13
00:00:50,226 --> 00:00:51,952
 it feels great.

14
00:00:55,712 --> 00:00:57,488
 Me, too.

15
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:08,942
I still can't get used to you in a suit.

16
00:01:08,942 --> 00:01:10,015
Do I look weird?

17
00:01:10,015 --> 00:01:12,174
No, you look great!

18
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,532
Really?

19
00:01:17,886 --> 00:01:20,160
Anyway, have a nice day.

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,154
Thanks! You, too.

21
00:01:22,154 --> 00:01:23,977
Okay!

22
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,703
 FILA Underwear

23
00:01:59,297 --> 00:02:02,564
Would you like another cup of coffee?

24
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,622
What did you say?

25
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,055
I'd like some water, please.

26
00:02:18,116 --> 00:02:20,159
Here you go.

27
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:27,792
What? I finished the drink.

28
00:02:38,994 --> 00:02:40,752
What would you like to order?

29
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,810
One Iced Americano.

30
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,260
 Where did she go?

31
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,690
 Plain yogurt, too.

32
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,154
Here you go!

33
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:49,600
I'll refill your coffee.

34
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,400
Oh... Yes...

35
00:02:52,404 --> 00:02:54,142
Th-Th-Thank you.

36
00:02:54,142 --> 00:02:55,893
Enjoy!

37
00:02:55,893 --> 00:03:01,931
But... Why are you giving me a refill?

38
00:03:12,621 --> 00:03:14,290
Wow!

39
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,273
Am I the only one who got a refill?

40
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:24,796
Is this the famous "green light"?

41
00:04:00,428 --> 00:04:02,181
Here you go.

42
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,145
Thank you.

43
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:07,345
Isn't that very heavy?

44
00:04:07,345 --> 00:04:08,461
Should I carry them for you?

45
00:04:08,461 --> 00:04:09,672
No, it's fine.

46
00:04:09,672 --> 00:04:12,181
But they look really heavy.

47
00:04:12,181 --> 00:04:14,331
This is a piece of cake for me.

48
00:04:14,331 --> 00:04:17,451
You're very social. You must be one of the cool kids.

49
00:04:17,451 --> 00:04:19,877
You're really popular in school, right?

50
00:04:19,877 --> 00:04:21,294
Not at all.

51
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:24,174
But do you run a restaurant?

52
00:04:24,174 --> 00:04:26,971
These don't look like groceries for an ordinary household.

53
00:04:26,971 --> 00:04:28,657
You even have sharp eyes.

54
00:04:28,657 --> 00:04:30,341
My uncle runs a café.

55
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:32,572
And I help get the groceries sometimes.

56
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,841
My girlfriend works part-time there, too.

57
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,396
Stop by my restaurant sometime with your girlfriend.

58
00:04:37,396 --> 00:04:38,810
The side dishes are on the house!

59
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,529
Really? Okay, then!

60
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:43,825
It's a raw fish place nearby called Ga Du Ri Restaurant.

61
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,517
Oh... Is it a raw fish place?

62
00:04:45,517 --> 00:04:46,973
Why?

63
00:04:46,973 --> 00:04:48,849
Chung Nam can't eat raw fish.

64
00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:51,496
Oh, Chung Nam is the name of my girlfriend.

65
00:04:51,496 --> 00:04:53,441
That's too bad.

66
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:55,087
Du Ri!

67
00:05:08,412 --> 00:05:09,435
What is this?

68
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:11,859
The scent of a...

69
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,474
somewhat familiar guy?

70
00:05:15,474 --> 00:05:17,817
Haven't we met before?

71
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,600
Well... I-I'm not sure.

72
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,713
I think it's my first time meeting you.

73
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,087
I can carry them from here.

74
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:29,679
It was nice meeting you.

75
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:30,684
Me, too.

76
00:05:30,684 --> 00:05:33,758
Oh, I'll drop by your restaurant with my friends!

77
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,011
Hey, Chung Nam, I'm on my way.

78
00:05:41,013 --> 00:05:42,704
Yes!

79
00:05:45,817 --> 00:05:48,264
But why are you here at this time of the day?

80
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,887
Aren't you supposed to be working?

81
00:05:49,887 --> 00:05:53,204
Something more important than work came up.

82
00:05:53,204 --> 00:05:55,624
Du Ri, I finally found her.

83
00:05:55,624 --> 00:05:58,057
My fate! My destiny!

84
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,383
What?

85
00:06:03,272 --> 00:06:06,077
There's still a lot of time until I open...

86
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,228
Du Ri, hold on!

87
00:06:10,228 --> 00:06:11,359
Don't go.

88
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:12,834
What?

89
00:06:13,572 --> 00:06:15,665
My hunch is at a scientific level.

90
00:06:15,665 --> 00:06:18,890
I sense something fishy.

91
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:22,911
They don't look like customers to me.

92
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,728
What is this?

93
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,349
What's wrong with you?

94
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:36,328
Where were you during work hours?

95
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,067
What's happening right now?

96
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,103
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:42,103 --> 00:06:44,627
Can I stay here for just an hour?

98
00:06:44,627 --> 00:06:48,566
She wanted to go somewhere else, but I brought her here.

99
00:06:48,566 --> 00:06:52,009
All hell broke loose in front of the restaurant.

100
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:53,226
What do you mean?

101
00:06:53,226 --> 00:06:55,139
So what happened was...

102
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:58,466
I was working my a** off at the café

103
00:06:58,466 --> 00:07:01,736
and this really cute part-timer

104
00:07:01,736 --> 00:07:04,189
asked if I wanted

105
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:05,170
a refill on my coffee.

106
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,556
For only me, just my table!

107
00:07:07,556 --> 00:07:09,334
And I was so sure

108
00:07:09,334 --> 00:07:12,497
this was a green light (go for it)!

109
00:07:12,497 --> 00:07:16,431
I mean... That's your story.

110
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,870
So why is Ms. Du Ri–

111
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,322
Just wait for it!

112
00:07:20,322 --> 00:07:23,532
The story continues...

113
00:07:23,532 --> 00:07:25,994
 Anyway I was on my way to meet Du Ri,

114
00:07:25,994 --> 00:07:29,827
 and there was a really cute guy standing next to her.

115
00:07:29,827 --> 00:07:31,549
 Hold it!

116
00:07:31,549 --> 00:07:32,694
Who was that guy?

117
00:07:32,694 --> 00:07:34,845
How should I know?

118
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,507
He was just a passerby.

119
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,265
Okay, Tae Kyung, please just get to the point.

120
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:47,704
Okay, right, straight to the point!

121
00:07:47,704 --> 00:07:49,070
I, Mo Tae Kyung,

122
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:52,970
 a real man with Du Ri's heavy groceries in hand walked her to the restaurant.

123
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,425
 When we got there, a strange crowd was in front of the restaurant.

124
00:07:56,425 --> 00:07:58,337
And I had a hunch!

125
00:07:58,337 --> 00:07:59,993
What did I tell you about Mo Tae Kyung's hunch?

126
00:07:59,993 --> 00:08:00,707
It's science!

127
00:08:00,707 --> 00:08:03,603
Right, right! My hunch is science!

128
00:08:03,603 --> 00:08:05,411
Geez...

129
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,586
I'll get to the point now.

130
00:08:10,586 --> 00:08:14,109
What happened was...

131
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,857
 I think that's her!

132
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,941
 Ms. Ga Du Ri! You're Ms. Ga Du Ri, right?

133
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:25,495
 No, she isn't! We don't know who that is!

134
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,600
 We're from Masspatch. Are the rumors true about Woo Jin of Men in Black?

135
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,360
 You were his girlfriend for a long time, right?

136
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,385
 Is it true that Woo Jin retired from the show after you broke up?

137
00:08:33,385 --> 00:08:34,364
 Tell us the truth!

138
00:08:34,364 --> 00:08:37,900
 A comment, please.

139
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,620
 Seriously!

140
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,799
 What's all this?

141
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,050
 How can you harass a civilian like this?

142
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,762
 You stay out of this.

143
00:08:45,762 --> 00:08:48,676
 To this day, nobody knows why Woo Jin, the nation's little brother

144
00:08:48,676 --> 00:08:51,185
 suddenly retired from the show two years ago.

145
00:08:51,185 --> 00:08:54,380
 Rumors say photos prove it. You should just be honest and tell us.

146
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,681
 A comment, please!

147
00:09:00,883 --> 00:09:03,003
 Wait!

148
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,109
 Nothing like that ever happened.

149
00:09:06,109 --> 00:09:10,511
 If you keep following me, I'll report all of you to the police.

150
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,787
 Du Ri, I hope I can be of help this time.

151
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:41,692
"Two years ago, the beloved nation's little brother A,"

152
00:09:41,692 --> 00:09:44,307
"member of a popular idol group T, retired from the show."

153
00:09:44,307 --> 00:09:46,844
"At last, his reason behind retirement has been revealed."

154
00:09:46,844 --> 00:09:51,946
"It was because he broke up with Writer B, who worked on the same show."

155
00:09:51,946 --> 00:09:54,840
 "Writer B, who worked at WBC, was very beautiful and glamorous"

156
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,517
 "which made her very popular among people at the network as well as celebrities."

157
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:02,237
 "A loved B with all his heart,"

158
00:10:02,237 --> 00:10:06,707
 "but he was just another guy on her countless hooks."

159
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:11,565
 "After realizing it, A was so shocked that he couldn't continue performing"

160
00:10:11,565 --> 00:10:13,568
 "and announced his retirement."

161
00:10:13,568 --> 00:10:16,998
 "Writer B is currently running a raw fish restaurant in Seoul."

162
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,520
It's so obvious

163
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,090
who spread these rumors.

164
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,371
Yes, I can tell who it is, too.

165
00:10:31,371 --> 00:10:33,417
It's that writer named Park Hyo Jeong, right?

166
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:36,683
I knew it the moment she came to meet you at the company.

167
00:10:36,685 --> 00:10:38,341
It was written all over her face!

168
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:40,224
I tell you, hunches and physiognomy are based on science!

169
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:42,137
It's a hard and fast rule!

170
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:43,491
I'm not going to hold back anymore!

171
00:10:43,493 --> 00:10:45,191
Ms. Du Ri,

172
00:10:46,038 --> 00:10:48,214
do you want me to come with you?

173
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,417
No!

174
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:51,546
I can do this on my own.

175
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,736
Okay, good luck.

176
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:00,301
I know that you're going to handle this just fine.

177
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,118
Yes.

178
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,264
See you at the restaurant later.

179
00:11:07,264 --> 00:11:08,910
Okay.

180
00:11:12,447 --> 00:11:14,433
Du Ri, Fighting!

181
00:11:26,859 --> 00:11:30,177
 Three years ago

182
00:12:52,611 --> 00:12:54,910
What do you think you're doing?

183
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:18,480

184
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:22,219
 Episode 9 Preview

185
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:26,090
♫  I don’t remember    ♫

186
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:29,940
♫  The last time I laughed   ♫

187
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,900
♫  As much as I wanted  ♫

188
00:13:31,935 --> 00:13:33,207
 Is there something you need?

189
00:13:33,207 --> 00:13:36,215
 Well, then tomorrow would you like to go on a date with me?

190
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,143
 - Du Ri. 
 - Why are you here?

191
00:13:38,143 --> 00:13:39,862
 A gift!

192
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:41,645
 I'm to blame for everything.

193
00:13:41,645 --> 00:13:43,135
 Does she like macaroons?

194
00:13:43,135 --> 00:13:45,567
 Ms. Kim Ah Young, who works here?

195
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:48,926
 Ms. Ah Young!

196
00:13:48,926 --> 00:13:51,786
 Can I ask you something?

197
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:57,188
