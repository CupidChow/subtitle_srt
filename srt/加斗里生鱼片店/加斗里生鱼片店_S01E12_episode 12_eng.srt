1
00:00:04,054 --> 00:00:05,714
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

2
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:08,928
- Are you here with your boyfriend today? 
 - Yes.

3
00:00:08,928 --> 00:00:10,135
You look great together.

4
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,285
Thank you.

5
00:00:11,285 --> 00:00:13,853
- Bye. 
 - Have a great day.

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:23,070

7
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,025
Secretary Mo.

8
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:40,548
What's up with you since yesterday?

9
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,515
Why are you so quiet?

10
00:00:44,515 --> 00:00:45,951
What about me?

11
00:00:45,951 --> 00:00:47,421
Usually,

12
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:51,422
when I even dare to yawn, you start giving me an endless lecture

13
00:00:51,422 --> 00:00:55,010
that the CEO shouldn't yawn during work hours.

14
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,772
Is there something wrong?

15
00:00:57,772 --> 00:01:01,883
Since when were you so interested in me?

16
00:01:01,883 --> 00:01:04,757
Just act like you usually do.

17
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,592
Is something really up with him?

18
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,781
 Assistant Manager Bang Seong Woo: Where are you, Secretary Mo?

19
00:01:29,781 --> 00:01:31,788
 Are you at the rooftop again?

20
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:38,011
It's really over between Ms. Ah Young and me.

21
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:40,524
♫ It's the end.

22
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,922
Maybe I should have asked her the reason.

23
00:01:45,922 --> 00:01:50,550
Maybe she was in real trouble or something. I was the only one she could turn to.

24
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,273
No, no, that's not right.

25
00:01:52,273 --> 00:01:54,529
What are you saying, Mo Tae Kyung?

26
00:01:54,529 --> 00:01:56,341
Does she count on you? Right.

27
00:01:56,341 --> 00:02:00,761
We aren't even dating or anything.

28
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,649
Get a grip.

29
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:06,993
You must pull yourself together.

30
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,256
See? I knew he would be here.

31
00:02:15,256 --> 00:02:16,977
Secretary Mo!

32
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,227
What is it?

33
00:02:27,227 --> 00:02:29,747
Why won't you answer my messages?

34
00:02:29,747 --> 00:02:31,375
First, I must apologize.

35
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,601
I should have checked more carefully.

36
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:36,329
I heard my Ms. Ah Young made a mistake toward you.

37
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:38,404
 My Ms. Ah Young?

38
00:02:38,404 --> 00:02:41,192
 I mean, why would he be checking Ms. Ah Young's money?

39
00:02:41,192 --> 00:02:44,065
 And why did they come together?

40
00:02:44,065 --> 00:02:48,122
 Don't tell me she fell for that womanizer already!

41
00:02:48,122 --> 00:02:49,856
 That b*stard, really!

42
00:02:49,856 --> 00:02:51,166
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:54,621
I didn't know Ms. Ah Young would go talk to you right away.

44
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:56,045
Ms. Ah Young, why just stand there?

45
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:57,925
Apologize to Secretary Mo again.

46
00:02:57,925 --> 00:03:00,253
I'm really sorry.

47
00:03:00,253 --> 00:03:01,251
Hold on, Mr. Bang Seong Woo.

48
00:03:01,251 --> 00:03:04,349
Why did you make Ms. Ah Young apologize to me like this?

49
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:05,943
Pardon?

50
00:03:05,943 --> 00:03:07,562
Then what should have I done?

51
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:11,117
If you needed money, you should ask me directly!

52
00:03:11,117 --> 00:03:14,562
Well, that doesn't mean I would have lent you money, but still...

53
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:16,523
No... Excuse me...

54
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,615
Secretary Mo, I don't know what you're talking about.

55
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,694
Are you pretending you don't get it? What a coward!

56
00:03:24,694 --> 00:03:28,479
But the mistake with this month's paycheck wasn't

57
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,485
made by me but Ms. Ah Young.

58
00:03:30,485 --> 00:03:34,223
Even if you made a mistake with this month's paycheck...

59
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,533
Made a mistake with what?

60
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:39,628
Your paycheck for this month.

61
00:03:39,628 --> 00:03:42,079
She confused your paycheck with Mr. Mo Ji Woo's from the PR Team.

62
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:45,456
Didn't you know that there was an error with your paycheck?

63
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:48,647
I'm really sorry.

64
00:03:52,502 --> 00:03:53,975
 Please

65
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,445
 give the money back!

66
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,914
 Back! Please give the money back!

67
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:09,966
Here. Please check it. I sent the money back.

68
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,902
Thank you so much.

69
00:04:12,902 --> 00:04:14,706
I'm sorry for causing all this trouble.

70
00:04:14,706 --> 00:04:18,460
No! It's nothing. It's fine.

71
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:22,203
I'm sorry for not hearing you out till the end.

72
00:04:22,203 --> 00:04:25,556
You must have really worried then.

73
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,524
I'm very sorry I misunderstood you.

74
00:04:27,524 --> 00:04:29,454
You were so startled, right?

75
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,400
I'm sorry. I should have double-checked.

76
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,179
Secretary Mo.

77
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:05,850
Ms. Ah Young,

78
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,228
that date we couldn't go on last week,

79
00:05:09,228 --> 00:05:11,492
let's do it this week.

80
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,924
W-Why?

81
00:05:17,924 --> 00:05:22,781
Is it that you don't... want to?

82
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,316
No. I'd like to.

83
00:05:27,316 --> 00:05:29,552
I like you more!

84
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,678
You're cute.

85
00:05:37,678 --> 00:05:40,437
You're cuter, Secretary Mo.

86
00:05:41,762 --> 00:05:43,738
That sunglasses idea is original.

87
00:05:43,738 --> 00:05:46,106
Should I try it on my Mi So?

88
00:05:46,106 --> 00:05:48,300
I should order one first.

89
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,980
What do you want to do this weekend?

90
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,411
Would you like to go see a movie?

91
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:55,655
What kind of movie would you like to watch?

92
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,894
How about a horror movie?

93
00:05:57,894 --> 00:06:00,989
H-H-Horror...

94
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,088
 From now on, we won't be serving the Ga Du Ri Special here anymore.

95
00:06:08,088 --> 00:06:13,005
 Instead, we'll officially open Ga Du Ri Tarot Cards starting next Monday.

96
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:17,881
 To get a tarot reading, please DM (direct message) us with your story!

97
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,937
 Wow, this place has great service! The raw fish here is fire, too!

98
00:06:26,937 --> 00:06:30,183
 I thought the owner reading tarot cards for customers was just a rumor!

99
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:32,156
 The owner is super cool!

100
00:06:32,156 --> 00:06:33,122
 Shall we go there today?

101
00:06:33,122 --> 00:06:35,736
 Did anyone get their tarot cards read there? Reviews, please!

102
00:06:35,736 --> 00:06:37,230
 Soon Jeong: Yes, I have!

103
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:40,160
 As someone who was there already, I can definitely vouch for it!

104
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,380
Oh? It's Ms. Soon Jeong.

105
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:45,268
I guess she's doing well.

106
00:06:45,268 --> 00:06:47,710
 Woo Bin: The raw halibut here is amazing.

107
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:52,907
 For your information, the owner has a really, really handsome boyfriend.

108
00:06:52,907 --> 00:06:54,513
That's Mr. Woo Bin.

109
00:06:54,513 --> 00:06:56,940
He's so adorable.

110
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:06,175
 One minute before getting off work.

111
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,876
Mr. CEO!

112
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,431
I'll be leaving now. Just so you know, don't contact me this weekend.

113
00:07:19,431 --> 00:07:21,173
Have I ever contacted you first?

114
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:24,970
Anyway I must go get a skincare treatment for my date on the weekend.

115
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,475
You should get one, too.

116
00:07:26,475 --> 00:07:28,439
You heard of male grooming, right?

117
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,513
Grooming means–

118
00:07:30,513 --> 00:07:32,393
I'm leaving.

119
00:07:32,393 --> 00:07:35,312
You can stay here and talk the night away.

120
00:07:35,312 --> 00:07:37,023
"You can stay here and talk the night away," right?

121
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:41,052
I'll talk the night away with Ms. Ah Young!

122
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,230
♫  I’ll sweep, sweep everything away. Swept, swept away  ♫

123
00:07:48,231 --> 00:07:49,732
Another bottle of Soju, please!

124
00:07:49,732 --> 00:07:51,186
Yes, just a second!

125
00:07:51,186 --> 00:07:53,363
Yes, coming right up!

126
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:57,260
♫  The pain is that people’s common love is not real love  ♫

127
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,212
Thanks.

128
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:04,540
♫  I’ll sweep, sweep away. I'll blow everything away  ♫

129
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,500
Here's the raw fish. Please enjoy!

130
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,300
- Welcome! 
 - Hello.

131
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,802
Did you see it earlier?

132
00:08:15,802 --> 00:08:18,926
Yes, that guy in the tuxedo was sobbing like crazy.

133
00:08:18,926 --> 00:08:20,420
He seemed normal though.

134
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,162
I know, right?

135
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,610
Let's just order.

136
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,390
I want this one.

137
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,540
No, let's order the wraps.

138
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:32,380
Since you're paying, I want something expensive.

139
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,810
♫  The end of love  ♫

140
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:46,010
♫  After a long time  ♫

141
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,496
Du Ri...

142
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,857
I mustered up all my courage to come here for the last time.

143
00:09:00,857 --> 00:09:02,678
What?

144
00:09:02,678 --> 00:09:06,167
I know that I'm thick-skinned to be acting like this,

145
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:08,108
- but– 
 - Stop it.

146
00:09:08,108 --> 00:09:09,821
What's your excuse this time?

147
00:09:09,821 --> 00:09:11,697
I'm sorry.

148
00:09:11,697 --> 00:09:13,416
Really...

149
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,630
I'm really, truly sorry.

150
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:21,536
I wanted to apologize to you sincerely if I ever had a chance.

151
00:09:23,236 --> 00:09:27,404
That's why I came here last time.

152
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,927
But I was too much of a coward to tell you then.

153
00:09:33,714 --> 00:09:36,156
And I dragged it on till today.

154
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,811
In the end...

155
00:09:39,547 --> 00:09:42,265
I get to tell you this now in the end.

156
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,534
You know me well.

157
00:09:46,534 --> 00:09:51,851
I never take responsibility for what I do.

158
00:09:51,851 --> 00:09:54,526
I always blame other people.

159
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,771
But...

160
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:02,007
I don't want to be a loser and coward to the end.

161
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,721
Please forgive this idiot,

162
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,672
the idiot from the past.

163
00:10:10,672 --> 00:10:12,192
And...

164
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:15,631
Woo Joo as well.

165
00:10:15,631 --> 00:10:18,500
Why are you apologizing on my behalf?

166
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,800
Woo Joo, no, well...

167
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,734
Is this why you were lurking around here?

168
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,233
I'm really sorry to you, too.

169
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,026
I mean it.

170
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:42,009
Did we go through all that, just to face this?

171
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,372
I know you're very upset,

172
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,716
but I really wanted to apologize to Du Ri

173
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,526
before it was too late.

174
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,583
Even if it meant

175
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,017
you breaking off the marriage,

176
00:11:02,025 --> 00:11:03,298
I had to.

177
00:11:03,298 --> 00:11:05,766
You could have told me earlier.

178
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,830
What?

179
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:15,103
If you had told me earlier, then I didn't have to live like this.

180
00:11:15,103 --> 00:11:18,209
I didn't have to pretend I was fine!

181
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,574
Woo Joo.

182
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:28,054
I've been suffering from a huge inferiority complex,

183
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:32,234
ever since I was your best friend, until now.

184
00:11:32,921 --> 00:11:35,815
Of course, you always had my back because you had no idea,

185
00:11:35,815 --> 00:11:38,654
not knowing it made me more miserable!

186
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,366
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

187
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,349
It may seem childish,

188
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,386
but I hated to tell you.

189
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,882
So it has come to this.

190
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,576
I'm sorry.

191
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,455
I ask you,

192
00:12:04,469 --> 00:12:07,755
why are you telling me this now?

193
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,190
What?

194
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,772
Hey, do you know how difficult it was for me?

195
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,438
I didn't even know that.

196
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:23,369
You should have told me back then.

197
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,946
I'm really sorry.

198
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,011
I'm not sorry.

199
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,923
I'm the b*stard here.

200
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:54,607
I'm sorry.

201
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,664
I'm sorry.

202
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:29,190
Woo Bin, look at this!

203
00:13:29,193 --> 00:13:31,819
It's so pretty!

204
00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:34,933
Do you like fish that much?

205
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:36,939
I'm getting jealous.

206
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:39,166
I think you like them more than you like me.

207
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:42,408
Yes, I love it here.

208
00:13:42,408 --> 00:13:43,919
Yes?

209
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,577
Pretty.

210
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,785
Woo Bin, it just talked to me!

211
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,068
What did it say?

212
00:14:30,068 --> 00:14:32,115
That Ga Du Ri is pretty.

213
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:38,900

 Thanks to all our language moderators!

218
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,612
Do you really like fish more than me?

219
00:15:05,612 --> 00:15:07,532
Well... I wonder?

220
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:09,516
Do you wonder?

221
00:15:09,516 --> 00:15:12,827
But who do you think manages this aquarium?

222
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,690
Do you want me to buy you the whole aquarium?

223
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,270
Yes, please!

224
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,928
Woo Bin, are you really going to do it?

225
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,984
Of course.

226
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,700
Once I make up my mind, I push ahead no matter what.

227
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,563
Du Ri, are you nervous?

228
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,167
No.

229
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:42,052
It's just this is the first drama actually breaking down the wall.

230
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:51,865
- Okay, let's do this! 
 - All right!

231
00:15:57,207 --> 00:16:01,125
 Coming up: One order of Ga Du Ri Special.

232
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:12,870

233
00:16:15,258 --> 00:16:21,641
 Ga Du Ri Restaurant was pleased to serve you! 
 Thanks to all our viewers!

234
00:16:21,641 --> 00:16:23,177
Yes.

235
00:16:23,177 --> 00:16:25,662
See you at the restaurant later.

236
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,198
Why did you laugh?

237
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:30,939
I'm sorry.

238
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:35,184
Let's shoot one more time. Please standby.

239
00:16:35,184 --> 00:16:37,516
Cut! Okay!

240
00:16:37,982 --> 00:16:39,086
Good night!

241
00:16:39,086 --> 00:16:41,722
Hold on!

242
00:16:41,722 --> 00:16:43,519
Look here! Oh!

243
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,007
They won't fly all over...

244
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,510
You're the one disrupting my business–

245
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,179
- I'm sorry. 
 - Okay, let's do it again.

246
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,722
You're the one dis–

247
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,870
Oh, my tongue's twisted now. What should I do?

248
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,629
I'm in trouble.

249
00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:00,819
What? I have hot sauce coming out of my nose.

250
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:03,565
 We can't see the blood. We need to see the blood.

251
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:04,924
Hey, cut it out!

252
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:06,528
Why would you pick your nose?

253
00:17:06,528 --> 00:17:10,317
Up here... Here... Over here...

254
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:17,133
What's... this... scent?

255
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,000
Scent!

256
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,900
Please stop rolling the camera, please.

257
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:32,892
♫ Love

258
00:17:32,892 --> 00:17:34,988
Oh, I can't...

259
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:36,646
I'm sorry.

260
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:45,666
