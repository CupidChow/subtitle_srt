1
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,612
If I didn’t come, would you really leave Grace here?

2
00:00:20,612 --> 00:00:23,106
Yes, I don’t like naughty kids.

3
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,588
Grace is drunk because of you every night.

4
00:00:25,588 --> 00:00:29,744
She doesn’t listen. I wanted you to see it for yourself.

5
00:00:33,431 --> 00:00:35,683
Can’t you be nicer to her?

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,420
Talk to her nicely.

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,119
She really does love you, Mook.

8
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:21,151
Seeing this, do you still want me back with Grace?

9
00:01:22,524 --> 00:01:23,428
P'Mook.

10
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,279
Why did you do it? I’m not one of your tools,

11
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:47,673
and I don’t care about whatever revenge

12
00:01:47,673 --> 00:01:49,446
you’re trying to get. Just don’t drag me into it.

13
00:01:54,252 --> 00:01:55,317
I’m sorry, Prang.

14
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:57,765
Please calm down.

15
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:02,790
I want to be alone.

16
00:02:23,995 --> 00:02:25,417
It always ends like this.

17
00:02:26,561 --> 00:02:28,304
Why would you want to meet Mook again?

18
00:02:30,593 --> 00:02:32,727
You want to torture yourself?

19
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,121
Let’s talk, Grace.

20
00:02:54,817 --> 00:02:56,090
I’ll wait in the car.

21
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:05,519
P'Mook, why didn’t you pick up my calls?

22
00:03:06,663 --> 00:03:08,109
Let go.

23
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,231
I wanted to talk to you, so you understand.

24
00:03:13,146 --> 00:03:14,600
So you could stop crying like this.

25
00:03:16,431 --> 00:03:19,721
About your mom, it’s long gone.

26
00:03:21,094 --> 00:03:24,586
It’s all in the past. Everything has changed.

27
00:03:24,586 --> 00:03:26,334
Do you understand?

28
00:03:27,264 --> 00:03:30,219
No, I don’t. Why didn’t you tell me back then?

29
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:32,124
We could have solved it together.

30
00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:35,253
Enough, Grace. There’s no point now.

31
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:40,249
You always decide everything on your own.

32
00:03:40,249 --> 00:03:42,313
You never ask me anything.

33
00:03:43,262 --> 00:03:45,266
P'Mook, I beg you.

34
00:03:45,936 --> 00:03:47,409
Please come back to me.

35
00:03:49,064 --> 00:03:51,333
Grace, I'm married.

36
00:03:52,337 --> 00:03:54,195
I’ll be your mistress.

37
00:03:54,679 --> 00:03:56,108
Just please don’t ignore me.

38
00:03:56,108 --> 00:03:58,334
Please, I beg you.

39
00:04:01,403 --> 00:04:04,376
Without you, I’m hurt. I don’t want to be like this.

40
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:06,900
Please don’t leave me.

41
00:04:07,867 --> 00:04:09,324
Please don’t leave me.

42
00:04:10,756 --> 00:04:13,499
Please don’t leave me. I’ll do anything.

43
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,762
You can call me dumb, but I’ll do anything.

44
00:04:18,213 --> 00:04:19,777
Please, P'Mook.

45
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,199
That’s enough, Grace. You’re very drunk.

46
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,657
You can send her home now.

47
00:04:49,793 --> 00:04:51,763
P'Mook. P'Mook, please don’t leave me.

48
00:04:51,763 --> 00:04:53,114
That’s enough.

49
00:05:20,348 --> 00:05:25,147
Mook, You didn’t call me. When did you come?

50
00:05:25,147 --> 00:05:30,647
Quite a while ago. Sorry. Go back and dance, I’ll go home soon.

51
00:05:30,647 --> 00:05:32,262
Okay.

52
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,109
Come here. Where’s your table? I’ll send you.

53
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,089
Don’t touch her. She’s with me.

54
00:07:15,883 --> 00:07:19,404
You got fooled by your sister, Sonprod.

55
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,694
What a messy relationship.

56
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,810
My source sent me this.

57
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,175
Ouch, I’ll give you this, Mookmanee.

58
00:07:37,548 --> 00:07:41,114
You’re the best. What is this?

59
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,570
I don’t encourage cheaters.

60
00:07:45,943 --> 00:07:49,705
What should I do about this mess?

61
00:08:03,975 --> 00:08:06,364
Take this so you don’t get a hangover.

62
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:24,760
If you don’t take it off, how are you going to take a shower?

63
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,457
No, not taking it off.

64
00:09:30,877 --> 00:09:32,143
Don’t be naughty.

65
00:09:32,635 --> 00:09:34,042
No

66
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,820
Let go.

67
00:09:38,312 --> 00:09:39,400
No

68
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:41,094
Let go.

69
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,080
Hey! Are you going to take it off, or do you want me to force you?

70
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,771
I think I want to send Mookmanee another gift.

71
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:42,866
What the hell is this? Where is the marriage certificate?

72
00:10:42,866 --> 00:10:45,465
Don’t think you can hide them, and I can’t do anything about it.

73
00:10:45,465 --> 00:10:47,958
Songprod won’t keep quiet about this.
