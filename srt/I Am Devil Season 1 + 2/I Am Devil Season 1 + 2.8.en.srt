1
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,184
They followed me to the hospital?!

2
00:00:38,929 --> 00:00:40,890
You! This again?

3
00:00:41,276 --> 00:00:43,036
Well, you were walked near me.

4
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:45,544
If you wanted to be near me, why didn’t you just say so?

5
00:00:45,544 --> 00:00:48,680
I’m a fan of skinship, you know. And it’s not like I have anyone else.

6
00:00:50,405 --> 00:00:52,195
Are you lacking warmth?

7
00:00:57,667 --> 00:00:59,863
...Yes.

8
00:01:07,286 --> 00:01:08,668
Are you a designer?

9
00:01:20,528 --> 00:01:22,261
Do you like roses?

10
00:01:22,647 --> 00:01:24,522
You’ve been staring at them for a while.

11
00:01:35,806 --> 00:01:38,511
I used to. But not anymore.

12
00:01:46,003 --> 00:01:50,207
Someone once told me that roses mean you’re in love.

13
00:01:51,683 --> 00:01:53,691
But now… I don’t like being in love,

14
00:01:53,691 --> 00:01:55,374
so I don’t like roses anymore.

15
00:01:57,099 --> 00:01:58,503
What about you, Prangdao?

16
00:01:59,638 --> 00:02:01,045
Do you like roses?

17
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,349
Why are you getting shy?

18
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:17,370
I was just asking if you like roses.

19
00:02:18,392 --> 00:02:20,269
Or… were you thinking something naughty?

20
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,600
So, is that a yes?

21
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,381
Then can I kiss you?

22
00:02:35,425 --> 00:02:36,876
Do you have any conditions?

23
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:41,595
You! There’s a camera right there, don’t you see?

24
00:02:49,744 --> 00:02:52,692
Why are you looking at the camera? Look at me.

25
00:02:57,005 --> 00:02:58,598
Here comes trouble…

26
00:03:10,117 --> 00:03:14,430
Hello? Yes, I just got home.

27
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,862
If you need anything, call me. I’ll pack your bag for you.

28
00:03:19,112 --> 00:03:20,186
Okay,

29
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,233
I've to pack Songprod bag.

30
00:03:32,175 --> 00:03:34,713
Then you and I need to talk.

31
00:03:42,296 --> 00:03:43,909
It’s not too late, Denkun.

32
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:45,372
Really?

33
00:03:45,372 --> 00:03:49,722
You wouldn’t lie to me just to ease my mind right?.

34
00:03:49,722 --> 00:03:51,528
You'll tell me the truth?

35
00:03:51,528 --> 00:03:53,033
Yes, it’s not too late.

36
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:55,730
PEP medication must be taken within 72 hours

37
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,125
after possible exposure to HIV.

38
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,835
In your case, it hasn’t been 72 hours

39
00:03:59,835 --> 00:04:00,736
yet, so you’re well within the window.

40
00:04:00,736 --> 00:04:04,947
The effectiveness of PEP is roughly

41
00:04:04,947 --> 00:04:08,115
80% in emergency situations, so you can breathe easy.

42
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:11,927
What a relief!

43
00:04:13,107 --> 00:04:15,731
Wait… is there anything else I need to get checked for?

44
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:18,933
HIV or anything else? I’ll do whatever it takes.

45
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:21,033
Of course. We’re fully equipped here.

46
00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:22,719
I’ll provide you with a complete list of tests,

47
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:24,917
so you can be sure and feel reassured.

48
00:04:26,869 --> 00:04:30,019
Thank you so much, Dr. Nan. And thank you, Songprod,

49
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:34,885
for building Sesh Clinic for people like us.

50
00:04:34,885 --> 00:04:38,338
No problem at all. It’s always been our mission

51
00:04:38,338 --> 00:04:43,535
to promote sexual health awareness

52
00:04:43,535 --> 00:04:46,981
and provide a safe space for consultation.

53
00:04:46,981 --> 00:04:51,626
We also offer anonymous consultations for those who prefer it.

54
00:04:52,012 --> 00:04:55,190
Exactly. Sexual well-being is important.

55
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,515
You’re always welcome here to seek advice, safely and confidentially.

56
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,921
This is amazing. Before, we couldn’t access such direct support.

57
00:05:06,921 --> 00:05:09,600
Now that we have it,

58
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,096
I’ll tell all my friends to come here.

59
00:05:12,096 --> 00:05:13,219
Sounds good?"

60
00:05:13,219 --> 00:05:14,864
Good, good

61
00:05:19,995 --> 00:05:21,664
Aren’t you going with Songprod?

62
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:27,271
No, I’m worried about you.

63
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:30,691
Besides, tomorrow I have to go to the agency.

64
00:05:30,691 --> 00:05:33,761
The anti-fan trend is getting worse.

65
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:40,116
I also want to know more about you and Prangdao.

66
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,989
What’s going on? When did it start?

67
00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:48,970
It hasn’t started yet.

68
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,130
What do you mean? What are you thinking?

69
00:05:53,516 --> 00:05:57,535
I mean… what do you think of Prangdao?

70
00:05:57,535 --> 00:06:00,908
I don’t think anything. I’ve always been like this.

71
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,562
See? That’s exactly the problem.

72
00:06:03,562 --> 00:06:06,174
This is why I don’t want you to mess with people’s around you.

73
00:06:11,668 --> 00:06:14,663
I can’t stop you, but I can at least warn you.

74
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:18,972
If you don’t feel anything, then don’t make others feel something.

75
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:23,585
Hurting people isn’t fun, Mook.

76
00:06:23,585 --> 00:06:26,342
There are enough lessons out there to know better.

77
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:32,045
Are you scolding me now?

78
00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:36,965
Yes, I am. I’m telling you off and giving you advice.

79
00:06:40,438 --> 00:06:43,748
Don’t you want to have a healthy relationship like before?

80
00:06:44,656 --> 00:06:49,789
No, I don’t. Right now, my focus is on Grandma.

81
00:07:12,486 --> 00:07:17,030
Well, I’ve said my piece. The rest is up to you.

82
00:07:39,803 --> 00:07:42,890
[Hey everyone, get ready for some gossip!

83
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:46,237
I don’t know much,

84
00:07:46,237 --> 00:07:47,162
but here’s what I heard.

85
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:49,609
Remember when I talked about

86
00:07:49,609 --> 00:07:53,123
her fighting with that guy’s fiancée?

87
00:07:53,123 --> 00:07:54,906
On the same day,

88
00:07:54,906 --> 00:07:56,641
she caused a scene at a club too!

89
00:07:56,641 --> 00:07:59,876
And get this, someone told me— though

90
00:07:59,876 --> 00:08:03,816
I’m just passing it along—

91
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:07,025
that she might have purposely gotten pregnant to trap him.

92
00:08:07,025 --> 00:08:08,838
Is it true?

93
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:10,671
No one knows!

94
00:08:10,671 --> 00:08:11,921
And that’s not all—apparently,

95
00:08:11,921 --> 00:08:14,829
she’s been going in and out of the hospital a lot.

96
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:16,438
So many photos have been taken, have you seen them?

97
00:08:16,438 --> 00:08:20,441
If not, follow my channel! And here’s the kicker:

98
00:08:20,441 --> 00:08:24,053
her anti-fans are

99
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:28,265
harassing everyone around her.

100
00:08:28,265 --> 00:08:31,350
I’m just sharing what I’ve heard,

101
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,874
but… will I get harassed too for talking about this?

102
00:08:43,872 --> 00:08:47,704
[Mook, can you delete the picture with me?

103
00:08:47,704 --> 00:08:50,022
I got a DM full of hate messages.]

104
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,398
I saw it.

105
00:09:04,398 --> 00:09:05,884
You did well.

106
00:09:05,884 --> 00:09:09,145
Sometimes, we need to use other people’s hands to get the job done.

107
00:09:09,145 --> 00:09:11,570
Make it even more viral.

108
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,604
I want more.

109
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,864
Let’s meet at the hospital.

110
00:09:17,864 --> 00:09:21,424
I’ll figure out what Mookmanee is up to myself.

111
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,470
[Happy early birthday, Prangdao!

112
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,343
Tomorrow, I won’t be there to celebrate with you.

113
00:09:48,343 --> 00:09:49,446
I’m sorry.

114
00:09:49,446 --> 00:09:51,093
Wishing you all the happiness.I’m leaving now. — Songprod

115
00:09:59,434 --> 00:10:00,598
What is it Peem?

116
00:10:00,598 --> 00:10:04,353
Why did I start a war with the antis?

117
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,007
They came at me first, so I fought back!

118
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:09,330
How could I just let them spread fake scandals without a response?

119
00:10:10,124 --> 00:10:12,644
Enough, enough. I have to get into a meeting now.

120
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:17,149
Peem, I’m going to visit Grandma today, okay?

121
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,767
Sure, but take Prangdao with you.

122
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:28,271
I’m busy today, and I don’t want you going anywhere alone.

123
00:10:28,271 --> 00:10:30,570
Do you understand? That’s all

124
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,491
Today’s your birthday?

125
00:10:38,535 --> 00:10:40,069
How old are you?

126
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,948
From the looks of it, I’d guess you’re younger than me.

127
00:10:47,015 --> 00:10:49,674
Do you want to celebrate? I’ll buy you a cake.

128
00:10:54,895 --> 00:10:56,501
No need.

129
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,412
I’ve never celebrated my birthday.

130
00:11:06,354 --> 00:11:07,862
Well, today you’re coming with me to visit Grandma.

131
00:11:07,862 --> 00:11:11,720
Let’s take your car. I’ll drive.

132
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,071
When finished, I will contact you.

133
00:11:20,071 --> 00:11:23,818
During the accident, Grandma's brain was damaged.

134
00:11:23,818 --> 00:11:26,917
It may result in memory being choppy,

135
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:29,920
Do you ever care about Grandma? Mother! Mother!

136
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,084
Sorry Sorry! NeverMind!

137
00:11:32,084 --> 00:11:33,845
Sorry I'm Drunk
