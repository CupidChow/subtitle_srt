1
00:03:12,545 --> 00:03:13,741
Did you call P'Peem?

2
00:03:14,443 --> 00:03:16,058
Mook, did you just woke up.

3
00:03:16,058 --> 00:03:18,244
I left the house not long ago.

4
00:03:18,244 --> 00:03:22,039
Did you see all the gifts from your fans?

5
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:24,170
They're on the table in the living room.

6
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,990
Yeah, I saw them. So many gifts.

7
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,144
Open them. It might keep you entertained.

8
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:35,199
And I stocked the fridge with fresh food in case you want to cook.

9
00:03:37,004 --> 00:03:37,791
But Mook,

10
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:42,570
listen carefully—don’t leave the house.

11
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,591
There’s been a threat sent to the company.

12
00:03:46,591 --> 00:03:48,591
What?! Are they crazy?

13
00:03:49,092 --> 00:03:53,308
They can be worse. I didn’t want to scare you,

14
00:03:53,308 --> 00:03:56,079
but I need you to be extra cautious.

15
00:03:56,881 --> 00:04:00,638
I’m worried about you, okay?

16
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,907
Alright, P'Peem. I’ll be more careful.

17
00:04:12,228 --> 00:04:14,624
My pajamas look cute on you.

18
00:04:20,038 --> 00:04:22,053
Why are you blushing?

19
00:04:29,571 --> 00:04:30,465
P'Mook!

20
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:32,873
I’m about to take a shower.

21
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:35,473
I’ll take one too. Let's take it together. I'll help you.

22
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:52,961
You're cute.

23
00:06:14,816 --> 00:06:16,158
What’s up, P'Peem?

24
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:19,466
Are you calling to check if I’m home?

25
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:21,674
Yes, that too.

26
00:06:22,777 --> 00:06:26,902
Mook, Grace has called you so many times.

27
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:32,631
Even though I’m married, she still doesn’t give up.

28
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:36,996
She still can't accept what her mom did to you.

29
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,867
She just found out. Maybe she can’t handle it yet.

30
00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:44,497
Maybe you should talk to her. End it once and for all.

31
00:06:50,412 --> 00:06:50,912
Shit!

32
00:06:54,015 --> 00:06:57,095
Mook, Mook, what's wrong?

33
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:02,297
P'Peem, someone sent me a bloody card!

34
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:05,412
What? Are you serious?

35
00:07:05,412 --> 00:07:08,482
That’s disgusting

36
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,816
What’s the?!

37
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,757
This is way too far.

38
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:14,645
Let’s just clean this up and throw it away. It’s contaminated.

39
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:18,525
Don’t open any more

40
00:08:19,929 --> 00:08:22,204
—better safe than sorry.

41
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:41,577
Who would do something like this?!

42
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:44,267
I don’t know, but it's way too far. This is scary.

43
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,502
She deserves it!

44
00:08:48,547 --> 00:08:51,990
Deserved.

45
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,858
Act more human like guys.

46
00:08:58,377 --> 00:08:59,372
Yes, P'Peem.

47
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:03,105
Mook, how could you? Are you crazy?

48
00:09:03,105 --> 00:09:05,070
Why did you post that photo?

49
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,481
When did you even take your phone back?

50
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:10,003
When you weren’t looking. And no, I’m not giving it back.

51
00:09:10,003 --> 00:09:11,938
Mook!

52
00:09:39,407 --> 00:09:43,370
Maybe you should talk to her. End it once and for all.

53
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:05,185
I'm going to the restroom.

54
00:10:11,501 --> 00:10:14,552
Mook, we need to talk.

55
00:10:18,763 --> 00:10:21,090
Please take care of her.

56
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,821
Why did you do it?

57
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:55,981
I don’t care about whatever revenge you’re trying to get.

58
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,744
Just don’t drag me into it.

59
00:10:58,744 --> 00:11:02,349
P'Mook, Please come back to me. I’ll be your mistress.

60
00:11:02,349 --> 00:11:06,204
What is this? What should I do about this mess?
