1
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,480
<b>We really can't keep going on like this, Mook.</b>

2
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,159
<b>Praw and that reporter, Natcha...</b>

3
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,599
<b>I have no idea what they're up to.</b>

4
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:53,960
<b>I'm fine with the porn clip,</b>
<b>as long as you don't show my face.</b>

5
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,920
<b>I really want to know how she thinks she can take my place.</b>

6
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,599
<b>Right now, Mook and I are wondering if Praw is a anti-fan.</b>

7
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,199
<b>That's why she needs to get close to Prow.</b>

8
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:06,400
<b>About her wanting to sleep with me...</b>

9
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,960
<b>How about tonight?</b>

10
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:12,280
<b>Hello, Praw.</b>

11
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,239
<b>I'm outside your condo.</b>

12
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,159
<b>I'm coming in.</b>

13
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,239
<b>Come down and get me.</b>

14
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:19,639
<b>I can't get in by myself.</b>

15
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,280
<b>Just a sec, Praw. I'll wait for you.</b>

16
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,840
<b>I'll come down to get you.</b>

17
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,280
<b>Praw... if she finds out,</b>

18
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,079
<b>it's all over.</b>

19
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,920
<b>What's meant to happen will happen, right, Nat?</b>

20
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,400
<b>Just be ready to film the clip for me.</b>

21
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,960
<b>I hire you Nat</b>

22
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,199
<b>I know your mom is sick.</b>

23
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,199
<b>I will pay you more.</b>

24
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,159
<b>Let’s destroy her life together.</b>

25
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:53,079
<b>You think you can get away from me?</b>

26
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:55,800
<b>Yes, but...</b>

27
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,960
<b>I'll give you my keycard.</b>

28
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,760
<b>So you can come after me when we fight.</b>

29
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,480
<b>Prang.</b>

30
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,360
<b>P'Peem, is something wrong?</b>

31
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,440
<b>Prang, could you step outside with me for a second?</b>

32
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,679
<b>I'm worried about Mook.</b>

33
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,760
<b>P'Mook?</b>

34
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,760
<b>What's going on?</b>

35
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,119
<b>And where did P'Mook go?</b>

36
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:15,239
<b>Right now, Mook is at Praw's condo.</b>

37
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:28,920
<b>Have you been waiting long?</b>

38
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:32,880
<b>Not really.</b>

39
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,079
<b>Let's go.</b>

40
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,400
<b>I have a surprise for you.</b>

41
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:08,800
<b>Here's my room.</b>

42
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,920
<b>Go on in.</b>

43
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,880
<b>Are you checking out my room?</b>

44
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,199
<b>Wouldn't you rather check me out instead?</b>

45
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,639
<b>I even prepared this outfit especially for you.</b>

46
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:00,039
<b>Doesn't this feel familiar to you?</b>

47
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,719
<b>Familiar?</b>

48
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,480
<b>Yeah, it really does feel familiar.</b>

49
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,920
<b>Especially this picture.</b>

50
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:12,320
<b>I feel particularly familiar with it.</b>

51
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:21,039
<b>So, you want me this badly, Praw?</b>

52
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:33,639
<b>You hate me this much?</b>

53
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,960
<b>Can you even stand it?</b>

54
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,599
<b>Aren't you disgusted by me?</b>

55
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:39,679
<b>What are you going on about, Mook?</b>

56
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:51,079
<b>This isn't how I remember things.</b>

57
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,440
<b>Now this is more like it.</b>

58
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,519
<b>Mook, you're taking this too far!</b>

59
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:05,920
<b>You're killing the vibe.</b>

60
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,719
<b>You absolute bitch!</b>

61
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:10,360
<b>Why do you hate me so much? Are you jealous of me?</b>

62
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,679
<b>Ouch!</b>

63
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:12,599
<b>Jealous?</b>

64
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,280
<b>Someone like you? Why would I ever be jealous?</b>

65
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,159
<b>All I can feel is hatred for you.</b>

66
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,159
<b>You don't even realize</b>
<b>you're responsible for someone's death.</b>

67
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:23,360
<b>What do you mean by that?</b>

68
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,679
<b>Want to find out?</b>

69
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:26,280
<b>If you really want to know, go figure it out yourself.</b>

70
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,440
<b>Whoever dies, dies.</b>

71
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:31,000
<b>I'm sure I've never killed anyone.</b>

72
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,960
<b>You should just leave me alone.</b>

73
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,960
<b>Ploy.</b>

74
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,360
<b>Ploy, honey.</b>

75
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,639
<b>That girl knew the whole time, didn't she?</b>

76
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,239
<b>Hey, Mook!</b>

77
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:22,960
<b>Prang - Mook's over there!</b>

78
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:24,920
<b>Mook!</b>

79
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:28,119
<b>What's happening here?</b>

80
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,800
<b>We'll discuss this at home.</b>

81
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,039
<b>Let's go.</b>

82
00:09:04,439 --> 00:09:07,640
<b>Khun Nita.</b>

83
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,520
<b>What happened, Nita?</b>

84
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,479
<b>What happened, Mook?</b>

85
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,479
<b>I grabbed that woman's neck, and then she stepped on my foot.</b>

86
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:36,079
<b>It's lucky Praw didn't do anything worse to you.</b>

87
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:41,039
<b>You were on her turf. You were at a total disadvantage.</b>

88
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,560
<b>Mook, how could you be so reckless?</b>

89
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,000
<b>You should have more sense.</b>

90
00:09:47,439 --> 00:09:52,000
<b>Do you know how worried Prang and I were about you?</b>

91
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,760
<b>I'm sorry, P'Peem.</b>

92
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,079
<b>I was a little hot-headed back then.</b>

93
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,720
<b>Prang, I'm sorry.</b>

94
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,199
<b>I'll be more careful next time.</b>

95
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,399
<b>So, what are you going to do?</b>

96
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,199
<b>Right now, it's completely affecting my work.</b>

97
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,119
<b>And you two still have to work together.</b>

98
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,680
<b>I guess I'll have to wait and see what happens tomorrow.</b>

99
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,800
<b>Sometimes,</b>

100
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,039
<b>I really feel like leaving this industry.</b>

101
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,000
<b>Here.</b>

102
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,840
<b>Where have you been?</b>

103
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,039
<b>I went to warm up some milk for you.</b>

104
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:01,800
<b>Drink some warm milk so you can sleep soundly.</b>

105
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,680
<b>Here, let me put this on for you.</b>

106
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,920
<b>Hey.</b>

107
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,560
<b>You're getting bolder every day, aren't you?</b>

108
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,439
<b>Well, you're the one who taught me, no?</b>

109
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,960
<b>That day, when I slapped you...</b>

110
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:43,760
<b>Did it sting?</b>

111
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,239
<b>I'm so sorry.</b>

112
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,560
<b>It hurts...</b>

113
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,640
<b>It hurts so much.</b>

114
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,319
<b>But what hurts me even more...</b>

115
00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:58,159
<b>Is that I failed to earn your trust.</b>

116
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:04,279
<b>My past... even though the present has shifted,</b>

117
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:07,479
<b>It still carries repercussions.</b>

118
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:11,239
<b>No one can truly rewrite history.</b>

119
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:14,520
<b>I bear some of the responsibility too.</b>

120
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,319
<b>I was wrong not to heed your words.</b>

121
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,760
<b>I was wrong to misjudge you.</b>

122
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,960
<b>I'm sorry, P'Mook.</b>

123
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,439
<b>Please forgive me, P'Mook.</b>

124
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,119
<b>Am I acting like I'm angry with you?</b>

125
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,520
<b>It seems like you're angry with yourself.</b>

126
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,439
<b>I don't want you to feel that way.</b>

127
00:12:46,439 --> 00:12:50,119
<b>I'd rather you be angry with me.</b>

128
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:52,239
<b>It's about relationships.</b>

129
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:54,319
<b>It's about two people.</b>

130
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,760
<b>Then we two should join hands and move forward together.</b>

131
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,720
<b>From now on,</b>

132
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,840
<b>I promise I'll listen to you more,</b>

133
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,159
<b>And trust you more, P'Mook.</b>

134
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,560
<b>I promise the same,</b>

135
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,680
<b>That I'll be better to you.</b>

136
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:19,560
<b>I'll be a better person,</b>

137
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,359
<b>And I won't make you sad again.</b>

138
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:27,560
<b>You're already the best person for me.</b>

139
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:34,880
<b>You don't need to be any better.</b>

140
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:38,199
<b>We promised each other.</b>

141
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:52,399
<b>I once found love.</b>

142
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,279
<b>I once learned what it felt like.</b>

143
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,600
<b>What it's like to be loved.</b>

144
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:06,319
<b>And what it's like to love someone.</b>

145
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:09,520
<b>Thank you.</b>

146
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,920
<b>For being born for me to love you.</b>

147
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,880
<b>Born for me.</b>

148
00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:22,199
<b>To learn how wonderful it is.</b>

149
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,640
<b>Thank you, my love.</b>

150
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:30,119
<b>I will remember it.</b>

151
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,359
<b>Every moment, forever.</b>

152
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:37,479
<b>Thank you for being born for me to love.</b>
