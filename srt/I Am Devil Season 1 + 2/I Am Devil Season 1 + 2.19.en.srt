1
00:02:22,904 --> 00:02:25,511
Whoa, so much food! Omakakai is a famous place.

2
00:02:25,511 --> 00:02:27,059
Do you want it?

3
00:02:27,059 --> 00:02:34,122
Just kidding! If I took it, your fans would come after me.

4
00:02:41,981 --> 00:02:43,935
Here, have it.

5
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:46,657
But they prepared it for you.

6
00:02:46,657 --> 00:02:49,171
Too much sugar. I can't drink it.

7
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:51,313
Just drink it.

8
00:03:26,682 --> 00:03:31,259
Prang! Prang! Prang! Prang! Prang!

9
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:32,989
Prang, what's wrong?!

10
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:40,309
P'Peem, what's happening to her? Prang! Prang!

11
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:41,774
Oh my God, the orange juice was poisoned!

12
00:03:41,774 --> 00:03:44,732
Lucky me—I wasn’t greedy enough to drink it.

13
00:03:50,806 --> 00:03:52,999
Shut it!

14
00:03:58,358 --> 00:04:01,206
Someone call an ambulance! Hurry!

15
00:04:01,206 --> 00:04:03,501
Okay, okay!

16
00:05:02,092 --> 00:05:07,553
It's you, P'Phin.

17
00:05:23,987 --> 00:05:26,135
What is it, Prod?

18
00:05:28,993 --> 00:05:32,204
What?!

19
00:05:52,855 --> 00:05:56,985
Mook, Mook...

20
00:05:56,985 --> 00:06:01,860
this is all my fault.

21
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:05,605
All of this is because of me.

22
00:06:05,605 --> 00:06:08,760
No, no.

23
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:14,899
It was my fault. I'm the reason this happened.

24
00:06:20,972 --> 00:06:25,347
Yesterday… if I had known

25
00:06:25,347 --> 00:06:32,909
That it would be the last time I’d stand by your side,

26
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:37,190
I would have told you over and over

27
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:45,509
Just how much you meant to me.

28
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:51,303
Yesterday… just that one day,

29
00:06:51,303 --> 00:06:58,706
Before my world was left with no one,

30
00:06:58,706 --> 00:07:03,423
Where are you now?

31
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:10,156
Can you hear me say—I love you?

32
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:43,382
Yesterday… just that one day,

33
00:07:43,382 --> 00:07:50,410
Before my world was left with no one,

34
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:55,409
Where are you now?

35
00:07:55,409 --> 00:08:03,578
Can you hear me say—I love you?

36
00:08:03,578 --> 00:08:08,270
Where are you now?

37
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:18,948
Can you hear me say—I love you?

38
00:08:22,494 --> 00:08:27,630
calm down ..... calm down

39
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,032
calm down..... Put yourself together.

40
00:08:32,973 --> 00:08:37,248
Trust me, Prangdao will be fine.

41
00:08:49,187 --> 00:08:52,679
I shouldn't have done that...

42
00:09:24,886 --> 00:09:27,804
Drink up.

43
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,566
Mook,

44
00:09:33,015 --> 00:09:35,119
you need to pull yourself together.

45
00:09:35,988 --> 00:09:37,924
I’m begging you.

46
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,557
Hello, Prod.

47
00:09:53,557 --> 00:09:55,519
P'Peem,

48
00:09:56,098 --> 00:10:00,024
Prang made it. She's safe now.

49
00:10:05,674 --> 00:10:09,112
Mook, Prang is safe.

50
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:23,281
So it’s you, Prangdao. You’re super unlucky.

51
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,142
Hello, Mom.

52
00:11:38,736 --> 00:11:41,018
Why are you calling me?

53
00:11:41,018 --> 00:11:43,673
I’m not in the mood to talk.

54
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:47,730
I’m calling to report something.

55
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,013
You should be proud of me.

56
00:11:51,013 --> 00:11:56,576
Did you hear about Prangdao getting poisoned?

57
00:11:56,576 --> 00:12:01,587
What are you saying? I don’t understand.

58
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:07,044
I was the one who did it.

59
00:12:08,927 --> 00:12:13,207
Nita?! What are you talking about?

60
00:12:13,207 --> 00:12:17,668
Are you crazy?! What did you do?!

61
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,266
Why?

62
00:12:20,266 --> 00:12:24,174
Isn’t this how you raised me?

63
00:12:24,174 --> 00:12:27,083
Why blame me now?

64
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:33,683
Since everything is falling apart, let’s make it worse.

65
00:12:33,683 --> 00:12:38,243
Then you’ll understand the pain my sister and I have endured—

66
00:12:38,243 --> 00:12:42,491
the torture you and Dad put us through.

67
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:46,674
Nutty and I were constantly in and out of the hospital.

68
00:12:46,674 --> 00:12:52,773
Do you know how that felt? How painful it was?!

69
00:13:05,522 --> 00:13:08,420
Well, I have to visit Prangdao at the hospital now.

70
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,298
Talk later.

71
00:13:11,298 --> 00:13:15,257
I promised to bring a big ‘get well soon’ basket

72
00:13:15,257 --> 00:13:18,735
so you don’t lose face.

73
00:14:57,566 --> 00:15:00,809
Why are you dragging me out? I haven’t even gotten my answer!

74
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:03,244
Can you not ask Mook anything right now?

75
00:15:03,968 --> 00:15:08,172
I’ll investigate.

76
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,834
No need.

77
00:15:18,222 --> 00:15:21,708
I did it.

78
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:26,533
If you check the CCTV in the studio, you’ll see—

79
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:31,423
I poisoned the orange juice.

80
00:15:33,306 --> 00:15:41,862
But too bad, the one who drank it was Prangdao, not Mookanee.

81
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:45,319
Nita...

82
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,896
It all started because of you.

83
00:15:52,896 --> 00:15:56,764
Now your sister suffers the consequences.

84
00:15:59,227 --> 00:16:02,035
Why did you have to be like this?

85
00:16:02,614 --> 00:16:06,746
If you had married me from the start,

86
00:16:06,746 --> 00:16:10,077
none of this would have happened.

87
00:16:14,423 --> 00:16:18,334
You, of all people, should understand me.

88
00:16:25,288 --> 00:16:28,569
We grew up together,

89
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,175
carrying the family burden—

90
00:16:34,624 --> 00:16:36,723
the promises,

91
00:16:36,723 --> 00:16:40,203
the business.

92
00:16:41,072 --> 00:16:46,339
Yet, I endured it. Why couldn’t you?

93
00:16:49,092 --> 00:17:00,113
Why am I always the only one who gets hurt by others’ actions?!

94
00:17:06,053 --> 00:17:10,719
Mook! Mook!

95
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:14,131
Mook, stop! Let go!

96
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:21,823
I’ll confess to the police.

97
00:17:21,823 --> 00:17:27,074
Don’t follow me. I’ll go alone.

98
00:17:55,684 --> 00:17:57,501
Mom, please don’t go in yet.

99
00:17:57,501 --> 00:18:00,265
I know how to handle this.

100
00:18:00,265 --> 00:18:02,280
You’re hurt! Was it worth it?

101
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,975
I don’t like hearing you say that.

102
00:18:03,975 --> 00:18:07,318
I can be nice to you even if you’re not hurt.

103
00:18:07,318 --> 00:18:09,584
P'Prod said you know my grandmother.

104
00:18:09,584 --> 00:18:14,441
Yes, but it's between me and her. It has nothing to do with you.
