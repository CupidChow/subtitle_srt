1
00:00:18,357 --> 00:00:19,867
Don’t bother me, Nita.

2
00:00:21,043 --> 00:00:23,046
Do whatever you want. I don’t care.

3
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:25,662
You!

4
00:00:26,446 --> 00:00:28,709
Are you done talking? Please excuse me.

5
00:00:46,581 --> 00:00:47,081
You dare hit me!

6
00:00:47,301 --> 00:00:48,249
You hit me first!

7
00:00:57,674 --> 00:00:58,714
Mook! Calm down!

8
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:00,710
Incase you have calm down,

9
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,126
don’t come bothering me again.

10
00:01:02,936 --> 00:01:04,516
go! go! go!

11
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:11,661
Don’t let me find your weakness, Mookmanee.

12
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:29,205
Incase you have calm down,

13
00:01:29,205 --> 00:01:30,622
don’t come bothering me again.

14
00:01:31,432 --> 00:01:33,939
This is unacceptable!.

15
00:01:35,244 --> 00:01:37,472
Go dig into Mooknanee’s past.

16
00:01:38,777 --> 00:01:40,316
I want to know everything—

17
00:01:40,586 --> 00:01:42,310
how she grew up,

18
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,253
Why did she dares to behave like this.

19
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,009
Yes, madam.

20
00:01:50,598 --> 00:01:51,690
And what about Pin?

21
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,787
Did you find anything? Have you located her?

22
00:01:56,047 --> 00:01:57,442
No progress yet, madam.

23
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,681
Where are you, Pin?

24
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,620
Aunty Den!

25
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:52,769
You have arrived!

26
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:56,115
Songprod! Confess to me right now—

27
00:02:56,637 --> 00:02:57,776
what are you two up to?

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,136
You and Mook?

29
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,666
It’s impossible. Don’t lie to me!

30
00:03:06,408 --> 00:03:08,034
I raised you. Do you think I wouldn’t know?

31
00:03:09,294 --> 00:03:12,944
Signing marriage certificates with her—this is all just a cover for something, isn’t it?

32
00:03:13,754 --> 00:03:14,334
Answer me!

33
00:03:21,892 --> 00:03:22,533
...Yes.

34
00:03:37,154 --> 00:03:38,616
Okay, Thank you

35
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,646
What did they say, Peem?"

36
00:03:55,344 --> 00:03:56,943
All your jobs have been canceled,

37
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,028
Mook. The brands are starting to terminate their contracts with the agency.

38
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,003
Negotiations are happening,

39
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,656
but... for now, they want you to take a break.

40
00:04:08,993 --> 00:04:10,924
They said to wait until the scandal dies down, and then we can revisit the deals.

41
00:04:12,296 --> 00:04:15,715
But this time, it’s bad, Mook. Worse than before. They can’t handle the backlash.

42
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:19,223
I’ll have to meet with them personally to discuss it.

43
00:04:23,115 --> 00:04:24,179
I’ll leave it to you, then.

44
00:04:28,498 --> 00:04:31,754
Was it worth it, Mook? Giving up this much?

45
00:04:34,498 --> 00:04:35,972
More than enough.

46
00:04:38,109 --> 00:04:39,753
Fame doesn’t last forever, Peem,

47
00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:43,169
but Grandma—she needs me for the long haul.

48
00:04:45,283 --> 00:04:47,286
For her, I can do anything.

49
00:04:48,838 --> 00:04:50,875
And think of it this way—I’m helping Songprod too.

50
00:04:52,517 --> 00:04:53,941
This is the path I chose.

51
00:04:55,876 --> 00:04:57,466
If I’ve made my decision,

52
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,924
I have to accept the consequences.

53
00:05:01,296 --> 00:05:02,376
Don’t worry about me.

54
00:05:04,423 --> 00:05:05,793
How can I not?

55
00:05:07,615 --> 00:05:08,891
You’re my sister.

56
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:12,591
We’ve been through so much together.

57
00:05:14,346 --> 00:05:16,132
And now, I can’t do anything to help you.

58
00:05:17,324 --> 00:05:18,718
Then there’s Nita—she keeps coming at you,

59
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:24,889
even though she started all this. But no one blames her.

60
00:05:28,016 --> 00:05:29,266
It’s not surprising.

61
00:05:30,256 --> 00:05:33,438
I’m the one who should take all the blame, not her.

62
00:05:34,473 --> 00:05:36,744
I was the one who stole her fiancé.

63
00:05:37,531 --> 00:05:39,588
Even if she does worse things, no one will hold it against her.

64
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,812
Don’t worry about it, Peem. At least I got to slap her, right?

65
00:05:53,888 --> 00:05:55,274
Are you going in alone?

66
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:58,776
Do you want to wait for me? I’ll only take minutes to sort out this work stuff.

67
00:06:00,756 --> 00:06:03,136
It’s alright. Today, I want to go in alone.

68
00:06:03,136 --> 00:06:04,819
I have a lot to talk about with Grandma.

69
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,783
You go handle your work—I’ll be fine.

70
00:06:11,012 --> 00:06:14,188
Alright, it’s up to you. But if anything happens, call me

71
00:06:14,188 --> 00:06:16,559
or Songprod. And

72
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:21,075
stay off social media—it’s not worth it.

73
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,495
I knowwwww! I’ll get going now.

74
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,916
Hello, Nita. Songprod has already left,

75
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,145
but I couldn’t follow him. My car broke down,

76
00:06:59,145 --> 00:07:00,624
and I’m waiting for the mechanic.

77
00:07:01,538 --> 00:07:02,862
How are you, Nita?

78
00:07:03,608 --> 00:07:05,034
Wait… hold on…

79
00:07:05,844 --> 00:07:07,706
Is that Mooknanee? What is she doing here?

80
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,504
I came to visit you, Grandma.

81
00:07:48,307 --> 00:07:49,689
It’s been a few days.

82
00:07:51,826 --> 00:07:53,415
We’ve moved you to a new place—

83
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:56,186
much more comfortable, right?

84
00:08:07,617 --> 00:08:09,639
Look, I brought your hairpin.

85
00:08:14,138 --> 00:08:15,425
Don’t worry, I didn’t sell it!

86
00:08:16,168 --> 00:08:18,526
Peem said even if I did, it wouldn’t be enough to cover your medical expenses.

87
00:08:23,857 --> 00:08:25,574
But you don’t have to worry about that—

88
00:08:26,294 --> 00:08:28,051
Songprod’s taking care of everything.

89
00:08:28,996 --> 00:08:30,832
He’s the owner of this hospital, you know.

90
00:08:31,237 --> 00:08:34,510
He promised to bring in the best doctors to treat you,

91
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,058
so you’ll get better soon.

92
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,684
I’m waiting for you, Grandma.

93
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:10,051
There’s so much I want to tell you...

94
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:15,012
You might even want to hit me when you wake up.

95
00:09:18,341 --> 00:09:20,149
But please, wake up soon.

96
00:09:44,622 --> 00:09:47,455
What? You’re getting married next month?!

97
00:09:49,817 --> 00:09:51,820
Oh my god,

98
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:56,316
Sorn! How could you plan something like this without asking your son?

99
00:09:57,328 --> 00:10:02,318
I was gone for a week, and now everything’s upside down!

100
00:10:05,153 --> 00:10:07,303
This is huge, Songprod.

101
00:10:08,045 --> 00:10:09,147
It’s gone too far

102
00:10:10,272 --> 00:10:11,220
I know!

103
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:14,059
But I didn’t think it would come to this.

104
00:10:16,421 --> 00:10:18,301
I’ve said no to everything,

105
00:10:19,651 --> 00:10:24,167
but the elders... they won’t listen.

106
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,424
They’re forcing me to marry her quickly.

107
00:10:28,436 --> 00:10:30,306
They’ve been planning everything behind my back

108
00:10:30,733 --> 00:10:32,296
—organizing everything in secret.

109
00:10:34,073 --> 00:10:36,743
And you’re just going to let it happen, Songprod?

110
00:10:37,936 --> 00:10:39,219
Lie to everyone?

111
00:10:41,288 --> 00:10:42,292
...Yes.

112
00:10:43,732 --> 00:10:46,432
At least until the other side cancels the wedding themselves.

113
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:51,319
I'll divorce with Mookanee

114
00:10:55,525 --> 00:10:56,901
Ugh, my head hurts.

115
00:10:56,901 --> 00:10:58,993
So many things are happening all at once!

116
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,002
You were at the hospital for a couple of hours.

117
00:11:04,002 --> 00:11:05,398
What were you doing there?

118
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:09,637
Maybe your weakness isn’t so hard to find after all.

119
00:11:09,637 --> 00:11:10,902
Stay out of my business Grace!

120
00:11:10,902 --> 00:11:12,417
I’ve changed.

121
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:14,806
You really like Guy? I Don't believe.

122
00:11:15,526 --> 00:11:17,958
what you just did—I wouldn’t exactly call that a kiss.

123
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,558
You don’t need to act. They all know now.
