1
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,868
Please worry about Grandma, Mom!!!

2
00:01:50,868 --> 00:01:52,486
I will celebrate the countdown on your birthday.

3
00:01:52,486 --> 00:01:55,304
In exchange for her having to forget all about the conversation I had with my mother.

4
00:01:55,304 --> 00:01:57,193
I am a second wife's child.

5
00:01:57,193 --> 00:02:03,137
So I chose to study something that was far from the family business.

6
00:02:03,137 --> 00:02:06,718
So I chose to study art.

7
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:15,800
Sorry! Sorry, sorry.

8
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,085
It's okay.

9
00:02:17,085 --> 00:02:18,731
Sorry, I'm quite drunk.

10
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:21,366
Don't worry.

11
00:02:24,623 --> 00:02:26,918
Your drawing is quite nice.

12
00:02:26,918 --> 00:02:30,252
Do you like drawing?

13
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,836
Do you like roses?

14
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,606
Mook! What are you doing there? Come here, this way.

15
00:03:05,606 --> 00:03:08,653
P'Peem, her drawing is very nice.

16
00:03:12,677 --> 00:03:14,305
What?

17
00:03:14,305 --> 00:03:16,342
Help me.

18
00:03:16,725 --> 00:03:19,261
With this behaviour? Becoming an actress?

19
00:03:19,261 --> 00:03:21,315
Wait, wait... Gosh,

20
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:31,616
I'm stressed having a sis like this.

21
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:36,300
One sec, let's get a grip.

22
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,710
You're already 20, you're about to become an adult—

23
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,534
wait, no—you ARE already grown up.

24
00:03:43,534 --> 00:03:46,277
You can't become an actress looking like this.

25
00:03:46,277 --> 00:03:48,047
If you become an actress behaving like this,

26
00:03:48,047 --> 00:03:52,006
you'll definitely have scandals all the time!

27
00:03:52,868 --> 00:03:54,725
Every day!

28
00:03:55,395 --> 00:03:58,427
I didn't want to be someone's role model;

29
00:03:58,427 --> 00:04:01,073
I just want to be an actress,

30
00:04:01,073 --> 00:04:05,377
to become rich, have loads of money.

31
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,715
Wait, you can't even stand up straight.

32
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:16,026
'Peem, if I become an actress, you must, MUST become my manager! Manager!

33
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:19,425
Hah? Me? Be what?

34
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,616
Manager!

35
00:04:21,616 --> 00:04:25,624
Manager?! No!

36
00:04:25,624 --> 00:04:26,861
Yes!

37
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:30,106
No!

38
00:04:35,087 --> 00:04:36,358
Why are you smiling?

39
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,440
Hey, I asked, why didn't you answer?

40
00:04:51,422 --> 00:04:54,249
... Ouch! Ouch!

41
00:04:54,249 --> 00:04:57,211
P'Mook, what's wrong?

42
00:04:57,211 --> 00:04:58,780
Cramp!

43
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:18,529
P'Mook, what are you playing at!

44
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:23,681
Don't hit me. I was talking to you, why didn't you answer?

45
00:05:23,681 --> 00:05:26,346
You tease me like this—are you asking for it?

46
00:05:27,591 --> 00:05:30,255
P'Mook, let me go.

47
00:05:30,255 --> 00:05:31,382
No.

48
00:05:31,382 --> 00:05:32,358
Let go!

49
00:05:32,358 --> 00:05:34,297
Stop hitting, the water's splashing!

50
00:05:34,297 --> 00:05:37,982
If you don't stop, I'll kiss you here!

51
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,035
Do you still want to blow your cake?

52
00:06:39,518 --> 00:06:41,766
If I do it, I'm not taking responsibility for it, okay?

53
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:43,830
I'm warning you.

54
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,733
I know.

55
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:50,977
You said it, okay? I didn't force you.

56
00:06:53,276 --> 00:06:55,085
I've warned you.

57
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,815
P'Mook...

58
00:07:18,827 --> 00:07:21,239
I can't stop, Prangdao.

59
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:24,144
You know it, right?

60
00:08:06,637 --> 00:08:08,767
Morning.

61
00:08:13,557 --> 00:08:15,992
Last night, you forgot to take "SESH Over"  I gave you, right?

62
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:19,430
Right...

63
00:08:20,484 --> 00:08:22,653
now I'm a bit hungover.

64
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,710
Hello? Do you want to turn on the camera?

65
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,987
What are you trying to do?

66
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,437
It’s still morning; I've just woken up.

67
00:09:10,545 --> 00:09:13,850
[I saw your news, so I was worried.

68
00:09:16,628 --> 00:09:19,302
But there’s nothing now.

69
00:09:20,452 --> 00:09:23,012
I’ll get going then.

70
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,111
Are you mad at me?

71
00:09:53,081 --> 00:09:54,641
You're cold-hearted.

72
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,399
This is just me. What are you expecting?

73
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,120
You can mess with me but NOT my grandma!

74
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,320
A warning this time—
