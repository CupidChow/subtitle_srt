1
00:02:10,772 --> 00:02:14,616
Here's loads of food. I bought so much.

2
00:02:14,616 --> 00:02:17,460
It should last for multiple meals.

3
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,980
And this... some random parcel. It was left at the front of the house.

4
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,616
Who even sent it? It’s such hot weather, it could’ve been damaged.

5
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,659
Anyway, here… proud to present…

6
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:32,760
Doctor Nan’s product. Supposedly helps with… you know… that.

7
00:02:51,328 --> 00:02:54,744
Wait, what? Sorn knows about everything?

8
00:02:57,891 --> 00:03:02,827
This is all my fault. I didn’t hide the contract with Mook properly.

9
00:03:04,575 --> 00:03:08,196
I never thought Mum would search my workroom.

10
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:15,457
It will be alright. Prod, don’t blame yourself. It’s already happened.

11
00:03:15,457 --> 00:03:18,273
What’s important now is figuring out how to fix this.

12
00:03:18,273 --> 00:03:26,194
Especially with Sorn… there’s no way she’ll cancel the wedding easily.

13
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:35,188
Wait. I have an idea.

14
00:03:36,468 --> 00:03:42,206
You should divorce Mook as soon as possible.

15
00:03:42,206 --> 00:03:48,571
Cheating scandals hit hard,

16
00:03:48,571 --> 00:03:51,727
and it won’t be good for either of you.

17
00:03:51,727 --> 00:03:58,739
It’s all public now; there’s no point hiding anymore.

18
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,272
Do you understand?

19
00:04:06,102 --> 00:04:08,712
And… where is she?

20
00:04:10,561 --> 00:04:12,738
She’s visiting Grandmother Phin.

21
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:20,366
I thought you said she didn’t want to socialise or even leave her room.

22
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:22,752
That’s why I bought all this stuff.

23
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:27,607
Like she cares. She doesn't.

24
00:04:27,607 --> 00:04:32,147
Look at what she’s done. She’s far from scared.

25
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,762
Hmm

26
00:04:35,757 --> 00:04:37,969
But I asked Prang to go with her,

27
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:42,931
so we can relax a little. Don’t worry.

28
00:04:49,615 --> 00:04:53,113
By the way, what’s in this box?

29
00:04:53,113 --> 00:04:56,502
I don’t know. I found it in front of the house.

30
00:04:56,502 --> 00:05:01,500
It was under the sun, so I brought it in. I didn’t want it to spoil.

31
00:05:46,294 --> 00:05:48,981
You are so beautiful.

32
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:52,780
Beautiful?

33
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,196
Cute...

34
00:06:16,096 --> 00:06:17,871
I’ll be right back.

35
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:19,533
Okay.

36
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:21,024
You’re beautiful.

37
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,117
You know, my grandma keeps talking about you.

38
00:06:43,117 --> 00:06:44,973
She says you’re cute.

39
00:06:56,207 --> 00:07:00,000
I haven’t forgiven you yet.

40
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,481
What do I need to do to make you forgive me?

41
00:07:17,986 --> 00:07:20,085
Hello.

42
00:07:20,085 --> 00:07:26,468
I just dropped by to see that my family’s room has already turned into an outsider’s room.

43
00:07:26,468 --> 00:07:30,085
I guess this is your and Songprod’s deal, right?

44
00:07:31,507 --> 00:07:33,832
Well, I’ll let it pass.

45
00:07:37,387 --> 00:07:38,973
Thank you.

46
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:42,115
Since you’ll do anything for money,

47
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,683
do you want to work for me?

48
00:07:45,963 --> 00:07:53,357
If you can make Songprod marry Nita, name your price.

49
00:07:55,206 --> 00:08:00,637
Any price? I’m greedy, you know.

50
00:08:00,637 --> 00:08:06,162
Any price… as long as it’s reasonable.

51
00:08:06,162 --> 00:08:08,803
I can pay Mookmanee.

52
00:08:30,703 --> 00:08:32,447
What were you thinking?

53
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,663
To make your mum and P’Prod see the truth.

54
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:46,025
So she can stop picking on me and my grandma.

55
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:03,485
Someone sent this to the house.

56
00:09:03,485 --> 00:09:04,761
I checked the CCTV,

57
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:06,833
but it doesn’t show who delivered it.

58
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,781
Just looking at it makes me feel sick.

59
00:09:11,345 --> 00:09:14,672
These anti-fans know too much.

60
00:09:40,411 --> 00:09:45,502
Morning, everyone! There’s a new update!

61
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:48,770
This topic is so hot.

62
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,721
Every time something like this comes up,

63
00:09:50,721 --> 00:09:53,000
I slip back into my southern accent.

64
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,269
Remember when Mookmanee married that high-society guy?

65
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:02,305
It wasn’t even that long ago,

66
00:10:02,305 --> 00:10:08,209
and now I’m hearing they’re getting a divorce.

67
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:11,677
Let me confirm it.

68
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:16,245
Hello? What’s the deal? Okay, update me, okay? Guys,

69
00:10:16,245 --> 00:10:19,547
follow me, and you’ll get all the details.

70
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,670
You went through all that trouble just to not marry me?

71
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,624
Have you thought about my reputation?

72
00:10:27,188 --> 00:10:29,732
Look at this, Nita.

73
00:10:31,581 --> 00:10:33,911
She’s not scared at all.

74
00:10:33,911 --> 00:10:37,555
The only thing she’s scared of is her grandma.

75
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:39,815
But I can’t touch that.

76
00:10:41,095 --> 00:10:42,729
What will you do next?

77
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:47,396
Even if he divorces Mook, will he agree to marry you?

78
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,858
He has to. I still have one more card to play.

79
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:56,688
I’ll visit Prapatsorn, then my future husband.

80
00:11:25,271 --> 00:11:29,493
Here you are. I’ve been waiting for you.

81
00:11:29,493 --> 00:11:33,011
Nita, what are you doing here?

82
00:11:33,011 --> 00:11:36,936
I came to make a deal.

83
00:11:38,358 --> 00:11:40,057
Look at this.

84
00:11:49,869 --> 00:11:52,855
Surprised?

85
00:11:53,708 --> 00:12:00,735
Don’t tell me you didn’t know that your blood sister and your fake wife

86
00:12:00,735 --> 00:12:05,428
were having an affair behind your back. Shocking, right?

87
00:12:08,557 --> 00:12:10,822
Where did you get this?

88
00:12:12,244 --> 00:12:19,975
Doesn’t matter. What matters is how surprised you are.

89
00:12:19,975 --> 00:12:24,290
Imagine how your mother would react if she saw this.

90
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:33,045
With just a rumor that you’re gay, she arranged our marriage.

91
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:41,272
What about your sister? With this kind of evidence?

92
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,808
Don’t touch my sister!

93
00:12:43,808 --> 00:12:47,672
I will! I have nothing to lose.

94
00:12:49,094 --> 00:12:55,771
You and I have been engaged since we were kids. Our marriage will happen.

95
00:13:03,735 --> 00:13:06,484
I’ll let you think it over for a couple of days.

96
00:13:06,484 --> 00:13:11,652
Hope you’re ready, Songprod.

97
00:14:03,272 --> 00:14:05,552
This is all my fault, P’Prod.

98
00:14:06,405 --> 00:14:10,951
Mook, I’m not looking for someone to blame.

99
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:13,650
Neither you nor Prang is at fault.

100
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:20,627
If anyone is to blame, it’s the person who recorded this to blackmail us.

101
00:14:22,902 --> 00:14:25,713
We have to do something.

102
00:14:49,035 --> 00:14:53,649
Why that face? I’m not scolding you.

103
00:14:55,782 --> 00:14:57,873
This is personal.

104
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:04,962
Actually, I’ve known for a while now.

105
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,912
I saw it on the CCTV.

106
00:15:11,623 --> 00:15:23,303
But I didn’t ask because I thought you’d tell me when you were ready.

107
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:29,948
Do you know what kind of person Mook is?

108
00:15:32,934 --> 00:15:41,553
It’s not that she’s bad, but in terms of love, she’s not ready.

109
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:48,303
I know.

110
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:55,604
Alright, since you know, that means you’ve decided.

111
00:15:58,164 --> 00:16:02,496
I respect that.

112
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:15,554
Whatever happens next, just remember I’m always here for you.

113
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:39,466
Ew, no.

114
00:16:42,595 --> 00:16:47,024
Why? I sanitized it.

115
00:16:50,437 --> 00:16:54,098
Have you thought about how you can help Songprod?

116
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:58,219
I have. Look at this.

117
00:17:00,636 --> 00:17:02,537
Guess who I met.

118
00:17:04,243 --> 00:17:08,176
Nita’s sister—the same one who poured water on me.

119
00:17:08,176 --> 00:17:12,315
She must be behind the leaked footage.

120
00:17:16,866 --> 00:17:19,857
I know how to help P’Prod.

121
00:17:35,784 --> 00:17:37,634
Wait… K. Nita!

122
00:17:37,634 --> 00:17:39,517
Who’s that?

123
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:42,983
Making a deal, just like you did with P’Prod.

124
00:17:42,983 --> 00:17:45,495
What did you just do, Natty?!

125
00:17:45,495 --> 00:17:48,107
You released her video—now she’s going to release yours.

126
00:17:48,107 --> 00:17:50,962
Be prepared, Natty.
