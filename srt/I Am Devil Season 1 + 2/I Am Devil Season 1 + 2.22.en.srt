1
00:01:36,456 --> 00:01:41,720
I'd rather kiss this rose.

2
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:53,920
I love you.

3
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,639
I love you too.

4
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:24,800
Oops!!! Smoked sausage. Denkhun is smoking hot too.

5
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,519
Auntie, please go sit down comfortably. Peem and I will take care of this.

6
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:32,800
Yes, Auntie. Hey, you two, you just kick me out whenever you feel like it.

7
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,599
Do you see me as a thorn in your side? No, Auntie, I just don't want you standing here.

8
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,720
I don't want Auntie to get smoked, or your hair to smell.

9
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,599
Well, that's why I came prepared. I have a hair cover ready.

10
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:50,840
You can grill whatever you want. But Mook's house is beautiful, it feels so warm.

11
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:58,640
And especially with Prang staying here, she won't have to call and complain about being lonely.

12
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,239
But I think Prang will be the one complaining more, Auntie.

13
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,959
Yes, Auntie, just imagine having to be with Mookmanee all day and night. Oh, I feel sorry for her.

14
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:16,440
Ugh, all day and all night, these two are just… always putting on a show.

15
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,360
Speaking of those two, where did they disappear to? They bring a guest to their house and then just leave.

16
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,120
And then just leave them there? Hmm, or maybe...

17
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,200
Did Sorn lock them up?
Oof.

18
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,040
That girl is so mischievous. What if she suddenly gets possessive of her daughter and locks her away?

19
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:38,159
Ugh, just talking about her gives me the creeps. That villain!
Oh, I don't think so, Auntie.

20
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,840
They probably have a lot to talk about today, and tomorrow, Mom's taking Grandma Pin to our Khao Yai place.

21
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,760
Mook probably won't see Grandma Pin for a long time then.
The vacation home?

22
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:56,239
The atmosphere there is great, way better than Bangkok.
Here, there's just dust and smoke.

23
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,000
Ugh, this is smoke too! Ugh, I can't take it! Ugh, it stinks!

24
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,120
The sausages are ready!
I'm so hungry.

25
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:10,599
What's there to eat?
Oh, you're here? You two! Leaving our guests alone at home.

26
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:16,320
And where did you two disappear to? Prod prepared so much food.

27
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,199
He was planning to feed the whole village! Counting everyone, there are only five of us.

28
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,720
No alcohol.

29
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,360
Oh, no alcohol? Come on, P'Peem!
We're celebrating.

30
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,080
No alcohol for you.
You...

31
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,160
Ugh, fine. But don't get too drunk, because tomorrow you have your annual calendar shoot.

32
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,800
You didn't forget, did you?
I didn't forget. I know that like the back of my hand.

33
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:54,000
I won't drink tonight, but I'll let my girlfriend drink to her heart's content.

34
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Celebrating your permanent return to Thailand! We can finally be together, Prangdao.

35
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,479
Ugh, see that? The fart's stink hasn't even faded yet, I'm telling you.

36
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,560
These two love to put on a show. Are you here to eat or to eat each other?

37
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,199
Ooh, can we have both?

38
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:22,360
If you guys aren't embarrassed for yourselves, at least...

39
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,080
...at least be embarrassed for the spirits of the place. Oh, this is giving me a headache.

40
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:13,440
I want to kiss you.

41
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,880
You're testing my patience, you know.

42
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:58,492
You're drunk.

43
00:06:58,492 --> 00:07:03,310
But I like it. I like it when you tease me.

44
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:33,280
Good Morning, everyone! Welcome back to Talk of the Town!

45
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,360
With me, you know there's never a dull moment! We've got another update for you today.

46
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:44,960
If you want to know what it is, hit that like button first! That's right, that's right. Today's topic is extra spicy.

47
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:51,199
If you're tired of the scandalous affairs of villainess M.M.N., I'm telling you, today we have a new and very interesting topic.

48
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,599
So, the story is that she has some anti-fans...

49
00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:02,120
...who created a group and asked her followers to donate money. There are tons of victims everywhere.

50
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:07,360
And then what happened was, some fan groups came to her and asked her to compensate for the damages.

51
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,240
But if I were her, I'd be stressed! Suddenly being caught up in something like this.

52
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:19,039
These days, you really have to think carefully before transferring money or doing anything. There are so many scammers out there.

53
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,120
Of course, I have to side with her! She didn't do anything wrong in this, you know?

54
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:32,200
Whenever we transfer money to someone, we have to double-check.
Enough with the headaches, I have some gossip!

55
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:39,240
Remember that new actress, Prao? The one who
replaced Grace as the lead actress.

56
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:46,480
Yeah, I think the same! Her face is so cute and
adorable, like a marshmallow.

57
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,560
So cute!

58
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,080
She's the same one who was in the news with Mookmanee.

59
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:01,920
Oops, I let it slip! Don't tell anyone, okay? This
stays between us.

60
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:58,360
I gave you all the information! How could you still fail, Nita?

61
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,640
At the very least, you should have gotten out of jail sooner.

62
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:38,040
Hello, I've brought Nita.

63
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:47,639
Now that you're out, behave yourself and listen to me. Do you know how much effort it took to get you out?

64
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:56,040
I had to pull so many strings. You needed to have a history of mental illness.

65
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:06,040
From now on, you need to be quiet, stay calm, and don't cause any more trouble for me.

66
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,240
I'm trying to find a way to save our family.

67
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,920
I will never go bankrupt.

68
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:25,399
When we get home, pack all your belongings. I'm taking you to the small house.

69
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,830
Thank you. Thank you so much.

70
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,279
Hey Mook!
Prang, why did you take so long?

71
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:14,120
I'm almost at the studio.
The cafe you like is far away.

72
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:19,360
I told you to just buy it at any cafe!
I didn't want you to go that far, Prang.

73
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,279
You never listen to me.
I already went, P'Mook. Please don't nag.

74
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,560
I wanted to come out for a drive anyway. Gotta go, P'Mook. I'm almost there.

75
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:37,240
Okay.

76
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,000
Can I have some time to think about it?

77
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,120
It's just that Mook's schedule is quite packed these days. I'm afraid I won't be able to manage the time very well.

78
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:54,079
You can handle it. I have faith in your abilities. You're only taking care of two people, Mook and Prow.

79
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,600
I'm only asking you to look after Prow for one month, really.

80
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:09,199
Oh, I'm so sorry! Are you alright? Does it hurt anywhere?

81
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:14,480
I'm okay. It doesn't hurt. I didn't do it on purpose.

82
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:21,480
I'm really sorry. The coffee spilled all over. I'll buy you a new one.

83
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,120
I'm here shooting at this studio anyway. I'm not in a rush, I can order you a delivery.

84
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,000
It's okay, really. You don't need to order a delivery.

85
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,199
It's just a little bit, I can still drink it. I feel bad.

86
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:40,480
It's okay, really, it's okay.

87
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,519
Excuse me, I have to go.

88
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,800
Consider it helping me out. I don't know who else I can trust besides Peem.

89
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,720
Okay, sure, I will.

90
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:05,399
Hey Prang, why are you so wet? I spilled a little coffee on myself, P'Peem.

91
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:11,079
I'm not too bad, but the coffee is!

92
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,040
Okay, let me help you clean up. Come on, I'll take you.

93
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,360
Let's go.
