1
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,089
I told P’Peem not to send anyone.

2
00:00:34,089 --> 00:00:38,000
Why did you follow me?

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,677
Are you brushing me off?

4
00:00:41,677 --> 00:00:44,486
Think whatever you want.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,548
I’m sorry, Prang.

6
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,166
Hello, Natty.

7
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,707
“P’Ni, I’m hurt.

8
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,958
Dad hit me really hard.

9
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:49,552
There’s blood.

10
00:01:50,408 --> 00:01:59,670
Please help me—I can’t stand it anymore.

11
00:02:33,347 --> 00:02:39,715
Guys, Hera Club is Hera Club. Scandals every day.

12
00:02:39,715 --> 00:02:45,266
Don’t waste time figuring out who Mook kissed.

13
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:47,290
Honestly, there are so many photos.

14
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,280
If I put them all up, my house would have a new wallpaper.

15
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,257
Anyway, back to the MookGrace ship—

16
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:57,935
I heard they’ll have new projects together.

17
00:02:57,935 --> 00:03:02,448
Let’s board the ship!

18
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:58,891
Eat more, Grandma, so you’ll remember me soon.

19
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,720
Did I forget you?

20
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,437
Where’s that cute little girl?

21
00:04:09,437 --> 00:04:12,761
Why doesn’t she visit me anymore?

22
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:15,673
You remember this clearly.

23
00:04:18,242 --> 00:04:21,164
But don’t count on her coming back.

24
00:04:27,871 --> 00:04:29,505
Hello

25
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,904
Tomorrow, Prangdao is going back to England.

26
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:35,141
Your grandma should also move out.

27
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:42,423
I transferred her to a VIP room, it's similar to the current room.

28
00:04:42,423 --> 00:04:46,103
You should also leave Songprod’s house too.

29
00:04:46,103 --> 00:04:50,002
Everything needs to go back to normal where there is no you.

30
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,270
Wait.. wait a sec.

31
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:47,255
—this hairpin. I customized it for us. One for you and one for me.

32
00:05:57,002 --> 00:05:59,172
Hello, P'Peem

33
00:05:59,172 --> 00:06:02,689
Songprod and I are running errands.

34
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:08,701
Did you know Prangdao is going back to England?

35
00:06:10,128 --> 00:06:13,200
And also another thing Mook,

36
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:19,381
I sent you the script for the series. Check your email.

37
00:06:19,381 --> 00:06:24,352
You need to go to the studio tomorrow.

38
00:06:24,352 --> 00:06:27,950
They want some photo shoot and script role-play

39
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,210
Okay.

40
00:06:55,755 --> 00:06:58,225
Please don’t cry, Prang.

41
00:07:03,362 --> 00:07:08,681
I don’t like when you’re cold to me.

42
00:07:08,681 --> 00:07:14,835
Tomorrow I’m leaving for England.

43
00:07:18,117 --> 00:07:25,264
Can you please not be cold? It really hurts.

44
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,295
I’m sorry.

45
00:07:32,295 --> 00:07:37,076
I don’t know what to do.

46
00:07:38,075 --> 00:07:41,636
What should I do, Prang?

47
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,263
You’re both useless. Both you and your sister.

48
00:11:42,263 --> 00:11:46,431
Do I need to hit you harder to make you think?

49
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,026
Hello. I need your help.

50
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:15,278
Where did Mookmanee’s fans order the food support?

51
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,680
What are you doing, Ni?

52
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,290
Making my parents proud.

53
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:27,067
Don't ask more.Just get me the info.

54
00:12:40,408 --> 00:12:42,825
You are responsible for this, Mookmanee

55
00:12:42,825 --> 00:12:47,263
—even if the debt were paid by others,

56
00:12:47,263 --> 00:12:51,400
you’ll live with the guilt for the rest of your life.

57
00:13:15,274 --> 00:13:19,397
Prang, when is your flight again? 2 am?

58
00:13:19,397 --> 00:13:24,071
Prod said that we'll took you to your favourite restaurant

59
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:26,667
before sending you off to the airport.

60
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:29,473
Okay, that sounds great.

61
00:13:42,814 --> 00:13:47,465
Prang, are you okay about going back to England?

62
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:56,011
I have no choice. Actually, this trip to Thailand was only to visit P'Prod.

63
00:13:57,415 --> 00:14:01,175
I have to go back and look after the company.

64
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:04,341
My friend and I start a graphic design company together.

65
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:08,018
I actually understand mum.

66
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,794
I will go back and rethink about the situation.

67
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,472
What’s this? So much food.

68
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:37,305
Omakakai, famous place!”

69
00:14:37,305 --> 00:14:39,078
Do you want it?

70
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:44,789
Just kidding—if I took it, your fans would come after me.

71
00:14:52,864 --> 00:14:54,996
Here, have it.

72
00:14:54,996 --> 00:14:58,294
But they've prepared it for you.

73
00:14:58,294 --> 00:15:01,097
Too much sugar. I can’t drink it. Drink up.

74
00:15:30,237 --> 00:15:35,588
Prang! Prang! Prang! Prang! Prang! P'Peem, what is wrong with her?.

75
00:15:35,588 --> 00:15:39,246
Prang! Prang! Prang! Prang!

76
00:15:39,246 --> 00:15:40,332
What's wrong?

77
00:15:43,356 --> 00:15:45,310
Shut it.

78
00:15:46,504 --> 00:15:50,073
Someone, someone call the ambulance! Hurry!

79
00:15:50,073 --> 00:15:51,627
Okay okay.

80
00:15:51,627 --> 00:15:54,111
Prang! Prang!

81
00:16:11,281 --> 00:16:16,953
Have a drink, Mook you have to claim down

82
00:16:16,953 --> 00:16:19,094
I beg you

83
00:16:19,094 --> 00:16:22,381
Hello Prod

84
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:38,215
It's you Prangdao, You are really unlucky.

85
00:16:38,215 --> 00:16:41,429
It started with you.

86
00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:44,776
That's why your sister had to suffer the misfortune instead.

87
00:16:46,774 --> 00:16:53,000
Mook stop! stop!
