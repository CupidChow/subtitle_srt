1
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,735
And you must divorce her now!

2
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:50,403
No, I won’t!

3
00:01:50,403 --> 00:01:52,060
Mookmanee and I love each other.

4
00:01:52,945 --> 00:01:54,841
How well do you know her?

5
00:01:54,841 --> 00:01:57,734
Why did you sign the marriage certificate with her?

6
00:01:57,734 --> 00:02:00,056
Can you stop getting in my way—like Mum does?

7
00:02:00,056 --> 00:02:04,150
love and what I need in life are two different things.

8
00:02:10,907 --> 00:02:12,981
My Lady, Miss Prangdao is here.

9
00:02:19,535 --> 00:02:21,174
Good morning, Step-Mother

10
00:02:21,814 --> 00:02:22,870
Sit

11
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:33,045
I have something for you to do.

12
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,227
When are you going back to England?

13
00:02:37,095 --> 00:02:37,844
Next week

14
00:02:39,171 --> 00:02:41,876
No. Move it.

15
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,666
You’re staying here to help me

16
00:02:44,863 --> 00:02:45,869
—and help your brother.

17
00:02:47,932 --> 00:02:49,786
Songprod is blinded by his love for that girl.

18
00:02:51,408 --> 00:02:53,160
Tomorrow, I’ll have you move into their house.

19
00:02:54,118 --> 00:02:55,785
You’ll be my eyes and ears.

20
00:03:00,356 --> 00:03:01,294
What are you scared of Prangdao,

21
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:04,112
Songprod won't be mad at you.

22
00:03:09,027 --> 00:03:10,132
Listen to me

23
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:13,194
—no one can help Songprod but you.

24
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,270
I want them divorced as soon as possible.

25
00:03:53,811 --> 00:03:55,016
Thank you, Songprod,

26
00:03:55,582 --> 00:03:57,182
for helping me with all the expenses.

27
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,483
You’ve been a big help.

28
00:04:01,695 --> 00:04:02,762
It’s all good, Mook.

29
00:04:03,278 --> 00:04:05,153
Don’t worry about money.

30
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:08,054
If you need anything else, just let me know

31
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:09,648
—no need to be shy.

32
00:04:11,466 --> 00:04:12,632
Thank you again, Songprod.

33
00:04:13,346 --> 00:04:14,478
Alright then, I’ll get going.

34
00:05:13,015 --> 00:05:14,580
What’s taking you so long? Do you need my help?

35
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:19,278
No need, I’ve already done it.

36
00:05:27,313 --> 00:05:29,068
Hey, what’s with that smile?

37
00:05:30,616 --> 00:05:32,044
So, when are you going to tell me

38
00:05:32,609 --> 00:05:33,845
what you’re up to?

39
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,220
Now you’re bringing groceries into the house.

40
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,585
Isn’t that a little odd?

41
00:05:39,396 --> 00:05:40,254
Odd? How?

42
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:44,166
I’m his sister—buying groceries for my brother.

43
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,824
What’s wrong with that? You’re just picking on me.

44
00:05:54,042 --> 00:05:54,935
You!

45
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,207
Yes, I am picking on you.

46
00:05:59,214 --> 00:06:00,316
And frankly,

47
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:02,881
I think you’re trading yourself for your brother just for me to mess with.

48
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:05,330
I am not! Let me go!

49
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:05,830
No.

50
00:06:07,796 --> 00:06:09,265
I know you’re here to spy on me.

51
00:06:16,883 --> 00:06:17,585
Well, good!

52
00:06:18,543 --> 00:06:19,396
Then you can see for yourself

53
00:06:19,396 --> 00:06:21,167
how lovely Songprod and I are together.

54
00:06:22,543 --> 00:06:24,281
Feel free to come live with us

55
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:26,784
—you won’t have to keep coming and going.

56
00:06:28,062 --> 00:06:29,612
You’ll see everything clearly. That way, you won’t miss any of the ‘important’ events.

57
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,201
Do you dare?

58
00:06:42,698 --> 00:06:43,857
You said it

59
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:47,987
I'll be waiting.

60
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,596
Well, I have to go to work now.

61
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:59,301
See you around... sister-in-law.

62
00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:22,946
Hello, Aunty Den?

63
00:07:22,946 --> 00:07:25,653
Prangdao! I’ve just landed at the airport.

64
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:28,322
Come pick me up right now—it’s soooo hot here!

65
00:07:28,961 --> 00:07:30,235
Okay

66
00:07:42,841 --> 00:07:44,693
Beautiful! Beautiful!

67
00:07:44,693 --> 00:07:45,556
Okay, change.

68
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,467
Perfect. Very pretty, Mook.

69
00:08:04,475 --> 00:08:07,389
Alright, we’re done. You can rest now.

70
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:08,596
Thank you

71
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:11,252
Bravo!

72
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:19,265
Hello,

73
00:08:20,322 --> 00:08:22,590
Mookmanee is currently doing a photoshoot for your product promotion Nita.

74
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,962
Good. I’ll head in now.

75
00:08:25,503 --> 00:08:27,897
You go watch Songprod at the hospital.

76
00:08:27,897 --> 00:08:30,117
I want to know his every move.

77
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:34,015
If there’s anything, I’ll call and update you.

78
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,951
Social media trends are really big right now.

79
00:08:37,811 --> 00:08:40,440
I’ll make it even bigger. Just you wait.

80
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,637
Ok, bye

81
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,006
Okay, cut! That’s a wrap. Thank you, everyone.

82
00:08:54,006 --> 00:08:56,053
Thank you

83
00:09:00,796 --> 00:09:04,492
Mook, I think you need to stop engaging on social media for now.

84
00:09:04,492 --> 00:09:06,307
I don’t want you fighting with people online.

85
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,196
This time... it’s different.

86
00:09:09,326 --> 00:09:10,316
Anti-fans again?

87
00:09:10,857 --> 00:09:11,840
What are they saying this time?

88
00:09:13,388 --> 00:09:15,330
They’re boycotting all the products

89
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,717
and reality shows you’re endorsing as a brand ambassador.

90
00:09:18,774 --> 00:09:21,568
They claim what you did was ‘immoral’

91
00:09:21,568 --> 00:09:22,835
and shouldn’t be supported.

92
00:09:25,808 --> 00:09:27,197
It’s getting big,

93
00:09:28,106 --> 00:09:29,512
Mook. You should be prepared.

94
00:09:30,888 --> 00:09:32,248
I don’t care, Peem.

95
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,531
It’s not far off from what I expected.

96
00:09:39,593 --> 00:09:42,197
Oh, Peem! This sunscreen is amazing.

97
00:09:42,762 --> 00:09:44,644
I was under the spotlight just now,

98
00:09:44,644 --> 00:09:45,676
but my skin doesn’t feel irritated at all.

99
00:09:45,676 --> 00:09:47,422
Is it really that good?

100
00:09:48,257 --> 00:09:49,196
Here, give me your arm.

101
00:09:49,196 --> 00:09:50,948
Even guys need to take care of themselves.

102
00:09:50,948 --> 00:09:52,465
I can’t be the only one!

103
00:09:52,465 --> 00:09:53,798
No way! It’ll be sticky.

104
00:09:54,584 --> 00:09:55,735
It’s not! Let me tell you

105
00:09:55,735 --> 00:09:57,331
—this is the new innovation, Aqua Tech. It’s lightweight,

106
00:09:57,331 --> 00:09:58,615
non-sticky,

107
00:10:00,507 --> 00:10:02,507
I confirmed

108
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:06,216
Look! It’s already gone.

109
00:10:08,502 --> 00:10:09,616
Plus, it smells really nice.

110
00:10:09,861 --> 00:10:10,361
Try it!

111
00:10:12,156 --> 00:10:13,836
Oh... it does smell good.

112
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,899
See? Fast absorbing, right?

113
00:10:25,328 --> 00:10:26,952
It’s good.

114
00:10:27,321 --> 00:10:28,732
Who’s that?

115
00:10:28,732 --> 00:10:30,364
Oh, that’s Miss Nita—

116
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:32,043
the owner of the food supplement product.

117
00:10:32,043 --> 00:10:33,950
She’s also the heir to the pharmaceutical empire

118
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,436
... and and Songprod’s fiancée.

119
00:10:36,977 --> 00:10:39,708
Mooknanee is the current brand ambassador,

120
00:10:40,888 --> 00:10:42,113
but she’s done for.

121
00:10:49,706 --> 00:10:50,666
Miss Nita.

122
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:53,269
I need to talk to you.

123
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:57,769
Privately.

124
00:10:59,219 --> 00:11:00,160
Follow me.

125
00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:18,391
Hello, Songprod? Nita’s here.

126
00:11:31,712 --> 00:11:33,622
I’m here to talk about the contract agreement.

127
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:37,312
At first, I considered contacting your agency,

128
00:11:38,418 --> 00:11:40,156
but since I had business nearby,

129
00:11:40,648 --> 00:11:41,960
I decided to handle this personally.

130
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,556
You’ve damaged my brand’s reputation, Mooknanee.

131
00:11:47,318 --> 00:11:49,445
I have more than enough reason to terminate our contract.

132
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:54,812
Get to the point. What do you want?

133
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,269
I want you to divorce Songprod.

134
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,461
He’s my fiancé.

135
00:12:03,346 --> 00:12:04,826
And let me warn you—

136
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,580
I will do whatever

137
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,445
it takes to get him back.

138
00:12:10,551 --> 00:12:11,667
My advice?

139
00:12:12,183 --> 00:12:13,631
Back off now,

140
00:12:14,344 --> 00:12:16,199
and I’ll pretend none of this ever happened.

141
00:12:18,116 --> 00:12:19,622
Are you threatening me?

142
00:12:20,998 --> 00:12:22,741
There’s no point, Nita.

143
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:27,021
Songprod and I love each other. You can’t force me out of his life.

144
00:12:30,314 --> 00:12:30,814
Love?

145
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,079
Someone like you?

146
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,825
To be frank, I’m not surprised.

147
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,532
If I came from a background like yours,

148
00:12:39,532 --> 00:12:41,066
I’d probably do the same.

149
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:43,718
With a rich man in front of me

150
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,653
—who wouldn’t want him?

151
00:12:47,422 --> 00:12:49,504
You’re right.

152
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,724
You want him too, don’t you? But he didn’t choose you

153
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,036
—he chose me.

154
00:12:56,945 --> 00:12:58,622
So, don’t bother me, Nita.

155
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,947
Do whatever you want. I don’t care.

156
00:13:03,544 --> 00:13:04,044
You!

157
00:13:05,715 --> 00:13:06,810
Are you done talking?

158
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,011
Please excuse me.

159
00:13:15,776 --> 00:13:16,815
you two signing marriage certificates

160
00:13:16,815 --> 00:13:19,238
—this is all just a cover for something,

161
00:13:19,238 --> 00:13:20,427
Answer!!

162
00:13:20,427 --> 00:13:22,946
Was it worth it, Mook? Giving up this much?

163
00:13:23,437 --> 00:13:27,192
More than enough. For her, I can do anythingplease,

164
00:13:27,192 --> 00:13:28,698
wake up soon.

165
00:13:29,337 --> 00:13:31,467
What? You’re getting married next month?!

166
00:13:32,253 --> 00:13:34,752
And you’re just going to let it happen, Songprod?
