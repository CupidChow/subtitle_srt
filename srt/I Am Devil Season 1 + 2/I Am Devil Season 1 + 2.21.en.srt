00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:54,537
OMG, guys! It’s been three months since we talked about Mookmanee.

2
00:03:54,537 --> 00:04:02,068
Are you bored? Please don’t be! Let’s gossip!

3
00:04:02,068 --> 00:04:08,348
All this time, fans have been asking about the owner of those red roses.

4
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:14,093
I even called Hera Club, and they said they haven’t seen Mookmanee in months!

5
00:04:14,093 --> 00:04:18,161
Who could it be?

6
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:22,600
Are they really in love?! Who is it?

7
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:30,218
Could it be N'Proud, the new devilish lead in the series?

8
00:04:30,218 --> 00:04:41,623
I heard Mookmanee has been spotted in the changing room with her!

9
00:04:41,623 --> 00:04:51,880
If this keeps up, the MookGrace ship might sink!

10
00:04:51,880 --> 00:05:00,246
OMG! No rest! I need to know!

11
00:05:05,862 --> 00:05:09,825
Thank you.

12
00:05:11,357 --> 00:05:14,283
So, what’s the deal with MookProud now?

13
00:05:14,283 --> 00:05:18,364
The gossip is spreading. MookGrace can’t compete.

14
00:05:18,364 --> 00:05:22,825
Be careful—Prangdao will come after you.

15
00:05:22,825 --> 00:05:28,632
P'Peem, Prang hasn’t picked up in two days.

16
00:05:33,882 --> 00:05:35,939
Do you believe in karma?

17
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:39,051
You deserved it.

18
00:05:39,051 --> 00:05:42,488
I don’t even understand why you went in there alone with her.

19
00:05:42,488 --> 00:05:46,807
P'Peem, listen. She just asked for help zipping up her dress.

20
00:05:46,807 --> 00:05:51,787
So I helped. Why did it have to turn into a scandal?

21
00:05:57,806 --> 00:06:02,567
People love to gossip—are they using their mouths to work?

22
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,904
Mook, I know you've shed your devilish image,

23
00:06:07,904 --> 00:06:11,338
but please don’t turn off your brain.

24
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:16,539
You’ve met so many people.

25
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:19,772
How can you not see that she did it on purpose?

26
00:06:19,772 --> 00:06:22,034
I don’t want to talk to you anymore.

27
00:06:22,034 --> 00:06:24,197
This is making me crazy.

28
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,782
P'Mook, I want to talk to you. Can we talk?

29
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:43,680
Grace, I’m already in so much trouble. I can’t deal with…

30
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,430
Then let me say it here.

31
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,878
I’m moving on from you.

32
00:06:49,878 --> 00:06:51,607
You can rest easy.

33
00:06:51,607 --> 00:06:54,944
I won’t bother you anymore. From now on,

34
00:06:54,944 --> 00:06:58,841
we’re just work partners. I mean it.

35
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:52,753
What? Did you post that photo to get back at me?

36
00:07:52,753 --> 00:07:54,585
Mook! What happen?

37
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,823
Think of it as karma. You did it to her first,

38
00:08:01,823 --> 00:08:05,035
now you’re getting it back.

39
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:07,637
P'Peem, do you even know who she is?

40
00:08:10,592 --> 00:08:12,406
She’s my friend.

41
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:24,015
Are you teasing me? Who allowed you to post those photos?

42
00:08:24,015 --> 00:08:27,660
Well, who allowed you to have those rumours with other girls?

43
00:08:29,521 --> 00:08:31,847
Are you jealous?

44
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,919
And you’re not?

45
00:08:41,735 --> 00:08:44,044
Are you going public?

46
00:08:45,248 --> 00:08:49,752
Umm… should I?

47
00:08:49,752 --> 00:08:53,449
Are you ready to go public with me?

48
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,054
Yes!

49
00:09:02,103 --> 00:09:04,754
Don’t you have roses for me?

50
00:09:06,943 --> 00:09:13,740
No, I didn’t bring any. Today, I came here just to scold you.

51
00:09:15,382 --> 00:09:17,617
You can borrow mine.

52
00:09:22,214 --> 00:09:24,670
Shall we celebrate?

53
00:09:25,655 --> 00:09:28,362
Kiss her.

54
00:09:31,507 --> 00:09:35,172
And don’t you want to kiss… I know....

55
00:09:56,404 --> 00:09:58,389
I give this to you

56
00:09:59,046 --> 00:10:00,757
They said we should kiss.

57
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,303
Right here?

58
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,344
But we haven't clear yet.

59
00:10:08,344 --> 00:10:12,010
Clear later, Kiss first.

60
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:28,742
Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her!

61
00:10:28,742 --> 00:10:32,745
Then we’ll deal with everything else later.
