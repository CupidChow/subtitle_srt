1
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,759
Oh is Praw's manager. He wants me to take care of Praw.

2
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,399
How about starting by dealing with someone named Prangdao first?

3
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,719
From now on, there's nothing related to Nita. It's just you and me.

4
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,399
The court acquitted Nita. Money really can buy anything.

5
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,799
In exchange for you becoming his mistress. If you don't want to, I'll just send Natty instead.

6
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:07,200
Prod, I'd like to transfer my sister to your hospital for treatment.

7
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,599
In this life, Natty is the most important to me.

8
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,640
Good morning! You guys have seen it, right? Where are you going now?

9
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:25,800
It's all about Mook-Praw, Praw-Mook everywhere. And they're using matching items so intensely.

10
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,280
Is there something going on? I think so too. Their couple gigs are booked solid all the way to Mars.

11
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,200
It's a little difficult for anyone to contact them for work.

12
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:44,120
But do you think like me? Where did that Cutie Pie girl disappear to, or are they the same person?

13
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:54,239
I don't know, but anyway, I'm declaring right now, I ship Mook-Praw, Praw-Mook.

14
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,480
Only then add the hashtags together: Mook-Praw, Praw-Mook.

15
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,159
You and Prow have been training together for a week now.

16
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:34,400
I think we're going to have some trouble soon.
I mean,

17
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,519
A 'couple goals' gig. What can I do? P'Peem and the higher-ups love it.

18
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,280
Right now, it's all couple gigs. There's almost no solo work left.

19
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,319
Of course. They love anything that sells.

20
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:55,239
But honestly, Prow seems like she really wants to be paired up with you.

21
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:00,799
Think about it, she buys and uses the same things as you. Exactly the same.

22
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,011
Whatever. Let her do what she wants. I don't care.

23
00:04:08,335 --> 00:04:10,000
You have a rehearsal for the fashion show.

24
00:04:11,065 --> 00:04:11,828
You haven't forgotten, have you?

25
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:19,138
I haven't. What's on tomorrow's schedule? Fashion show, talk about the product...

26
00:04:19,138 --> 00:04:22,104
And a photo op with fans. Is that all?

27
00:04:22,104 --> 00:04:24,538
Pretty much. The organizer requested that...

28
00:04:24,538 --> 00:04:28,297
They want a sweet, sweet ending.

29
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,840
So, after the show, you're going to kiss on stage, right?

30
00:04:34,437 --> 00:04:36,047
Are you jealous?

31
00:04:37,179 --> 00:04:38,311
Mmm hmm, jealous.

32
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:44,759
What am I even doing here?
This is driving me crazy.

33
00:04:48,198 --> 00:04:50,539
So, what's the conclusion? Did Pimpim really have a kiss scene?

34
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,435
What kiss scene?

35
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,642
Just a hug is enough, and maybe
give her some flowers.

36
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,203
We have to go along with what they want, right?

37
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,280
That's just how it is. They're the producers, you know.

38
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,240
I wish the day would come when we can actually say no.
How famous do we have to be?

39
00:05:15,043 --> 00:05:16,017
That's the truth.

40
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:19,454
Being a celebrity means being a puppet for the capitalists anyway.

41
00:05:25,713 --> 00:05:27,049
Prangdao

42
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,504
Could you make me some pressed rice tonight?

43
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:33,270
I'm going to brag about it to everyone.

44
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,231
That I have a girlfriend who cooks for me.

45
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,649
Ouch.

46
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,346
Ow, that hurts.

47
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,440
I pinched you so it would hurt, so the adults will scold you again for sure.

48
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,600
You promised them you wouldn't be so blatant, didn't you?

49
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:00,039
Mook, do you still want to be in the industry? If you want to stay in the industry,

50
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:06,080
you have to be patient. At least be patient until your contract is up.

51
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,400
Can you do that? I don't want you to break your word to anyone.

52
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,850
Because what we've said, we can't take it back, you know?

53
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm leaving.

54
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,378
Where are you going? I just got a chance to rest.

55
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:31,039
I have to pick up Pao and then discuss the next ad campaign.

56
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,680
Let's meet at the studio this evening. You're driving yourself, right?

57
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,882
Yeah.

58
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,840
I'm off.

59
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,680
Ugh!!! So tired!

60
00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:07,880
Are you blushing?

61
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:12,360
Why are you blushing?

62
00:07:13,562 --> 00:07:17,541
We've done more than this before, you know.

63
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,279
P'Mook

64
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,639
P'Mook, what are you going to do?

65
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,199
I only have until this evening.

66
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,800
I don't want to waste any time.

67
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,839
Have some water first, P'Mook.

68
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You'll feel more relaxed.

69
00:10:31,842 --> 00:10:34,295
You're taking such good care of me. Thank you.

70
00:10:36,243 --> 00:10:38,190
When I was sick,

71
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,520
you took care of me this well too.

72
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,850
Then let's take care of each other like this,

73
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:53,044
forever.

74
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,296
Blushing again, blushing, so cute!

75
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,399
Don't even.

76
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,828
Seriously, don't.

77
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:08,349
So, are you feeling any better?

78
00:11:09,024 --> 00:11:10,000
Not at all.

79
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,335
Still feeling feverish and flushed.

80
00:11:12,335 --> 00:11:14,493
Why don't you try putting your hand on my forehead?

81
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:19,273
I don't feel any heat.

82
00:11:19,273 --> 00:11:22,070
No, you have to press your forehead against mine.

83
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:24,530
That's the only way to know if I'm really hot.

84
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,800
P'Mook,

85
00:11:29,018 --> 00:11:30,640
I'm feeling better now.

86
00:11:31,705 --> 00:11:35,258
I just don't feel like driving myself.

87
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,453
Should I drive you?

88
00:11:38,453 --> 00:11:40,000
Absolutely not.

89
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,562
You'll have to drive back at night.

90
00:11:43,562 --> 00:11:45,903
And you still have your own work to do.

91
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,678
Just making me food like this,

92
00:11:48,678 --> 00:11:51,383
I'm already so grateful.

93
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,120
Could you grab my phone for me?

94
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,803
Thank you.

95
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,827
Hello, Muk, what's up?

96
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:24,550
P'Pim, could you come pick me up? I have really bad period cramps.

97
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,063
I don't want to drive myself anymore.

98
00:12:26,063 --> 00:12:29,394
Are you sure you're okay? If you're not, I can let them know.

99
00:12:29,394 --> 00:12:33,480
I'm okay, I'm okay. Bang Dao already got me a hot water bottle to use.

100
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:39,560
And there's work tomorrow too. P'Pim, I have to go to Blocking practice.

101
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,072
Could you swing by and pick me up?

102
00:12:41,072 --> 00:12:45,120
Okay, okay, I'll come get you ASAP.

103
00:13:01,923 --> 00:13:04,013
Wait for me a sec, I'll go get Mook.

104
00:13:04,013 --> 00:13:06,764
Prow, can I go to the restroom?

105
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:12,463
If I have to wait until we get to the studio, I don't think I can hold it.

106
00:13:12,463 --> 00:13:15,880
Thank you.

107
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,369
The restroom is all the way down on the right.

108
00:13:35,369 --> 00:13:38,279
Thank you, P'Peem.

109
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,320
Hello Muk, where are you?

110
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,578
Are you here already? I'm upstairs.

111
00:13:51,578 --> 00:13:53,110
Just a sec, I'll be right down.

112
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,720
I just popped up to grab a pad to change.

113
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,160
Oh, okay.

114
00:14:12,034 --> 00:14:16,069
Are you done yet? I have to go. P'Peem is here to pick me up.

115
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:22,560
I'm done. Enjoy your meal, I put my heart and soul into it.

116
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,040
Give me a kiss for good luck.

117
00:14:29,323 --> 00:14:33,885
Hurry up, Muk. P'Peem is waiting.

118
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:36,068
Are you kicking me out?

119
00:14:36,068 --> 00:14:39,279
How dare you?

120
00:14:51,243 --> 00:14:54,112
You saw it, didn't you?

121
00:14:54,112 --> 00:14:55,444
Yeah, I saw.

122
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,044
While I was waiting in the car.

123
00:14:57,044 --> 00:15:01,480
Hurry and follow me. Prao's coming.

124
00:15:06,854 --> 00:15:09,048
Did I make you wait long?

125
00:15:09,048 --> 00:15:11,939
Hmm, it's okay.

126
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:14,436
There, Mook's here.

127
00:15:14,436 --> 00:15:17,560
Let's hurry, we're already late.
