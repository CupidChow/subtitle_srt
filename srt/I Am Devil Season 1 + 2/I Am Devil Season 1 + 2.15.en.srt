00:00:33,317 --> 00:00:34,879
Hi P'Peem

2
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:37,113
Mook, why are you so naughty?

3
00:00:37,113 --> 00:00:40,042
Didn’t I tell you not to go anywhere?

4
00:00:40,042 --> 00:00:42,711
Who told you this time?

5
00:00:42,711 --> 00:00:47,204
What? There are videos of you and Grace kissing all over the internet.

6
00:00:47,204 --> 00:00:48,979
What?!

7
00:00:59,145 --> 00:01:00,245
Omg, everyone!!

8
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,458
Mookmanee and Grace! Is this true?

9
00:01:04,696 --> 00:01:07,631
Don’t tell me they’re back together.

10
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:12,823
What about the rich husband? Did they break up?

11
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:16,805
Why is this happening? Again, you all need to help me figure it out.

12
00:01:18,308 --> 00:01:21,681
What’s the real story?!

13
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:35,803
I think I want to send Mookmanee another gift.

14
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:39,049
She needs some cheering up.

15
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,070
Send it to her house, okay?

16
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:51,730
With so many enemies, you’ll never get me.

17
00:02:13,034 --> 00:02:14,206
Are you still mad at me?

18
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,454
Did you see the video?

19
00:02:22,929 --> 00:02:23,761
It has nothing to do with me.

20
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:30,278
Where are you going?

21
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,482
I’ve ordered congee for you. Eat with me.

22
00:02:34,278 --> 00:02:37,774
I’m not hungry. Don’t want to eat. I’m going to take a shower.

23
00:02:38,481 --> 00:02:40,655
Don’t want to eat? Still have to eat. Don’t be fussy.

24
00:02:41,893 --> 00:02:43,506
Why do you like to force me?

25
00:02:46,246 --> 00:02:47,759
Don’t know.

26
00:02:48,378 --> 00:02:50,705
I just don’t like you not listening. It’s annoying.

27
00:03:09,339 --> 00:03:10,658
Hello

28
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:13,394
What the hell is this?

29
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:15,655
What did you do?

30
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,166
When Songprod touches down in Thailand, I’m taking you to divorce!

31
00:03:21,315 --> 00:03:22,516
Where is the marriage certificate?

32
00:03:31,055 --> 00:03:32,747
Here’s our contract.

33
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,968
Just to confirm that we’re only married by contract.

34
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:39,258
No inheritance involved.

35
00:03:48,894 --> 00:03:50,843
It’s not even necessary, Mook.

36
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:56,402
P'Prod, let me. I want to come clean.

37
00:03:57,198 --> 00:03:59,495
You can keep it with the marriage certificates.

38
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:31,756
Where is it? Where are the certificates?

39
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:36,372
Don’t think you can hide them, and I can’t do anything about it.

40
00:04:36,372 --> 00:04:38,959
Songprod won’t keep quiet about this.

41
00:04:48,064 --> 00:04:49,671
Madam I've Found it.

42
00:05:08,235 --> 00:05:10,452
What is this?

43
00:05:10,452 --> 00:05:13,477
What does this mean?!

44
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:24,331
It means I’ll do anything so I don’t have to marry Nita.

45
00:05:24,331 --> 00:05:27,264
Songprod! So you lied to me?!

46
00:05:27,264 --> 00:05:29,262
How could you do that?

47
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:33,501
Go and divorce her and get ready to marry Nita!

48
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:35,264
No, I won’t.

49
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,554
Songprod! You are my son!

50
00:05:39,554 --> 00:05:40,879
You have to listen to me!

51
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,078
Do you know how important they are to us?

52
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:49,039
If it weren’t for them, our business would’ve been gone by now.

53
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:52,047
Can you stop causing problems?!

54
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,785
I’m giving you 2 days. Make everything right!

55
00:06:28,674 --> 00:06:32,353
How did I raise him? Why is he so spoiled?

56
00:06:34,563 --> 00:06:39,294
Madam, just then, our private investigator called.

57
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,804
They’ve found K.Phin’s old neighbour.

58
00:06:45,776 --> 00:06:47,811
Not much information since

59
00:06:47,811 --> 00:06:51,066
K.Phin moved a long time ago.

60
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,856
Apparently, she’s staying with her daughter near Nonthaburi.

61
00:06:57,154 --> 00:07:01,126
They’ve changed names but aren’t sure.

62
00:07:02,275 --> 00:07:05,599
Nonthaburi? That’s close.

63
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,520
But how can I find her? There’s no information at all.

64
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,564
Also, I found out that

65
00:07:15,564 --> 00:07:19,206
the person you wanted me to look into is Mookmanee’s grandmother.

66
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:20,759
She’s one of the patients here.

67
00:07:24,295 --> 00:07:27,051
What a nice son.

68
00:07:27,935 --> 00:07:30,551
He brings whoever he wants into our private space.

69
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,454
Does everything but nothing I’ve asked.

70
00:07:35,161 --> 00:07:37,160
What should I do with him?

71
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,285
It's my fault.

72
00:07:52,285 --> 00:07:55,355
I didn't keep the contract well.

73
00:07:55,355 --> 00:07:58,787
After all, you can do anything for money. Are you coming to work with me?

74
00:07:58,787 --> 00:08:00,617
He even created a story

75
00:08:00,617 --> 00:08:03,309
because he didn't want to marry me.He really don't respect me.

76
00:08:03,309 --> 00:08:05,355
Nita, Why do you come here?

77
00:08:05,355 --> 00:08:09,918
I hope we will get married soon Songprod

78
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:18,813
P'Peem... suppose I feel good about love again. Will it be the same?
