1
00:00:27,496 --> 00:00:29,048
Yes, P'Prod?

2
00:00:29,694 --> 00:00:31,704
I've taken care of the triage.

3
00:00:32,673 --> 00:00:36,196
This room is my family's. Others can’t come in,

4
00:00:36,752 --> 00:00:39,047
but my mum might find out.

5
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,586
You need to prepare to deal with her.

6
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:44,580
But don't worry too much

7
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,011
—you're my girlfriend.

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,490
Your grandma is like my grandma.

9
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,136
Even if I take her in, it's nothing wrong.

10
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:56,398
Thank you, P'Prod.

11
00:01:03,254 --> 00:01:06,122
I have to go to the office—it's an emergency call.

12
00:01:06,696 --> 00:01:11,085
Right now, your anti-fans are sabotaging the whole company.

13
00:01:13,723 --> 00:01:16,842
Mook, I'm grounding you for a couple of days.

14
00:01:18,296 --> 00:01:19,357
You're not allowed to go anywhere

15
00:01:19,357 --> 00:01:21,108
—not even to visit your grandma.

16
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,709
P'Peem...

17
00:01:22,942 --> 00:01:24,686
You don't need to worry about Grandma.

18
00:01:24,686 --> 00:01:27,282
She's being taken care of 24/7.

19
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:32,300
Give me your phone.

20
00:01:34,508 --> 00:01:35,751
Give it.

21
00:01:40,328 --> 00:01:42,899
Mook! Give it.

22
00:01:49,468 --> 00:01:50,675
Use this one instead.

23
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:54,467
I've changed the sim and saved the important numbers.

24
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:56,905
Only use it to call or accept calls.

25
00:01:59,471 --> 00:02:00,728
P'Peem...

26
00:02:01,356 --> 00:02:03,788
Like just no internet wasn’t enough

27
00:02:03,788 --> 00:02:06,857
—gotta take away all Wi-Fi and ban you from social media.

28
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:10,720
P'Peem, this is like torturing.

29
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,709
You want me to only play Snakes & Ladders?

30
00:02:13,588 --> 00:02:15,026
Take it.

31
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,122
Can you stay alone?

32
00:02:22,647 --> 00:02:25,199
Where is Prangdao? Why isn't she back?

33
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,780
There—she's back.

34
00:03:05,797 --> 00:03:07,450
Have you calmed down?

35
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,861
About you? Or Nita?

36
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:22,501
So, you're not mad at me?

37
00:03:31,716 --> 00:03:34,215
Oh, isn’t this from my favourite bakery?

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,979
Did you buy it to make me happy?

39
00:03:41,035 --> 00:03:43,717
What else do you know about me?

40
00:03:47,055 --> 00:03:47,980
Wait—

41
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:52,791
that day at Hera Club, did you follow me?

42
00:03:54,406 --> 00:03:55,352
Nope.

43
00:03:56,644 --> 00:03:58,525
I just wanted to go out.

44
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:02,671
I saw you like to go to that place, so I went too.

45
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:07,132
Didn't think I'd meet you like that...

46
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,600
Well, you saw me kissing another girl.

47
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:29,332
Can you let go?

48
00:04:29,332 --> 00:04:30,530
Ouch!

49
00:04:33,868 --> 00:04:35,466
Are you hurt?

50
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:55,802
Why are you looking at my lips?

51
00:04:56,322 --> 00:04:58,059
Do you want to kiss me?

52
00:04:59,226 --> 00:05:02,105
Is that all you can think of?

53
00:05:04,618 --> 00:05:06,310
Prang, was that intentional?

54
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:09,060
No...

55
00:05:30,974 --> 00:05:35,409
You're a pro at this. Did you usually wash other people’s hair?

56
00:05:38,191 --> 00:05:39,491
No.

57
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,171
After Mum's death, you're the second.

58
00:05:52,381 --> 00:05:54,211
You never celebrate your birthday?

59
00:05:55,414 --> 00:05:58,291
Or is it because your mum isn’t around

60
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:00,795
—that’s why you never celebrate?

61
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,917
Because Mum didn’t love me.

62
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,972
She wasn’t a good person—

63
00:06:22,313 --> 00:06:24,286
that’s what everyone says.

64
00:06:27,265 --> 00:06:29,430
But she did love Dad a lot.

65
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,623
After Dad’s death,

66
00:06:34,202 --> 00:06:36,068
she was heartbroken,

67
00:06:37,306 --> 00:06:39,260
then she followed him.

68
00:06:41,145 --> 00:06:44,805
So, I decided to go and study in the UK

69
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:48,630
and stayed there until now.

70
00:06:53,727 --> 00:06:58,284
It's not just you who lacks love

71
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:04,501
—I lack it too.

72
00:07:08,503 --> 00:07:09,513
That day,

73
00:07:11,218 --> 00:07:12,461
I’m sorry—

74
00:07:14,095 --> 00:07:15,764
I didn’t mean it.

75
00:07:19,748 --> 00:07:21,521
Never mind

76
00:07:42,993 --> 00:07:44,656
Why did you stop?

77
00:07:47,815 --> 00:07:50,698
Well, who asked you to make such sounds?

78
00:07:51,901 --> 00:07:54,025
What sound?

79
00:07:56,304 --> 00:07:57,558
Oh...

80
00:07:59,317 --> 00:08:02,043
You made that sound all night, and I didn’t say anything.

81
00:08:02,043 --> 00:08:03,699
P'Mook!

82
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,644
Can we stay like this?

83
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:21,112
I’m very tired.

84
00:08:42,357 --> 00:08:43,541
P'Mook.

85
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:45,449
I'm gonna take a shower.

86
00:08:45,449 --> 00:08:46,762
I'm gonna take shower too!

87
00:08:46,762 --> 00:08:48,327
We take a shower together,

88
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,131
Let me give you bath.

89
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,584
Now someone has sent a threatening letter to you at the company.

90
00:08:59,584 --> 00:09:01,520
They are going crazy!

91
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,549
Shit!!!

92
00:09:03,123 --> 00:09:04,644
I Want to talk to you.

93
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:07,719
Why don't you open up and talk to Grace? The story will end.

94
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:10,181
P'Mook.Would you please come back o me?

95
00:09:10,181 --> 00:09:12,569
I agree to be another woman.
