1
00:00:46,961 --> 00:00:49,877
Why didn’t you tell me you were coming?

2
00:00:49,877 --> 00:00:53,281
Today, I just want a quiet drink. Okay?

3
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:54,237
Okay

4
00:01:13,858 --> 00:01:15,754
I’m grabbing a drink at Hera Club.

5
00:01:15,754 --> 00:01:17,894
Promised—no trouble, no girls.

6
00:01:17,894 --> 00:01:20,197
Calling a car back in 2 hours.

7
00:01:20,197 --> 00:01:21,947
Please let Songprod know.

8
00:01:58,926 --> 00:02:00,828
You were at the hospital for a couple of hours.

9
00:02:01,798 --> 00:02:03,182
What were you doing there?

10
00:02:03,843 --> 00:02:08,221
Maybe your weakness isn’t so hard to find after all.

11
00:02:09,632 --> 00:02:11,759
[Natty] Nita, guess who I found?

12
00:02:13,324 --> 00:02:14,409
[Natty] Send pics.

13
00:02:32,877 --> 00:02:33,377
What the hell?!

14
00:02:33,377 --> 00:02:34,054
Ouch!

15
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,264
Mook, don’t! Come with me!

16
00:02:59,377 --> 00:03:00,759
What are you shooting?

17
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:11,467
Stay out of my business Grace!

18
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,697
Where are you going?

19
00:03:16,218 --> 00:03:17,677
I need to know who that is.

20
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:20,388
Mook, I already know everything.

21
00:03:20,961 --> 00:03:22,113
All the things my mom has done.

22
00:03:22,928 --> 00:03:24,266
Why didn’t you just tell me?

23
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,477
Why didn’t you pick up my calls? I only wanted to talk to you.

24
00:03:29,813 --> 00:03:31,394
It’s been two years, Grace.

25
00:03:31,857 --> 00:03:32,778
So what if I know?

26
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:35,198
It doesn’t change anything—I’ve changed.

27
00:03:36,476 --> 00:03:37,865
You really like Guy?

28
00:03:39,606 --> 00:03:40,708
I don’t believe it.

29
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,170
Then that’s your problem, not mine."

30
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:45,848
That’s enough, Grace.

31
00:03:46,906 --> 00:03:47,936
Say no more.

32
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,292
You’re being too harsh on her, Mook.

33
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:56,832
If you care so much, why don’t you take care of her yourself?

34
00:03:56,832 --> 00:03:58,199
Don’t come to me with this

35
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:03,020
Ouch!

36
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:07,962
Prangdao!

37
00:04:09,306 --> 00:04:10,060
You’re coming with me!

38
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,249
You—

39
00:04:20,717 --> 00:04:23,002
where are you taking me?

40
00:04:23,994 --> 00:04:24,800
Let me go first!

41
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,428
I said, where are you taking me?

42
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,432
To the car.

43
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:30,479
Can you please calm down.

44
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,226
Why do you always get so heated?

45
00:04:32,975 --> 00:04:34,303
Your clip has gone viral. It’s all over the internet.

46
00:04:34,876 --> 00:04:35,617
And?

47
00:04:36,454 --> 00:04:38,527
I just want you to calm down, that’s all.

48
00:04:47,056 --> 00:04:48,340
Kiss me.

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,241
If you kiss me, I’ll calm down for you.

50
00:05:14,512 --> 00:05:16,153
Last time I remember, you slapped me.

51
00:05:18,687 --> 00:05:20,651
I’ve kissed you now. Can we leave now?

52
00:05:29,004 --> 00:05:29,795
Get in.

53
00:05:43,127 --> 00:05:45,317
Your car is cozy. I like it.

54
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,762
But what you just did—I wouldn’t exactly call that a kiss.

55
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,036
Now, let’s talk.

56
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,619
How did you know I was here?

57
00:06:25,081 --> 00:06:26,702
Okay, I’ll get there quickly.

58
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:29,495
What is it?

59
00:06:31,087 --> 00:06:32,511
There’s nothing yet,

60
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:35,488
but Peem's worried.

61
00:06:37,361 --> 00:06:41,336
Mook snuck out to Hera Club. He's scared she’ll get herself into more trouble.

62
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,257
Do you want me to go?

63
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,127
That club only allows women, so I’ll get in easier.

64
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,255
So... did you follow me?

65
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,826
You should move in with us. That way, you won’t have to come and go

66
00:07:04,826 --> 00:07:06,958
—and you won’t miss out on any important events.

67
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,528
Bringing your bag like this...

68
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,386
were you planning to trade your brother’s position to mess with me?

69
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,428
Are you thinking about being unfaithful to your sister-in-law?

70
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:20,807
Are you really my sister-in-law?

71
00:07:23,981 --> 00:07:26,996
Don’t you see me as your sister-in-law?

72
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,139
Think whatever you want.

73
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,740
I only came here because Songprod asked me to.

74
00:07:33,313 --> 00:07:34,417
I wasn’t following you.

75
00:07:35,343 --> 00:07:39,976
And by the way, he said to make sure you don’t get into trouble.

76
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:43,717
Too late.

77
00:07:47,265 --> 00:07:48,922
Get out—I’ll drive.

78
00:08:24,994 --> 00:08:25,494
Peem,

79
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,740
Oh no, I’m in deep trouble.

80
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:49,706
Songproddddddd

81
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,214
You don’t need to act. They all know now.

82
00:08:57,941 --> 00:08:59,215
What?!

83
00:08:59,502 --> 00:09:00,633
Yes,

84
00:09:01,955 --> 00:09:02,748
Aunty Den?!

85
00:09:02,748 --> 00:09:04,664
We all know.

86
00:09:06,074 --> 00:09:08,659
You knew? Since when?

87
00:09:09,518 --> 00:09:11,663
Since before the sun even set.

88
00:09:11,663 --> 00:09:14,644
You two are playing around like children.

89
00:09:14,644 --> 00:09:16,717
Enough of this nonsense.

90
00:09:21,676 --> 00:09:23,267
Tomorrow, I’m going to talk to Sorn

91
00:09:23,818 --> 00:09:24,860
about canceling the wedding.

92
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,862
This has to end immediately.

93
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,536
We need to talk!

94
00:09:49,536 --> 00:09:52,520
From now on, I’m not letting you go anywhere alone.

95
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,214
You urged even harder. I want more

96
00:09:55,214 --> 00:09:57,285
The wedding will never be cancelled.

97
00:09:57,285 --> 00:09:59,739
What other plans does Mom have?

98
00:09:59,739 --> 00:10:02,156
Are you really being unfaithful to me?
