1
00:00:39,543 --> 00:00:41,006
I'm going out to work, Prangdao

2
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:21,162
What are you doing?

3
00:01:21,162 --> 00:01:24,172
Playing. Come play!

4
00:01:24,172 --> 00:01:26,506
Grandma, your grandchild has come. Today,

5
00:01:26,506 --> 00:01:29,592
I have only prepared one apple.

6
00:01:29,592 --> 00:01:31,180
Seems like it's not enough for everyone;

7
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,583
I might need to buy more.

8
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:34,636
Okay.

9
00:01:40,338 --> 00:01:41,381
What do you want?

10
00:01:41,381 --> 00:01:44,525
You know what I want.

11
00:01:44,525 --> 00:01:52,440
Today, I just want to show you that I can do anything.Like I said,

12
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:58,593
maybe next time I might buy poisoned fruit for your grandma.

13
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:12,120
You already know me a little.Nita

14
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:16,894
Wait for me a bit, Grandma. I'll be back.

15
00:02:16,894 --> 00:02:18,860
Okay.

16
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,189
Where are you, Nut? I'm here.

17
00:02:41,321 --> 00:02:44,238
Nita! Nita!

18
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,738
You can mess with me but NOT my grandma!

19
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,886
A warning this time—

20
00:02:55,886 --> 00:02:59,988
next time, you'll know how I can do ANYTHING for my grandma.

21
00:03:00,531 --> 00:03:02,754
REMEMBER that!

22
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,034
Are you okay?

23
00:03:36,034 --> 00:03:37,843
I'm good.

24
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:40,271
Is your hand okay?

25
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,643
Nah, just a little injured.

26
00:03:42,643 --> 00:03:45,500
The bad one is the girl; I hit her that hard.

27
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,378
The clip should be viral by now.

28
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,108
How did it come to this?

29
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:58,326
P'Peem, I need to do something.

30
00:04:13,683 --> 00:04:17,469
[Nita! What are you doing?! All you do is keep fighting with each other!

31
00:04:17,469 --> 00:04:19,582
My business is going down.

32
00:04:19,582 --> 00:04:22,579
I released the scandal so that you can quickly marry Songprod.

33
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:25,056
You are ruining everything!

34
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,257
See, Nut.

35
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,129
Even though I was injured this badly,

36
00:04:38,577 --> 00:04:44,710
Mum still didn’t ask me once whether I was hurt

37
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:48,342
—whether I was okay.

38
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:02,568
Mookmanee, this revenge must be returned!

39
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:14,160
Open this.

40
00:05:23,392 --> 00:05:27,879
For me, your mum is not a good person

41
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:30,487
—that’s the truth.

42
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:33,452
But it has nothing to do with you.

43
00:05:35,172 --> 00:05:39,216
This box... Duddao gave it to me before she passed.

44
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:45,932
She told me to open it and do whatever with it.

45
00:05:52,177 --> 00:05:55,132
I only opened it not long ago.

46
00:05:56,218 --> 00:06:01,677
I couldn’t throw it away but also couldn’t keep it.

47
00:06:02,944 --> 00:06:06,857
Your mum was mean to me until her last day.

48
00:06:13,192 --> 00:06:15,490
Whatever it is, I give this box to you.

49
00:06:16,938 --> 00:06:20,055
It should mean something to you.

50
00:06:21,232 --> 00:06:25,777
Take it as a birthday gift from me.

51
00:06:32,565 --> 00:06:35,906
That’s all I called you in for today.

52
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,234
Happy Birthday, Prangdao.

53
00:07:25,053 --> 00:07:28,238
This hairpin—I give it to you. It was specially customised.

54
00:07:28,238 --> 00:07:30,859
You and I take one each.

55
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,752
[I was the one who accused your nanny of stealing.

56
00:07:55,752 --> 00:08:01,701
I asked Dumrongdech to fire her and told you she quit herself.

57
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:06,045
I told P'Phin that if she dared to tell you,

58
00:08:06,045 --> 00:08:08,434
I'd have the police arrest her and throw her in jail.

59
00:08:08,434 --> 00:08:12,596
All that I did—you deserved it, Prapatsorn.

60
00:08:12,596 --> 00:08:18,254
You stole my man. I hate you. You deserved it.]

61
00:08:24,286 --> 00:08:27,072
You are cold-hearted, Duddao.

62
00:08:34,946 --> 00:08:40,746
P'Phin, how are you?

63
00:08:42,285 --> 00:08:44,049
Are you doing well?

64
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,250
I want to meet you.

65
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,370
Gosh! Everyone, such big news!

66
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,303
laughs Sorry, a bit excited, so the accent comes back.

67
00:08:59,303 --> 00:09:02,099
This news—such big news!

68
00:09:02,099 --> 00:09:06,491
She slapped—and slap, slap, slap right in front of the hospital.

69
00:09:06,491 --> 00:09:08,658
OMG! Even the hospital!

70
00:09:08,658 --> 00:09:12,936
Such a powerful slap—is she a volleyball player?

71
00:09:12,936 --> 00:09:15,705
Slaps harder than the devil itself!

72
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:18,887
Look at the comments—

73
00:09:18,887 --> 00:09:24,250
'Mookmanee is too vicious, too devilish!

74
00:09:25,602 --> 00:09:28,231
'So, you're not mad at me?

75
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,560
—that day at Hera Club, did you follow me?
