1
00:01:50,356 --> 00:01:54,120
You two got married to keep secrets from each other, right?

2
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,988
Go looking for someone to investigate Mookmanee background.

3
00:01:56,988 --> 00:01:59,120
My fame won't last long.

4
00:02:00,311 --> 00:02:03,313
But Grandma will have to stay with me for a long time.

5
00:02:03,486 --> 00:02:05,360
For Grandma, I can do anything.

6
00:02:11,885 --> 00:02:13,031
What is it this time?

7
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:14,607
We need to talk!

8
00:02:21,687 --> 00:02:22,738
Did you teased me?

9
00:02:23,507 --> 00:02:25,352
Well, you lied to me first.

10
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,247
You already know the truth,

11
00:02:28,867 --> 00:02:30,374
so why are you still here?

12
00:02:32,954 --> 00:02:33,990
Or... could it be

13
00:02:35,181 --> 00:02:36,302
you want to be close to me?

14
00:02:40,122 --> 00:02:42,740
Step-Mother asked me to keep an eye on you and Songprod.

15
00:02:42,938 --> 00:02:45,203
I have to stay here so she doesn’t suspect anything.

16
00:02:45,649 --> 00:02:49,109
But can you take a step back? Why do you always act like this?

17
00:02:50,176 --> 00:02:51,828
Because I like talking like this.

18
00:02:53,787 --> 00:02:56,465
Why? Don’t you like it? Didn’t you like me?

19
00:03:01,524 --> 00:03:03,206
We did kiss just a moment ago.

20
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:10,900
I kissed you because we made a deal.

21
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,158
I drew you because I liked your looks,

22
00:03:16,621 --> 00:03:17,938
not your personality.

23
00:03:19,054 --> 00:03:21,040
If I had known what you were really like,

24
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:23,212
I never would have drawn you in the first place.

25
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:26,567
Who doesn’t know about my personality?

26
00:03:27,187 --> 00:03:28,861
My scandals are all over the internet—

27
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,033
you should have known.

28
00:03:32,075 --> 00:03:36,385
Wait… or maybe you did know but just didn’t want to admit it?

29
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,247
Your lips weren’t hard

30
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,235
when we kissed; they were soft.

31
00:03:47,492 --> 00:03:49,552
But why do you always say things you don’t really mean?

32
00:03:52,702 --> 00:03:53,952
I’m done talking to you!

33
00:04:00,995 --> 00:04:02,182
What are you teasing Prangdao?

34
00:04:05,382 --> 00:04:06,332
Nothing

35
00:04:08,763 --> 00:04:11,708
I saw the clip—the one from Hera Club.

36
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:13,490
Get in. We need to talk.

37
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:23,732
You didn’t get hurt, did you?

38
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,454
I’m fine, just a little wet.

39
00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:28,395
Were they anti-fans?

40
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,131
I don’t know. I got out first—

41
00:04:32,453 --> 00:04:33,899
I didn’t have a chance to ask.

42
00:04:35,635 --> 00:04:36,977
Good thing you got out safely.

43
00:04:38,118 --> 00:04:41,018
Everything else can be dealt with later.

44
00:04:42,605 --> 00:04:45,275
From now on, I’m not letting you go anywhere alone.

45
00:04:45,523 --> 00:04:46,472
You always seem to find trouble.

46
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:51,174
You should be more careful, do you understand?

47
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:55,781
Alright, that’s all for now. I’ll be leaving.

48
00:04:56,823 --> 00:04:59,353
Take a shower then sleep.

49
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,976
If anything comes up, we’ll handle it tomorrow.

50
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:04,317
Ok, Peem.

51
00:05:37,196 --> 00:05:38,749
[our lips weren’t hard

52
00:05:39,543 --> 00:05:41,135
when we kissed; they were soft.

53
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:45,339
But why do you always say things you don’t really mean?]

54
00:06:54,761 --> 00:06:56,161
Your mum is calling, Prangdao.

55
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,779
Yes, Stepmom?

56
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:15,140
[How was last night? Anything unusual?]

57
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:24,802
No, nothing

58
00:07:26,563 --> 00:07:29,595
Just like I told you—keep your eyes on them.

59
00:07:29,868 --> 00:07:34,154
If anything happens, call me immediately.

60
00:07:36,386 --> 00:07:38,025
Yes, Madam.

61
00:07:52,436 --> 00:07:54,848
I can trust you, right, Prangdao?

62
00:08:07,051 --> 00:08:10,543
Sorn, seriously? Did you really go so far as to dig into the past

63
00:08:13,395 --> 00:08:16,254
and send Prangdao to spy on them?

64
00:08:17,023 --> 00:08:18,232
I’ve already warned you

65
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:19,765
not to force your kids!

66
00:08:23,634 --> 00:08:24,924
What else should I do?

67
00:08:24,924 --> 00:08:27,722
Do you realize the employees are gossiping

68
00:08:27,722 --> 00:08:30,000
about Songprod being gay?

69
00:08:32,046 --> 00:08:34,597
And that’s why you’re forcing this wedding?

70
00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:39,307
How can you care more about a scandal than your own son’s feelings?

71
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:41,607
They’re going to marry eventually,

72
00:08:41,607 --> 00:08:42,847
aren’t they?

73
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:45,277
Songprod and Nita are engaged—

74
00:08:46,021 --> 00:08:48,135
what’s the difference if it’s today or tomorrow?

75
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:52,331
But Songprod doesn’t want to get married!

76
00:08:53,943 --> 00:08:55,602
You should understand him better.

77
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,823
You should know what he wants!

78
00:09:00,187 --> 00:09:02,866
Feelings can’t be forced—you, should know that!

79
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,531
Just like what you did to me?

80
00:09:06,531 --> 00:09:11,115
Turning me down and sending your brother to marry me instead?

81
00:09:12,975 --> 00:09:14,519
How can you even bring that up?

82
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:20,210
That was a long time ago! Stop making it a big deal.

83
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:25,000
The only reason I’m saying this is because Dumrongdeach said

84
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,455
before he passed

85
00:09:26,455 --> 00:09:29,009
that if something goes against your feelings,

86
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:30,471
you shouldn’t force it.

87
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,163
Songprod is my son.

88
00:09:35,163 --> 00:09:37,809
He was born into a business family—

89
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:41,228
don’t talk to me about feelings!

90
00:09:41,228 --> 00:09:44,192
I’ve already decided.

91
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,079
Nothing will change now.

92
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:49,699
Say no more, Denkun.

93
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,983
This scandal has already gone too far.

94
00:09:54,752 --> 00:09:56,456
Look at what your decision has done to your son.

95
00:09:56,456 --> 00:10:00,474
That’s why I want them divorced as soon as possible.

96
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:04,329
But the wedding will not be canceled!

97
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,277
You’re impossible, Sorn! I Don't want to talk to you anymore

98
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:31,566
Sorn! I

99
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,617
So stubborn.

100
00:10:39,576 --> 00:10:40,772
Please, here’s the inhaler.

101
00:10:41,094 --> 00:10:43,987
You know me too well. Thanks.

102
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,845
[Denkun, my bloodwork came back positive.

103
00:11:03,845 --> 00:11:05,322
Please go get yours tested. I love you.]

104
00:11:06,215 --> 00:11:07,081
What?!

105
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:11,360
Are you okay, Denkun?

106
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,256
Here, inhale this.

107
00:11:15,813 --> 00:11:18,182
This time an inhaler won’t help…

108
00:11:20,141 --> 00:11:22,553
Are you okay? Denkun.

109
00:11:30,862 --> 00:11:35,042
Songprod! Songprod, help me!

110
00:11:48,988 --> 00:11:50,649
[Tomorrow, you need to go to Singapore

111
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:55,084
and take my place in the meeting.]

112
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,870
What are you up to this time, Mum?

113
00:12:01,574 --> 00:12:05,916
Songprod, help me.

114
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,405
What’s wrong? Denkun…

115
00:12:20,514 --> 00:12:24,032
You need to take me to Sesh Clinic—fast!

116
00:12:24,032 --> 00:12:26,582
Schedule an appointment with Dr. Nan ASAP!

117
00:12:26,582 --> 00:12:28,184
Denkun, please calm down.

118
00:12:28,184 --> 00:12:32,180
I’ll take you. Rest assured,

119
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,597
there’s nothing to worry about. Trust me.

120
00:12:35,597 --> 00:12:36,834
You’re sure?

121
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:37,415
Yes, I’m sure.

122
00:12:50,386 --> 00:12:52,146
Hello, Nitta.

123
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,424
Songprod is leaving.

124
00:12:54,424 --> 00:12:56,411
Do you want me to follow him?

125
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,058
No, no need.

126
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:01,999
Madam Prapatsorn just told me

127
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:04,747
he’ll be traveling internationally for a meeting over the next three days.

128
00:13:04,747 --> 00:13:07,486
Should I follow him

129
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:11,209
or stay back and deal with Mookmanee?

130
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:13,772
She hurt my sister.

131
00:13:14,318 --> 00:13:17,391
By the way, did you find out why she was at the hospital?

132
00:13:18,284 --> 00:13:20,847
Not yet.

133
00:13:20,847 --> 00:13:23,864
But if there’s any update, I’ll call you immediately.

134
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,427
Okay?

135
00:13:26,146 --> 00:13:27,644
Bye.

136
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,706
You!! Again!!

137
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:40,350
You are the one come closer to me

138
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,520
Someone said

139
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,499
intending to get pregnant in order to catch a man.

140
00:13:43,995 --> 00:13:46,702
Don't look at the camera, look at me!!

141
00:13:46,851 --> 00:13:49,434
You and me have to talk!
