1
00:00:22,195 --> 00:00:23,953
I order you to divorce her!

2
00:00:23,953 --> 00:00:26,341
And you must divorce her now!

3
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:27,828
No, I won’t!

4
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,662
Mookmanee and I love each other.

5
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:33,068
We didn’t do anything wrong!

6
00:00:33,297 --> 00:00:33,922
You’re wrong!

7
00:00:35,482 --> 00:00:37,186
You didn’t just find out that you have a fiancée—

8
00:00:37,395 --> 00:00:38,482
you’ve known it for a long time!

9
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:41,453
You are not allowed to love anyone!

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,218
And you’re definitely not allowed to do this!

11
00:00:43,618 --> 00:00:45,245
The wedding is scheduled for next month.

12
00:00:45,607 --> 00:00:46,742
Everything has already been set.

13
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,471
You’re not thinking of me at all by doing this!

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,916
Lady Prapatsorn?!

15
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,375
Songprod’s mother? She’s come?!

16
00:00:55,163 --> 00:00:55,663
Let's go

17
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,960
Not thinking of coming home anymore, right?!

18
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:16,092
This house was given to me by grandmother.

19
00:01:17,081 --> 00:01:18,544
It’s the same as my own house.

20
00:01:19,724 --> 00:01:21,205
I want to stay here..

21
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:23,962
with Mookmanee.

22
00:01:31,868 --> 00:01:33,638
Well, I don’t want to be those bullying younger children,

23
00:01:34,685 --> 00:01:37,865
but I want you two to divorce.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,736
Mother!

25
00:01:40,783 --> 00:01:42,061
You have no right to speak!

26
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:44,983
You must listen to me!

27
00:01:45,953 --> 00:01:48,129
The wedding will never be cancelled!

28
00:01:49,214 --> 00:01:50,594
I will not marry!

29
00:01:52,192 --> 00:01:54,492
The only one I will marry is Mookmanee!

30
00:01:54,492 --> 00:01:55,235
Songprod!

31
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,020
You are my only heir.

32
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,741
Remember that!

33
00:02:17,892 --> 00:02:19,325
I need to talk to you about something.

34
00:02:32,435 --> 00:02:33,637
Songprod,

35
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:35,428
I have a question.

36
00:02:36,684 --> 00:02:38,366
When did you start dating Mookmanee?

37
00:02:40,649 --> 00:02:41,850
It’s been a while.

38
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,646
Why do you ask?

39
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:48,634
I just want to know...

40
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:51,762
How well do you know her?

41
00:02:52,618 --> 00:02:54,570
Why did you sign the marriage certificate with her?

42
00:02:56,473 --> 00:02:57,685
What do you mean?

43
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,777
What’s this about?

44
00:03:04,438 --> 00:03:05,989
I just wanted to warn you about Mook.

45
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:10,644
A few days ago, I saw her at...

46
00:03:14,392 --> 00:03:15,405
Hera Club.

47
00:03:22,046 --> 00:03:23,573
I saw her hugging and kissing with a women

48
00:03:23,573 --> 00:03:24,236
That's enough Prang

49
00:03:24,236 --> 00:03:27,155
But I really saw it, Mook knows I saw her too!

50
00:03:27,155 --> 00:03:28,496
There’s nothing to talk about, Prang.

51
00:03:28,496 --> 00:03:30,255
I don’t want to hear it.

52
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,612
What do you mean?

53
00:03:33,735 --> 00:03:37,215
You know about this, and you still want to date her?

54
00:03:39,403 --> 00:03:40,108
Enough, Prang.

55
00:03:42,886 --> 00:03:44,503
I need to ask you something.

56
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,339
Can you stop getting in my way—like Mum does?

57
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:56,896
In this family, you’re the one who understands me the most.

58
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,788
Everything I do,

59
00:04:05,082 --> 00:04:06,063
I have my reasons.

60
00:04:07,776 --> 00:04:10,228
Even if, in the end,

61
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,637
I get hurt by her...

62
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,814
I'm not gonna blame anyone.

63
00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:20,007
I’ll only blame myself.

64
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,127
Fine. It’s up to you then.

65
00:04:47,101 --> 00:04:48,381
Come talk to me.

66
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:49,587
I need to talk to you about something.

67
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:56,893
Mook, don't

68
00:05:08,251 --> 00:05:09,261
What are you doing?!

69
00:05:10,213 --> 00:05:12,448
Oh... I just remembered.

70
00:05:13,056 --> 00:05:14,615
That day, when I saw you at Hera Club...

71
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,435
what were you doing there?

72
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:21,040
Or... is it possible that we’re the same?

73
00:05:22,215 --> 00:05:23,790
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

74
00:05:24,361 --> 00:05:26,675
What I want to talk about is my brother, Songprod.

75
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:29,238
Honestly,

76
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:33,108
I don’t want you messing around with him.

77
00:05:34,744 --> 00:05:35,985
You don’t love him.

78
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:38,558
You don’t even like Guy!

79
00:05:41,469 --> 00:05:42,396
Oh, is that so?

80
00:05:43,328 --> 00:05:45,065
You couldn’t convince your brother,

81
00:05:45,065 --> 00:05:46,594
so you came to me instead?

82
00:05:49,448 --> 00:05:50,998
Let me make something clear—

83
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,158
sometimes love and what I need in life are two different things.

84
00:05:58,357 --> 00:05:59,851
Love or not, it’s too late.

85
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,104
I’m already your brother’s lawful wife. Do you understand?

86
00:06:04,104 --> 00:06:05,414
No I don't

87
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,779
Fine. Then let’s make a deal.

88
00:06:11,464 --> 00:06:13,376
If you want me to stop ‘messing around’ with your brother...

89
00:06:13,636 --> 00:06:14,897
you’ll have to trade with me.

90
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:19,047
What do you want?

91
00:06:20,322 --> 00:06:21,113
You

92
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,607
We already kissed, didn’t we?

93
00:06:24,797 --> 00:06:27,321
It’s such a shame your brother doesn’t know...

94
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:29,997
or should I tell him?

95
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,859
Tell him that you kissed his wife—your sister-in-law.

96
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:34,774
YOU!

97
00:06:35,554 --> 00:06:37,554
I don’t want to talk to you anymore.

98
00:06:39,818 --> 00:06:41,907
You’ll never win, Prangdao!
