1
00:00:23,912 --> 00:00:25,476
Did you really take that much interest in me?

2
00:00:35,658 --> 00:00:36,970
Are you trying to kiss me on the cheek?

3
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,159
You were the one who came close to me!

4
00:00:41,211 --> 00:00:42,204
What are you doing here?

5
00:00:43,388 --> 00:00:44,587
It’s none of your business.

6
00:00:51,904 --> 00:00:53,580
What are you doing? Let go!

7
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,704
Shhhh! Be quiet!

8
00:00:56,993 --> 00:00:58,960
Then let go of me! Let me go!

9
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,981
Hello, Nita. What is it?

10
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:14,402
Oh, is it? Ok, ok. I’ll get it done.

11
00:01:20,874 --> 00:01:22,088
If you don’t want to be in a scandal with me,

12
00:01:22,088 --> 00:01:23,633
then keep your voice down.

13
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,280
What the hell are you doing?!

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,114
Why did you slap me?!

15
00:01:46,114 --> 00:01:47,257
Why did you kiss me?!

16
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:50,138
I was just closing your mouth!

17
00:01:51,243 --> 00:01:52,570
Aren’t you my fan club?

18
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,383
Shouldn’t you know what kind of person I am?

19
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,521
I saw all my pictures on your phone.

20
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,159
Now answer me. What are you doing here?

21
00:02:06,296 --> 00:02:07,329
Are you a stalker?

22
00:02:08,787 --> 00:02:10,951
Or are you trying to blackmail me about the kiss scene that night?

23
00:02:12,857 --> 00:02:13,687
I’m not!

24
00:02:14,072 --> 00:02:16,231
I came to pick up my BROTHER

25
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,702
—Songprod. The one you just did an interview with!

26
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,670
See you at home, Songprod.

27
00:03:02,034 --> 00:03:06,395
There, they actually following us…

28
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,676
All done Nita,

29
00:03:19,255 --> 00:03:21,924
But it seems like she doesn’t feel anything.

30
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,366
It’s okay. It’ll process over time.

31
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:27,286
You need to keep following them, Nut.

32
00:03:27,286 --> 00:03:28,738
You must help me.

33
00:03:28,738 --> 00:03:31,619
She has lots of anti-fans.

34
00:03:31,619 --> 00:03:34,317
Use them to get her.

35
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,388
You think I’ll give up that easily?

36
00:03:52,388 --> 00:03:54,221
NEVER!

37
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:17,178
What are you thinking, Mook?

38
00:04:17,178 --> 00:04:19,094
I saw you thinking about it all the way here.

39
00:04:25,488 --> 00:04:26,831
Whose car is that?

40
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,478
Do you have guests today?

41
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,568
Peem, I have something I need to tell you.

42
00:04:43,566 --> 00:04:44,375
What?!

43
00:04:46,822 --> 00:04:48,809
Songprod’s sister saw you?!

44
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:52,765
I’m going crazy!

45
00:04:54,344 --> 00:04:55,958
What were you thinking? I want to die!

46
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,042
I’m going crazy too!

47
00:04:57,042 --> 00:04:59,870
Since when did Songprod have a sister? Why didn’t we know?!

48
00:05:00,896 --> 00:05:03,558
Songprod has a sister, but she’s not in Thailand!

49
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,033
Mook, why did you ask for it?

50
00:05:08,033 --> 00:05:09,905
Why create an enemy inside the house?

51
00:05:09,905 --> 00:05:11,306
I didn’t know...

52
00:05:12,806 --> 00:05:14,111
My head is about to explode.

53
00:05:17,663 --> 00:05:20,000
What should we do now?
