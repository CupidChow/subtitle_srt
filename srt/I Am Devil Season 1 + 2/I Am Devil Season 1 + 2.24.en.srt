1
00:01:37,311 --> 00:01:38,599
I think you're biased against me.

2
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,654
And right now, we have the same manager.

3
00:01:40,654 --> 00:01:43,150
Shouldn't we love and help each other?

4
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,200
It seems like Praw is intentionally causing problems between you and Prang.

5
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,719
Ouch, ouch! Hey Muk!

6
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,555
So, this is all Nat's doing?

7
00:01:49,555 --> 00:01:53,533
You got what you wanted, didn't you? Make sure she has no place in this industry!

8
00:01:53,533 --> 00:01:54,790
Understood.

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,267
I wonder how she's doing.

10
00:01:57,437 --> 00:01:58,948
I want to stop by Hera Club to see Ploy.

11
00:01:58,948 --> 00:02:00,500
Are you planning to tell Prangdao?

12
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,719
I'll be back in a bit, I have an errand to run.

13
00:02:06,398 --> 00:02:08,252
Praw, you don't know anything about this, okay?

14
00:02:08,908 --> 00:02:09,621
Muk.

15
00:02:09,621 --> 00:02:10,121
Hey.

16
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:11,602
Praw.

17
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:16,686
Muk, sleep with me.

18
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,326
I wants to sleep with you.

19
00:02:19,326 --> 00:02:21,341
Praw.

20
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,080
Muk.

21
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,920
Prangdao.

22
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,242
Prangdao, wait.

23
00:02:30,752 --> 00:02:31,568
Prang.

24
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,584
Prang.

25
00:02:32,584 --> 00:02:33,887
Prang.

26
00:02:35,127 --> 00:02:35,944
Wait, Prang.

27
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,260
Okay.

28
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,302
I'll let you slap me.

29
00:02:44,302 --> 00:02:46,070
But you have to listen to me first.

30
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,040
But I don't want to talk to you anymore.

31
00:02:49,263 --> 00:02:50,649
Prang.

32
00:02:50,649 --> 00:02:51,457
Where are you going?

33
00:02:51,457 --> 00:02:52,127
Hey.

34
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,962
We need to talk.

35
00:02:54,191 --> 00:02:56,769
About something I didn't do. I won't let you misunderstand me anymore.

36
00:02:57,109 --> 00:02:58,325
Go home.

37
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:00,113
Let go,

38
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:00,892
Muk.

39
00:03:00,892 --> 00:03:02,450
Go home.

40
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:14,027
It's even better than I expected.

41
00:03:15,267 --> 00:03:16,914
At the very least,

42
00:03:17,206 --> 00:03:20,665
Your phone was useful to me, Ploy.

43
00:03:21,903 --> 00:03:25,524
It helped me a lot.

44
00:03:25,524 --> 00:03:27,981
So satisfying!

45
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:31,396
I didn't think Prangdao would follow.

46
00:03:31,396 --> 00:03:33,106
Really lucky.

47
00:03:34,394 --> 00:03:35,074
You got the pictures, right?

48
00:03:35,147 --> 00:03:38,514
Got tons! I've been snapping away from start to finish.

49
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,970
Hello, Praw.

50
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:46,880
That girl actually came here.

51
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,991
Worth all the trouble I went through.

52
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:07,007
Get ready to trend tomorrow.

53
00:04:07,007 --> 00:04:10,575
I'm dropping this news first thing in the morning.

54
00:04:10,697 --> 00:04:13,356
Hey, Praw.

55
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,939
I wanted to ask you something.

56
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:20,737
About you saying you're impersonating Ploy...

57
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:27,280
I want to know, who is Ploy?

58
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,880
My sister who passed away.

59
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,334
Prang, come down!

60
00:04:50,334 --> 00:04:53,032
Come down!

61
00:04:53,032 --> 00:04:54,177
Hey, come down!

62
00:04:54,177 --> 00:04:56,740
Come down!

63
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,064
Let go of me, Muk!

64
00:05:02,064 --> 00:05:04,784
Prang!

65
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:08,841
Hey Muk, what's going on? What's all this about?

66
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:11,562
P'Peem went to Hera Club to get Prang's car.

67
00:05:12,777 --> 00:05:13,734
Huh? What?

68
00:05:13,734 --> 00:05:15,121
Wait, Muk, calm down first.

69
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:16,770
P'Prod, right now Prang is misunderstanding Me.

70
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,672
I needs to clear things up with Prang.

71
00:05:18,672 --> 00:05:19,646
But I don't want to talk to you.

72
00:05:19,646 --> 00:05:22,556
You have to talk. I told you, you have to talk.

73
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:24,827
If we don't talk, how can we move forward?

74
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:28,246
I don't mind if other people misunderstand me...

75
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,227
But it can't be you.

76
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:32,456
P'Muk.

77
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:35,292
It's okay, let those two talk it out.

78
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:38,382
really big problem this time.

79
00:05:38,382 --> 00:05:39,722
Besides,

80
00:05:39,722 --> 00:05:43,394
Muk wouldn't do anything drastic.

81
00:05:45,838 --> 00:05:46,902
Let go.

82
00:05:46,902 --> 00:05:48,297
Muk, let go!

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,465
Muk!

84
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,520
Hey.

85
00:05:56,435 --> 00:05:59,155
Let go

86
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,231
Can you be quiet now?

87
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:07,680
If not, I'll kiss you again.

88
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,123
Prangdao, listen to me.

89
00:06:20,537 --> 00:06:23,127
You met another woman.

90
00:06:23,127 --> 00:06:24,955
You was with another woman.

91
00:06:24,955 --> 00:06:26,997
What else do you want me to hear?

92
00:06:26,997 --> 00:06:28,635
You lied to me.

93
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:30,821
I didn't make an appointment.

94
00:06:30,821 --> 00:06:32,485
I didn't lie to you.

95
00:06:32,485 --> 00:06:35,348
I saw messages from someone who believes Ploy sent them to you.

96
00:06:35,494 --> 00:06:38,376
Can you please stop lying to me?

97
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,727
This hairpin is very important to me.

98
00:06:47,067 --> 00:06:49,323
It's my grandmother's hairpin.

99
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:54,149
I want to leave it with you.

100
00:07:11,624 --> 00:07:14,072
I don't believe anything you say anymore.

101
00:07:14,194 --> 00:07:17,038
If you don't trust me,

102
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,659
we can't go on.

103
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,547
We really can't go on, Muk.

104
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,880
Don't get your hopes up.

105
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,905
Prangdao already went home with Prod.

106
00:08:13,905 --> 00:08:15,159
They just left a moment ago.

107
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,283
Do you want to follow them?

108
00:08:18,283 --> 00:08:20,283
Nah.

109
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:25,159
I'll wait for Prangdao to cool down first.

110
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:31,129
Was this a really bad fight?

111
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:33,778
Probably the worst one yet, P'Pim.

112
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,772
Prangdao saw me...

113
00:08:36,772 --> 00:08:40,070
...kissing Praw at Hera Club.

114
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,240
Hey!

115
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,004
Oh!

116
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:44,704
Sorry!

117
00:08:44,704 --> 00:08:47,683
So, you kissed Praw?

118
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:49,073
No.

119
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,429
But Praw came onto me and tried to kiss me.

120
00:08:52,429 --> 00:08:53,796
But I didn't let her.

121
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:56,325
I don't know what's wrong with Praw, P'Peem.

122
00:08:56,325 --> 00:08:58,557
Out of nowhere, she took off her shirt and then...

123
00:08:58,557 --> 00:09:00,901
Lunged at me, trying to kiss me.

124
00:09:01,362 --> 00:09:03,720
I understand that Praw was drunk.

125
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,162
But I don't understand why she would do that.

126
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,913
Does Praw like you?

127
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,951
I don't think so.

128
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:15,529
I don't think so either.

129
00:09:16,185 --> 00:09:19,025
She definitely doesn't like me.

130
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,854
Yeah, Muk.

131
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,458
Actually,

132
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,462
I was going to warn you about Praw.

133
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:29,512
I tried calling you earlier,

134
00:09:29,512 --> 00:09:32,012
but you left your phone at home.

135
00:09:33,714 --> 00:09:37,725
Do you know that Praw and that reporter, Natcha or whatever her name is,

136
00:09:37,725 --> 00:09:39,557
those two know each other?

137
00:09:39,557 --> 00:09:40,724
And they seem very close too.

138
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,079
What?

139
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:43,982
I just found out too.

140
00:09:43,982 --> 00:09:46,333
I happened to see Praw talking on the phone.

141
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,657
So I tried to follow her secretly.

142
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:51,080
Turns out, those two actually know each other.

143
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,515
And it seems like they're planning something, I don't know what.

144
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:01,562
I'm not sure if it's related to what's happening to you right now.

145
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,182
That reporter is really scary, Muk.

146
00:10:06,401 --> 00:10:09,685
They have even more information in their hands.

147
00:10:10,684 --> 00:10:12,738
And most importantly,

148
00:10:12,932 --> 00:10:15,801
Money can buy anything.

149
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,175
Even if Nita says...

150
00:10:19,175 --> 00:10:23,476
That she's stepped away, I still don't trust her.

151
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:30,200
What are you looking at, P'Peem?

152
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,760
What is it?

153
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,439
Ploy arranged to meet you?

154
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:43,472
I just saw this message.

155
00:10:43,472 --> 00:10:48,160
But Prangdao saw it before I did.

156
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,720
And then followed me to Hera Club.

157
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,491
Because she thought I was meeting Ploy.

158
00:10:57,019 --> 00:11:00,348
And when you went, did you see Ploy?

159
00:11:00,348 --> 00:11:03,066
No, I didn't.

160
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:05,780
And did you go to that VIP room or whatever?

161
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,793
Yes, I did.

162
00:11:06,793 --> 00:11:09,337
But I went because I followed someone.

163
00:11:10,213 --> 00:11:13,733
That person looked a lot like Ploy.

164
00:11:14,487 --> 00:11:17,138
But it turned out that when I got there...

165
00:11:17,964 --> 00:11:20,711
It was Praw.

166
00:11:20,978 --> 00:11:23,003
Hey!

167
00:11:23,003 --> 00:11:27,817
This is getting too weird, Muk.

168
00:11:28,758 --> 00:11:30,475
Wait a minute.

169
00:11:30,475 --> 00:11:32,322
Ploy and Praw...

170
00:11:32,322 --> 00:11:35,251
Praw and Ploy...

171
00:11:35,251 --> 00:11:38,238
Are these two sisters?

172
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,034
What do you know about Ploy?

173
00:11:42,395 --> 00:11:45,411
No... well...

174
00:11:45,411 --> 00:11:50,000
I... I just sleep with Ploy often because we meet at Hera Club.

175
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,373
But I'm not personally that close to Ploy.

176
00:11:57,175 --> 00:12:00,000
But Ploy is very good to me.

177
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,709
Like a good friend.

178
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:05,484
This is getting too weird.

179
00:12:05,484 --> 00:12:08,316
Is this just a coincidence?

180
00:12:08,316 --> 00:12:10,280
But one thing's for sure,

181
00:12:10,985 --> 00:12:12,434
Praw can't be trusted.

182
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,150
I agree.

183
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:17,430
I think,

184
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,584
Ge should play dumb for now.

185
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:23,686
If Praw and that reporter really planned this,

186
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:26,274
they only have one objective:

187
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,218
Secretly take photos for blackmail,

188
00:12:29,218 --> 00:12:30,589
To expose her publicly,

189
00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:34,480
Or create more rumors.

190
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,636
Praw probably wants to replace you.

191
00:12:37,636 --> 00:12:40,519
It all seems so deliberate.

192
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,338
I could kind of predict things with Praw.

193
00:12:45,338 --> 00:12:48,880
But with Ploy, why does everything seem so connected?

194
00:12:50,238 --> 00:12:53,399
Try calling Ploy again.

195
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,199
Call ended.
