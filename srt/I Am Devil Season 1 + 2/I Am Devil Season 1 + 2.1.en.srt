00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,600
Stop messing with Grace,You are not worthy of my daughter

2
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,280
2 years later

3
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,658
Everyone, everyone Talk of the Town is here.

00:03:06,658 --> 00:03:09,093

00:03:09,093 --> 00:03:10,506
you know. Oh, please like and share.

00:03:10,506 --> 00:03:12,306
Come and gather around quickly.

7
00:03:12,306 --> 00:03:14,033
Do you know or not?

8
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:16,422
The heroine's initials are M, M,

9
00:03:16,422 --> 00:03:19,342
a little more, M, M, N,

00:03:19,342 --> 00:03:23,020
a little more, a little more. Mook, Mook, something like this.

11
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,966
Oh, I heard the news that

12
00:03:26,966 --> 00:03:31,100
she secretly registered her marriage with a high-society young man outside the industry.

13
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,224
And what's even spicier is that this

14
00:03:33,224 --> 00:03:37,681
high-society young man already has a fiancée.

15
00:03:37,681 --> 00:03:39,546
Isn't it spicy? Oh,

16
00:03:39,546 --> 00:03:42,540
if you want to know more, please like, share, and follow me.

17
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,442
I'll come and tell you who it is.

18
00:03:44,442 --> 00:03:46,721
Now, I'll go investigate first. We'll find out.

19
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,009
Why are you taking that? Don't you want to get drunk?

20
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:55,465
Tomorrow I've work.

21
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:59,827
I might not be good at drinking but... I good at.......

22
00:05:31,534 --> 00:05:32,981
You!

23
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,812
What are you doing?

24
00:05:39,812 --> 00:05:41,016
Can I see your phone?

25
00:05:45,592 --> 00:05:46,787
I saw that you took a picture of me

26
00:05:46,787 --> 00:05:47,996
I am not!

27
00:05:48,798 --> 00:05:50,324
Then go ahead and open it!, that way I can feel more at peace.

28
00:05:51,245 --> 00:05:52,187
Now!!!

29
00:05:58,814 --> 00:06:01,177
Since you seem suspicious, then don't mine me being rude.

30
00:06:05,873 --> 00:06:07,547
See? Is there any?

31
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,560
I told you here isn't any. I didn't take a sneaky photo.

32
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,576
Who would be crazy enough

33
00:06:12,576 --> 00:06:14,090
to secretly snap a picture of people kissing?

34
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:17,196
Who would've known?

35
00:06:17,196 --> 00:06:18,682
These days, you can never tell what's going on inside.

36
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,330
Okay Mook, it all done.

37
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,572
Great Job! See you again at the commercial shooting.

38
00:06:52,572 --> 00:06:53,752
Sure, Thank you.

39
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:57,532
Phone?

40
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,402
Peem, can you stop being angry?

41
00:07:11,127 --> 00:07:12,852
You haven't talked to me all day.

42
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:14,762
Your mouth’s made for talking—

43
00:07:18,467 --> 00:07:22,878
Are you going to? If not, I going to kiss you. Mook!

44
00:07:24,082 --> 00:07:25,593
Stop it. Go sit down.

45
00:07:28,636 --> 00:07:29,513
What did I tell you?

46
00:07:30,103 --> 00:07:32,910
I forbid you from going to HERA Club, but you went anyway.

47
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:35,600
I called and called, but you didn’t answer.

48
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,417
Did anyone see you?

49
00:08:17,387 --> 00:08:19,349
THE SAINT and this DEVIL?

50
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:21,559
No way!, that can't be true!

51
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:25,357
Fake news.
I’ve got to gossip about this.

52
00:08:37,697 --> 00:08:40,164
My business is really someone else’s business.

53
00:08:43,206 --> 00:08:44,283
You just realised?

54
00:08:45,486 --> 00:08:47,783
Now everyone wants to know about you

55
00:08:48,207 --> 00:08:50,350
—the gossip flies fast.

56
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,765
That’s why I warned you to be careful when you do something.

57
00:08:56,228 --> 00:08:57,534
You already signed the marriage certificate

58
00:08:57,534 --> 00:08:59,236
—more than that—with a GUY.

59
00:08:59,684 --> 00:09:02,025
You can’t just go around sleeping with girls like you used to.

60
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,049
Do you understand?

61
00:09:06,984 --> 00:09:09,502
And... did anyone see you last night?

62
00:09:13,325 --> 00:09:15,000
... Yes.

63
00:09:20,168 --> 00:09:22,459
Tomorrow, you’ve got an interview.

64
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,392
Peem, you are DEAD.

65
00:09:44,831 --> 00:09:48,215
What is the time? Where is she?
She coming! There! There!

66
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:52,935
Hello

67
00:09:56,441 --> 00:09:57,529
Don't forget what I told you.

68
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,440
If you’re ready, can we start the interview?

69
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:08,027
So, about the rumor… is it true?

70
00:10:13,216 --> 00:10:13,982
So? Can you answer?

71
00:10:15,665 --> 00:10:17,067
Yes, it’s true.

72
00:10:21,124 --> 00:10:25,181
I and Mook have registered our marriage.

73
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,801
Can you tell us the details of how you met?

74
00:10:38,063 --> 00:10:40,503
It was me and Peem

75
00:10:41,046 --> 00:10:42,470
—Mook’s personal assistant.

76
00:10:42,989 --> 00:10:44,482
We had known each other before this.

77
00:10:45,237 --> 00:10:47,005
That’s how we met.

78
00:10:50,143 --> 00:10:53,612
When we were dating, we agreed to date quietly.

79
00:10:56,278 --> 00:10:58,830
Because we didn’t want to be in the news.

80
00:11:00,741 --> 00:11:02,158
It was what we wanted.

81
00:11:04,211 --> 00:11:06,611
When you say quietly,

82
00:11:06,847 --> 00:11:11,566
how quiet was it? And… does your family know about it?

83
00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:16,879
And what about the rumour that K.Songprod already has a fiancée?

84
00:11:17,516 --> 00:11:18,741
Is that true?

85
00:11:26,614 --> 00:11:28,955
Today, I only want to answer questions about us.

86
00:11:29,616 --> 00:11:31,717
[What? ] [Why?] [How come?] [Please tell us!]

87
00:11:31,717 --> 00:11:33,018
I’m sorry.

88
00:11:33,018 --> 00:11:35,637
Then what about K.Mook?

89
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,538
Don’t you like girls anymore?

90
00:11:38,718 --> 00:11:43,680
You’re in the news every day for your “messes” with girls.

91
00:11:43,775 --> 00:11:46,394
[Yes, yes! Please answer us! Answer! Answer us!]

92
00:11:46,394 --> 00:11:48,311
Oh, wait… or is it the money?

93
00:11:48,689 --> 00:11:50,592
Did you marry for MONEY?
