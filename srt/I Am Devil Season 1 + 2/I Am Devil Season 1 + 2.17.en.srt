1
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:25,156
Wait… K. Nita!

2
00:00:28,058 --> 00:00:29,430
Who’s that?

3
00:00:31,192 --> 00:00:33,015
It’s me.

4
00:00:34,881 --> 00:00:37,095
What are you doing?

5
00:00:37,095 --> 00:00:41,714
Making a deal, just like you did with P’Prod.

6
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:48,824
Take a look—you might want to see it up close.

7
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:24,274
You can blackmail me? Well, I can blackmail you too.

8
00:01:25,622 --> 00:01:27,624
Just like I thought.

9
00:01:27,624 --> 00:01:31,065
Tomorrow, I’ll have something to surprise your sister with.

10
00:01:38,839 --> 00:01:40,280
Natty!

11
00:01:40,695 --> 00:01:43,913
Why? Didn’t you know?

12
00:01:45,468 --> 00:01:48,034
Your sister often goes to Hera Club.

13
00:01:48,656 --> 00:01:51,406
It’s a sapphic club.

14
00:01:55,345 --> 00:01:58,193
I even have a video clip. Want to see it?

15
00:01:58,193 --> 00:02:00,234
I’ll share it with you.

16
00:02:03,447 --> 00:02:08,309
If you think of hurting others, make sure you have no weaknesses of your own.

17
00:02:16,187 --> 00:02:20,588
You investigated me? Well, I can investigate you too.

18
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:25,521
I heard your parents don’t like people like us.

19
00:02:27,076 --> 00:02:30,342
How do you think they’ll react

20
00:02:31,275 --> 00:02:35,562
if they find out about your sister?

21
00:02:36,806 --> 00:02:40,170
Or do you think your sister will break first?

22
00:02:43,694 --> 00:02:47,678
It’s a tough choice, Nita. You started this.

23
00:02:49,026 --> 00:02:51,249
Are you willing to trade?

24
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:10,206
“P’Ni, I released the video.”

25
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:18,091
“What are you talking about? What clip?”

26
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,861
“Mookmanee’s clip. Since you didn’t do anything, I did.”

27
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:28,190
“What?! What did you just do, Natty?!”

28
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:33,053
“Ouch! Are you crazy? That hurt!”

29
00:03:33,053 --> 00:03:35,834
“Answer me. Are you dating a girl?

30
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:38,366
That friend of yours, right?

31
00:03:38,366 --> 00:03:41,132
You know what our parents are like.

32
00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:46,616
Who told you?”

33
00:03:46,616 --> 00:03:47,893
“Who?

34
00:03:47,893 --> 00:03:51,570
You released her video—now she’s going to release yours.

35
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,890
Be prepared, Natty.”

36
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:26,955
“She’ll really dare to release it?”

37
00:04:48,102 --> 00:04:51,456
“I want to be alone for a while.”

38
00:05:11,462 --> 00:05:14,252
“Yes, Mum wants to meet Prangdao immediately.”

39
00:05:47,836 --> 00:05:49,694
I was wrong about that night.

40
00:05:49,694 --> 00:05:52,770
Prangdao didn’t even want to kiss me.

41
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,937
Let me ask you something, Mook.

42
00:05:56,937 --> 00:05:59,390
Do you still believe in love after all this?

43
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:03,574
And about Prangdao—

44
00:06:05,647 --> 00:06:10,020
don’t you think she’s different?

45
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,767
You care about her a lot, don’t you?”

46
00:06:30,663 --> 00:06:33,297
Do you have anything to say to me?

47
00:06:46,254 --> 00:06:49,961
Pack your bags and go back to England.

48
00:06:50,998 --> 00:06:54,990
Think about what’s happened.

49
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,873
And if you can’t figure it out, don’t come back.”

50
00:07:13,696 --> 00:07:23,961
“P’Peem, what if I believe in love again? Will it end the same way?”

51
00:07:23,961 --> 00:07:27,489
“If you make the same decisions, yes.

52
00:07:28,111 --> 00:07:30,802
But if you change, things might turn out differently.

53
00:07:30,802 --> 00:07:34,124
Your actions always shape the outcome.

54
00:07:55,166 --> 00:08:00,547
Mookmanee, I want you to stop messing with Prangdao,

55
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:05,055
my daughter. You cannot do this to my family.

56
00:08:05,055 --> 00:08:10,475
I won’t accept it. End everything. Do you understand me?!

57
00:08:55,358 --> 00:08:59,783
Come with me. Don’t ask anything.

58
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:17,981
“P’Mook—”

59
00:09:17,981 --> 00:09:20,903
“I’m going out. Don’t follow me.”

60
00:09:45,055 --> 00:09:47,041
What’s up, P’Peem?

61
00:09:47,974 --> 00:09:53,714
I was on the phone with Sponsors. They want to make a new GL series

62
00:09:54,854 --> 00:09:58,223
with you and Grace.

63
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:02,378
But I already rejected them.

64
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:09,935
“Mookmanee, I want you to stop messing with Prangdao, my daughter.

65
00:10:09,935 --> 00:10:14,013
You cannot do this to my family. I won’t accept it.

66
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:17,903
End everything. Do you understand me?!

67
00:10:17,903 --> 00:10:20,514
“Hello, Mook?”

68
00:10:21,965 --> 00:10:25,380
P’Peem, I’m in for the project. Accept it.

69
00:10:27,971 --> 00:10:33,983
I’m going to Hera Club—don’t send anyone.

70
00:10:58,964 --> 00:11:04,451
“Mook, are you drunk? You can’t kiss me here—it’ll be a scandal.”

71
00:11:09,841 --> 00:11:11,027
“Why not?

72
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,410
I told P’Peem not to send anyone.

73
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,465
Are you brushing me off?

74
00:11:19,465 --> 00:11:23,264
Anyway, back to the MookGrace ship—

75
00:11:23,264 --> 00:11:26,440
I don’t like when you’re cold to me.

76
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,451
Tomorrow I’m leaving for England.

77
00:11:31,451 --> 00:11:33,426
even if the debt were paid by others,

78
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:38,031
you’ll live with the guilt for the rest of your life.
