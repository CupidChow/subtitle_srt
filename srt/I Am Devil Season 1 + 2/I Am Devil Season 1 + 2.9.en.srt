1
00:00:28,303 --> 00:00:29,745
When finished, I will contact you.

2
00:00:33,749 --> 00:00:36,247
You don't have any contacts for me, Mook.

3
00:01:12,564 --> 00:01:14,585
During the accident,

4
00:01:14,585 --> 00:01:16,623
Grandma's brain was damaged. Severely

5
00:01:16,623 --> 00:01:19,474
It may result in memory being choppy,

6
00:01:19,474 --> 00:01:21,496
making it difficult for anyone to remember.

7
00:01:21,496 --> 00:01:24,601
The doctor wants Mr. Mook to calm down.

8
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:27,077
Don't rush her, don't do anything that will startle her.

9
00:01:27,077 --> 00:01:28,861
We need to give Grandma plenty of time,

10
00:01:28,861 --> 00:01:32,235
give him plenty of rest her body will recover

11
00:01:32,235 --> 00:01:33,740
and your memory will recover quickly.

12
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,281
Yes, Doctor. Thank you.

13
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,962
As soon as Grandma recovers, I’m happy.

14
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:33,311
Mom , Listen to me

15
00:02:34,361 --> 00:02:36,539
Why don't you listen to me?

16
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:38,899
I just called to tell you about Grandma condition.

17
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:43,846
Don't hang up Mom.

18
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:57,916
Mom, please worry about Grandma! Mother .. Mother!

19
00:03:24,177 --> 00:03:29,683
I didn't intend to eavesdrop on you.

20
00:03:29,683 --> 00:03:35,625
I was already hiding, but you walked towards me.

21
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,432
Tonight, I'll celebrate your birthday countdown

22
00:04:01,432 --> 00:04:04,352
in exchange for you forgetting all about me and my mother conversation.

23
00:04:04,352 --> 00:04:07,544
You don't have to do this.

24
00:04:07,544 --> 00:04:09,647
I don't have to worry about anyone else.

25
00:04:09,647 --> 00:04:15,795
Besides, I can't drink tonight. I have work to finish tonight,

26
00:04:15,795 --> 00:04:19,083
I drank and had a headache and couldn't work.

27
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:26,599
I'm asking just one question.

28
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,939
Do you want to drink?

29
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:34,363
Just tell me whether you want it or not. Only answer that.

30
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:56,719
Why is it so difficult for me to kiss you today

31
00:04:56,719 --> 00:05:00,100
no camera here Why are you running away from me? Hmm?

32
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,198
Are you ashamed of me?

33
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:15,732
(If you don't think about it, then don't  let someone else think.

34
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,226
There are many lessons that you learn.

35
00:05:18,226 --> 00:05:21,131
Making other people sad is not fun.)

36
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,214
Let's drink.

37
00:05:28,214 --> 00:05:31,311
Have this before going to bed. It helps prevent hangovers.

38
00:05:31,311 --> 00:05:33,984
I take it often. It really works.

39
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,184
You don't eat?

40
00:05:42,184 --> 00:05:44,863
No, tonight I want to get drunk.

41
00:05:49,065 --> 00:05:52,491
I want to go swimming Do you want to swim together?

42
00:05:52,491 --> 00:05:55,023
Then at midnight we would come and blow the cake.

43
00:06:14,868 --> 00:06:16,202
Why are you secretly peeking at me?

44
00:06:16,786 --> 00:06:18,529
No I’m not

45
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:27,200
We don't even know each other yet.

46
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:30,458
Come and get to know each other, okay?

47
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,382
What do you want to know?

48
00:06:37,432 --> 00:06:41,695
You call me “Sis” So How many years younger than me?

49
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:44,910
2 Years

50
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:48,155
Two years , So you are   23 years old.

51
00:06:51,073 --> 00:06:54,558
Do you like art? I saw you working on art all the time

52
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,576

53
00:06:58,977 --> 00:07:02,700
Why? What’s your inspiration

54
00:07:11,803 --> 00:07:14,800
I am the second wife's child.

55
00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:21,498
So I want to study something far from the family business,

56
