1
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:20,912
OMG, everyone! Did you hear?!

2
00:00:20,912 --> 00:00:25,506
I’ve been spilling tea about MMN,

3
00:00:25,506 --> 00:00:28,035
but this is the juiciest scandal ever!

4
00:00:28,035 --> 00:00:33,006
During today’s shoot, someone tried to poison her!

5
00:00:33,006 --> 00:00:35,360
At first, we thought it was one of her anti-fans,

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,418
but no—it was actually Nita!

7
00:00:39,418 --> 00:00:41,160
So cruel!

8
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,436
She wanted Mookmanee to drink it, but it ended up in someone else’s hands.

9
00:00:45,436 --> 00:00:48,488
OMG, this is just evil!

10
00:00:48,488 --> 00:00:54,915
And get this—Nita turned herself in this morning!

11
00:00:54,915 --> 00:01:01,110
This is straight-up villainous.

12
00:01:27,443 --> 00:01:30,717
Mook, it's late. You need to rest.

13
00:01:30,717 --> 00:01:35,281
Prang is safe now.

14
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,685
Prang! You’re awake!

15
00:02:40,685 --> 00:02:43,414
Mook, wake up! Prang is awake.

16
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:47,310
Prang...

17
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:09,528
Who would’ve thought Nita would do such a thing?

18
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:16,451
How did it come to this?

19
00:03:18,811 --> 00:03:22,095
I’m sorry. It was my fault.

20
00:03:22,095 --> 00:03:26,526
I shouldn't have given you that orange juice.

21
00:03:26,526 --> 00:03:28,069
Stop blaming yourself, Mook.

22
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:31,808
Are you saying it should have been you instead?

23
00:03:31,808 --> 00:03:33,781
It wasn’t your fault.

24
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:39,873
Please don’t say that. I’ll feel uneasy.

25
00:03:47,544 --> 00:03:54,378
Prang, Mook, P'Peem and I are going to grab some food.

26
00:03:54,378 --> 00:03:59,188
We’ll talk when we get back.

27
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:35,389
Mom, please don’t go in yet.

28
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:39,213
I know how to handle this.

29
00:04:55,358 --> 00:05:04,046
P’Mook, I’m thirsty. My throat is so dry.

30
00:05:28,238 --> 00:05:31,801
P’Mook,

31
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:35,594
this is a hospital.

32
00:05:35,594 --> 00:05:38,893
I’m fine now.

33
00:05:38,893 --> 00:05:41,618
Don’t worry so much.

34
00:05:47,224 --> 00:05:49,532
Actually, this was worth it.

35
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:54,637
Now you’ll be nice to me forever.

36
00:05:55,965 --> 00:05:59,672
What are you saying? Worth it?!

37
00:05:59,672 --> 00:06:02,832
I don’t like hearing that.

38
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,496
Why are you scolding me?

39
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:12,611
You’re hurt! Was it worth it?

40
00:06:12,611 --> 00:06:15,357
I don’t like hearing you say that.

41
00:06:15,357 --> 00:06:21,164
I can be nice to you even if you’re not hurt.

42
00:06:22,344 --> 00:06:26,349
Aww, you’re angry? So fierce.

43
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:35,986
I was just happy you were worried about me.

44
00:06:35,986 --> 00:06:38,980
Can you not be mad?

45
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,190
Don’t say that again, okay?

46
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,697
Are you scared?

47
00:07:33,155 --> 00:07:36,556
Here is K. Pranee's medical history.

48
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:41,183
Transfer the case to me. I'll take care of it.

49
00:07:41,183 --> 00:07:44,706
As for Songprod, I'll give him a call.

50
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,950
Even if you don't remember me, it's okay.

51
00:07:55,983 --> 00:07:58,704
I just want to repay you.

52
00:08:28,954 --> 00:08:31,219
Let me help.

53
00:08:32,989 --> 00:08:40,090
And Mook, my mom is taking over your grandma's case.

54
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:45,454
She said they know each other, so she wants to handle it herself

55
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,737
P'Prod said you know my grandmother.

56
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:14,690
Did you take her case?

57
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:18,952
Yes, but it's between me and her.

58
00:09:18,952 --> 00:09:22,557
It has nothing to do with you.

59
00:09:32,735 --> 00:09:38,021
From now on, I'll be watching over you, Mookmanee.

60
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:42,896
If you hurt my daughter, I'll be the one to take care of you.

61
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:50,576
I don't accept you yet, but I'm giving you a chance.

62
00:09:52,494 --> 00:09:55,847
That's from my heart.

63
00:10:05,436 --> 00:10:11,131
Bravo! Magnificent! Prapatchdorn,

64
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:19,071
good luck, you little devil.

65
00:10:49,728 --> 00:10:51,519
Wait.

66
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:08,019
I want to walk with you and hold your hand.

67
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:10,179
But... I don’t want anyone to see.

68
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:14,437
I worry about your privacy.

69
00:12:00,424 --> 00:12:03,680
You made Songprod and me wait for 30 minutes.

70
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,533
Were you out for a catwalk or something?

71
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:08,449
Look, Prod! Look at how they're dressed.

72
00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:11,753
P'Peem, you're in this cool car. Don't complain.

73
00:12:13,376 --> 00:12:15,371
This is hot.

74
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:19,471
Are you hot? Okay,

75
00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:26,408
let me turn on the air.

76
00:12:26,408 --> 00:12:27,942
My body aches.

77
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,895
Is your body stiff? The seats have an auto-massage function.

78
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:36,696
What? They do?

79
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,515
This is super luxurious.

80
00:13:26,212 --> 00:13:28,632
Is it that scary?

81
00:13:28,632 --> 00:13:32,285
What's wrong? You look stressed.

82
00:13:32,285 --> 00:13:34,568
My friend just sent me an email.

83
00:13:34,568 --> 00:13:36,629
There’s a problem at work.

84
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:40,567
Our customer won’t talk to anyone except me.

85
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:51,245
Looks like I really have to go back to England.

86
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,624
Is the customer a guy or a girl?

87
00:14:02,115 --> 00:14:04,874
When will I see you again?

88
00:14:13,135 --> 00:14:15,840
Can I ask you something?

89
00:14:16,873 --> 00:14:19,073
What do you think of me now?

90
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:24,090
How do I think of you?

91
00:14:26,008 --> 00:14:30,138
Umm… let's just say,

92
00:14:33,383 --> 00:14:37,040
when I used to see roses,

93
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,174
I didn’t like them.

94
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:44,936
But now, when I see them,

95
00:14:44,936 --> 00:14:51,929
I think they're actually kind of pretty.

96
00:14:54,437 --> 00:14:56,385
Then how about this?

97
00:14:56,385 --> 00:15:02,450
I'll send you roses every day while I'm in England, so you don’t forget about me.

98
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,066
Flirting with me?

99
00:15:05,394 --> 00:15:08,246
Yes. You might not know this,

100
00:15:08,246 --> 00:15:11,219
but you were my first love.

101
00:15:11,219 --> 00:15:15,088
When we first met, you probably don’t remember

102
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:17,423
because you were really drunk that time.

103
00:15:18,603 --> 00:15:21,643
Yeah, I don’t remember.

104
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:29,780
I really can’t recall where or when.

105
00:15:33,468 --> 00:15:36,381
Well, you said I was drunk.

106
00:15:36,381 --> 00:15:39,762
Can’t you give me a chance?

107
00:15:53,629 --> 00:15:56,454
Stop! Stop!

108
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,177
I want to start over with you.

109
00:16:05,062 --> 00:16:08,202
I won’t disappoint your mother.

110
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:12,169
You're giving me hope.

111
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:14,770
I am.

112
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,879
And you're giving me hope too, Prangdao.

113
00:16:19,059 --> 00:16:25,220
But I need to work—can you accept that our relationship won’t be ideal?

114
00:16:28,908 --> 00:16:29,834
Yes.

115
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:38,114
But if I see you kiss another girl even once, I’ll kiss you ten times in return.

116
00:16:38,114 --> 00:16:42,920
Good! Then I’ll tell them to write plenty of kissing scenes.

117
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,243
That way, when you come back, you’ll have lots of chances to kiss me.

118
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:31,953
It’s been three months since we talked about Mookmanee.

119
00:18:31,953 --> 00:18:39,072
I heard Mookmanee has been spotted in the changing room with N'Proud!

120
00:18:39,072 --> 00:18:42,807
the MookGrace ship might sink! OMG!

121
00:18:42,807 --> 00:18:46,571
P'Mook, I want to talk to you. Can we talk?
