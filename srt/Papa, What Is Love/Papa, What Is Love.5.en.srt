00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:03,987
Tupe?

3
00:00:04,498 --> 00:00:05,668
Is that you, Tupe?

4
00:00:07,543 --> 00:00:08,626
Holy f*ck!

5
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:20,508
Why are you naked, Tupe?

6
00:00:22,024 --> 00:00:25,512
I fell asleep instantly right after I took a bath.
Then, I heard loud noises here.

7
00:00:26,363 --> 00:00:27,652
And why are you naked?

8
00:00:28,252 --> 00:00:30,000
I saw a rat. I'm afraid of rats.

9
00:00:33,215 --> 00:00:35,363
Looks like you already caught the rat.

10
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:38,556
How about you?

11
00:00:39,203 --> 00:00:40,936
Why don't you catch YOUR rat?

(Episode 5)
(Greg &amp; Tupe)

14
00:02:06,578 --> 00:02:07,078
Greg,

15
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,672
will your dad be okay with us going out?

16
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:11,022
Of course.

17
00:02:11,263 --> 00:02:13,263
And it's not a problem for him.

18
00:02:14,749 --> 00:02:16,364
You're with me anyway.

19
00:02:16,551 --> 00:02:18,877
Did you mention this to your dad?
Is he aware of this?

20
00:02:19,046 --> 00:02:21,046
- Yes.
- Just relax.

21
00:02:21,863 --> 00:02:22,885
It's not like...

22
00:02:23,451 --> 00:02:26,637
we're escaping or eloping.

23
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:29,026
Or going to do something bad.

24
00:02:29,027 --> 00:02:29,527
Why?

25
00:02:29,764 --> 00:02:31,421
Are we going to do something bad?

26
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:32,814
Stop joking.

27
00:02:32,815 --> 00:02:34,133
Of course, none!

28
00:02:34,243 --> 00:02:35,739
Then there should be no problem.

29
00:02:41,231 --> 00:02:41,838
Where are we going?

30
00:02:42,905 --> 00:02:44,905
We're going to eat at a restaurant.

31
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:25,319
You know what?

32
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:27,054
I enjoyed this trip so much.

33
00:05:28,921 --> 00:05:31,840
I never thought I could experience that again.

34
00:05:32,317 --> 00:05:32,864
But...

35
00:05:34,227 --> 00:05:36,227
I get to experience it again because of you.

36
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,779
It's okay.

37
00:05:38,056 --> 00:05:39,848
I planned all these for you.

38
00:05:40,581 --> 00:05:41,209
And...

39
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,680
the food that you ordered earlier for me?

40
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:45,977
It was so delicious. I haven't tasted anything like that.

41
00:05:46,736 --> 00:05:48,736
But I want to try and do that dish.

42
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,375
I'll replicate that dish, you want?

43
00:05:51,821 --> 00:05:53,139
You'll replicate that dish?

44
00:05:53,332 --> 00:05:54,502
Yes, for you.

45
00:05:54,869 --> 00:05:56,869
That's kinda hard to believe.

46
00:05:57,546 --> 00:05:58,686
I can do that.

47
00:05:59,248 --> 00:05:59,795
Anyway,

48
00:06:00,619 --> 00:06:02,263
thank you for today.

49
00:06:08,476 --> 00:06:09,231
It's Rich.

50
00:06:10,884 --> 00:06:11,817
Hello, Rich?

51
00:06:15,684 --> 00:06:17,269
Phone's low battery.

52
00:06:36,308 --> 00:06:38,308
My father doesn't know, of course.

53
00:06:39,307 --> 00:06:41,307
I don't need to tell it to him anyway.

54
00:06:42,664 --> 00:06:44,664
Because all he gave to me and my mom

55
00:06:45,022 --> 00:06:49,008
are just pains and problems.

56
00:06:49,983 --> 00:06:51,272
All trouble.

57
00:06:58,913 --> 00:07:01,832
I had two girlfriends.

58
00:07:02,635 --> 00:07:04,131
One in high school,

59
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:06,000
and one when I was in college.

60
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,109
And then...

61
00:07:08,957 --> 00:07:10,957
I got a boyfriend.

62
00:07:11,554 --> 00:07:13,850
Our relationship was longer and

63
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,565
it was more intense.

64
00:07:17,286 --> 00:07:19,286
Because we knew...

65
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:21,651
how to take care of each other.

66
00:07:23,564 --> 00:07:24,171
But...

67
00:07:24,914 --> 00:07:26,914
that jerk left me and went home to Zamboanga.

68
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,148
He disappeared in my life like a bubble.

69
00:07:35,634 --> 00:07:37,634
Does your mother know that?

70
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:39,944
Yes, my mother knows.

71
00:07:40,864 --> 00:07:42,000
I told her that...

72
00:07:42,001 --> 00:07:44,001
I like both girls and boys.

73
00:07:45,035 --> 00:07:45,535
But

74
00:07:45,762 --> 00:07:47,762
I didn't say which one weighs more.

75
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:52,703
At first,

76
00:07:54,802 --> 00:07:55,587
she looked sad.

77
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,455
But when I asked her,

78
00:07:58,106 --> 00:08:00,106
she said she didn't mind. Whatever makes me happy.

79
00:08:05,377 --> 00:08:06,280
My turn.

80
00:08:07,705 --> 00:08:09,705
I was in first year college

81
00:08:09,705 --> 00:08:11,705
when I confessed to my mom and dad.

82
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,605
They seemed okay with it.

83
00:08:15,422 --> 00:08:17,422
Of course, especially to dad.

84
00:08:18,862 --> 00:08:19,439
You know what?

85
00:08:19,862 --> 00:08:24,174
I don't really understand the difference between a bisexual like me,

86
00:08:24,175 --> 00:08:26,679
and a pansexual like you.

87
00:08:28,355 --> 00:08:28,873
It's like this,

88
00:08:29,327 --> 00:08:29,827
I,

89
00:08:31,057 --> 00:08:31,604
We,

90
00:08:33,135 --> 00:08:34,483
we believe that...

91
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:36,247
first of all,

92
00:08:36,565 --> 00:08:38,565
sexuality isn't just a guy and a girl

93
00:08:39,928 --> 00:08:43,618
and gender identity isn't that simple.

94
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,452
It just means...

95
00:08:48,774 --> 00:08:52,138
we enjoy and experience love and sex.

96
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,530
Whether you're a girl, a guy,

97
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,419
straight or LGBT,

98
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:03,334
cisgender or transgender,

99
00:09:03,845 --> 00:09:04,392
So...

100
00:09:05,272 --> 00:09:06,768
you're also okay with lesbians?

101
00:09:06,768 --> 00:09:07,375
YES!

102
00:09:07,996 --> 00:09:09,700
I'm okay with anyone.

103
00:09:09,701 --> 00:09:10,626
Any gender.

104
00:09:11,615 --> 00:09:13,615
As long as I like him or her,

105
00:09:13,848 --> 00:09:15,848
or I love him or her.

106
00:09:16,936 --> 00:09:17,810
Is it clear now?

107
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:20,541
You know what?

108
00:09:21,016 --> 00:09:22,779
Whatever makes you happy. Go with it.

109
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:23,724
Exactly.

110
00:09:25,428 --> 00:09:26,064
Bottoms up!

111
00:09:47,644 --> 00:09:48,547
You know what?

112
00:09:48,887 --> 00:09:52,338
It was really difficult for me when mom died.

113
00:09:55,794 --> 00:09:58,920
It's like I lost half of my soul.

114
00:10:00,654 --> 00:10:02,387
I felt so lost.

115
00:10:05,663 --> 00:10:07,485
Everything I feel,

116
00:10:08,871 --> 00:10:11,138
my fears, anxieties,

117
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:12,726
frustrations,

118
00:10:13,054 --> 00:10:15,054
I tell her everything.

119
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,258
And she always has an answer.

120
00:10:19,247 --> 00:10:22,848
Because she sees all the good things in this world.

121
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:26,758
Ever since I was a child,

122
00:10:27,487 --> 00:10:29,695
she was my rock.

123
00:10:35,478 --> 00:10:36,589
You know...

124
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,394
I should be fine now.

125
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:43,908
Dad never abandoned me.

126
00:10:45,517 --> 00:10:47,398
We got even closer when

127
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:50,329
mom died.

128
00:10:54,726 --> 00:10:55,925
But you know what?

129
00:10:56,606 --> 00:10:57,835
I admire him

130
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:00,009
for his decision to

131
00:11:00,548 --> 00:11:03,348
not tell mom the truth about his sexuality.

132
00:11:06,735 --> 00:11:07,935
And let my mom

133
00:11:07,936 --> 00:11:09,580
pass peacefully

134
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:12,522
and happier.

135
00:11:14,647 --> 00:11:15,402
You know what?

136
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,030
I could have felt

137
00:11:17,387 --> 00:11:18,320
cheated.

138
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:20,212
For me,

139
00:11:20,777 --> 00:11:21,858
for mama.

140
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,927
But at least,

141
00:11:26,739 --> 00:11:28,354
dad was honest with me.

142
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:33,442
And I didn't mind at all.

143
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:35,121
You know what?

144
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:36,795
I'm proud of him.

145
00:11:41,246 --> 00:11:42,653
Cheers!

146
00:11:53,311 --> 00:11:54,392
Me?

147
00:11:56,126 --> 00:11:58,126
I don't have a nice story about my father.

148
00:12:00,478 --> 00:12:02,063
As I have told you,

149
00:12:03,286 --> 00:12:05,286
all he gave were disappointments and problems.

150
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,318
Body pains,

151
00:12:08,523 --> 00:12:09,515
all trouble!

152
00:12:10,672 --> 00:12:13,028
That's what we went through with him.

153
00:12:23,095 --> 00:12:23,595
Greg,

154
00:12:26,219 --> 00:12:29,375
Since I was a child, my father physically abused me.

155
00:12:35,457 --> 00:12:36,242
My mother...

156
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:39,073
she tried to defend me but

157
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:42,470
she can't do anything because she also gets hurt.

158
00:12:48,523 --> 00:12:49,397
That's why

159
00:12:49,577 --> 00:12:50,688
when...

160
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:53,441
when he left us,

161
00:12:54,514 --> 00:12:55,773
I was thankful.

162
00:13:03,163 --> 00:13:04,778
He may have left us in peace but

163
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:07,531
he also left us with a lot of debt.

164
00:13:12,018 --> 00:13:13,158
So you,

165
00:13:14,434 --> 00:13:14,934
Greg.

166
00:13:19,142 --> 00:13:21,552
You're really lucky with your father.

167
00:13:22,248 --> 00:13:24,485
You're really lucky to have Richard as your father.

168
00:13:27,631 --> 00:13:29,631
He let me experience

169
00:13:29,846 --> 00:13:32,231
things I never would have thought I could experience.

170
00:13:34,468 --> 00:13:35,549
To be loved truthfully?

171
00:13:38,426 --> 00:13:41,404
I thought I don't deserve that but he gave it to me.

172
00:13:44,477 --> 00:13:45,825
That's why...

173
00:13:56,895 --> 00:13:58,272
I can't hurt him.

174
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,890
I hope I won't hurt him.

175
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,639
I hope I won't hurt Richard.

176
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:29,213
You know,

177
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:30,359
you're funny.

178
00:14:32,195 --> 00:14:34,195
You really had to walk me to my room.

179
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:35,716
Are you that drunk?

180
00:14:36,206 --> 00:14:37,198
Of course...

181
00:14:37,525 --> 00:14:38,725
you're also my boss.

182
00:14:38,726 --> 00:14:39,718
That's why

183
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:41,704
I also have to serve you.

184
00:14:42,594 --> 00:14:43,171
Fine.

185
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:45,439
Have a good night.

186
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,499
We've been together for one whole day.

187
00:14:47,631 --> 00:14:48,949
Let's rest for tomorrow.

188
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:50,843
Good night.

189
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:01,946
No, please.

190
00:16:43,373 --> 00:16:45,373
I really can't hurt Richard.

191
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:53,604
Tupe...

192
00:16:54,939 --> 00:16:56,702
I like you...

193
00:16:58,281 --> 00:16:59,688
I really, really like you.

194
00:17:02,249 --> 00:17:02,945
I think.

195
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,220
I'm falling for you.

196
00:17:11,482 --> 00:17:12,267
But...

197
00:17:13,394 --> 00:17:14,979
what about Richard?

198
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:32,977
Eat your food.

199
00:19:08,931 --> 00:19:10,783
I can't wait to hug you.

200
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,545
But don't worry,

201
00:19:12,675 --> 00:19:14,171
I'm okay here in Cebu.

202
00:19:14,394 --> 00:19:16,661
So far, the business deals are good.

203
00:19:19,231 --> 00:19:21,231
How are you and my baby Tupe?

204
00:19:21,466 --> 00:19:23,466
Don't be too much on him.

205
00:19:25,871 --> 00:19:27,871
He's okay, dad.

206
00:19:53,852 --> 00:19:54,903
Hello, Rich?

207
00:19:56,332 --> 00:19:57,028
Hello?

208
00:19:57,566 --> 00:19:58,795
Hi, my baby.

209
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:01,296
I miss you so much.

210
00:20:01,421 --> 00:20:02,591
So, how are you?

211
00:20:03,874 --> 00:20:05,370
I'm okay here.

212
00:20:08,777 --> 00:20:09,502
Sure?

213
00:20:10,255 --> 00:20:10,921
Okay.

214
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:14,001
Me, too. I'm very okay.

215
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:18,000
I have a lot of good deals on my business trip here in Cebu.

216
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,272
With the overwhelming happiness I feel,

217
00:20:20,468 --> 00:20:23,180
I bought you something special from here.

218
00:20:24,551 --> 00:20:26,551
Because you're always on my mind.

219
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:28,522
And the thought of you

220
00:20:28,697 --> 00:20:30,371
always keeps me going.

221
00:20:31,661 --> 00:20:32,505
Rich,

222
00:20:34,225 --> 00:20:36,000
Why are you crying all of a sudden?

223
00:20:36,238 --> 00:20:37,052
What's wrong?

224
00:20:37,676 --> 00:20:38,312
Why?

225
00:20:40,065 --> 00:20:41,798
What happened?
