00:00:00,966 --> 00:00:02,669
(Previously On Papa, What Is Love?)
Today is super crazy.

2
00:00:02,774 --> 00:00:04,204
It's exhausting, it's frustrating.

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:04,923
I'm done!

4
00:00:07,638 --> 00:00:09,985
And why are you sending female applicants?

5
00:00:11,148 --> 00:00:12,578
You already know, right?

6
00:00:12,697 --> 00:00:14,697
I don't like female applicants.

7
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,800
(Papa, What Is Love?)

00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,500
(Episode 2)
(Flowers For Rich)

9
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,644
Yes, son?

10
00:03:37,645 --> 00:03:38,654
What's up, dad?

11
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:40,792
I'm sending the documents today.

12
00:03:41,523 --> 00:03:43,523
You have to sign it, dad.

13
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:45,301
It's very important.

14
00:03:45,899 --> 00:03:46,488
Dad,

15
00:03:46,611 --> 00:03:48,438
you seem different.

16
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,438
Me?

17
00:03:51,585 --> 00:03:53,362
Son, I'm fine.

18
00:03:53,544 --> 00:03:54,405
I mean...

19
00:03:54,552 --> 00:03:56,899
you really sound okay.

20
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:57,510
But...

21
00:03:57,811 --> 00:03:59,216
are you really so?

22
00:03:59,217 --> 00:04:00,301
Yeah.

23
00:04:00,646 --> 00:04:01,730
I am.

24
00:04:01,977 --> 00:04:03,927
You've been like that for three weeks now.

25
00:04:03,928 --> 00:04:04,913
Actually,

26
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:08,198
ever since you had company in the house.

27
00:04:08,854 --> 00:04:09,789
Uhm...

28
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:10,867
Son?

29
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,981
Hello? Hello? Son!

30
00:04:12,982 --> 00:04:13,818
Choppy!

31
00:04:14,113 --> 00:04:15,667
Son, choppy!

32
00:04:15,668 --> 00:04:16,999
Your signal is choppy.

33
00:04:17,176 --> 00:04:18,458
Hello? Hello!

34
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,459
Hello? Hello! Hello!

35
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:48,617
Good morning, sir Richard!

36
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:50,731
Breakfast is ready.

37
00:04:58,294 --> 00:04:59,031
Wait,

38
00:04:59,747 --> 00:05:01,128
Sir Richard?

39
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:02,911
I told you already...

40
00:05:02,912 --> 00:05:04,442
Just call me Rich.

41
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,687
And no more "sir".

42
00:05:06,927 --> 00:05:08,927
And not Richard.

43
00:05:09,097 --> 00:05:09,983
Rich.

44
00:05:12,538 --> 00:05:13,374
Come on,

45
00:05:13,517 --> 00:05:14,947
let's eat.

46
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:16,675
Wow!

47
00:05:25,764 --> 00:05:28,482
You know, you cooked this hotdog perfectly.

48
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,660
Yes! Look.

49
00:05:32,255 --> 00:05:34,181
All of them are perfect.

50
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:36,533
You know what?

51
00:05:36,658 --> 00:05:39,178
I'm getting inspired to
eat breakfast every day if it's like this.

52
00:05:40,832 --> 00:05:43,055
Especially if you have some company.

53
00:05:46,591 --> 00:05:48,665
Sir.. Uhm.. Rich,

54
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,533
what you said is more inspiring.

55
00:05:57,402 --> 00:05:58,387
You know what?

56
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:01,615
You really understand
how I want my hotdog to be cooked.

57
00:06:03,425 --> 00:06:05,425
Not too oily,

58
00:06:07,473 --> 00:06:08,804
not too cooked.

59
00:06:08,804 --> 00:06:10,309
Just perfect.

60
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,688
You know what,

61
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,641
we had a family restaurant business before.

62
00:06:20,474 --> 00:06:25,173
That's why my father pressured me to learn how to cook.

63
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:27,679
I need to be a chef.

64
00:06:28,002 --> 00:06:32,478
Because he wanted me to
manage our restaurant business.

65
00:06:32,941 --> 00:06:35,634
Do you still have restaurants until now, sir?

66
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:38,390
Before...

67
00:06:38,595 --> 00:06:40,595
but now they're all gone.

68
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,265
The business went bankrupt.

69
00:06:42,266 --> 00:06:46,371
All of our money went to
the hospital bills of my father in the US.

70
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:49,121
And also, the economy here is not doing well.

71
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,295
But you know,

72
00:06:51,296 --> 00:06:53,296
I never became a chef.

73
00:06:57,162 --> 00:07:00,375
To be honest, it's one of my dreams:
to have a restaurant.

74
00:07:00,974 --> 00:07:03,172
Even just a small canteen would do.

75
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:04,644
Really?

76
00:07:05,087 --> 00:07:06,270
Oh my God,

77
00:07:06,271 --> 00:07:07,305
that's right.

78
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,236
People should never forget to have hope,

79
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,281
dreams,

80
00:07:11,282 --> 00:07:11,994
and goals.

81
00:07:12,095 --> 00:07:13,154
Otherwise,

82
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,421
what's the use?

83
00:07:15,693 --> 00:07:16,455
Right?

84
00:07:16,823 --> 00:07:18,031
Remember that.

85
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:21,096
That's all I have, sir.

86
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:22,428
Dreams.

87
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:33,085
How did you learn how to cook again?

88
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,890
Our family can manage before

89
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:40,872
maybe because my parents were hardworking.

90
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:43,883
They work all day in the market.

91
00:07:43,884 --> 00:07:46,404
So I'm left all alone in the house.

92
00:07:47,017 --> 00:07:50,181
That's why even as a kid, I learned how to cook.

93
00:07:50,576 --> 00:07:51,076
And,

94
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,730
they give me a budget for the ingredients.

95
00:07:53,731 --> 00:07:56,173
So, I can cook anything I want.

96
00:07:56,174 --> 00:07:56,674
But,

97
00:07:57,042 --> 00:08:00,478
I follow the recipes,
you know those wrapped around the canned goods?

98
00:08:00,904 --> 00:08:02,904
I can't go wrong though.

99
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,799
I'm dead if my mom doesn't like the taste.

100
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:08,794
She's like a machine gun when she nags.

101
00:08:08,795 --> 00:08:10,795
Your ears would hurt.

102
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:12,562
You know what?

103
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,226
My son Greg is so hardworking.

104
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:18,168
It's like opportunities are going to deplete.

105
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,473
He doesn't want to stop.

106
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:21,078
He doesn't want to take a rest.

107
00:08:21,206 --> 00:08:24,320
That's why he didn't get to learn any house chores.

108
00:08:24,423 --> 00:08:26,423
Even to cook, he doesn't know how.

109
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:28,038
Because...

110
00:08:28,298 --> 00:08:30,496
that's what his mother wanted.

111
00:08:30,781 --> 00:08:34,044
She doesn't want us to get a helper.

112
00:08:34,273 --> 00:08:37,065
She wants to do all the house chores.

113
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,343
Even I,

114
00:08:38,865 --> 00:08:40,865
I spoiled my son.

115
00:08:41,306 --> 00:08:43,578
But in every generous act I do,

116
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:47,152
I always remember to give a valuable lesson.

117
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:48,930
Words of wisdom.

118
00:08:49,688 --> 00:08:51,416
But he loves me.

119
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,898
He really loves me.

120
00:09:05,222 --> 00:09:07,222
That's why when...

121
00:09:07,484 --> 00:09:08,815
you know,

122
00:09:09,027 --> 00:09:11,027
when I came out to him,

123
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,530
it was easy for him to accept me.

124
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,708
Well, how could he not?

125
00:09:17,826 --> 00:09:20,445
He's no different from me after all.

126
00:09:20,672 --> 00:09:22,449
The difference is

127
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,533
he is pansexual.

128
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:26,265
You know,

129
00:09:26,491 --> 00:09:27,921
millennials.

130
00:09:32,768 --> 00:09:34,768
Thank God...

131
00:09:35,035 --> 00:09:37,035
I am the only child.

132
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:37,897
Because...

133
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:41,149
it wasn't hard for us back then.

134
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,945
But,

135
00:09:43,094 --> 00:09:45,094
when my father died,

136
00:09:46,268 --> 00:09:48,342
debts begin to bury us.

137
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:55,210
Add the slow business in the market.

138
00:09:57,493 --> 00:09:59,493
But the worst thing that happened, sir,

139
00:10:00,607 --> 00:10:02,607
is when my mother got sick.

140
00:10:04,786 --> 00:10:06,786
All of our money were drained.

141
00:10:08,001 --> 00:10:10,001
That's why I decided to...

142
00:10:10,468 --> 00:10:12,468
stop going to school.

143
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,939
So when I saw the ad posted by your son,

144
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,296
about this job.

145
00:10:19,297 --> 00:10:20,827
The pay is really big!

146
00:10:20,968 --> 00:10:23,216
I told myself, Lord I wish I get this job.

147
00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:26,482
Thankfully,

148
00:10:26,483 --> 00:10:28,483
my aunt is with us now.

149
00:10:29,005 --> 00:10:31,005
If I get this job,
she'll be taking care of my mother.

150
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:38,152
So...

151
00:10:39,037 --> 00:10:41,037
What's the condition of your mother now?

152
00:10:47,027 --> 00:10:47,591
Stage...

153
00:10:47,906 --> 00:10:49,312
Stage 3, sir.

154
00:10:55,642 --> 00:10:57,642
It's really hard to hold on, sir.

155
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:02,517
All I wanted is to see her healthy.

156
00:11:05,073 --> 00:11:07,742
Let me have all the pain and disease

157
00:11:07,742 --> 00:11:09,742
just not my mother.

158
00:11:10,052 --> 00:11:11,062
Sorry, sir.

159
00:11:14,398 --> 00:11:16,076
It's okay.

160
00:11:22,628 --> 00:11:24,925
You know, my wife died

161
00:11:25,107 --> 00:11:27,379
without me telling her the truth.

162
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,507
I don't have the guts.

163
00:11:33,273 --> 00:11:35,149
I got scared.

164
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:37,153
Well,

165
00:11:37,616 --> 00:11:39,690
actually, I am a coward.

166
00:11:43,893 --> 00:11:45,175
I'm a jerk.

167
00:11:47,478 --> 00:11:49,478
My wife died

168
00:11:49,862 --> 00:11:51,862
while being fooled by me.

169
00:11:53,369 --> 00:11:53,982
But...

170
00:11:55,483 --> 00:11:58,597
you never had the guts to leave her

171
00:11:59,888 --> 00:12:02,705
even if you know what would make you happy.

172
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:06,342
Because...

173
00:12:08,224 --> 00:12:11,214
she's the only one that makes me happy.

174
00:12:12,188 --> 00:12:14,634
She's the only one that really loves me.

175
00:12:15,942 --> 00:12:17,522
Comprehends,

176
00:12:17,886 --> 00:12:19,366
takes care,

177
00:12:20,104 --> 00:12:21,683
understands.

178
00:12:22,977 --> 00:12:24,977
So, why would I leave her?

179
00:12:27,771 --> 00:12:29,598
I just chose to

180
00:12:31,558 --> 00:12:33,979
not let her know the whole truth.

181
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:36,041
Because...

182
00:12:37,082 --> 00:12:38,000
nothing.

183
00:12:38,263 --> 00:12:40,263
I just don't want to add to

184
00:12:41,111 --> 00:12:43,260
the pain she's going through back then.

185
00:12:46,664 --> 00:12:48,664
The only condition is..

186
00:12:48,898 --> 00:12:50,898
You have to be stay in.

187
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:52,899
Of course, you have to attend to everything I need.

188
00:12:54,883 --> 00:12:55,818
Also,

189
00:12:56,001 --> 00:12:58,100
I increased your salary.

190
00:12:59,004 --> 00:13:02,787
That's triple the standard pay of a helper.

191
00:13:03,654 --> 00:13:05,060
Anyway,

192
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm expecting only the best.

193
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,224
Am I hired, sir?

194
00:13:15,313 --> 00:13:17,313
I am hired, sir?

195
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:21,240
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

196
00:13:23,609 --> 00:13:25,609
Thank you, sir.

197
00:13:35,895 --> 00:13:36,781
Hey!

198
00:13:37,576 --> 00:13:38,561
Good morning.

199
00:13:38,562 --> 00:13:39,547
Good morning.

200
00:13:39,548 --> 00:13:40,607
Wow!

201
00:13:44,355 --> 00:13:45,563
You know what?

202
00:13:45,822 --> 00:13:47,822
I really like flowers.

203
00:13:48,151 --> 00:13:50,151
Any kind. Just flowers.

204
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,173
Fragrant, fresh,

205
00:13:52,174 --> 00:13:54,174
and bright colors.

206
00:13:54,482 --> 00:13:56,482
How about this one?
Is this okay for you, Rich?

207
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,116
Of course.

208
00:14:00,117 --> 00:14:02,117
You know, I've learned to appreciate them.

209
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:04,847
Just like how my wife loved them.

210
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,557
And we're always happy whenever we see flowers.

211
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,980
Especially in the morning.

212
00:14:16,096 --> 00:14:17,526
Thank you.

213
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,098
Keke!

214
00:14:21,098 --> 00:14:23,098
Your dog is cute, sir.

215
00:14:23,351 --> 00:14:25,351
Are those for me?

216
00:14:26,194 --> 00:14:27,798
Sure, sir.

217
00:14:28,223 --> 00:14:29,777
Sure, sir?

218
00:14:30,144 --> 00:14:32,491
I just picked those from your neighbor.

219
00:14:32,618 --> 00:14:34,866
Their dog ruined their garden.

220
00:14:35,068 --> 00:14:36,746
I was thinking of giving those to your wife, sir.

221
00:14:36,747 --> 00:14:37,806
For good vibes.

222
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,183
Are you an applicant?

223
00:14:41,184 --> 00:14:41,723
Yes, sir!

224
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,122
Christopher Danan, sir.

225
00:14:43,123 --> 00:14:45,123
You can call me Tupe for short.

226
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,263
I thought I have a suitor

227
00:14:48,264 --> 00:14:50,264
since I am single now.

228
00:14:50,398 --> 00:14:50,987
Sir?

229
00:14:51,155 --> 00:14:52,511
Nothing.

230
00:14:52,512 --> 00:14:56,146
Thank you for the flowers anyway.

231
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,515
Wow!

232
00:15:02,043 --> 00:15:03,374
They're beautiful.

233
00:15:05,932 --> 00:15:08,700
Looks like you're getting better with flowers.

234
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,268
Yes, sir.

235
00:15:10,334 --> 00:15:15,058
My mother is a "plantita"
that's why I love being around flowers and plants.
