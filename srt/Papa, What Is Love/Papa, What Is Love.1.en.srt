1
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,100
(Papa, What Is Love?)

2
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,650
(Episode 1)
(The Applicants)

3
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:58,368
Yes, yes.

4
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,811
What?

5
00:05:05,132 --> 00:05:06,624
Wait a second.

6
00:05:08,486 --> 00:05:11,481
Dad, don't forget to
take your vitamins and supplements

7
00:05:11,481 --> 00:05:13,269
after you've had your breakfast, ha?

8
00:05:13,285 --> 00:05:14,565
Okay, okay.

9
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:17,159
The applicants will arrive around 10AM.

10
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,280
You're meeting 8 persons...

11
00:05:19,281 --> 00:05:20,455
maybe 10.

12
00:05:20,456 --> 00:05:21,694
I'm not sure.

13
00:05:21,695 --> 00:05:22,679
What?

14
00:05:22,804 --> 00:05:24,656
That seems a bit too much.

15
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:25,275
Son,

16
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:29,229
that would fill up my entire day.

17
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,733
We shouldn't waste time.

18
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,527
Dad...

19
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:35,274
You really need someone to help you there.

20
00:05:36,512 --> 00:05:38,512
You know...

21
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,237
Son,

22
00:05:40,344 --> 00:05:42,344
what do I need them for?

23
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:44,280
I can take care of the house.

24
00:05:44,281 --> 00:05:46,090
I can take care of myself!

25
00:05:46,368 --> 00:05:47,902
Dad...

26
00:05:48,064 --> 00:05:49,471
You just can't.

27
00:05:49,608 --> 00:05:51,608
And we're going to be busy again.

28
00:05:52,724 --> 00:05:54,724
We don't have...

29
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:57,346
Mom's not in the house anymore.

30
00:05:58,387 --> 00:06:01,446
You need someone to help you dad, okay?

31
00:06:08,305 --> 00:06:10,305
Did you say that

32
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,621
you went to UP before?

33
00:06:13,183 --> 00:06:15,098
Why did you stop?

34
00:06:15,328 --> 00:06:16,905
What did you say, sir?

35
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:19,301
(Applicant 1: What's that, sir?)

36
00:06:26,002 --> 00:06:28,997
YOU WENT TO UP BEFORE?

37
00:06:30,581 --> 00:06:31,480
Right?

38
00:06:32,011 --> 00:06:34,011
I have missed three semesters
since the school year started.

39
00:06:34,012 --> 00:06:36,012
Instead of going back to the province

40
00:06:36,013 --> 00:06:38,458
where it's harder for me to find work.

41
00:06:42,648 --> 00:06:44,076
I see.

42
00:06:46,867 --> 00:06:48,549
What did you say, sir?

43
00:06:55,673 --> 00:06:56,551
So...

44
00:06:58,196 --> 00:07:00,196
What happened to your last employer?

45
00:07:01,518 --> 00:07:03,433
Why did you leave?

46
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,690
(Applicant 2: Turn on the waterworks)

47
00:07:07,477 --> 00:07:09,477
Sir, because...

48
00:07:35,842 --> 00:07:37,842
(Applicant 3: The Solicitor)

49
00:07:50,142 --> 00:07:51,782
Here's the thing,

50
00:07:51,783 --> 00:07:53,783
I was shocked when I saw the ad.

51
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,740
I mean, my eyes went big!

52
00:07:58,703 --> 00:08:00,703
For a helper position,

53
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:03,169
the salary was so big!

54
00:08:03,956 --> 00:08:05,236
So, I was thinking.

55
00:08:05,237 --> 00:08:09,376
Why would I apply for a high-level job?

56
00:08:10,601 --> 00:08:14,528
I told myself, here's a high-paying job. Right?

57
00:08:16,532 --> 00:08:17,643
Anyway,

58
00:08:31,558 --> 00:08:32,838
Are you okay?

59
00:08:41,025 --> 00:08:43,025
(Applicant 4: Helper or eater?)

60
00:08:50,855 --> 00:08:52,855
(Applicant 5: Enjoying the food?)

61
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:55,730
The truth is,

62
00:08:55,731 --> 00:08:57,519
it's not my idea to get a helper.

63
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,694
I don't need it.

64
00:08:58,904 --> 00:09:00,904
But my son Greg is persistent.

65
00:09:01,654 --> 00:09:03,950
He says someone should take care of me.

66
00:09:03,951 --> 00:09:05,782
So, I just went along and agreed with it.

67
00:09:05,783 --> 00:09:07,338
And you know,

68
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:08,365
At my age,

69
00:09:08,366 --> 00:09:11,361
I admit that I need it. It's hard to be alone.

70
00:09:11,903 --> 00:09:12,442
Right?

71
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:15,033
So, that's why we're..

72
00:09:18,827 --> 00:09:20,086
It broke.

73
00:09:20,087 --> 00:09:21,642
I'm sorry.

74
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:22,733
It's okay.

75
00:09:23,421 --> 00:09:26,035
I also know how to give a massage, sir...

76
00:09:27,428 --> 00:09:29,322
with extra service.

77
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,237
(Applicant 6: With Extra Service)

78
00:09:49,411 --> 00:09:51,411
(Applicant 7: Forgive me, Lord)

79
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,176
Today is super crazy.

80
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,750
It's exhausting, it's frustrating!

81
00:09:58,751 --> 00:09:59,841
I'm done.

82
00:09:59,842 --> 00:10:00,762
Dad,

83
00:10:00,763 --> 00:10:01,853
don't be like that!

84
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,637
Just get through with it.

85
00:10:03,638 --> 00:10:05,702
And why are you sending female applicants?

86
00:10:06,694 --> 00:10:08,165
You already know.

87
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,166
I don't want female applicants.

88
00:10:10,586 --> 00:10:12,946
And why don't you want female applicants, dad?

89
00:10:16,479 --> 00:10:18,479
I thought I'm done with all the applicants?

90
00:10:18,781 --> 00:10:20,781
I already met 8 of them.

91
00:11:07,992 --> 00:11:09,992
(Applicant 8: Is he the one?)
