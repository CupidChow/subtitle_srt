1
00:00:00,969 --> 00:00:01,469
Rich?

2
00:00:02,974 --> 00:00:04,974
(Previously On Papa, What Is Love?)
Why are you crying all of a sudden?

3
00:00:05,377 --> 00:00:05,877
What's wrong?

4
00:00:06,808 --> 00:00:07,308
Why?

5
00:00:09,171 --> 00:00:10,089
What happened?

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,600
(Papa, What Is Love?)

7
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,400
(Episode 6)
(Love Me. Love Me. Say That You Love Me)

8
00:02:41,188 --> 00:02:42,391
I'm going to leave now, Greg.

9
00:02:45,227 --> 00:02:47,540
I really can't hurt Richard.

10
00:02:48,915 --> 00:02:50,915
Even more so with you.

11
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,354
You're leaving?

12
00:02:55,268 --> 00:02:56,015
YOU'RE LEAVING?!

13
00:02:56,241 --> 00:02:57,159
F*ck you, Tupe!

14
00:02:57,299 --> 00:02:58,217
F*ck you!

15
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,480
So you're just going to leave me here?

16
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:01,456
F*ck it.

17
00:03:02,194 --> 00:03:04,052
What did you say? F*ck it?

18
00:03:04,408 --> 00:03:05,867
You're right, f*ck it!

19
00:03:08,202 --> 00:03:10,202
I can't face Richard after what happened.

20
00:03:11,155 --> 00:03:12,472
Are you even thinking?

21
00:03:13,104 --> 00:03:14,449
Don't you feel guilty?

22
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:17,647
What am I going to say to him?

23
00:03:18,794 --> 00:03:20,794
I've been thinking all night
but nothing comes to mind.

24
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,279
Maybe you have thought of something?

25
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:25,517
Share it with me, please!

26
00:03:26,692 --> 00:03:28,493
Or do you want me to tell him,

27
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,000
sorry, Richard.

28
00:03:30,884 --> 00:03:32,372
I f*cked with you and your son.

29
00:03:32,615 --> 00:03:33,619
You're sh*t.

30
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,319
You're such a jerk.

31
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:45,363
With all the times we've had sex,

32
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:46,979
you're backing out now?

33
00:03:49,371 --> 00:03:50,944
Your moans say otherwise.

34
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,308
Even once, I did not see any regrets from you.

35
00:03:55,915 --> 00:03:59,168
- It even looked like you enjoyed every minute of it.
- I'm not joking, Greg!

36
00:04:03,128 --> 00:04:04,359
I'm scared!

37
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,255
I don't want to hurt your father.
Do you understand that?

38
00:04:24,455 --> 00:04:25,288
And what about me?

39
00:04:28,621 --> 00:04:31,993
Do you think I want to hurt my dad?

40
00:04:38,342 --> 00:04:39,545
Guess what, dad?

41
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:43,007
I'm f*cking your boyfriend.

42
00:04:47,827 --> 00:04:48,802
And I'm in love with him.

43
00:04:49,094 --> 00:04:50,587
Do you think I can tell him that?

44
00:05:04,293 --> 00:05:05,866
We can't do anything about it.

45
00:05:06,815 --> 00:05:08,126
It already happened.

46
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,041
We have no choice, Tupe.

47
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:15,958
Greg,

48
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:19,143
listen.

49
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:21,539
Listen to me.

50
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:23,602
We have a choice.

51
00:05:26,138 --> 00:05:27,284
I'm going to leave

52
00:05:29,778 --> 00:05:31,778
and you'll never see me again.

53
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:34,690
I'll go away where you can't reach me.

54
00:05:36,288 --> 00:05:38,857
You jerk! You're going to leave?

55
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,467
You're going away?
You'll leave us? You'll leave me?

56
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:51,321
You really didn't love truly, Tupe.

57
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,801
You're f*cking selfish.

58
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:00,185
What if...

59
00:06:03,186 --> 00:06:04,332
you fight for me?

60
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,739
We face the truth.

61
00:06:20,196 --> 00:06:21,057
The truth?

62
00:06:23,496 --> 00:06:25,496
And what truth are you talking about, Greg?

63
00:06:30,192 --> 00:06:30,692
WHAT?

64
00:06:32,853 --> 00:06:34,284
You haven't told me yet, Tupe.

65
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,000
But f*ck,

66
00:06:37,453 --> 00:06:39,453
I'm not stupid to not feel!

67
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,153
That you love me more, Tupe.

68
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:45,779
Me. Me.

69
00:06:57,481 --> 00:06:57,981
Greg...

70
00:07:03,694 --> 00:07:05,096
Greg, I love you.

71
00:07:06,772 --> 00:07:07,833
Do you understand?

72
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:13,208
I love the two of you.

73
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:17,183
I love you both.

74
00:07:24,156 --> 00:07:25,530
But do you love him more?

75
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,502
I'm going now.

76
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:01,147
Do you really love me?

77
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,913
Or do you love my father more?

78
00:08:05,523 --> 00:08:06,137
Come on...

79
00:08:06,613 --> 00:08:07,198
Tell me.

80
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:10,535
Tell it straight to my face.

81
00:08:20,537 --> 00:08:22,537
I love you so much,

82
00:08:23,429 --> 00:08:23,929
Greg.

83
00:08:28,084 --> 00:08:29,315
I love you more.

84
00:08:31,056 --> 00:08:33,056
I love you so much more.

85
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,643
Dad.

86
00:09:13,851 --> 00:09:15,196
I'm very, very sorry, dad.

87
00:09:18,597 --> 00:09:20,426
We never meant it to happen, dad.

88
00:09:21,939 --> 00:09:23,939
It was never my intention to hurt you.

89
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:27,929
You just did, son.

90
00:09:30,157 --> 00:09:30,990
You just did.

91
00:09:32,636 --> 00:09:34,067
Dad, believe me.

92
00:09:35,838 --> 00:09:37,269
It just happened, dad.

93
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,207
It just happened.

94
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:43,959
And I can't justify it, dad.

95
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:46,077
Dad...

96
00:09:47,137 --> 00:09:48,000
I love you, dad.

97
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:51,965
I love Tupe.

98
00:09:53,655 --> 00:09:54,516
What now?

99
00:09:55,284 --> 00:09:57,284
I'm your son, please.

100
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,488
Does he love you?

101
00:10:10,048 --> 00:10:11,109
Very much, dad.

102
00:10:28,443 --> 00:10:29,048
But...

103
00:10:31,334 --> 00:10:32,793
Why does it have to be him?

104
00:10:36,771 --> 00:10:40,024
Didn't you tell me
there are a lot of guys out there?

105
00:10:42,355 --> 00:10:44,156
Why does it have to be Tupe?

106
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:49,589
Terry...

107
00:10:50,852 --> 00:10:52,824
Don't give me that "Terry" Terry"!

108
00:10:53,755 --> 00:10:55,755
Answer my question!

109
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,171
ARE YOU F*CKING MY HUSBAND?

110
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:03,358
Sometimes.

111
00:11:25,609 --> 00:11:27,609
Are you the only one?

112
00:11:30,994 --> 00:11:33,848
Are you the only one
who has the right to be happy?

113
00:11:38,145 --> 00:11:38,864
You too, dad.

114
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:44,733
I also want you to be happy, dad.

115
00:11:46,124 --> 00:11:46,900
But dad,

116
00:11:47,276 --> 00:11:49,276
it was really not my intention.

117
00:11:52,689 --> 00:11:54,689
You're the best dad ever.

118
00:11:55,561 --> 00:11:57,419
I could never ask for more.

119
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,730
And you are my best son.

120
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:13,162
My one and only.

121
00:12:16,465 --> 00:12:17,127
I wi...

122
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,130
I will want what's best for you.

123
00:12:25,182 --> 00:12:27,182
I couldn't ask anything more.

124
00:12:28,868 --> 00:12:30,612
Not for my sake,

125
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:32,525
but yours.

126
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:37,768
Your happiness always comes first.

127
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,740
That's why I'm giving you Tupe.

128
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:54,545
You know, maybe we were really not
meant for each other.

129
00:12:58,204 --> 00:13:00,289
He was never really mine, to begin with.

130
00:13:02,962 --> 00:13:04,791
Maybe, I just assumed.

131
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,218
I just don't have enough courage to ask.

132
00:13:12,432 --> 00:13:14,432
If he really loved me.

133
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,420
(Malvin Drake's 'Bakit Naman Iyong Akin Pa' starts playing)

134
00:13:41,797 --> 00:13:42,297
(Door opens)

135
00:14:09,337 --> 00:14:09,999
Rich...

136
00:14:13,231 --> 00:14:14,064
Rich...

137
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:27,620
Rich, forgive me.

138
00:14:33,124 --> 00:14:35,608
It wasn't my intention to fall for your son.

139
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,179
I left you so that you can think.

140
00:14:51,532 --> 00:14:53,731
Not to leave me for another guy!

141
00:15:08,111 --> 00:15:09,286
Ouch.. Ouch..

142
00:15:09,353 --> 00:15:10,223
What are you doing?

143
00:15:10,506 --> 00:15:12,677
You're annoying. I'm having a moment here.

144
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:16,469
You know, I have more Maricel Soriano lines.
But I didn't get to use them.

145
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,544
I'm already there, about to cry.

146
00:15:18,636 --> 00:15:20,636
You're annoying, you're not reading the script.

147
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:22,234
Oh my...

148
00:15:22,832 --> 00:15:23,693
Just stop.

149
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,159
Are you sure that...

150
00:15:40,153 --> 00:15:41,185
you're okay?

151
00:15:43,415 --> 00:15:44,646
That we're okay?

152
00:15:47,728 --> 00:15:48,988
Do I have a choice?

153
00:15:49,946 --> 00:15:51,804
If I break down here.

154
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:56,425
Will something happen
if I start to ugly cry and beg for you?

155
00:16:02,366 --> 00:16:03,398
You know what?

156
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,039
I love my son more than I love myself.

157
00:16:14,481 --> 00:16:16,253
Love him, okay?

158
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:18,270
Hey...

159
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:23,649
Don't hurt him.

160
00:16:24,356 --> 00:16:24,990
Okay?

161
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:45,873
What's up, dad?

162
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,926
We'll be going now.
We're going to be late on our flight.

163
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:53,727
- Enjoy, okay?
- Dad, are you sure you're okay alone here?

164
00:16:53,728 --> 00:16:55,643
What are you talking about?
Don't worry.

165
00:16:55,644 --> 00:16:56,591
I'm okay.

166
00:16:56,803 --> 00:16:58,803
Sir Rich, here are your vitamins.

167
00:16:58,994 --> 00:17:00,709
You might forget them again.

168
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,714
And also...

169
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,442
you should double-check those who are ringing the doorbell.
They might not be applicants.

170
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,570
Don't let them in right away.

171
00:17:07,571 --> 00:17:08,859
Yes, sir Tupe.

172
00:17:10,307 --> 00:17:12,307
What now? You're going to be late.

173
00:17:12,433 --> 00:17:13,807
Go now! Just go now.

174
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:15,723
Don't mind me. I'm okay.

175
00:17:16,432 --> 00:17:18,432
What's important is that you two enjoy your trip. Okay?

176
00:17:19,274 --> 00:17:21,274
- Bye, dad!
- Bye, sir!

177
00:17:21,961 --> 00:17:23,961
Take care. Good bye!

178
00:17:27,645 --> 00:17:29,503
- Are you excited?
- Yes.

179
00:17:29,503 --> 00:17:31,503
Let's go! We might miss our flight!

180
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:38,383
I'll just put these at the back, okay?

181
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:40,457
Okay. I'll put mine here.

182
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,294
Let's go...

183
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,086
Are you sure you didn't forget anything?

184
00:17:49,325 --> 00:17:50,585
What about you? Did you forget something?

185
00:17:50,783 --> 00:17:51,283
None.

186
00:17:52,202 --> 00:17:53,490
- Love you.
- Love you.

187
00:17:56,347 --> 00:17:57,550
Let's go...

188
00:18:25,036 --> 00:18:27,634
"Looking for a male helper with abs.
Women are not allowed. They're poison!"

189
00:20:45,075 --> 00:20:45,575
Hello, dude!

190
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,985
It's beautiful here. I'll show you.

191
00:20:51,892 --> 00:20:52,668
Chilling like a king there!

192
00:20:53,788 --> 00:20:55,126
You're too at home in our house.

193
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,241
It seems you're too comfortable here.

194
00:20:57,469 --> 00:20:58,643
Do we have a problem here?

195
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,459
"What did I did?"

196
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:02,939
Stop talking in English, Cal!

197
00:21:03,965 --> 00:21:05,083
My ears are bleeding.

198
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,205
I'm just adapting to your social lives.

199
00:21:07,755 --> 00:21:09,499
Trying hard elitists.

200
00:21:09,499 --> 00:21:10,751
Can you just stop pretending?

201
00:21:11,164 --> 00:21:12,225
We know what you're doing.

202
00:21:12,664 --> 00:21:14,066
You're a conman!

203
00:21:14,443 --> 00:21:15,731
You're just going to hurt Rich.

204
00:21:16,165 --> 00:21:17,339
What are you talking about?

205
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:19,037
You have the guts to accuse me?

206
00:21:19,492 --> 00:21:21,793
You're now with the son
after you got the father.

207
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:22,479
Jerk!

208
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:25,242
Don't compare me with the things
you've done to Richard.

209
00:21:26,196 --> 00:21:27,513
Let's get things straight.

210
00:21:29,047 --> 00:21:31,645
I don't like how you act in this house.

211
00:21:32,463 --> 00:21:33,837
My father accepted you, yes.

212
00:21:34,887 --> 00:21:37,501
But don't act like you're somebody important.

213
00:21:37,639 --> 00:21:39,042
Because you're just an outcast here.

214
00:21:39,262 --> 00:21:40,607
Aren't we just the same?

215
00:21:41,123 --> 00:21:42,269
Just picked up from the ground.

216
00:21:42,493 --> 00:21:43,497
You're rude!

217
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
(The Story of Rich, Tupe and Greg will continue
in Papa, What is Love? Season 2.)
