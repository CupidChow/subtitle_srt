00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,300
(Previously On Papa, What Is Love?)

2
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:10,459
Sorry, sir.

3
00:00:17,175 --> 00:00:20,511
I'm really like that every morning since puberty.

4
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,835
It's actually a problem.

5
00:00:23,836 --> 00:00:26,761
Because I need to relax first before waking up.

6
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,747
What are you saying?

7
00:00:30,172 --> 00:00:32,172
All of us men are like that.

8
00:00:32,795 --> 00:00:33,459
But...

9
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:37,629
yours is extraordinary.

10
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,679
Too scandalous!

11
00:00:40,015 --> 00:00:40,988
It's like...

12
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:42,645
it's challenging someone.

13
00:00:43,463 --> 00:00:44,744
I'm embarrassed.

14
00:00:47,849 --> 00:00:49,181
Why are you embarrassed?

15
00:00:49,498 --> 00:00:50,214
You know...

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,638
be embarrassed if you don't have anything to be proud of.

17
00:00:56,302 --> 00:00:58,302
Then, I should be proud.

18
00:01:04,762 --> 00:01:06,300
Are you sure?

19
00:01:09,014 --> 00:01:09,935
I'm sure.

20
00:01:34,391 --> 00:01:35,055
Tupe,

21
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:40,001
I have something I want to ask.

22
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:43,236
What's that?

23
00:01:44,983 --> 00:01:45,802
Papa,

24
00:01:47,532 --> 00:01:49,532
what is love?

25
00:01:53,272 --> 00:01:54,707
You're corny.

26
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,708
I'm not corny. That's true!

27
00:01:58,474 --> 00:02:00,474
What the fuck, dad?

28
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,800
(Papa, What Is Love?)

29
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,400
(Episode 4)
(Three's A Crowd)

30
00:05:29,734 --> 00:05:31,734
You're not even embarrassed.

31
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,950
That was too much, dad.

32
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,160
Keep your voice down.

33
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,559
You're making a scene.

34
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:38,496
Dad!

35
00:05:39,618 --> 00:05:41,618
There are other options out there.

36
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:43,009
I'm fine.

37
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,860
Just let me be.

38
00:05:45,266 --> 00:05:46,264
I'm happy.

39
00:05:48,702 --> 00:05:49,202
Son...

40
00:05:49,203 --> 00:05:49,703
Dad.

41
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:52,038
Aren't you too old for this shit?

42
00:05:52,443 --> 00:05:53,878
I don't see anything wrong.

43
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:55,358
With a helper?

44
00:05:56,214 --> 00:05:56,827
I mean...

45
00:05:56,828 --> 00:05:58,623
There's nothing wrong if he's a helper.

46
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,000
But... Dad.

47
00:06:00,145 --> 00:06:01,580
Look, he's too young for you.

48
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:02,965
Again, there's nothing wrong.

49
00:06:02,965 --> 00:06:04,246
I don't see anything wrong with this.

50
00:06:04,247 --> 00:06:05,605
He's almost the same age as me.

51
00:06:06,001 --> 00:06:08,001
I'm not saying that it's wrong.

52
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,558
And I'm fine with you being in a relationship.

53
00:06:10,887 --> 00:06:14,094
But I don't have plans of seeing you having sex.

54
00:06:14,491 --> 00:06:15,592
I'm sorry, son.

55
00:06:16,195 --> 00:06:17,399
But I think...

56
00:06:17,895 --> 00:06:18,970
Tupe is my boyfriend now.

57
00:06:19,952 --> 00:06:21,027
WHAT?!

58
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,261
Come on.

59
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,414
Let's eat.

60
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:36,167
This one looks good.

61
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,414
Boss.

62
00:06:42,261 --> 00:06:43,285
Let's eat.

63
00:06:46,568 --> 00:06:47,464
Eat your food.

64
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,683
Just eat your food.

65
00:07:03,628 --> 00:07:04,318
Go on,

66
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:05,399
eat your food.

67
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:09,459
Pst!

68
00:07:09,604 --> 00:07:10,345
Is it money?

69
00:07:11,496 --> 00:07:12,880
Is it money that you want?

70
00:07:15,713 --> 00:07:17,790
Everybody needs money now.

71
00:07:18,926 --> 00:07:21,054
But if you're thinking I'm with Rich
because of his money?

72
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,203
No.

73
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:24,270
RICH?

74
00:07:24,518 --> 00:07:25,388
What the f*ck!

75
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:26,198
What are you two?

76
00:07:26,497 --> 00:07:27,418
A love team?

77
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:29,539
I'm sorry.

78
00:07:30,444 --> 00:07:32,829
But Rich told me that you're a pansexual.

79
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:34,365
So?

80
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:36,834
I thought you would be more open-minded.

81
00:07:36,835 --> 00:07:37,962
So what?

82
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:44,942
Whether you believe it or not,

83
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:48,299
I can never do to Rich whatever you are thinking.

84
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:52,067
Your father is a good person.

85
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:51,143
DAD!

86
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:24,165
Help us, sir!

87
00:09:29,723 --> 00:09:30,285
Are you okay?

88
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:31,608
What happened?

89
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:36,999
What happened, son?

90
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I got muscle cramps, dad. It hurts.

91
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,150
Look at what happened...

92
00:09:47,686 --> 00:09:49,481
Luckily, Tupe was there.

93
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,998
I still hate him.

94
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,137
Son...

95
00:09:55,932 --> 00:09:57,932
Please give him a chance, okay?

96
00:10:01,527 --> 00:10:02,602
Please?

97
00:10:04,874 --> 00:10:05,615
For me?

98
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,623
Tupe...

99
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,417
Greg has something to tell you.

100
00:10:24,133 --> 00:10:25,748
Thank you for...

101
00:10:26,229 --> 00:10:28,229
saving me yesterday.

102
00:10:28,903 --> 00:10:30,000
That's nothing, boss.

103
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:31,102
It's okay.

104
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:32,284
And...

105
00:10:32,513 --> 00:10:34,513
Don't call me boss.

106
00:10:34,723 --> 00:10:36,000
Just call me Greg.

107
00:10:38,942 --> 00:10:39,555
Greg.

108
00:10:43,694 --> 00:10:44,410
Let's eat?

109
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:46,273
Let's continue eating.

110
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,353
Are you sure you don't want me there?

111
00:11:43,071 --> 00:11:43,864
Baby boy,

112
00:11:43,865 --> 00:11:44,838
what are you talking about?

113
00:11:45,146 --> 00:11:46,581
This is just a business trip, okay?

114
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,350
And I can't bring you there anyway.

115
00:11:49,457 --> 00:11:50,610
I won't be able to make time for you.

116
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,557
I will be too busy.

117
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,394
And I'll be gone for four days only.

118
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:55,429
- Dad!
- But I want to take care of you.

119
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,225
You forgot your medications.

120
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:58,840
Here.

121
00:11:59,054 --> 00:12:00,129
Thank you, son.

122
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,325
You two...

123
00:12:04,796 --> 00:12:06,642
Don't kill each other while I'm gone.

124
00:12:06,764 --> 00:12:08,764
I want to see you both alive
and breathing after four days.

125
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:09,984
Of course, dad.

126
00:12:09,985 --> 00:12:10,485
Okay?

127
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,650
Good bye.

128
00:12:13,828 --> 00:12:14,775
Take care, okay?

129
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:15,415
Take care, dad.

130
00:12:16,487 --> 00:12:17,023
Bye.

131
00:12:17,477 --> 00:12:17,977
Bye.

132
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,041
Take care.

133
00:16:15,771 --> 00:16:16,410
Tupe?

134
00:16:16,997 --> 00:16:18,000
Is that you, Tupe?

135
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,261
Mother f*cker! F*ck!

136
00:16:31,705 --> 00:16:33,114
Why are you naked, Tupe?

137
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:37,840
I slept right after I took a bath
but I heard loud noises here.

138
00:16:38,678 --> 00:16:40,267
And why are you naked?

139
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,433
I saw a rat. I'm afraid of rats.

140
00:16:45,717 --> 00:16:47,717
Looks like you already caught the rat.

141
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,101
What about you?

142
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,350
Why don't you catch your rat?
