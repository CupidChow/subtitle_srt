1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,991
(Previously On Papa, What Is Love?)
Are those for me?

2
00:00:03,651 --> 00:00:04,488
Sure, sir.

3
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:06,381
Sure, sir?

4
00:00:07,536 --> 00:00:09,536
I just picked those from your neighbor.

5
00:00:09,748 --> 00:00:12,060
Their dog ruined their garden.

6
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,031
Was planning to give it to your wife.

7
00:00:14,032 --> 00:00:15,096
For good vibes.

8
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:18,545
Are you an applicant?

9
00:00:18,545 --> 00:00:19,155
Yes, sir!

10
00:00:19,156 --> 00:00:20,163
Christopher Danan, sir.

11
00:00:20,164 --> 00:00:21,795
You can call me Tupe for short.

12
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:25,215
I thought a suitor.

13
00:00:25,282 --> 00:00:27,083
Now that I'm single.

14
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:28,228
Sir?

15
00:00:28,503 --> 00:00:29,255
Nothing.

16
00:00:30,057 --> 00:00:31,858
Thank you for the...

17
00:00:31,971 --> 00:00:32,666
flowers.

18
00:00:33,714 --> 00:00:35,714
The only condition is...

19
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,479
you need to be a stay-in.

20
00:00:37,612 --> 00:00:39,782
And of course, you attend to everything I need.

21
00:00:42,305 --> 00:00:45,042
Also, I increased your salary.

22
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:49,805
That's triple the standard pay of a helper.

23
00:00:51,442 --> 00:00:52,364
Anyway,

24
00:00:52,818 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm expecting only the best.

25
00:00:58,117 --> 00:01:00,117
Am I hired, sir?

26
00:01:02,331 --> 00:01:04,331
I am hired, sir?

27
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:09,435
Thank you, sir.

28
00:01:10,823 --> 00:01:12,681
Thank you, sir.

29
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,078
Looks like you know your way with flowers.

30
00:01:21,172 --> 00:01:22,151
Yes, sir.

31
00:01:22,152 --> 00:01:23,812
Because my mother is a "plantita"

32
00:01:23,813 --> 00:01:25,813
that's why I know my way with flowers and plants.

33
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,800
(Papa, What Is Love?)

34
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,500
(Episode 3)
(Beautiful Boy)

35
00:04:24,454 --> 00:04:25,745
Are you okay?

36
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:13,945
Thank you, sir.

37
00:05:31,503 --> 00:05:32,624
One more, okay?

38
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:42,175
Rich...

39
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,594
I'm sorry.

40
00:05:45,483 --> 00:05:47,058
I'm embarrassed.

41
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:50,136
I should be the one taking care of you.

42
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:53,197
But...

43
00:05:54,106 --> 00:05:56,106
Thank you very much.

44
00:05:59,246 --> 00:06:01,246
You should eat more.

45
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:03,367
Get better, okay?

46
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,601
Be careful...

47
00:06:12,723 --> 00:06:14,042
Can you move?

48
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,413
Wait...

49
00:06:15,571 --> 00:06:16,919
I'm sorry, sir.

50
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:33,894
In your room, sir?

51
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:34,419
Yeah.

52
00:06:36,456 --> 00:06:38,456
Be careful...

53
00:07:28,043 --> 00:07:29,164
Sorry...

54
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,230
You were having chills last night.

55
00:07:33,131 --> 00:07:35,641
Even with a lot of blankets,

56
00:07:35,642 --> 00:07:37,302
you're still freezing.

57
00:07:37,554 --> 00:07:38,902
That's why...

58
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:41,149
I hugged you.

59
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,450
Thank you, sir.

60
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,634
Sir?

61
00:07:58,886 --> 00:08:00,177
Sorry, sir.

62
00:08:10,994 --> 00:08:14,213
I'm always like that since I hit puberty.

63
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:17,226
It's actually my problem.

64
00:08:17,523 --> 00:08:20,430
Because I need to relax before waking up.

65
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:23,360
What are you saying?

66
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:25,814
All of us men are like that.

67
00:08:26,525 --> 00:08:27,476
But...

68
00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:30,874
yours is extraordinary.

69
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,429
Too scandalous.

70
00:08:33,736 --> 00:08:34,687
It's like...

71
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:36,828
It's challenging someone.

72
00:08:37,175 --> 00:08:38,749
I'm embarrassed.

73
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:41,000
What...

74
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,255
Why would you be embarrassed?

75
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,349
You know...

76
00:08:44,605 --> 00:08:46,066
you should be embarrassed if

77
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,067
you don't have something to be proud of.

78
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,364
Then, I guess I should be proud.

79
00:12:31,975 --> 00:12:34,174
It's been a long time since I've done this.

80
00:12:38,226 --> 00:12:39,092
Drink?

81
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:44,084
To emote...

82
00:12:44,594 --> 00:12:46,793
like someone from a soap opera show.

83
00:12:52,473 --> 00:12:53,792
Sometimes, everything's like...

84
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:57,055
so lonely.

85
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:02,400
Especially when you're down with a problem.

86
00:13:05,505 --> 00:13:07,000
It's like...

87
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,031
it's better to drown yourself with loneliness.

88
00:13:14,412 --> 00:13:17,008
Everything's suffocating you,

89
00:13:21,457 --> 00:13:23,570
especially when it's like this

90
00:13:26,665 --> 00:13:28,069
night time,

91
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,601
and dark.

92
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,818
You know...

93
00:13:40,464 --> 00:13:42,464
I understand what you're saying.

94
00:17:05,249 --> 00:17:05,944
Sorry.

95
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,578
Are you sure about this?

96
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:27,720
I'm sure.

97
00:18:02,455 --> 00:18:04,455
You are so beautiful, Tupe.

98
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:08,667
You are a beautiful boy.

99
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,000
Easy...

100
00:18:56,373 --> 00:18:58,373
Good morning, Rich.

101
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:04,910
Good morning.

102
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:07,808
Finally,

103
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,101
there's no effort.

104
00:19:11,278 --> 00:19:13,278
You now call me Rich.

105
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,340
That's right.

106
00:19:15,459 --> 00:19:17,459
There's like butterflies in my stomach.

107
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:18,730
It's like...

108
00:19:19,127 --> 00:19:21,326
my womb is shaking.

109
00:19:31,197 --> 00:19:31,751
Tupe,

110
00:19:34,739 --> 00:19:36,739
I have something to ask.

111
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,089
What's that?

112
00:19:41,928 --> 00:19:43,000
Papa...

113
00:19:44,508 --> 00:19:45,912
what is love?

114
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:50,981
You're corny.

115
00:19:51,236 --> 00:19:53,236
I'm not corny. That's true!

116
00:19:56,879 --> 00:19:58,595
Why? What I said is true.

117
00:19:58,718 --> 00:19:59,782
Papa...

118
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,916
what is love?

119
00:20:14,471 --> 00:20:16,471
That feels good.

120
00:20:20,546 --> 00:20:21,809
You want that?

121
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,899
What the fuck, dad?
