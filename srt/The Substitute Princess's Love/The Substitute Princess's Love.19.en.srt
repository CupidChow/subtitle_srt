00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,330
Yi Fu, listen.

191
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,270
If you really want to protect Prince Jin,

192
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,830
you have to

193
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,260
get rid of this child.

194
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:31,750
Yes,

195
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,430
Your Grace.

196
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,270
Brother,

197
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,350
these are the people I caught from the marriage alliance team.

198
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,140
Look carefully.

199
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,750
Is this girl your princess?

200
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,940
-Yes.
-Yes.

201
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,790
Yes.

202
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,390
Come with me.

203
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,540
It's just a portrait of a random girl.

204
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,740
But they said she is the princess.

205
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,370
So no one in the marriage alliance team

206
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,990
has ever seen

207
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,420
the so-called princess.

208
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:44,140
Brother,

209
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,780
this is a serious matter.

210
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,900
I don't think Liang State has the guts to make trouble.

211
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,180
Is something wrong?

212
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,650
I've sent someone to ask around.

213
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,940
On the route between the capital city of Liang State and Weicheng City,

214
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,290
few people saw the marriage alliance team.

215
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,590
Until in Weicheng City,

216
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,740
the team drew much attention and was seen by others.

217
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:58,980
I think

218
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,910
maybe the marriage alliance team

219
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,860
didn't depart from the capital city of Liang State.

220
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,740
They just created a team temporarily in Weicheng City.

221
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,860
That's strange.

222
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,750
How could the princess of Liang State

223
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,230
skip the route between Liang State and Weicheng City?

224
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,030
There's something more strange.

225
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,550
I went to the post today to test the envoy.

226
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,310
I found

227
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,470
there are many loopholes.

228
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,540
I think this marriage alliance team

229
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,420
is very suspicious.

230
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,150
By the way,

231
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,270
have you found out about Zuo Shuangzhi's background?

232
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,260
Zuo Shuangzhi is indeed a princess of Liang State.

233
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,590
But when she was young, her mother's family was exiled due to a serious crime.

234
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,460
She was not favored in the imperial palace.

235
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,910
There's nothing wrong with her identity.

236
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,870
Then what on earth do they want to do?

237
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,180
Since the marriage alliance team came to the capital,

238
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,950
Nanzhu Pavilion has disappeared.

239
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,470
They didn't come all the way here to form a marriage alliance

240
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,990
just to protect some people of Nanzhu Pavilion, right?

241
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,500
Brother,

242
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,290
I'll ask His Majesty for the letter of credence to verify it.

243
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,030
Forming a marriage alliance is a serious matter.

244
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,940
If Liang State dares to cheat in terms of this,

245
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,140
they are really despicable.

246
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,260
Brother, be careful.

247
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,300
Steward Yi,

248
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,150
the medicine is not ready yet.

249
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,590
Her Highness doesn't like bitter things.

250
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,710
Go get some preserved fruits.

251
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:32,620
Yes.

252
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:04,940
[Virtue and Benevolence]

253
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,870
Her Highness had two meals today.

254
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,420
Her appetite

255
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,230
is better than before.

256
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,460
She ate much food at lunch.

257
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,460
According to the leftovers,

258
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,070
Her Highness likes sour and sweet dishes recently.

259
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,390
Sour and sweet dishes?

260
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,820
Chefs in Jiangnan

261
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,220
are good at making sweet dishes.

262
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,410
Invite some over tomorrow.

263
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,150
Yes, Your Highness.

264
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,310
She is thin and small.

265
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,350
She

266
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,300
is still like a child,

267
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,390
and pregnancy is not an easy thing.

268
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,830
But there is nothing I can do.

269
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:53,820
Your Highness,

270
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:54,740
this...

271
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:56,820
You may leave.

272
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,510
Yes.

273
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,430
Your Highness,

274
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,180
it's time to take your medicine.

275
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,099
Tao,

276
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,540
what is the medicine I take every day?

277
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,310
I don't know.

278
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,210
When the imperial physician came to check your pulse last time,

279
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,380
he prescribed medicine for half a month.

280
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,300
Every day, Steward Yi

281
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,060
would ask the men in the kitchen to prepare the medicine and deliver it here.

282
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,460
Are you feeling better?

283
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,390
I'm not sick,

284
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,140
but I have to take such bitter medicine.

285
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:47,950
Tao.

286
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,340
Yes.

287
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,390
Do something for me.

288
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,750
I think something is wrong.

289
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,870
Your Highness, just tell me.

290
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,150
What do you want me to do?

291
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,510
Okay, I understand.

292
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,460
Do it secretly.

293
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,750
Do it when His Highness is not in the mansion.

294
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,870
Yes, I understand.

295
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:42,670
Sir,

296
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,300
do you want to see Her Highness?

297
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,410
Okay.

298
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,740
Let me help you.

299
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,630
How can you help me?

300
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,190
Just wait and see.

301
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,100
Are you crazy?

302
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:07,820
This is Prince Jin's Mansion. How dare you come in here?

303
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,060
I think there is something wrong

304
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,020
with what happened today.

305
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,590
I have to come to see you.

306
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,820
Wen Ye doesn't trust me.

307
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,900
He must be suspicious after he met the envoy.

308
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,180
I didn't expect at this time,

309
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,310
he still has the mood to care about these details.

310
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,070
I told you this plan wouldn't work.

311
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,070
You underestimated Wen Ye.

312
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,020
No. You can't stay here.

313
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,030
Go with me.

314
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,220
Catch the assassins!

315
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,060
-Find a place to hide.
-Catch the assassins!

316
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,100
I'm gonna go out to see what's going on.

317
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,730
[Virtue and Benevolence]

318
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,670
There are many assassins.

319
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,830
Hurry! Catch the assassins!

320
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:43,320
[Virtue and Benevolence]

321
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,710
Over there. Over there.

322
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,710
Hurry! Catch the assassins!

323
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,110
Run faster! Run faster!

324
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,340
Your Highness, why did you come here?

325
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,180
Assassins!

326
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:00,740
Hurry! Over there!

327
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,460
Have you seen the assassins?

328
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:08,780
No.

329
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,180
But I saw them

330
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,380
coming to Xingyue Pavilion.

331
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,620
You must be mistaken.

332
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:21,980
Go on with your things.

333
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:23,500
Don't mind me.

334
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,390
The assassins will show up

335
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,620
when they think it's safe outside.

336
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,340
I'm just gonna sit here

337
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:35,830
to wait for them to show up.

338
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,630
Come out.

339
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,990
It was just a false alarm.

340
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,710
Why are there assassins in the mansion all of a sudden?

341
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,870
Because Wen Ye put on a play

342
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,660
in order to stay in Xingyue Pavilion.

343
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,220
I didn't expect that an ambitious man

344
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,670
would do such a childish thing

345
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,980
for a woman.

346
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,130
It's none of your business.

347
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,550
Your task is to find the imperial edict as soon as possible.

348
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,580
How come it's not my business?

349
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,470
If I can win Wen Ye's heart,

350
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,890
it'll help a lot with our task.

351
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,300
His softness is because of another woman.

352
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,900
You can't even get close to him,

353
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,770
not to mention winning his heart.

354
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,260
I will succeed soon.

355
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,220
Soon,

356
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,050
I'll be the only princess in the mansion.

357
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:26,940
Zuo Shuangzhi,

358
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,660
wake up.

359
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,340
You are an assassin with a sword.

360
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,620
Do you really think

361
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,900
you are a lady from a noble family?

362
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,910
Why do you have to stay by Wen Ye's side?

363
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,140
Answer me.

364
00:21:59,030 --> 00:21:59,700
Tang Ti,

365
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,510
is it that important?

366
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,830
It doesn't matter as long as I can complete the task, right?

367
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,100
This is a swamp.

368
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,500
You can't sink deeper.

369
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,650
Even if you fail to complete the task, you can still make a comeback.

370
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,180
Go with me.

371
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,420
Even if I have to risk my life,

372
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,510
I'll take you out safely.

373
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,060
Really?

374
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,660
Have I ever lied to you all these years?

375
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,500
But aren't you a man sent by my father to spy on me?

376
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,020
If I'm disloyal,

377
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,220
you can kill me immediately.

378
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,740
If that's true, you would have died countless times.

379
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:37,860
You're right.

380
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,780
No matter how dangerous

381
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,060
or risky my decision is,

382
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,270
you've always supported me without any complaints or regrets.

383
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,510
If you're worried that you'll be punished if you fail to complete the task,

384
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,510
we don't have to go back to Liang State.

385
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,660
We can go to the north or south.

386
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,340
We can go to a place where no one knows us

387
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:01,670
and start over.

388
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,140
Will you protect me

389
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,550
no matter what happens?

390
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,310
Yes.

391
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:12,780
You won't regret it?

392
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:13,690
I won't.

393
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,220
But once we go out,

394
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,620
everything will be in vain.

395
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,830
Both Liang State and Wen Ye will hunt us down.

396
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,700
It doesn't matter

397
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,070
to you?

398
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,190
Zuo Shuangzhi,

399
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,460
I want you to live.

400
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:45,420
Okay.

401
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,110
Tomorrow,

402
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,710
wait for me at Huaifeng Pavilion.

403
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,430
Help me.

404
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:52,710
Okay?

405
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,430
I'll help you.

406
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,270
[Folk Strange Tales]

407
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,830
What books do you usually read?

408
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,910
Some unimportant books.

409
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,500
They are all there.

410
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,130
I don't think you'll like them.

411
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:56,780
Your Highness,

412
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,180
the assassins haven't shown up yet.

413
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,470
They must have escaped from the mansion.

414
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,380
Not necessarily.

415
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,500
I think the assassins

416
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,950
are very cunning.

417
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:18,910
But Your Highness,

418
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,220
I'm going to sleep.

419
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:23,770
How long are you going to stay?

420
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,630
Are you chasing me away?

421
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,060
Your Highness,

422
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,540
are you going to sleep here?

423
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:46,630
Forget it.

424
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,110
Help yourself, Your Highness.

425
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,170
Your Highness,

426
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,900
are you hiding something from me?

427
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,100
No matter what it is

428
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,060
or what the reason is,

429
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:31,940
can you tell me?

430
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:39,590
In the future.

431
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,140
In the future, you'll know.

432
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:46,750
Rest early.

433
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:19,700
Look, Your Highness.

434
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,700
This is a surprise I prepared for you.

435
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:22,710
Do you like it?

436
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,270
Your ordinary tent

437
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,190
has turned into a wonderful place to enjoy flowers under the starry sky.

438
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:35,820
In my life,

439
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,470
I've never hurt anyone,

440
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,130
except you.

441
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:47,780
Who is it?

442
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,020
It's me.

443
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,140
Why did you come

444
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:51,940
at this hour?

445
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,270
I have something important to tell you.

446
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,110
Tell me tomorrow.

447
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,830
It'll be too late if I tell you tomorrow.

448
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,140
Come in.

449
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,140
What are you...

450
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,270
Your Highness,

451
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,390
I've been hiding something from you for a long time.

452
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,810
I'm guilty and I deserve to die.

453
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,300
But after thinking about it,

454
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,140
whether you blame me or not,

455
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,430
I'm going to tell you the truth.

456
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:30,900
What happened?

457
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:37,900
What are you doing?
