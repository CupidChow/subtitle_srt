[Episode 7]

4
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,930
So beautiful.

5
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:50,539
Your Highness.

6
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,660
You said there was a female ghost on the back hill.

7
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,979
Has anyone ever seen her?

8
00:01:59,180 --> 00:01:59,820
Maybe.

9
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,180
I've never seen her anyway.

10
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,300
That's good.

11
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:08,820
Why?

12
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,660
I'm afraid the female ghost will scare you.

13
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,579
I wonder

14
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,620
why the ghost hid in the back hill of my mansion.

15
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,340
Was she

16
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,980
trying to hurt someone?

17
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,140
Not necessarily.

18
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,860
Maybe she hid there because someone

19
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,180
was trying to hurt her.

20
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,380
Do you feel warm?

21
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,500
Yes.

22
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,940
Where do you want to go?

23
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,620
I want to...

24
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,580
It's up to you.

Let's just walk around for a while.

28
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:04,860
Okay.

♫The painter is busy with the drawing of a portrait♫

♫The oars on the boat go up and down gently♫

♫I sigh when I see a petal and its shadow on the river because they look like a couple♫

What's wrong with His Highness?

47
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,100
He's so gentle now. He shouldn't be.

48
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,220
His Highness is spoiling her but it is a trap.

49
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:19,940
A trap?

50
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,180
You mean His Highness is being so nice to her

51
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,300
that she will be less vigilant and give herself away?

52
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,220
Then Her Highness will be really hurt.

53
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,940
Now I feel sorry for Her Highness.

54
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,260
If she was really sent by the Shen family

55
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,500
to our mansion to hurt His Highness,

56
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,980
she doesn't deserve our sympathy.

57
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,530
This smells so good. I'll take one.

58
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,210
Okay.

59
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,540
It smells so good. I want one too.

60
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,220
Okay, please wait a moment.

61
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,780
I need to make one for my husband first.

62
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,260
Miss, what are you doing?

63
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,500
Sir, you weren't here just now.

64
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,940
So I am making one for myself.

65
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,740
I've even attracted many customers for you.

66
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,940
How can you make it smell so good?

67
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,900
It's because of my nanny's secret recipe.

68
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,020
Sir.

69
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,860
I've attracted many customers for you.

70
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,980
Shouldn't you give me some reward?

71
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,100
Of course. Please take it.

72
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,580
Sir, this is mine, right?

73
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,100
Here.

74
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:17,260
Your Highness.

75
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,060
It tastes better when it's still warm.

76
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,500
This is not meat.

77
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,659
It looks like fried meat, but it's not. It's called Fake Fried Meat.

78
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,180
This special snack is popular among ordinary people.

79
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,580
Some people can't afford meat,

80
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,140
so they cook gluten in a special way,

81
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,420
making it look like and taste like meat.

82
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:56,820
I can't tell that it's not meat

83
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,380
by just looking at it.

84
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,540
So,

85
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,060
sometimes,

86
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,380
what you see may not be true.

87
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,490
Your Highness,

88
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,740
will you get angry after you

89
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,900
eat this snack and realize it's not meat?

90
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,820
If people use gluten to make snacks and lie to customers

91
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,460
that it's meat, I will get angry.

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,870
♫You come from the mortal world♫

93
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,100
But if they just cannot afford meat

94
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,180
♫And laugh at me for not knowing about that world♫

95
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:24,860
and do not want to fool others,

96
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,460
I won't get angry about it.

97
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,020
♫You waved your hand with flowers♫

98
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,130
Really?

99
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,340
You're such a kind prince.

100
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,080
♫I see through the crowd♫

101
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:33,460
You're really a good person.

102
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,330
♫If I can just follow my heart♫

103
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,650
♫And let everything happen naturally♫

104
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,720
♫Only a few years to spend with you♫

105
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,050
♫Are far from enough♫

106
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:57,940
♫I got an unexpected period of time♫

107
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:02,500
♫It was worth it to wander in loneliness in the past on a horseback♫

108
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,620
Your Highness.

109
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:08,060
♫If it's a beautiful dream, what's wrong with going separate ways to our ends?♫

110
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,580
You've been keeping me company for so long today.

111
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,130
This is your reward.

112
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:14,410
♫Love is a reward, and I'm willing to wander if it lasts long♫

113
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:19,100
♫Because the flowers once bloomed, I won't forget them after seeing them♫

114
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,540
Your Highness, it's time to go to the royal palace.

115
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,930
♫Do you know this glance♫

116
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,980
Tonight's Lantern Festival is so lively.

117
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,210
If you want to have more fun here, just do it.

118
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:29,540
♫Is the gaze for us so far away?♫

119
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,420
Thank you, Your Highness.

120
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,060
Then,

121
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,180
see you later.

122
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,180
Wait.

123
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,460
Go.

124
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,300
Miss.

125
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:47,820
Miss.

126
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,220
Miss.

127
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,940
Will you buy it or not?

128
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,740
Be careful not to break it.

129
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,500
Who said I wouldn't buy it?

130
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,860
You're in a good mood. You even bought a pendant.

131
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,780
You can have it.

132
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,220
Can you tell me

133
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,340
between what I see and what I feel,

134
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,540
which one is true

135
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,220
and which one is false?

136
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,580
I think

137
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,020
what you see is true and what you hear about may be false.

138
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,140
Maybe both are true.

139
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,340
What you see

140
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,409
plus what you feel

141
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,380
is the complete truth.

142
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,940
But what if the two contradict each other?

143
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,500
Everything happens for a reason.

144
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,380
Some smart people invented Fake Fried Meat

145
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,900
because they were too poor to afford meat.

146
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,740
Maybe you haven't found the real reason

147
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,860
so what you see and what you feel contradict each other.

148
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,500
Nan Bo.

149
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,180
Follow Her Highness.

150
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,220
Let me know where she is going.

151
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,500
Okay.

152
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,340
Your Ladyship.

153
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,020
That girl is sick today.

154
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,770
So she didn't go to the royal palace to attend the banquet.

155
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,140
His Highness spent some time with her at the market.

156
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,180
She didn't

157
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,420
wear that outfit?

158
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,500
Go back to Prince's Mansion now.

159
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,540
Otherwise, they'll be suspicious of you.

160
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,460
I have another way.

161
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,660
Your Ladyship,

162
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,300
you have to save me.

163
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,620
His Highness forces me to drink the poison every day.

164
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,980
If I keep drinking it,

165
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,140
I'll be dead soon, Your Ladyship.

166
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,500
What are you doing?

167
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,420
Get up.

168
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,260
Hang in there for a few more days.

169
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,300
After Shen Keyi dies,

170
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,300
and we get the jade pendant,

171
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,290
I will find a way to get you back.

172
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,980
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

173
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,620
Madam, you have good taste.

174
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,380
It's our new design for this year.

175
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,740
Look at the red beans. They are so round and smooth.

176
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,740
And the magnets are unique.

177
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:05,820
You can buy two of them.

178
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,100
One for you and the other for your husband.

179
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,980
You'll make a perfect couple with the bracelets.

180
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,340
These bracelets are rare now.

181
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,220
Sir, how much are they?

182
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,980
If you like them, I'll sell them to you

183
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:18,900
for 100 coppers.

184
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,180
Sir.

185
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,780
The red beans and magnets

186
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,900
are not valuable.

187
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:25,900
How about

188
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,490
you sell them to me for 60 coppers?

189
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,020
No, I can't.

190
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,100
It would be a great loss for me if I do that.

191
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,540
How about 80 coppers?

192
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,740
Sir.

193
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,890
Today is the Lantern Festival.

194
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,140
How about you sell them to me for 66 coppers?

195
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,460
66 is an auspicious number.

196
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,500
I'll come here and buy something next time.

197
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,420
Fine, madam.

198
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,220
You are really good at bargaining.

199
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,500
Your husband is lucky

200
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,890
to have a thrifty wife like you.

201
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,940
My husband is the best husband in the world.

202
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,740
I am the one who should feel lucky.

203
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:56,440
-His Highness is the best husband in the world.
-He'll like the bracelet you picked for him.

204
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,750
Not necessarily.

205
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,500
But I still want to give it to him.

206
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,740
Thank you, sir.

207
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,610
[Mingren Dessert and Beverage Shop]

208
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,660
Your Highness, Your Highness.

209
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:06,740
Sanniang.

210
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,220
I'm Nian Sanniang, a servant of the Shen family.

211
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,780
It's the Lantern Festival today.

212
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,580
Her Ladyship heard that you didn't go to the royal palace for the banquet,

213
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,100
so she invites you to go back home and have a family dinner.

214
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,060
Her Ladyship missed you so much

215
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,060
so she sewed a sachet for you.

216
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,620
She said when you see this sachet,

217
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,540
you'll remember how it felt to be at home.

218
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,700
Let's go back to Shen Mansion now.

219
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:31,860
Let's go.

220
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,300
She is going back to Shen's mansion with a servant in the Shen family.

221
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,820
In this case,

222
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,300
do I still need to follow her?

223
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,180
Of course not.

224
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,140
I should go find His Highness.

225
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:48,180
That's the right thing to do.

226
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,660
Where is she now?

227
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,620
Sanniang.

228
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,860
How come you're a servant of the Shen family now?

229
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,660
Ke, I know it was inconvenient for you to speak with me.

230
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,260
You have to hide some things from His Highness.

231
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,460
So I made up an excuse.

232
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,570
Otherwise,

233
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,460
they wouldn't let you go with me.

234
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,540
Did my nanny ask you to come to see me?

235
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,340
Of course.

236
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,330
Your nanny escaped from Prime Minister's Mansion

237
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,460
and left the capital.

238
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,580
It's convenient for her to come to see you.

239
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,820
So she asked me to come to see you.

240
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,140
That's great.

241
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,860
I was wondering how to rescue Nanny.

242
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,580
Sanniang, we haven't seen each other for a long time.

243
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,540
How are you doing?

244
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,460
Are you still selling folding fans?

245
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,260
How is Uncle Zilin? Has he taken office?

246
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,980
You can do

247
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,060
what I told you to do before.

248
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:54,860
Your Ladyship.

249
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,930
What my husband's case?

250
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,260
After you finish your job,

251
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,860
your husband can go home.

252
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,130
We haven't sold folding fans for a long time.

253
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,940
Zilin

254
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,860
is a small official in the capital now.

255
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,100
We're doing well.

256
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,290
That's great.

257
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,140
Ke.

258
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,300
I need to leave now.

259
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,580
Your nanny is waiting for you in the suburb of the capital.

260
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,570
Okay, thank you.

261
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,260
Where are we going?

262
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,420
Why are we farther and farther from the official road?

263
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,820
Can you stop? I need to use the bathroom.

264
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,260
Don't worry, Madam.

265
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,180
We will arrive soon.

266
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,780
This wasn't stitched by Nanny.

267
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,090
[Ye]

268
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,540
Your Ladyship.

269
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,020
At His Lordship's study, I heard that

270
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,420
the murderer

271
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,540
was wandering around Qiyu Village in the suburb of the capital.

272
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,700
His Lordship has sent Commander Zhang and some soldiers to capture him.

273
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,420
Now that place

274
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,420
is in turmoil.

275
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,020
People might get killed easily.

276
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,460
If Shen Keyi

277
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,820
is accidentally killed there,

278
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,260
I can say

279
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,700
she is really unlucky

280
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,740
to encounter a mad killer.

281
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,060
Once she dies,

282
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,620
the jade pendant will be ours.

283
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,340
That's a brilliant idea, Your Ladyship.

284
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,020
It can solve two problems at the same time.

285
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,100
No.

286
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,220
It can solve three problems at the same time.

287
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,420
If someone needs to be held accountable for it,

288
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,900
we can say Prince Jin doesn't protect her.

289
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,380
It has nothing to do with the Shen family.

290
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,860
No matter whether they investigate it or not,

291
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,180
Prince Jin

292
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,700
will be blamed for the death of her wife.

293
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,500
Give me Prince Jin's jade pendant.

294
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,260
Did the Shen family send you to do this?

295
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,660
You are smart.

296
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,860
If you take away Prince Jin's jade pedant from me,

297
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,980
he will find you and get you severely punished.

298
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,500
Do you think someone is coming to save you?

299
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,420
Stop talking and give it to me.

300
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,490
Sir, please help me.

301
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,020
I fell into a trap.

302
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,420
It's really precious.

303
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:44,820
Your Highness.

304
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,100
I saw Her Highness getting on the carriage of the Shen family.

305
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,500
So I came back to tell you the news.

306
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,820
What is the Shen family up to?

307
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:55,900
Your Highness.

308
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,860
Do you want me to bring Her Highness back?

309
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,060
This village is so strange.

310
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,780
All the houses are closed.

311
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,260
There's no one else in this yard.

312
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,700
The mountain roads have been flooded. We can't go back now.

313
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,930
We have to spend the night here.

314
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:30,740
Okay.

315
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:31,980
Young Master, please.

316
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,180
Go.

317
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,500
Hurry up.

318
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,980
It smells so good.

319
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,700
Young Master.

320
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,500
You're amazing.

321
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,420
We hit the jackpot the first time we left the mountain.

322
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,940
Last time, you said we could wait at a jewelry shop

323
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,500
and find someone to rob. It really worked.

324
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:49,860
I know.

325
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,220
Look.

326
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,940
We've kidnapped this girl so we've got some rich man to blackmail.

327
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,700
The officials in the city are powerful.

328
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,660
And they use their power to take away the wealth of ordinary people.

329
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,220
People dare not get angry.

330
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,020
Now, we've kidnapped a girl from an official's family.

331
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,700
We can say we did something good for the ordinary people.

332
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:07,780
Young Master,

333
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:08,980
I have an idea.

334
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,900
Those officials are so bad.

335
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,580
Let's sell her after we get the money

336
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:18,900
Let her know

337
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,300
how it feels to be homeless.

338
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,980
She is a woman.

339
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,300
If she hasn't done anything bad, we can't hurt her.

340
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,970
Zhou Yu.

341
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,930
Big Boss told you not to watch too many operas.

342
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,820
You’re being too kind now.

343
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,610
The chicken is ready.

344
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:37,660
Come on, let's eat.

345
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,260
Girl.

346
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,380
You're lucky to be kidnapped by me.

347
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,300
Let me introduce myself.

348
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,460
My name is Zhou Yu.

349
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,500
I'm the young master of Tianhe Fortress.

350
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,300
Zhou, Z-H-O-U.

351
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,060
Yu, Y-U.

352
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,620
Get up.

353
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,340
I know Her Highness is not here.

354
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,660
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

355
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,100
She hasn't come back yet?

356
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,380
What did she tell you

357
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,180
before she left?

358
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,460
Nothing.

359
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,860
Her Highness just asked me to lie in bed.

360
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,700
You are quite loyal to her.

361
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,420
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

362
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,460
Light the lanterns outside.

363
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,300
So Her Highness can see clearly when she is back.

364
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:24,940
Yes.

365
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,780
What?

366
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,610
He failed to kill her and get the jade pendant?

367
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,380
And a bunch of bandits kidnapped her?

368
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,130
Your Ladyship.

369
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,140
What should we do now?

370
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,860
Those bandits are stuck in Qiyu Village now?

371
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:44,940
Yes.

372
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:49,980
Well.

373
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,020
We can't let Shen Keyi leave Qiyu Village.

374
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,210
Once she leaves,

375
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,860
it will be hard to control her.

376
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,580
But now she is kidnapped by the bandits.

377
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,140
Well.

378
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,260
Have the soldiers sent by His Lordship arrived in Qiyu Village?

379
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,340
Yes.

380
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,260
Contact my cousin, Commander Zhang.

381
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,060
Ask him to kill Shen Keyi once he gets the chance

382
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,780
and make people believe she is killed by those bandits.

383
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,860
Bandits

384
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,220
are all bad guys.

385
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,460
Although it didn't go as planned,

386
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,930
we can still

387
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,900
find someone to kill her.

388
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,580
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

389
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,540
Well...

390
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,220
Has she come back yet?

391
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,540
No.

392
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,540
Steward Yi.

393
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,620
Your Highness, what can I do for you?

394
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,660
It's about the Princess.

395
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,340
Your Highness.

396
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,060
I'll send a carriage

397
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,300
to Shen Mansion to bring Her Highness back.

398
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,700
Why?

399
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:44,980
If she wants to come back,

400
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,060
she can go herself.

401
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,020
If she wants to spend more time with the Shen family,

402
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,260
let her do it.

403
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,500
I'm okay with it.

404
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:53,690
Your Highness.

405
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,740
How about I go to Shen Mansion

406
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,820
and ask Her Highness when she will be back?

407
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,340
What are you doing?

408
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,980
Do I want her to come back so much?

409
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,740
So...

410
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,100
Your Highness, you mean...

411
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,100
I want to tell you

412
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,380
I'll stay at the army camp today.

413
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,620
If she comes back,

414
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,140
send someone to tell me.

415
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,730
Yes, Your Highness.

416
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,900
We don't have much food now.

417
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,500
It cannot last long.

418
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,620
We can't stay in this village

419
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,260
any longer.

420
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,660
From my observation,

421
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,220
there are entrances in the east and the south of the village.

422
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,620
But they are guarded by soldiers.

423
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,980
There's a forest in the north of the village.

424
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,220
And there's a cliff next to the forest.

425
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,180
The cliff seems steep.

426
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,580
It's very likely that it's not guarded by soldiers.

427
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,940
We can go down the cliff to the valley below

428
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,340
and then we can leave the village.

429
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,540
This is the only way we can leave here.

430
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,300
We can give it a try.

431
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,700
How about we start off at midnight tonight

432
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,090
so that there won't be any more trouble?

433
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:56,730
Okay.

434
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:57,460
I agree with you, Uncle Dao.

435
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,140
Guys, take some food with you.

436
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:00,580
Here.

437
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,620
I'm hungry.

438
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,260
Shut up.

439
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,340
It's none of my business.

440
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,940
We don't even have enough food for ourselves.

441
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,060
We have no food for you.

442
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,260
Da.

443
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,820
Bring her here.

444
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,370
Go.

445
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,020
Untie her hands.

446
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,300
Feed me.

447
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,820
It's said that rich people ask servants

448
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,300
to wait on them when they are eating and dressing.

449
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:40,780
Today,

450
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,460
I want to have such an experience too.

451
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,300
Feed me.

452
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:47,860
Okay.

453
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,140
Open your mouth.

454
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,100
Eat.

455
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,380
Eat.

456
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:57,700
Eat.

457
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,980
Eat more.

458
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,380
Do you know how to wait on people?

459
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,140
No.

460
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:18,740
Get out.

461
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,420
You are like a loyal dog.

462
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,060
How dare you say that?

463
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,820
Even if I were a dog,

464
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,460
I would be better than you who are a disloyal jerk.

465
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,700
You bastard.

466
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,700
You have a sharp tongue.

467
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:34,900
Unfortunately,

468
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,260
your master can never come back.

469
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,140
You can keep staying here to wait her,

470
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,540
but she can get you nothing.

471
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,620
What did you say?

472
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,260
Why can't Her Highness come back?

473
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,990
[Xingyue Pavilion]

474
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,260
Do you know something?

475
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,540
Let go!

476
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,780
Don't get my clothes to be dirty.

477
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,180
Who turned over the oil lamp?

478
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:08,860
Not me.

479
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,780
I didn't do it.

480
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,060
People inside,

481
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,340
open the door!

482
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,420
Open the door!

483
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,420
Go.

484
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,060
Coming.

485
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:25,300
Sir.

486
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,290
Who set the fire?

487
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,970
Sir, I'm really sorry.

488
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,020
I planned to cook something in my room.

489
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,980
I accidentally burnt the weeds.

490
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:32,900
I've put out the fire.

491
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,850
The fire has been put out.

492
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,940
Don’t worry.

493
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,220
I’ll go to Shen Mansion tomorrow.

494
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,940
If her illness is not very serious,

495
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,020
I'll bring her back.

496
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,740
Thank you, Sister.

497
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,220
Miss He Mu'er.

498
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,660
I need to see Lady Yunying.

499
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,940
Please let me see her.

500
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,300
Come tomorrow.

501
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,540
Tao.

502
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,140
Your Highness.

503
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,940
The Shen family

504
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,500
wants to hurt Her Highness.
