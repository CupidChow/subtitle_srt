[Episode 3]

4
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,500
Prince Jin, accept the imperial edict.

5
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,500
I accepted the great mission from Heaven. Prince Jin returned in triumph

6
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,940
and contributed a lot to the stability of the country.

7
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,340
He will be rewarded with 10,000 taels of gold,

8
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,460
a thousand mu of land, and 500 pieces of items.

9
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,660
I heard that Princess Jin is loyal, righteous,

10
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,180
virtuous, and talented. She'll be bestowed a gold book and a gold stamp,

11
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,650
which are the same as those of the Crown Princess.

12
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:11,980
Respect it.

13
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:28,620
Brother.

14
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,740
His Majesty also asked me to bring two bowls of Many-Children Soup

15
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,060
to congratulate you on your getting married.

16
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,900
Third Sister-in-law,

17
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,100
this soup is a blessing for many children.

18
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,370
Don't let His Majesty down.

19
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,940
Please bear children for Princess Jin.

20
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,180
Why are you eating so happily?

21
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,060
Shouldn't I be happy?

22
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:06,900
That is delicious.

23
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,300
It has a good meaning, too.

24
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,780
Children are innocent.

25
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,300
If a couple doesn't love each other,

26
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,260
what's the use of having many children and grandchildren?

27
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,210
Your Highness, this is yours, right?

28
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,740
Who allowed you to take it?

29
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,860
Don't touch my stuff anymore.

30
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,060
Don't think I'll accept you just because you're here in my mansion.

31
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,740
Your Highness, let me take you to Xingyue Pavilion.

32
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,500
Your bedroom is there.

33
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,180
His Highness likes to be left alone.

34
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,380
Don't go to Shanglin Pavilion again if there's no urgent matter.

35
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,700
I've finally made it to Prince Jin's Mansion,

36
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,420
but His Highness hates me so much.

37
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,020
What should I do?

38
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,150
[Shen Mansion]

39
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,260
Master, the imperial edict has been sent.

40
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,100
At this moment, Shen Keyi

41
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,140
should have entered Prince Jin's Mansion.

42
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,500
But what's the secret of that jade pendant?

43
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,540
Wen Ye was the late emperor's favorite prince.

44
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,060
But in the end, he didn't inherit the throne.

45
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,500
He went to the border to guard the border city.

46
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,020
This jade pendant

47
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,060
was like a death-exemption plate given by the late emperor.

48
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,700
When Wen Ye has the jade pendant,

49
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,860
even if His Majesty wants to punish him,

50
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,940
nothing can be done.

51
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,060
But Master,

52
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:50,659
Shen Keyi's nanny is dead.

53
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,380
I'm afraid this reason

54
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,300
can't trick her long.

55
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,940
Do you really believe Shen Keyi

56
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,140
can steal the jade pendant?

57
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,940
If Wen Ye finds out…

58
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,020
What do you think

59
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,620
a person like Wen Ye would do

60
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,380
if he finds out someone beside him betrays him?

61
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,660
He...

62
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,500
Master, that is a brilliant move.

63
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,580
However,

64
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,010
Shen Keyi had a year to do it.

65
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,060
His Majesty awarded the Many-Children Soup.

66
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,020
On the face of it, he forced Wen Ye to acknowledge the Princess,

67
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,100
but he actually agreed

68
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,220
that if she can't give birth within a year,

69
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,210
he can repudiate her.

70
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,700
One year later,

71
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,580
if Shen Keyi can't accomplish anything

72
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,659
and gets repudiated,

73
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,659
our efforts will be in vain.

74
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,010
Don't worry, Master.

75
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,140
I've prepared for it.

76
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,740
I've arranged Aunt Xin

77
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,100
to bring the Hundred-day Powder to the Prince's Mansion.

78
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,020
The poison is colorless and odorless.

79
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,180
It can't even be detected by silver needles.

80
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,580
At first, there were no symptoms after taking it.

81
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,500
The poison will gradually take effect in a year.

82
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,460
Even if she can't steal the jade pendant

83
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,580
and isn't punished by Wen Ye,

84
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,300
Shen Keyi will still die in Prince Jin's Mansion.

85
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,340
So…

86
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,820
I'm doing this for the sake of our Prime Minister's Mansion.

87
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,020
Leave no trace.

88
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,780
If I give birth to a child for His Highness,

89
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,220
then I can stay in the Mansion

90
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,740
and become the person he trusts?

91
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,500
Come to think of it, it's quite worth it.

92
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:55,940
It's okay.

93
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,380
I can do it.

94
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,660
It's just having a baby for His Highness.

95
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,020
It's not like he eats humans.

96
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,660
From today onwards, strengthen the guard of Shanglin Pavilion.

97
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,580
No one from Xingyue Pavilion is allowed to come near.

98
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,540
Yes.

99
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,140
Who is it?

100
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,700
Assassin!

101
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,659
Guards!

102
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,340
What are you doing here?

103
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,260
I...

104
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,300
I want to give birth to a child for Your Highness.

105
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,940
Don't look. Come with me.

106
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,420
Go that way.

107
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:34,580
Then...

108
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,140
what about me?

109
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:37,820
Get lost!

110
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:05,740
Nan Bo.

111
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:09,780
Your Highness.

112
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:10,780
What's wrong?

113
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:12,580
It that…

114
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,260
Don't touch it.

115
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:16,900
Your Highness,

116
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,340
that looks like a walnut.

117
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,380
Do you think Her Highness tried so hard to come into my tent

118
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,100
just to leave a walnut?

119
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,380
Didn't she come to give birth to a child of yours?

120
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,020
Think about it.

121
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:33,900
Think more about it.

122
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,140
If she can say something

123
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,780
so bold so casually,

124
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,060
she must have some ulterior motive.

125
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,740
Your Highness is right.

126
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,660
The more innocent a woman looks,

127
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,860
the more she lies.

128
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,860
Do you know what kind of hidden weapon it is?

129
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,020
This kind of round hidden weapon

130
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,700
is not as sharp as those sleeve darts.

131
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,940
It might have been dipped in the poison.

132
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,420
Or it might have been filled with gunpowder.

133
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,500
It's uneven on the surface.

134
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,820
It's very likely that

135
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:02,970
poisonous needles shoot out from the dented areas.

136
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,100
You've been with me for so many years.

137
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,340
You've finally improved.

138
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,050
You must deal with it carefully.

139
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:19,820
Sir,

140
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:20,810
this way, please.

141
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:32,660
Sir.

142
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,580
Watch out!

143
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,540
This walnut

144
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,780
has a crispy shell.

145
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,980
I just want to test

146
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,220
your observation ability.

147
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:02,660
Sir,

148
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,140
I escorted Her Highness to Xingyue Pavilion.

149
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,780
I didn't find anything unusual.

150
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,020
The more normal it seems,

151
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:07,860
the more careful you should be.

152
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,060
Especially at the moment of the military ration case,

153
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,660
we must be extremely careful

154
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,020
in case Prime Minister Shen finds out

155
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,380
and destroys the evidence in advance.

156
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:15,980
Sir,

157
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,130
you're right.

158
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,500
After all, she is the daughter of the Shen family.

159
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,780
Who knows what they are up to?

160
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,860
We will be watchful and alert from now on.

161

[Xingyue Pavilion]

162
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,260
Has she eaten it all?

163
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,460
Yes, she's like the incarnation of a starving ghost.

164
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,570
Her Ladyship is really resourceful.

165
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,540
As Her Ladyship's trusted subordinates,

166
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,940
we must do this job well.

167
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,340
By then,

168
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,860
we will be greatly rewarded.

169
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,420
His Highness also eats three meals a day.

170
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,700
What does he like to eat?

171
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,060
If

172
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,580
I can cook something he likes,

173
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,460
will he allow me to get close to him?

174
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,220
I'll surprise His Highness secretly.

what does His Highness usually like to eat?

184
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,460
I want to cook something for him.

185
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,180
Everyone inside and outside the camp is watching His Highness closely.

186
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,260
Food is the easiest way to poison him.

187
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,300
If people find out what His Highness likes to eat,

188
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,340
the enemy will get the goods on him.

189
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,340
Wouldn't that make His Highness's life

190
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,220
much less fun?

191
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,340
When His Highness was young,

192
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,740
he often asked his birth mother

193
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,900
to make him desserts.

194
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,500
After his birth mother passed away,

195
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,860
he was adopted by the Empress Dowager

196
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,260
and never asked for desserts.

197
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,020
Then His Highness must like sweets.

198
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,180
I didn't say that.

199
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,820
I'm best at making deserts.

200
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,940
I'm sure he'll like it.

201
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,500
But His Highness

202
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,010
doesn't eat the food outside.

203
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,660
He only eats the food made in the small kitchen in Shanglin Pavilion.

204
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,580
I need to go to the accounting office now.

205
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,620
In the afternoon,

206
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,540
Your Highness can come to find me in Shanglin Pavilion.

207
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,420
I'll take you to the small kitchen.

208
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,740
Thank you, Sister Yunying.

209
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:47,620
Thank you.

210
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:49,540
This...

211
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,020
How could there be such a lady?

212
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,520
Mu'er.

213
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,610
Let's go.

214
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,610
I did hear that Her Highness is making desserts for you.

215
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:06,740
It seems

216
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,860
she's coming to poison me.

217
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,100
Poison?

218
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,260
I'll stop her now.

219
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:12,780
No need.

220
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,580
Get my Poison Cleansing Pills ready.

221
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,140
Let her do it.

222
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,300
If she really poisons me,

223
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,100
we can catch her red-handed.

224
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,780
But...

225
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,460
Go ahead.

226
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,780
Lady Yunying

227
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,460
is with Her Highness.

228
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,660
I'm afraid that she'll be bewitched by her.

229
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:31,740
Don't worry.

230
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,930
My sister can't be that stupid.

231
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,180
I was thoughtless.

232
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,060
You may leave.

233
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,060
Yes.

234
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,140
She didn't even hide her purpose.

235
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,420
What trick is that?

236
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,570
I've never seen it before.

237
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:07,660
Your Highness,

238
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,500
you said you wanted to make desserts for His Highness.

239
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,060
Have you decided what to do?

240
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,180
The apricot blossoms are blooming now.

241
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,180
Why don't we make apricot blossom pastry?

242
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,700
My nanny made it for me before.

243
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:20,730
It was delicious.

244
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:21,420
Your Highness,

245
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,940
have you heard of this poem?

246
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,060
Going on a spring outing,

247
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,380
the apricot blossoms are blooming.

248
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,810
On the country road, who's that young man?

249
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,540
He's so charming.

250
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,660
I want to be married to him

251
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,300
for the rest of my life.

252
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,340
For the rest of my life?

253
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,100
Her Highness went under the quilt of His Highness

254
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,340
to try to give birth to a child for him.

255
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,620
Isn't that "for the rest of her life?“

256
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,180
Mu'er.

257
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,250
But in my humble opinion,

258
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,620
Your Highness, don't bother.

259
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,220
If His Highness doesn't like it,

260
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,700
it'll be a waste of your time.

261
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:56,980
No way.

262
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,060
I want to give His Highness a surprise.

263
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,020
I just hope it won't scare him.

264
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,210
Mu'er.

265
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,180
Her Highness is thoughtful.

266
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,210
Stop pouring cold water on her.

267
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,380
Yes.

268
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,020
Your Highness,

269
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,970
what are you doing with this?

270
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,740
Knock off the apricot flowers, of course.

271
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,260
Be careful.

272
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,310
Be careful, Your Highness.

273
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,680
The flowers smell so good.

274
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,000
Come down.

275
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,280
They're so beautiful.

276
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,110
That's enough.

277
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,270
Come down now.

278
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,340
The little princess is so strange.

279
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,060
She's the daughter of the Prime Minister,

280
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,540
but she wears a sloppy dress every day

281
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,820
and likes to jump up and down.

282
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,980
It's as if no one cares about her.

283
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,980
So many apricot blossoms.

284
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,940
I spoke too much.

285
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:05,540
Your Highness.

286
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,780
Come down. Beware of falling.

287
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,380
I don't think she will fall.

288
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,540
Look how agile she is.

289
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,020
She must climb trees often.

290
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,610
Your Highness, be careful.

291
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,450
She is indeed a strange person.

292
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:17,920
There are more over here.

293
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,540
Your Highness.

294
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:23,980
Be careful.

295
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,300
Okay.

296
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,580
Be careful.

297
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:30,220
Got it.

298
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,660
The flowers smell so good.

299
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,490
This way.

300
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,220
So beautiful.

301
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,220
Be careful, Your Highness.

302
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,130
♫You come from the mortal world♫

303
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,440
♫And Laugh at me for not knowing about that world♫

304
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,280
♫You waved your hand with flowers♫

305
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:09,340
♫I see through the crowd♫

306
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,530
♫I got an unexpected period of time♫

307
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:20,090
♫It was worth it to wander in loneliness in the past on a horseback♫

308
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:25,650
♫If it's a beautiful dream, what's wrong with going separate ways to our ends?♫

309
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:32,000
♫Love is a reward, and I'm willing to wander if it lasts long♫

310
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,690
♫Because the flowers once bloomed, I won't forget them after seeing them♫

311
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,520
♫Do you know this glance♫

312
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,340
Wan.

313
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,740
Draw the curtains.

314
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:39,900
Yes.

315
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:47,130
♫Is the gaze for us so far away？♫

316
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,220
Be careful, Your Highness.

317
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,180
Your Highness,

318
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,610
we've picked so many.

319
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,620
This should be enough, right?

320
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,660
Yes.

321
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,580
The flowers you picked are all very fresh.

322
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,330
Sir.

323
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,540
-The pastries we make today must be delicious.
-Sir.

324
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,380
Let's go to the small kitchen.

325
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,660
-You've read this page 100 times.
-Let's go.

326
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,900
What do you know?

327
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,780
This is called "read the book 100 times,

328
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,940
and you'll understand the meaning naturally."

329
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:17,900
Really?

330
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,020
You'll know after you copy this page 100 times.

331
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,900
Fortunately, I don't need to copy the whole book.

332
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,140
Copy the whole book then.

333
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,220
Wan, supervise him.

334
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,820
He can't eat until he finishes copying.

335
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,180
No.

336
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:29,900
Yes, Your Highness.

337
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,620
Sir.

338
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,380
Go ahead.

339
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,140
I...

340
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,260
When can I finish copying this?

341
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,620
This book is so thick.

342
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,200
♫There's a breeze near the arch bridge♫

343
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,840
♫A few people pass by♫

344
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,620
Your Highness.

♫The painter is busy with the drawing of a portrait♫

346
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,460
You're good at this.

347
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,250
It looks like you often do this.

348
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:08,150
♫Who's the young lady trying make-up before a bronze mirror?♫

349
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,300
Of course.

350
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,820
Before, I was doing it on the str…

351
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:12,030
♫The scene inspirs a young master to write an article♫

352
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,100
I mean, learning from Nanny at home.

♫The oars on the boat go up and down gently♫

354
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:19,650

are made by you yourself?

Your Highness.

00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,340
These are just folk snacks.

371
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,580
I wonder if you'll be used to it.

372
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:48,900
How is it?

373
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,180
Do you like it?

374
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,260
Not this one.

375
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,460
Not this one either.

376
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,860
Not this one either.

377
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,220
At least leave one for me.

378
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,140
This must be it.

379
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,820
Your Highness, you'll get indigestion if you eat too much dessert.

380
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,860
Let me help you with the last one.

381
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,700
No need. I still have some space in my tummy.

382
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,860
Your Highness, you're full. Let me help you.

383
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,540
I can still eat.

384
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,900
I want to eat more.

385
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,820
Let me help you.

386
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,900
Your Highness, I can help you.

387
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,340
I can still eat.

388
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,700
Hurry up! Get the Poison Cleansing Pill.

389
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:19,820
Hurry up.

390
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,940
-Drink some water.
-Here.

391
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,140
Open your mouth.

392
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:38,980
Are you okay?

393
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,740
I'm fine.

394
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,300
Your Highness,

395
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,900
I've checked the half apricot blossom pastry.

396
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,250
It's not poisonous.

397
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,900
Did Her Highness put so much effort

398
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,580
just to make food for Your Highness?

399
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,500
Something is wrong.

400
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,540
What's wrong?

401
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,620
She's so strong.

402
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,460
Is she a martial artist?

403
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:10,740
Your Highness.

404
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,260
She pushed me so far today.

405
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:14,860
She is really strong.

406
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,820
But I didn't feel any inner power

407
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,210
in her body.

408
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,700
She's hidden it so well.

409
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,180
Did Prime Minister Shen marry the Princess to you

410
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,540
to assassinate you?

411
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,860
I thought she came to spy

412
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,180
and poison me at most.

413
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,900
But I didn't expect

414
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,940
a weak-looking girl like her

415
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,620
to know martial arts.

416
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,460
Sir,

417
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,780
people in the capital

418
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,660
are unpredictable.

419
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,020
Don't worry. I'm going to confront Her Highness.

420
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,660
Do you think she will admit it?

421
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,570
She hid it so well,

422
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:53,140
so she won't be exposed easily.

423
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,620
But no matter how cunning a person is,

424
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,420
they have weaknesses.

425
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,540
They all value their lives and care about their own benefit.

426
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,020
Why don't we test her?

427
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,180
Then let's spread the news.

428
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:06,300
Just say

429
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,060
I've found important evidence,

430
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,140
but my old injury relapsed,

431
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,020
so I have to stay at home

432
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,700
and can't fight for a month.

433
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,780
-Yes.
-Yes.

434
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:20,730
[Xingyue Pavilion]

435
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,940
I didn't expect Shen Keyi

436
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,220
to hide so many good things.

437
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,540
Biyun, try it.

438
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,060
You bitch!

439
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,540
Are you trying to rebel?

440
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,060
Give it back.

441
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,420
You are the princess.

442
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,020
You have everything.

443
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,210
Just lend us this jade comb for a few days.

444
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,620
That's right.

445
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,580
No.

446
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,580
-This is from my nanny.
-You shameless bitch!

447
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,380
Give me back my jade comb.

448
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,980
Do you really take yourself as a princess?

449
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,020
-I'm telling you, all the things here
-It's mine.

450
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,180
are not for you to enjoy.

451
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,940
Just finish your task,

452
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,900
Don't dream of a meteoric rise.

453
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:17,740
Let go!

454
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:18,860
Let go!

455
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:20,620
Let go.

456
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:38,980
Just bear with it.

457
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:41,700
Once I get the jade pendant and rescue Nanny,

458
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,820
I won't be bullied by these bad women anymore.

459
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,660
Lord Shen, you're in such a good mood.

460
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,570
Wen Ye came back alive.

461
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,700
And yet you still have the mood

462
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,420
to raise these little things here?

463
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,660
I haven't asked you yet.

464
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,940
Nanzhu Pavilion

465
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,620
is the No. 1 assassination organization in the State of Liang,

466
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,260
but you can't even handle a severely injured person?

467
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,700
You don't have to mock me so fast.

468
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,140
Wen Ye has started investigating the case of rations.

469
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,980
Once he finds the evidence of your treason,

470
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,940
you will be at the mercy of others

471
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,580
like the fish in the water.

472
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,660
You can rest assured of that.

473
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,140
I already had a plan for it.

474
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:35,420
Plan?

475
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,740
Just with your delicate illegitimate daughter?

476
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,820
Let me help you.

477
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,210
What on earth do you want?

478
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,020
Others are the knife,

479
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,420
and we're the fish on the chopping board.

480
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,380
Instead of waiting for him to recuperate and counterattack,

481
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,060
we should kill him

482
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,810
before he recovers.

483
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,850
I think you must have forgotten

484
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,940
this is the capital of Cang.

485
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,140
What? You want to charge into the Prince's Mansion

486
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,780
and assassinate Wen Ye?

487
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,940
Are you crazy?

488
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,420
Of course I am not.

489
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,900
I just need your cooperation

490
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,260
to transfer the guards of the capital.

491
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,740
After Wen Ye dies,

492
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,700
you can continue to be the Prime Minister.

493
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,500
You'll be like a fish in the water.

494
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,060
My lord,

495
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,620
am I right?

496
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,660
Your Highness.

497
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,700
Your Highness, His Highness wants to see you.

498
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,900
The Empress Dowager sent some imperial food.

499
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,940
His Highness invites you to have a taste of it together.

500
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,780
Really?

501
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,970
His Highness really called me?

502
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,820
Is there anything delicious?

503
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,260
Haven't you had enough delicious food

504
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,460
in the Prime Minister’s Mansion?

505
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,820
We're almost there.

506
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:25,940
Okay.

507
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,370
Your Highness, Her Highness is here.

508
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,740
You may leave.

509
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:56,780
Sit.

510
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,060
Okay.

511
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:02,820
Your Highness.

512
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,420
Why are you at home today?

513
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,580
My old injury relapses.

514
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:10,980
I'll recuperate at home for a few days.

515
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,660
Your Highness.

516
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,260
If you're recuperating,

517
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,980
don't eat these things. They're bad for your recovery.

518
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,620
There must be rules.

519
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,140
Your Highness, I don't deserve any reward without contributions.

520
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,540
I didn't do anything.

521
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:53,130
Just take it as a thanks to the apricot blossom pastry you made for me.

522
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,660
You're welcome.

523
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,420
Your Highness, if you like it,

524
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,570
I'll make it for you every day.

525
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,380
If there are no apricot flowers after spring,

526
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,660
I can use lotus in summer,

527
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,900
chrysanthemum in autumn,

528
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,940
and plum blossoms in winter.

529
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,940
There are a lot of flowers which we can use for cooking

530
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,620
in the four seasons.

531
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,660
Don't talk when eating or sleeping.

532
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,220
This is delicious, Your Highness.

533
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:35,900
Try it.

534
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,460
Your Highness, this one is clean.

535
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,820
It hasn't been stained by my saliva.

536
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,100
Don't worry.

537
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,660
Did you usually eat like this

538
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,500
at home?

539
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,420
I didn't expect Prime Minister Shen would have a daughter like you.

540
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,060
You two are totally different.

541
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,540
I didn't usually

542
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,660
eat with my father.

543
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:18,940
He's busy.

544
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,060
Before you got married,

545
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,580
did you always stay at home?

546
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,060
I just stayed in the backyard,

547
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,220
cooking and arranging flowers.

548
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,620
Have you been to school?

549
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,410
No.

550
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,180
But I'm not illiterate.

551
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,420
Have you learned martial arts?

552
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:48,420
Dance?

553
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,220
I don't know how to dance.

554
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,500
Does His Highness like girls with soft waists?

555
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,530
Yes, I have. Look, Your Highness.

556
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,660
Let's eat.

557
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,820
Your Highness, did you hear anything?

558
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,980
No. Let's eat.

559
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,020
I must have heard it wrong.

560
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:49,820
Be careful, Your Highness.

561
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:37,420
Shen Keyi! Shen Keyi! Shen Keyi!

562
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,340
Shen Keyi!

563
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,460
Sir.

564
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,010
You don't need to worry too much.

565
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,260
The arrow didn't hurt the vital part.

566
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,100
Her Highness will be fine.

567
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,380
I thought she approached me

568
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,260
for some ulterior motive.

569
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,140
That's why I pretended to be injured to test her.

570
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,860
In the end, the assassins did come.

571
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,340
But I don't understand

572
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,380
why she'd block the arrow for me.

573
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,660
Sir.

574
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,820
Maybe the news wasn't revealed by Her Highness?

575
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,540
Your Highness.

576
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:05,500
Your Highness, the arrowhead is taken out.

577
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:08,660
Your Highness.

578
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,610
I'll stay here with her tonight.

579
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:12,980
Okay.

580
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,660
You may leave now.

581
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,660
I'll guard outside the tent tonight.

582
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,660
Please tell me when she wakes up, Sister.

583
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:21,940
Yes.

584
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:27,460
Sister.

585
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,020
Then...

586
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:31,610
I'll have to trouble you for this.

587
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:52,880
[Tang's Fish Shop]

588
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,660
I told you not to act on impulse.

589
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,020
Now you're hurt.

590
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,980
I underestimated Wen Ye this time.

591
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,020
No one expected Prime Minister Shen's daughter

592
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,980
would come out to protect him from the arrow.

593
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,220
Did they fall in love?

594
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,980
After all, they are husband and wife.

595
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,780
After getting along for a long time, they'll naturally have feelings for each other.

596
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,020
Whether the feelings are true or fake,

597
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,340
a strong man has a weakness when he falls in love.

598
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,500
I didn't kill him this time,

599
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,140
but he won't be so lucky next time.

600
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:49,660
Your Highness.

601
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:53,860
Sister.

602
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,940
Her Highness is awake.

603
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:00,820
Good.

604
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,220
I'm glad she's awake.

605
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,940
I need to check the medicine in the kitchen.

606
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,740
If you want to go in,

607
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,090
go in.

608
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:35,100
Your Highness.

609
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:39,900
I didn't mean to steal snacks.

610
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,290
I just saw it there,

611
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:43,460
so I...

612
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,180
Where are you going?

613
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,420
I've disturbed you for too long.

614
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,180
I'll go back first.

615
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,180
Just sleep here.

616
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,740
The night is not over yet.

617
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,500
We don't know if there are

618
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,020
more assassins hidden in the mansion.

619
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,700
What's wrong? Does it hurt badly?

620
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,220
I think it hurts so much

621
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,260
that I don't even feel anything.

622
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,500
Weren't you afraid

623
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,140
when you blocked the arrow for me?

624
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,660
How do you know I was not scared?

625
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,540
Actually, I had a selfish motive.

626
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:37,860
A selfish motive?

627
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,180
I was thinking,

628
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,300
if I did more things for you,

629
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,500
maybe you could accept me.

630
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,180
I didn't think that much at that moment.

631
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:50,660
I just wanted to show my loyalty in front of you.

632
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:55,980
I did regret it a little when I got hurt.

633
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,540
You're honest.

634
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,380
I...

635
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,900
I'm not telling the whole truth.

636
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,260
But I sincerely hope

637
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,340
you can be safe and healthy.

638
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,140
You are the head of the family.

639
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:16,300
You're like a big tree.

640
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,860
Only if you don't fall

641
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,500
can you protect the rest of us.

642
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:27,980
Then all in all,

643
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,740
you're doing it for yourself.

644
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,260
We're family,

645
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,900
so I'll do things for you,

646
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,140
and you'll do things for me. Right?

647
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,180
Ye.

648
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,340
You'll understand when you grow up.

649
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,900
Some places

650
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,740
cannot get warm no matter how much charcoal you use.

651
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,900
While some places

652
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:50,340
are warm even if the house

653
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:51,780
leaks rain and wind in.

654
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,460
Where is that place?

655
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:57,810
Home.

656
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,740
Two people in one room

657
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,740
have three meals a day and live through the four seasons together.

658
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,420
That's the warmest place in the world.

659
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,940
You're the first person who wants to protect me.

660
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:14,980
Then...

661
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,340
it must be hard for you

662
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,420
if you have to protect others all the time.

663
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,900
Although I'm a humble person,

664
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,860
but if you need me,

665
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:27,300
you can rely on me.

666
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,100
How can I rely on you?

667
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:39,540
I can make Your Highness happy

668
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,140
and cook delicious food for you every day.

669
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,810
I'll always support you.

670
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,180
I mean it.

671
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:06,940
Take care of yourself.

672
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,500
Your Highness.

673
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,820
When I return to Xingyue Pavilion,

674
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:18,290
will you still come to see me?
