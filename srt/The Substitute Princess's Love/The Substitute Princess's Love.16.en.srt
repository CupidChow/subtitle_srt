Tonight is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

Tell everyone to go back early to reunite with their family.

16
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,180
Yes.

Let's go.

20
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,260
Now Wen Ye has the evidence.

21
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,150
I’m afraid Prime Minister Shen will be doomed.

22
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,700
We can't stay in the capital for any longer.

23
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:38,750
Let's go.

24
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,220
Which side do you think Wen Ye will choose?

25
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,660
He has always been decisive.

26
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,900
He will take this opportunity to defeat Prime Minister Shen.

27
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,829
I don’t think so.

28
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,579
But we can't take the risk.

29
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,750
Last time, Wen Ye stopped suddenly,

30
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,340
leaving us a chance to escape.

31
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,300
But he has set up intricate networks

32
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,420
both within the capital and beyond the borders.

33
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,750
We won't be able to escape.

Under this circumstance,

35
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,180
I have a new idea.

36
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,060
We can take a gamble.

37
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:20,900
This is the location of the accounts

38
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,060
that record my father's embezzlement,

39
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,270
as well as some highly confidential letters.

40
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,870
But as for how you want to use it,

41
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,500
whether to save your princess

42
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,390
or to bring down my father,

43
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,230
that's up to you, Your Highness, to decide.

44
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,060

48
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,340
I know my guilt.

49
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,740
Please

51

and let me go.

52
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,510
Why should I be merciful?

53

54

no one will oppose you.

This

59
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,070
is not necessarily a good thing.

60
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,420
Since ancient times,

61
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,350
when generals achieved greater success than their emperor

62
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,030
and had no one to restrain them,

63
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,710
they often

64
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,470
ended up in misery.

65
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,990
Lord Shen. How do you

66
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,990
plan to help me?

67
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,980

69
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,710

00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,710
Let me ask you.

72

Who

73
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,220
informed the Empress Dowager?

my wife.

76
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,390
She was crazy

77
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,030
and did something stupid.

78
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,900
Since we have found the culprit,

79
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,060
Prime Minister Shen, you should report the truth

80
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,740
and let His Majesty decide.

00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,250
I will

84
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,310
do as you say.

My wife

86
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,340
forced my illegitimate daughter to get married in place of her sister.

removed her from the family book.

00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,220
Yes.

193
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,350
Your Highness, the Spring Festival is coming.

194
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,700
This will be our first Spring Festival together.

195
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:12,500
Yes.

196
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,710
Your Highness, you have been working hard in the court.

197
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,260
As your wife, I must

198
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,940
show consideration for you.

199
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,940
I'll be in charge of

200
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,510
the Spring Festival preparations.

201
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,870
Thank you, my princess.

202
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,130
Not at all.

203
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:30,870
But, Your Highness,

204
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,270
to make people work,

205
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,790
you need to pay enough money.

206
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,420
I knew it.

207
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,060
I've prepared it for you.

208
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,620
The banknotes are in the drawer.

209
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,780
Take them if you want.

210
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,500
Your Highness, just leave it to me.

211
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:02,990
[Auspiciousness and Good Luck Are Gathered Here]

212
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,140
I'll hang it up.

213
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:04,500
Okay.

214
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,440
[Prince Jin’s Mansion]

215
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,700
Your Highness, you are amazing.

216
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,270
Of course.

217
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,420
You are amazing.

218
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,270
Your Highness.

219
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,510
I didn't expect you to know how to make this.

220
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,260
When I was young, Nanny and I depended on each other.

221
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:37,940
[Prince Jin’s Mansion]

222
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,060
Every Chinese New Year,

223
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,270
when other kids had new clothes to wear but I didn't,

224
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,540
I envied them.

225
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,180
Nanny couldn't afford new clothes for me.

226
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:44,220
So she would go to the end of the alley to get two pieces of red paper with some candies

227
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,700
and cut beautiful window decorations for me.

228
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,260
Nanny said that as long as we put up new window decorations,

229
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,270
it symbolized the beginning of a new year.

230
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,140
In the end,

231
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,910
all the kids in the alley envied me.

232
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,340
I envy you too.

233
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,980
I don't believe it.

234
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,620
Your Highness, when you were young,

235
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,470
you must have had endless new clothes

236
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,300
and endless delicacies.

237
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,820
How could you envy me?

238
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,700
On every holiday,

239
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,260
there were rewards in the palace.

240
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,790
[Prince Jin’s Mansion]

241
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,310
I didn't find them rare since I had seen so many.

242
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:19,700
Actually, when I was young,

243
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,750
what I liked the most

244
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,900
was to spend New Year's Eve with my mother.

245
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:24,910
But

246
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,090
she was in the palace every New Year's Eve.

247
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,710
I remember one New Year's Eve,

248
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,500
I faked to be sick.

249
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,740
But I didn't expect

250
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,990
that only the imperial physician came.

251
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,270
Your Highness.

252
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,190
That's why I envy you.

253
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,030
At least the person you cared about

254
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,790
was with you

255
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,580
on every New Year's Eve.

256
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,070
Your Highness.

257
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,580
I'll be with you for every New Year in the future.

259
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,620
Is the height okay?

260
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,700
A little higher.

261
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,590
What about now?

262
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,220
Your Highness.

263
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:02,580
Good.

Her Grace's decree has arrived.

267
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:19,860
Stop!

268
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,510
Steward Aunt. What brings you here today?

269
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,670
Your Highness.

270
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,100
It's been a long time since you last celebrated Spring Festival in the capital.

271
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,910
New Year's Eve is in a few days.

272
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,060
Her Grace invites you and the Princess

273

to have New Year's Eve dinner together.

274
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,290
Okay.

275
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,630
I will go.

276
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,110
Pack the chestnuts for me.

Your Highness.

280
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,700
What else should I say

281
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,500
other than greeting words in front of Her Grace?

282
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,590
You just need to treat Her Grace as your elder.

283
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,070
Just say some blessings

284
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,060
that elders like to hear.

285
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,410
But I'm worried about being disrespectful

286
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,620
and causing her to dislike me more.

287
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,900
It's up to her whether she likes you or not.

288
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,470
We just need to have a clear conscience

289
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,950
and do what we should do.

290
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,540
Besides,

291
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,620
you manage the mansion so well.

292
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,180
There's no reason she doesn't like you.

293
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,220
What should I say to His Majesty?

294
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:04,630
Should I stop using informal language?

295
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,790
I'll just shut up

296
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,790
in case the more I speak, the more mistakes I may make.

297
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,670
You are my princess.

298
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,420
Just be yourself.

Do you not want to go to the palace to celebrate the New Year's Eve?

300
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,060
I prefer to spend the New Year's Eve at home.

301
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,140
It's carefree and cozy.

302
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,340
Then,

303
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,550
let's run away.

Look at these candied haws.

310
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,590
This year's New Year's gift

311
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,740
is to be an ordinary couple with you

312
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,310
and give you a New Year night in your memory.

313
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,230
Happy New Year.

314
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,420
So, you lied to me about going to the palace,

315
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,100
just to secretly prepare all of this

316
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,430
and give me a surprise?

317
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,380
Come.

318
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:43,550
I'll walk with you.

Madam, you are so beautiful.

321
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,820
Come here.

322
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:58,340
Look at this red plum hairpin. It's delicate.

323
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,610
It matches your bright look.

324
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,310
Why don't you buy it on New Year's Eve?

325
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,940
It symbolizes the prosperity of the next year.

326
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,170
Okay, I'll buy it.

327
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:13,790
Here.

328
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,260
Nice.

329
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,460
My husband will pay for it.

330
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,310

376
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:24,980
It doesn't matter.

377
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,660
Come on.

378
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,270
Then let's eat together.

379
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,900
Let's propose a toast to His Highness and Her Highness.

380
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:35,540
OK.

381
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,220
Happy New Year, everyone.

382
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,310
Happy New Year, Your Highnesses.

383
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,030
Happy New Year.

384
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,310
Let's eat.

385
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:49,620
Here.

386
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:51,550
Your Highnesses.

387
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,740
I placed a copper coin

388
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,940
in today's dumplings.

389
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,020
Whoever finds the coin

390
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,140
will be lucky in the new year.

391
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,180
Let me try.

392
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,350
-Me too.
-I want to eat it too.

393
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,300
Tao, eat.

394
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,430
Come on, try it.

395
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,700
Let me try.

396
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,460
Mine doesn't have it.

397
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:20,490
Mine either.

398
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,150
I want that, Tao. I want that.

399
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:25,620
Your Highness.

400
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,820
I will find it.

401
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:35,310
Looks like

402
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,180
I will be lucky in the new year.

403
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,020
Congratulations, Sister Yunying.

404
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,820
This luck was given to me by the Guard Wan.

405
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,270
To Guard Wan too.

406
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,460
Thank you, Madam.

407
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,380
Don't be so formal.

408
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,110
We are a family.

409
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:58,790
Happy New Year.

410
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:03,870
Today,

411
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,500
I've prepared lucky money for you.

412
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:08,620
There're red envelopes for us.

413
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,140
We'll get lucky money.

[Earth Is Nurturing]

415
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,340
There're red envelopes for us.

416
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:13,860
This is yours.

417
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:17,660
Your Highness.

418
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,830
Why don't I have one?

419
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,100
I've prepared it for you long before.

420
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,590
Here, your lucky money.

421
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,140
Thank you, Your Highness.

422
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,590
Thank you, Your Highness.

423
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,660
Come on, let’s eat.

424
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,990
Wan, do you want to have a fish tail?

425
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,430
You eat.

426
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:37,590
Steward Yi, let me pour the wine for you.

427
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,700
Okay.

428
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,230
Your Highness.

429
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,420
This must be delicious.

430
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:43,790
You don't drink?

431
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,300
Is it good?

432
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,230
This is not bad. Try it.

433
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,570
Your Highness.

434
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,220
This year,

435
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:07,180
I want to go back to the Zheng family's old house to worship my ancestors.

436
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,700
Haven't you been in touch for years?

437
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,570
Why do you suddenly want to go back this year?

438
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,310
I should go back once.

439
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,930
Tao, eat this.

440
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,140
I'll send someone to accompany you.

441
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,100
Or the Zheng family will bully you again.

442
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,260
No need.

443
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,740
They're my in-laws, not enemies.

444
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,180
I can ask Mu'er to go with me.

445
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,780
I'm afraid I won't be able to spend

446
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,570
the first lunar month here.

447
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:41,380
Fine.

448
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,390
I'll respect your decision.

449
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,390
Don't worry about me, Your Highness.

450
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,980
Today is New Year's Eve.

451
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,630
Everyone should be happy.

452
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,420
-Be happy.
-Be happy.

00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,750
Let's eat.

454
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,270
I'm happy.

456
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,470
Have a fish head.

457
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:02,500
Open your mouth, Your Highness.

458
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,010
Alright.

459
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,500
Your Highness.

460
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,700
Did Sister Yunying and Guard Wan have a conflict?

461
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,350
They are not kids.

462
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:15,990
They'll take care of it.

463
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:20,590
Come on.

464
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,090
Follow me.

465
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,460
It smells good. Is it plum blossom wine?

466
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,630
I intentionally used white plum blossoms

467
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,660
picked after the first snowfall of the year.

468
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,430
I heard that this kind of plum blossom

469
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,710
can preserve its fragrance to the utmost.

470
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,060
It's New Year's Eve.

471
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:44,620
Drink with me.

472
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,300
Your Highness,

473
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,340
I think I like Chinese New Year more than before.

474
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:49,870
No.

475
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,510
It should be

476
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,830
I prefer the years I spend with you.

477
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,150

478
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,980
We will always be together.

479
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:09,940
Right?

480
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,300
Your Highness, you hesitated.

481
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,670

00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,670
It's almost midnight.

503
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,670
Let's go back to Xingyue Pavilion and rest.

504
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:54,740

505
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,270

511
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,710
You came all the way to our country.

512
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:34,670
It’s almost New Year’s Eve.

513
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:37,910
I'm afraid you'll miss your family more during the festival.

514
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,420
So I came to see you.

515
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,060
How is it?

00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,540
Are you accustomed to living here?

517
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,380
Great Cang has a vast land and abundant resources.

518
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,580
Here, there are outstanding individuals and a fertile land.

519
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:48,630
It's not something our small country can look up to.

520
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,370
Of course, I miss my hometown.

521
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,060
But I am drawn to the scenery and items of the Great Cang.

522
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,180
And I am attracted

523
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,220
by the lively atmosphere in the palace.

524
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,020
These have eased my homesickness.

525
00:29:58,990 --> 00:29:59,790
That's good.

526
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,060
I'm old.

527
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,220
I love to be lively.

00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,750
When you have time,

529
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,860
come to see me more often.

530
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,860
Of course, I'd like to.

531
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,630
But...

532
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,830
I don't want to disturb you, Your Grace.

533
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:26,270
We will be a family in the future.

534
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,950
Don't feel like you'll disturb me.

535
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,500
I

536
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,060
think you are a good girl.

537
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,660
I hope

538
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,540
you and Ye can become

I

541
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,790
won't let you down.

542
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,590
Wen Ye already hates me.

543
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,460
He can’t wait to send me to prison.

544
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,730
Now that he has the evidence,

545
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,390
of course, he'll present them to His Majesty.

546
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,100
My lord, look.

547
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,990
You've been fighting with him for so many years.

548
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,260
But you don't know him as well as I do.

549
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,750
Master, His Highness has gone to the palace.

550
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,330
What kind of person is Wen Ye?

551
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,180
How dare I gamble with him?

552
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,300
Calm down, Lord Shen.

553
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:26,590
No one gained benefits from this move.

554
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,820
The result depends on the future.

555
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,790

The State of Liang is willing to establish a marital alliance with the Great Cang,

559
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,500
sending a princess to marry Prince Jin.

560
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,260
Wen Ye is not a person

561
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,300
who can be controlled by women.

562
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,220
He wouldn't even

563
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,220
agree to this marriage.

564
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,110
But his princess is still in prison.

565
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,420
In order to save her,

566
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:55,910
why can't he compromise?

567
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,710
What's the point of marrying

568
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,500
the princess into the Prince's mansion?

569
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:03,100
I will lurk by his side

570
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,230
and take everything from him.
