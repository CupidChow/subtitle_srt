[Episode 24]

4
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,630
I've checked the terrain nearby.

5
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:36,950
We can open up farmlands

6
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:38,509
and bring water here to irrigate them.

7
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:39,850
That way we can provide enough food for ourselves.

8
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,530
During the three years when you garrison the border,

9
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,910
you don't have to worry about the food anymore.

10
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:45,860
Well,

11
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,460
then I have to confer

12
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,789
the title of Army's Farmlands Director on you.

13
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,310
General,

14
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,450
you are getting more and more humorous.

15
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,620
No, I have to go home.

16
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,910
You can farm the lands yourself.

17
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:02,820
General,

18
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:05,820
the spy has confessed.

19
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,060
This is the portrait of the chief of Nanzhu Pavilion

20
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,220
drawn according to his statement.

21
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:13,870
Isn't…

22
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,380
Isn't that the Princess of Liang in your mansion?

23
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:20,750
It's her!

24
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,030
Your Highness.

25
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:23,940
Sir.

26
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,350
News from the capital

27
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:28,180
says that the soldiers of our mansion escorted 
the Princess of Liang back to Liang under orders.

28
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,990
But unexpectedly, the princess was highly skilled in martial arts.

29
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,180
She killed everyone and ran away on the way.

30
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,190
She left only this letter written with blood.

31
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,740
If you still want to see your loved one,

32
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,420
come to see me immediately.

33
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,220
Prepare the horse.

34
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,030
Your Highness.

35
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,430
The imperial edict says if you return to the capital,

36
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:53,020
you'll be punished the same as an accomplice conspiring against the state.

37
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,060
Let me go instead.

38
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:55,930
But the chief of Nanzhu Pavilion

39
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,750
has been lurking beside me for so long.

40
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,620
I can't risk my princess's life.

41
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:00,630
Sir.

42
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:02,420
Sir.

43
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,470
General, think twice!

44
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,100
General.

45
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,420
if the nomads in the North know

46
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,260
that you will be punished after you go back

47
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,820
and that there will be no general guarding here,

48
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,310
I'm afraid they'll come back to invade us.

49
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,390
Go back.

50
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,750
Take my share of care for her.

51
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:24,630
You protect her,

52
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,750
and I will protect our country.

53
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,620
Your Majesty.

54
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,550
I, Zuo Shuangzhi,

55
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,110
have something important to report.

56
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,790
[Cangdu]

57
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,610
His Majesty has ordered

58
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,580
Prince Jin should guard the border for three years

59
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,550
and is not allowed to enter the capital.

60
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,270
Get out of my way if you don't want to die.

61
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,110
Your Highness.

62
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,270
We can't disobey His Majesty's order.

63
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,150
Please turn around and go back.

64
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,980
If you insist on breaking through,

65
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,220
don't blame me

66
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,860
for being rude to you.

00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,710

68
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:56,780
My lord.

69
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,380
According to the spies in the city,

70
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,540
Zuo Shuangzhi, the Princess of Liang,

71
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,210
found an edict of the late emperor

72
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,190
in Prince Jin's Mansion

73
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,150
and submitted it to His Majesty.

74
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,450
What's going on in the palace then?

75
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,980
We don't know about it yet.

76
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,900
But Prince Jin rushed back

77
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,590
from the barracks in the North

78
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,940
and broke into the city gate.

79
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:17,940
It is said that

80
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,790
he wants to confront the Princess of Liang.

81
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,630
Go to the palace.

82
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:28,980
Prepare the horse.

83
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,380
Yes.

84
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,580
Today

85
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,630
has finally arrived!

86
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,140
Wen Ye.

87
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:49,990
You're finally here.

88
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:50,940
Where is she?

89
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,659
I've prepared your favorite tea.

90
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,420
If you want to know where she is,

91
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,460
sit down and drink this cup of tea.

92
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,390
I never thought

93
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,190
you were the leader of Nanzhu Pavilion.

94
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,530
Yes.

95
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,430
Do you know

96
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,990
how I became the leader of Nanzhu Pavilion?

97
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,020
It's all because of you, Wen Ye.

98
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:17,820
That year,

99
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,110
you saved me on the battlefield.

100
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,350
I then joined Nanzhu Pavilion.

101
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,060
You told me to struggle to live.

102
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,909
I stepped on the blood of my comrades and went all the way up.

103
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,620
But I didn't expect

104
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,950
that you were the God of War of Cang,

105
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,790
my biggest enemy.

106
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,750
Destiny played such a big joke on me.

107
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,630
Who I need to kill

108
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,020
is the person I've loved for so many years.

109
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,430
Zuo Shuangzhi,

110
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,580
You don't know anything about love.

111
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,030
It's you who don't know anything!

112
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,150
Shen Keyi is a weak woman.

113
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,220
She will only be your burden.

114
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,990
But I'm different.

115
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,220
I can be your biggest ally.

116
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,300
I can betray Nanzhu Pavilion

117
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,460
and my motherland for you.

118
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,230
I am the one who loves you the most.

119
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,620
You're obsessive.

120
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,940
Zuo Shuangzhi,

121
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,540
no matter what happened between us in the past,

122
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,270
I will never fall in love with

123
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,270
a ruthless person with blood on her hands.

124
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,620
Ruthless?

125
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,230
Blood on my hands?

126
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,030
You still have a chance to mend your ways.

127
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,190
Tell me.

128
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,670
Where is Shen Keyi?

129
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,340
If you really love her so much,

130
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,430
will you do anything for her?

131
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,780
What do you want me to do?

132
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,510
Tell me. I'll do anything.

133
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,230
Fine.

134
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,860
Kneel.

135
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,620
That's not enough.

136
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,730
I want you to cut off the tendons in your wrists and ankles.

137
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,030
What?

138
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:42,059
Are you reluctant now?

139
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,140
Right.

140
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,020
If you, Wen Ye,

141
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,430
become a cripple,

142
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,790
it'll be more painful than being dead.

143
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,100
What a pity.

144
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,300
But besides trusting me,

145
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,550
you have no other choice.

146
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,820
I hope you can keep your promise.

147
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,380
Why?

148
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,300
You're a prince.

149
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,750
What's so good about her?

150
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,860
What's so good about her that she deserves you to do this?

151
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,230
She is my wife.

152
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,970
I love her deeply.

153
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,300
She's the best in my heart.

154
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,300
Let me tell you then.

155
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,310
Shen Keyi is already dead.

156
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,350
What did you say?

157
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,740
She's dead.

158
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,670
I killed her myself.

159
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,500
Your Highness, run!

160
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,420
Nan Bo!

161
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,380
Run, Your Highness. Don't mind me. Run!

162
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,860
You run pretty fast.

163
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,900
Zuo Shuangzhi.

164
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,730
His Highness is a good general.

165
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,780
He has never been rebellious.

166
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,260
You know clearly that if you hand these things

167
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,100
to the imperial court,

168
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,860
His Highness will die.

169
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,020
So what?

170
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,060
I love him more than you do.

171
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,110
How could he

172
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,420
not even look at me?

173
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,910
If I can't have him,

174
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,070
I will destroy him.

175
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,260
You're crazy through and through!

176
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,630
You don't cry uncle even if you're dying.

177
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,620
Just give me the edict.

178
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,030
Maybe I'll spare your life.

179
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,610
In the Prince's Mansion,

180
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,660
I've gained

181
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,270
the strongest and warmest power in the world.

182
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,940
It's the love from His Highness,

183
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,710
which you will never get.

184
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,420
You...

185
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,950
Love is protection,

186
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,300
not destruction.

00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,350
you won't have any chips

191
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:50,000
♫I cut the hidden line at the center of the palm silently♫

192
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,950
and you wouldn't have dared to come to see me.

193
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,590
Why do I need chips?

194
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,760
♫Among the clouds and in the sky♫

195
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,890
I've submitted the edict you kept

196
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,570
♫My missing of you is hidden secretly♫

197
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,860
to your emperor.

198
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,140
You have no place in the court.

199
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:04,120
♫Only a light of our predestined love is left there, and it's flickering♫

200
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,900
My mission is completed.

201
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,230
That's good.

202
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,750
In this life,

203
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,860
I can't get your love.

204
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,340
It's also good to get your hatred.

205
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,700
[Auspiciousness and Gook Luck Are Gathered Here]

206
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:42,750
Your Majesty.

207
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,150
Prince Jin has no respect for the law.

208
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,340
As the Nation-protecting General,

209
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,580
he disobeyed the imperial edict

210
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,350
and barged into the city gate to return to the capital.

211
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,550
Moreover,

212
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:53,300
he secretly hid an edict of the late emperor.

213
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,620
He's trying to undermine Your Majesty's power.

214
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,470
Such a person...

215
00:12:59,180 --> 00:12:59,790
Your Majesty,

216
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,100
don't be merciful to him.

217
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,710
How did you know

218
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,410
that the edict was written by the late emperor

219
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,590
and what it was about?

220
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,460
She couldn't protect the edict,

221
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,340
nor can you protect her.

222
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,350
We are both pitiful.

223
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:38,980
You want to die?

224
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,770
It's not that easy.

225
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,430
Shen Keyi.

226
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,270
You can never beat me.

227
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,050
Only I can save Wen Ye.

228
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,540
I love him more than you do.

229
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,940
Your Majesty, I...

230
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,550
Prince Jin.

231
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,390
Prince Jin.

232
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,340
Your Majesty.

233
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,900
I'm here to apologize for my crime.

234
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,940
Please grant me a death, Your Majesty.

235
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,580
Prince Jin.

236
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,500
What crime did you commit?

237
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,090
The first crime

238
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,820
is that I took the liberty to return to the capital.

239
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:56,780
The second crime

240
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,500
is that I killed the Princess of Liang without permission.

241
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,140
You killed her?

242
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:02,980
Yes.

243
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,510
Don't you

244
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,030
want to know

245
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,540
what the imperial edict

246
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,620
in the black iron box

247
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,170
sent by the Princess of Liang was about?

248
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,590
I never thought

249
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,580
this imperial edict would be brought to light again.

250
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,470
No,

251
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,380
I didn't expect

252
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,510
to get this thing

253
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,580
from a foreign princess.

254
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,740
Shen,

255
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,660
take a good look.

256
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,940
Everything written here

257
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,790
is evidence of your collusion with Nanzhu Pavilion.

258
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,780
[Prime Minister Shen Yurong came from a humble family and is greedy for money] 
[He's always been on bad terms with General Wen Ye of Cang]
[He's actually a spy of our country Liang in Cang]

259
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,230
This...

260
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,300
How could it be?

261
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,900
This is impossible.

262
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,460
What about the edict?

263
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,220
Prince Jin and the Princess of Liang State must have…

264
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:16,890
Shen.

265
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,470
At this point,

266
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,460
you still want to find excuses?

267
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,670
Because

268
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,580
you've served three emperors,

269
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,090
you were my teacher when I was young,

270
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,100
and you've contributed a lot to stabilizing the court,

271
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,430
I tolerated you once and again.

272
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:39,990
I didn't expect

273
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,260
you could be so bold.

274
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,350
You embezzled money and took bribes.

275
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,420
And you even committed treason.

276
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,870
Not only did you cause the death

277
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,190
of millions of soldiers who defended the border,

278
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,670
but you also put your finger in my pie again and again.

279
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,740
Your Majesty, please spare me!

280
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,470
Please spare me, Your Majesty!

281
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,270
Please forgive me for being foolish.

282
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,030
It's all...

283
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,790
because of that woman Zuo Shuangzhi.

284
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,380
She kept threatening me.

285
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,580
That's how I descended to the extent

286
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,380
that I committed a capital crime.

287
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,340
Your Majesty,

288
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,270
I have contributed

289
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,860
to Cang.

290
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,940
Please show mercy, Your Majesty.

291
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,510
Please show mercy, Your Majesty!

292
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,780
Shen Yurong

293
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,110
colluded with the spy of Liang State,

294
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,110
sold the military information,

295
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,300
embezzled military rations,

296
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,380
and caused the miss of combat opportunities.

297
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,350
He deserves to die ten thousand times!

298
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,260
There are treacherous officials in the country.

299
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,550
There are treacherous officials in the country.

300
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,150
Prince Jin,

301
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,940
in your view,

302
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,710
what should we do about him?

303
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:53,900
All the property of the Shen family

304
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,860
should be confiscated

305
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,220
to reward the three armies, to support the border defense,

306
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,990
and to award to the families of the dead and wounded soldiers

307
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,190
to comfort their souls.

308
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,230
As for Prime Minister Shen,

309
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,630
I beg your mercy

310
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,460
to exile him to Zhenxi Pass

311
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,630
and to forbid him from returning to the capital ever.

312
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,580
Shen Yurong's crime is so serious

313
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,980
that it will not be too much to execute him.

314
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,140
Prince Jin, why do you

315
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,950
spare his life?

316
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,300
Your Majesty is benevolent

317
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,420
and shows mercy to a senior official who served three emperors.

318
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,830
My selfish intention is

319
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,590
that I hope Prime Minister Shen

320
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,070
could feel the endless snow

321
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,030
in Zhenxi Pass

322
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,340
and feel the pain we felt when we were trapped in the cold.

323
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,230
Only in this way

324
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,790
can we console the dead officers and soldiers.

325
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,430
Do as

326
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,140
what Prince Jin said.

327
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:07,950
Is your wound

328
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,070
all right?

329
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,380
I'll ask the imperial physician to treat you.

330
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,180
Brother.

331
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,630
It's just a minor injury.

332
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,430
Don't worry.

333
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:19,910
Is that

334
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,910
from Zuo Shuangzhi?

335
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,020
I don't know why

336
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,740
Zuo Shuangzhi gave me

337
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,740
the evidence of her collusion with Shen Yurong.

338
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,180
I asked her if she needed sanctuary.

339
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,220
She only asked me

340
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,180
to grant her one last request.

341
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,940
I love Prince Jin,

342
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,470
but I couldn't get him.

343
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,420
Someone told me

344
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,660
love is not destruction,

345
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,700
but protection.

346
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,220
I want to know

347
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,340
how to protect someone.

348
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,620
I know I can't escape the death penalty.

349
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,910
My only wish

350
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,510
is to die in his hands.

351
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,020
From then on,

352
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,220
all the love and hatred can end there.

353
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,490
It turns out

354
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,350
all she wanted was to die.

355
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,070
No wonder she said those words to provoke me.

356
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:23,630
The woman

357
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,790
was deeply in love.

358
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:27,750
In my opinion,

359
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,620
we should keep her body whole

360
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,260
and send it back to Liang State.

361
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,540
I'll do as you say.

362
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,150
By the way,

363
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,070
when the Princess of Liang

364
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,620
came to deliver the evidence,

365
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:40,780
she also said

366
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:41,980
this was a deal she made

367
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,740
with someone.

368
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,110
Could it be

369
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,830
a deal she made with you?

370
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,710
Is she

371
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,070
still alive?

372
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,190
Brother,

373
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:04,900
I have a request.

374
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,750
Please permit it.

375
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,300
Go ahead.

376
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,230
I

377
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,310
want to resign from my position and military power,

378
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:14,420
leave the court,

379
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:15,660
and become a commoner.

380
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,420
There will no longer be a Prince Jin in the court.

381
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:20,710
I'm going to look for her.

382
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,750
You...

383
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,620
Have you made up your mind?

384
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:34,620
Yes.

385
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,100
Come.

386
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,670
Third Brother.

387
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,380
When I was young,

388
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,700
I was

389
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,350
jealous of your intelligence and kung fu.

390
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,230
I was so jealous

391
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,420
that I even pretended to have accidentally pushed you into the lake of the garden.

392
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,350
But I regretted it right away.

393
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,190
You're the brother with whom I grew up together.

394
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,420
Actually,

395
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,900
I never suspected you.

396
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,420
But many times,

397
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,500
in order to balance the fractions of the court,

398
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,940
I had to behave that way.

399
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,500
If it's just because of

400
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,950
the edict of which the existence is not even for sure,

401
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,650
you don't have to do this.

402
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,020
Brother.

403
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,380
It's all in the past.

404
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:34,870
As you know,

405
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,820
I don't care about fame or status.

406
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,970
Now that the war is over,

407
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:40,900
I think

408
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,110
it's time to have a good rest.

409
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,110
Alright.

410
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:47,830
I

411
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,140
approve.

412
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,210
Thank you, Brother.

413
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,270
Brother,

414
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:55,570
I can

415
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,820
focus on looking for her.

420
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,180
I've found

421
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,380
the path I'm going to take,

422
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,750
which is to protect the country

423
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,980
where you can live and work in peace.

424
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,500
My name is Zhou Yu.

425
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,020
The sky is high enough for the bird to fly freely.

426
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,340
The ocean is vast enough for the fish to swim around.

427
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,230
What?

428
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:33,860
Here you are.

429
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,300
What's that?

430
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,020
It's fake.

431
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:43,900
It's a fake grasshopper.

432
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,990
This is a fake grasshopper.

433
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,630
Come and sit.

434
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,020
I didn't expect you to be so cowardly.

435
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,980
You are never serious

436
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,070
and always make fun of me.

437
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:56,910
It's true this time.

438
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:58,780
I don't believe it.

439
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,740
Really.

440
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,420
This is real. Look.

441
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,420

442
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:14,900
Do you like it?

443
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,020
Why do you give me this for no reason?

444
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:23,430
I...

445
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,510
I like you, that's why.

446
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,830
