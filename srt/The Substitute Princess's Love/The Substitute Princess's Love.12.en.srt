Besides, it was just a misunderstanding.

7

I've explained it clearly.

8
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,380
But with your personality,

9
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,700
if you stay in Prince Jin's Mansion,

10
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,700
can you bear all kinds of rules and will you be happy?

11
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,380
I'll say the same thing.

I'd rather stay with him.

19

Sometimes, freedom is big.

20
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,260
It might be so big that it extends to the end of the world.

21
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,979
Sometimes, it's very small.

22

How do you know he won't take a concubine?

27
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:21,260
In the future, there might be many women who will compete with you for a man.

28

Are you also willing to accept that?

00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,230
How's everything going with your preparation?

00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,100
Your Majesty.

185
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,310
There was a fortress in Quezhou,

186
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,740
and the building inside there is complete.

187
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,110
After we renovate it, it can be used as a military fort

188
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,100
and a warehouse.

189
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,210
After the renovation is finished,

190
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,230
I'll go to Quezhou personally

191
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,510
to check the construction work.

192
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:03,660
Okay.

193
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,150

196
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,140
Be careful.

197

Your Highness.

198
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,750
Come and see which pot of flowers looks better.

199
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:15,830
Slowly.

200
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,500
Slowly.

201
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,460

202
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,260
I think this is good.

203
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,740
The flowers inside the pot are quite exquisite, too.

204
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,070
Lady Yunying loves butterfly orchids the most.

205
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,940
There are so many flowers in this cart.

206
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,590
If a pot of them is missing, Her Highness won't discover it, right?

207
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,430
It looks nice.

208
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,150
Is this a bit short?

209
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,460
A little. Besides, there is one bud on each side.

210
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:49,500
Then let's choose this one.

211
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,630
Take this inside.

212
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,940
They're so beautiful.

213

Have you seen that pot of butterfly orchids

214
00:11:59,100 --> 00:11:59,980
which I bought with a lot of money?

215
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:01,670
Was it here just now?

216
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,110
Yes.

217
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,940
Why can't I see it?

218
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:06,790
Have you seen the butterfly orchids?

219
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,100
No, I haven't.

220
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,230
There is thief in the mansion?

221
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,100
He's just too unscrupulous in broad daylight.

Maybe because His Highness loved Her Highness so much that

352

His Highness didn't make a big deal out of it.

353

00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,300
doesn't quite care what other people wear.

367
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,330
Then what does she like to eat?

368
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,830
How about I make some snacks to show my respect?

369
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,670
I don't know the rules in the palace.

370
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,260
What if something goes wrong?

371
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,420
Silly girl.

372
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,670
You don't need to butter others up.

373
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,380
When you're by my side, just be yourself.

374
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,380
Your Highness.

375
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,860
How is the family feast in the palace usually arranged?

376
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,590
Does everyone also eat together

377
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,300
on the same table?

378
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,710
Can we get full?

379
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,190
Or do we need to put down the chopsticks after having a few bites?

380
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,340
You don't need to be overcautious.

381
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,310
It's just like how you eat in the mansion.

382
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,260
You can eat whatever you want.

383
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:53,420
Okay.

384
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,420
You're by my side anyway,

385
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,380
so I won't be nervous.

386
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:04,580
Your Highness.

387
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:05,860
Who is it?

388
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:06,950
Your Highness.

389
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,370
Her Grace said that she wanted to discuss something important with you,

390
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,990
so you should attend the banquet alone.

391
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,060
Princess Jin, please go back.

392
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,810
What's going on? Why did Her Grace suddenly...

393
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:14,620
Your Highness.

394
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,630
It's all right.

395
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,630
I don't know the rules anyway,

396
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,540
and I feel very worried.

397
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,110
Now this is good, as I can go home for dinner.

398
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,620
But this is our first time...

399
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,300
Your Highness, it's really okay.

400
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,820
I'll wait for you at home. Just go at once.

401
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,420
Okay.

402
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,230
Go ask someone

403
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,590
to clean the yard.

404
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,430
Hurry up.

405
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,390
Your Highness.

406
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,300
Didn't you go to the palace to attend the banquet with His Highness?

407
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:01,830
How come

408
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,700
you're back alone?

409
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,310
The Empress Dowager didn't want to see me,

410
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,830
so she asked me to come back halfway.

411
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,270
It seems that she doesn't like me.

412
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,820
It's okay, Your Highness.

413
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,630
Don't care about it too much.

414
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,980
You usually stay in Prince's Mansion,

415
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:19,900
while Her Grace

416
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,690
lives in the imperial palace.

417
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,260
You might not see each other even once in a month.

418
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,790
But she's Prince Jin's mother.

419
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,070
I'm supposed to call her mother, too.

420
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,310
I just want my mother to like me.

421
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:44,750
Your Highness.

422
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,540
In fact, in the palace,

423
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:53,990
there's only the Empress Dowager and the Emperor. There are no mothers or brothers.

424
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,670
Then does His Highness have any relatives?

425
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,750
The imperial family is different from ordinary people.

426
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,060
His Highness has been

427
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,140
living like this since childhood.

428
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,540
His Highness is such a poor guy.

429
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,070
However,

430
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,740
His Highness still has you.

431
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,820
You're His Highness's family.

432
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,510
You've been guarding His Highness all these years.

433
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,340
Although the imperial palace is not His Highness's home,

434
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,560
[Auspiciousness and Good Luck Are Gathered Here]

435
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:27,390
this place is his home.

436
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,830
Our home will get better and better.

437
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:30,820
Am I right, Uncle Fu?

438
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,060
Yes.

439
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:32,860
I'll

440
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,420
protect this mansion,

441
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,300
His Highness

442
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,020
and Your Highness well.

443
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:50,110
[Auspiciousness and Good Luck Are Gathered Here]

444
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,670
Ye, why aren't you eating more food?

445
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,660
Do you not like the food?

446
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:10,870
Eat more.

447
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:12,740
Okay.

448
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:19,550
By the way,

449
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,590
I heard that

450
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,540
the jade pendant which the late emperor had given to you was broken.

451
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,990
I didn't keep it properly,

452
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,340
and I've wasted my father's kindness.

453
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,550
The late emperor

454
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,340
wanted to make sure that you would be safe all your life.

455
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,670
In the future, I don't know how many

456
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,660
open criticisms or secret plots there will be in the palace to go against you.

457
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,590
Mother, don't worry.

458
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,490
I've done nothing wrong.

459
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,150
That's good.

460
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,750
Recently,

461
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,350
I've heard the rumor that

462
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,590
you and your wife are deeply in love.

463
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,740
I'm curious then.

464
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:12,540
What is so special about Miss Shen,

465
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,700
which made you fall in love with her?

466
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,260
Why do you think that's merely a rumor?

467
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,870
So you mean

468
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,700
it's true?

469
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,140
Thank you for caring about my life.

470
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:32,820
Mother.

471
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:34,900
I'm full.

472
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,070
I'll take my leave.

473
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,550
Your Highness.

474
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,540
These are the crabs from Mingyue Lake in Jiangnan regions, which are given to His Majesty as tributes?

475
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:05,380
Yes, Your Highness.

476
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,830
These are the fresh crabs from Mingyue Lake

477
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,700
in Jiangnan regions, which are delivered here at top speed.

478
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,860
Though there is only a small number of them, they are very delicious.

479
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:11,910
Each of them is good.

480
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:15,950
Your Highness,

481
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,780
these crabs are for His Majesty's dinner.

482
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,820
Besides, there are only a few crabs.

483
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,670
If His Majesty asks about them...

484
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,060
Just tell His Majesty I took them.

485
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,220
Your Highness.

486
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:36,350
Sister!

487
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,140
Your Highness.

488
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,470
Sister.

489
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,070
I need your help.

490
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,500
These crabs were intercepted by me when I came across an envoy on the palace road.

491
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,980
I've never seen you

492
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,110
make a big fuss for crabs.

493
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,340
Sister, don't make fun of me.

494
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,710
I just want my wife to taste them.

495
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,420
But she has never eaten crabs.

496
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,270
If I put them in front of her after they are steamed,

497
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,430
I'm afraid she won't know how to eat them.

498
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,940
Instead, she might feel embarrassed.

499
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,100
So,

500
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,820
I'd like to ask you

501
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,350
to make them into Stuffed Orange with Crab Meat.

502

My wife likes sweet food.

503
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:10,990
I'm sure she'll like it.

504
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:12,500
Okay.

505
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:13,830
Here you are.

506
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,660
Since my brother wants to please his wife,

507
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,300
as your sister,

508
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,700
I'll surely do my best to make this dish.

509
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:32,030
[Xingyue Pavilion]

510
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,500
Your Highness.

511
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,540
Why are you back so early?

512
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,420
I prepared it for you. Open it to take a look.

513
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:13,540
What is this?

514
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,500
These are the crabs from Mingyue Lake in Jiangnan regions.

515
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,270
When I left the palace, I met an envoy who was offering crabs as tributes,

516
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,830
so I asked him for a few crabs, and made them into Stuffed Orange with Crab Meat.

517
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,540
Stuffed Orange with Crab Meat?

518
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,940
The precious crabs and this ordinary orange

519
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,100
can be made into such a special snack?

520
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,150
Yes.

521
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,940
Crabs taste better when they are cooked with oranges.

522
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,740
Though oranges are ordinary,

523
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,340
they can remove the coldness of crabs

524
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,180
and protect the stomach.

525
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,030
Although crabs are rare and precious,

526
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,820
when they are combined with an orange,

527
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,390
and made into Stuffed Orange with Crab Meat,

528
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,250
their freshness will be greatly improved.

529
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:46,870
Look.

530
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:50,090
Though the orange and the crab meat look different,

531
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,310
they can actually complement each other.

532
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,180
When they are together,

533
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,390
both of them can be in the best state.

534
00:28:59,330 --> 00:28:59,900
It turns out that

535
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:02,470
oranges can also become precious

536
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,550
and be liked by many people.

537
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:06,420
Yes.

00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,030
In my eyes,

539
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,350
oranges have always been the best.

00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,320
♫Only a few years to spend with you♫

550
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,640
♫Are far from enough♫

551
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,480
♫I got an unexpected period of time♫

552
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,040
♫It was worth it to wander in loneliness in the past on a horseback♫

553
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:04,590
♫If it's a beautiful dream, what's wrong with going separate ways to our ends?♫

554
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:10,940
♫Love is a reward, and I'm willing to wander if it lasts long♫

555
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:15,630
♫Because the flowers once bloomed, I won't forget them after seeing them♫

556
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:19,470
♫Do you know this glance♫

557
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:26,070
♫Is the gaze that has made us stay so far away from each other?♫

558
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:32,880
