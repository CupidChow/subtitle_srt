00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,460
we held our wedding ceremony.

190
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,260
I wasn't present that day. The wedding didn't count.

191
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,300
Why?

192
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,500
How can the prince's mansion not acknowledge things that happened?

193
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,660
Besides, I slept with you

194
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,420
in a shabby temple the night before.

195
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,130
Don't talk nonsense.

196
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,340
It's fine if you don't dare to admit it.

197
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,660
I'll pretend it never happened.

198
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,420
I won't mention it again.

199
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,820
Why can't I admit it?

200
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:11,530
I was injured that day. It was because I was injured.

201
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,700
You were indeed injured.

202
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,300
But you were quite strong when you forced me.

203
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,420
I asked her to get some water.

204
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,900
Just to get some water.

205
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,180
Yes, get some water.

206
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,020
Get some water.

207
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,780
Get some water.

208
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,140
Forget it.

209
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,620
Ask someone to send her back to the Prime Minister’s Mansion.

210
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,460
I don't want to see her anymore.

211
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:38,900
Yes.

212
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,220
No, Your Highness. I'm married to you.

213
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,780
[Prince Jin’s Mansion]

214
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,700
If you want to kick me out,

215
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,100
you might as well kill me.

216
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:47,860
Whatever.

217
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:50,900
Get some water.

218
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,180
Your Highness, wait for me.

219
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,500
Did she really go get water?

220
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,110
[Prince Jin’s Mansion]

221
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,700
What else?

222
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,330
[Prince Jin’s Mansion]

223
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,140
Nanny, the prince's mansion is so cold.

224
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,020
I'll bring you here once I finish my mission.

225
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,260
We'll have a home then.

226
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,500
Your Highness, it's spring now,

227
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,820
but it's still cold.

228
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,140
It's snowing heavily tonight.

229
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,220
I've made a charcoal fire for you.

230
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,980
It'll warm you up at night.

231
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,500
Steward Yi.

232
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,050
No need.

233
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,300
In the future, there's no need

234
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:13,850
to kindle a fire in my tent.

235
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,060
Your Highness.

236
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,820
That would freeze your body.

237
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,860
Although I'm back,

238
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,260
I feel like I'm still in Zhenxi Pass.

239
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,180
It was snowing day and night there

240
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,180
endlessly.

241
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,620
We lacked clothes and food.

242
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,850
Many of our fellows

243
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,060
never made it through the nights.

244
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,820
Your Highness, the war is over.

245
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,460
Don't...

246
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,180
Punish yourself anymore.

247
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,220
But they entrusted their lives to me.

248
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,700
I failed to protect them.

249
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:00,540
General.

250
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,740
Each of us in our battalion

251
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,020
took a piece of our own sword tassel

252
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:04,980
and asked the military doctor

253
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,740
to assemble them into a new one.

254
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,380
This battle will be dangerous.

255
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,740
If we can't come back,

256
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,700
please take this sword tassel back to the capital.

257
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,410
Consider it as returning to the court for us.

258
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,180
Report!

259
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,260
General.

260
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,740
The entire scouting camp died in Shanyin Valley.

261
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,900
We can definitely go back.

262
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,420
We'll return to the capital in triumph together.

263
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,380
By the way,

264
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,380
prepare a carriage for the girl from the Shen family at the door.

265
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,180
Send her back when she's ready.

266
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,380
Yes, Your Highness.

267
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,430
[Prince Jin’s Mansion]

268
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,290
Bodhisattva has shown his presence.

269
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,740
His Highness has returned safely.

270
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,450
This is...

271
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,940
Are you Miss Shen?

272
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,900
My name is Shen Keyi.

273
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,980
You are...

274
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,980
Prince Jin's legitimate wife?

275
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,300
What are you talking about?

276
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,010
This is His Highness's elder sister.

277
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,619
His Majesty granted her the title of Lady Yunying.

278
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,900
Miss Shen, you misunderstood.

279
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,420
A few days ago, the news of His Highness's death came.

280
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,579
I went to the Dazhao Temple to pray.

281
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,819
I came back as soon as I got the news today.

282
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,140
Your Ladyship, she is a member of the Shen family.

283
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:26,420
Why are you telling her so much?

284
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,780
Miss Shen, why are you sitting at the door?

285
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,980
His Highness wants me to leave, but I want to stay.

286
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,700
Aren't you afraid of him?

287
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,220
I am.

288
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,380
His Highness is always pulling a long face. He's fierce.

289
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,860
His Highness

290
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,980
is very stubborn.

291
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,260
It's hard to change his decision.

292
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,930
It's okay. I can change it.

293
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,340
My name is Shen Keyi.

294
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,020
Keyi means "can." I can do things that other people can't.

295
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,420
Here.

296
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,500
Take it.

297
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,980
What a silly girl.

298
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:47,880
[Jin]

299
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,700
Thank you, Guard Wan.

300
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,740
His Highness still refuses to sleep in the room?

301
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,220
He has been outside for so many years.

302
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,180
Now he's finally back to the capital.

303
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,860
He doesn't even want to sleep in his room

304
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,820
but to set up a tent in the yard.

305
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,500
This house doesn't look like home anymore.

306
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,740
His Highness is carrying too much burden.

307
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,770
He doesn't dare to slack off for a moment.

308
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,020
But the war is over.

309
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,300
The living must move forward eventually.

310
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,140
Your Ladyship.

311
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,420
Allow me to say one word.

312
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,980
His Highness won't tolerate the daughter of the Shen family.

313
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,500
He will chase her away in a few days.

314
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,620
You don't have to

315
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,900
waste your energy on someone from the Shen family.

316
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,890
There's always a way to subdue one thing.

317
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,220
I think this princess is a wonderful person.

318
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:16,420
Guard Wan, it's late. Let's go back.

319
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,220
Thank you for your umbrella. I'll send someone to return it to you tomorrow.

320
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,340
You Ladyship, you can keep it.

[Prince Jin’s Mansion]

322
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,180
Your Highness.

323
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,580
Your Highness, you haven't had breakfast, have you?

324
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,060
Have some warm porridge.

326
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,460
Your Highness, it's my fault.

327
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,820
Miss Shen didn't leave.

328
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,060
Give her the porridge.

329
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,060
Thank you, Your Highness.

331
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,490
After having your food,

332
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,660
we'll be a family.

333
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,500
Don't drink it.

334
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,700
Your Highness.

335
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,100
I've never had such delicious porridge.

336
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,860
I won't eat for free.

337
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,010
I will repay you.

338
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:59,020
Honey.

339
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:03,940
What are you talking about?

340
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,460
What honey?

341
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,940
According to seniority, you should call me Uncle.

342
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,380
Uncle?

343
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,260
Then we are relatives.

344
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,100
Can't I live in your house?

345
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,260
Nonsense.

[Prince Jin's Mansion]

348
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,580
His Highness ignored me.

349
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,220
I will try to get him to talk to me.

350
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,500
[Prince Jin’s Mansion]

351
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,860
It's just a door.

Sir, calm down.

The Shen family is really good at playing these little tricks.

357
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,380
You don't have to be angry about it.

358
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,770
Has she left?

359
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,220
She's still sitting at the gate.

360
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,500
It's troublesome to be back in the capital.

If she's in the military camp,

362
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,260
I won't care about her gender and background.

363
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,620
I'll just throw her out.

Although she's a member of the Shen family,

I can't let her die for me.

But this marriage is bestowed by His Majesty.

370

00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,140
means having one more spy.

373
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,740
In the future, we will be restricted in everything

374
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,180
we do in the mansion.

375
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,180
The mansion is not like the barracks.

376
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,700
Besides, Her Highness is delicate.

377
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,700
You can't beat her or scold her.

378
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,450
You can only hide and practice swordsmanship.

379
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,740
Is this my mansion or the backyard of the Shen family?

380
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,300
Miss Shen, stop sweeping.

381
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,180
There are many servants in the mansion.

382
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,820
It's not appropriate.

383
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:18,900
It's okay, Uncle Fu.

384
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,180
Miss Shen, My Lady, please stop sweeping.

385
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,420
How many days has it been snowing?

386
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,140
If His Highness sees this...

387
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:26,290
Your Highness.

388
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:28,820
Uncle.

389
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:31,740
Uncle.

390
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,220
Good morning.

391
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,340
Call me Your Highness. Don't try to get intimate with me as a relative.

392
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,660
Your Highness, I said I would repay you.

393
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,220
I can really do a lot of work.

394
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,100
I swept the snow.

395
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:45,660
What?

396
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,500
Don't we have servants, Yi Fu?

397
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:50,580
Your Highness, I'm guilty.

398
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,940
It was Miss Shen who insisted on sweeping the snow in front of the door.

399
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,740
I couldn't... stop her.

400
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,460
Good.

401
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,170
Good.

402
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,740
Your Highness, Miss Shen always lives at the door.

403
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,260
It's not appropriate.

404
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:11,050
How about I prepare a guest room for her?

405
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,500
I think she likes to live in front of other people's doors.

406
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,740
Let her be.

407
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,620
When she doesn't feel comfortable,

408
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,420
she'll go back.

409
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,780
Your Highness,

410
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,260
I feel comfortable staying here.

411
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,220
Can I continue sweeping the snow?

412
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,420
Shen Keyi.

413
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,940
Steward Yi, His Highness just said yes.

414
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,890
Good morning, Your Highness. Good noon, Your Highness.

415
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,980
Your Highness, I've watered the flowers.

416
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,940
Your Highness, I've swept the floor.

417
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,740
Your Highness, I've cleaned the doors.

418
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,090
Your Highness.

419
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,060
Your Highness.

420
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,650
Your Highness, do you think this stone lion

421
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:05,660
looks even more imposing after being cleaned?

422
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,220
Is this His Highness's?

423
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,300
Your Highness.

424
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,820
Miss Shen, His Highness has ordered you not to enter the mansion.

425
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,010
Here comes the imperial edict.

426
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,140
Brother, the imperial edict is here. Come out and receive the edict.

427
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,620
Where is Her Highness?

428
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,210
Yi Fu, did she go back?

429
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,700
Miss Shen seems to have left.

430
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,960
[Prince Jin’s Mansion]

431
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,500
No way.

432
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,340
The imperial edict can only be announced when Her Highness is here.

433
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,260
Then don't announce it.

434
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,700
Brother, don't embarrass His Majesty.

435
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,740
So many people are here, huh?
