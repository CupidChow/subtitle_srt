00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,710
I've been hiding something from you for a long time.

6
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,229
I'm guilty and I deserve to die.

Your Highness,

I did lie to you today.

I didn't come with the marriage alliance team,

15
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,940
I was abducted and taken here by someone from Nanzhu Pavilion.

16
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,310
I only found out about the marriage alliance thing

17

18

19

to be their spy in the mansion.

20

I refused,

21
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,260
so they humiliated me.

22
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,540
After I entered the mansion,

23
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,660
they were still looking for me

In Liang State,

28
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,350
I was a princess who was not favored.

29
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,210
I was born a pawn who had no choice.

30
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,829
Since I was engaged to you,

31
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:52,970
I would become a member in Prince Jin's Mansion.

32
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,220
I didn't want to betray my future husband.

33
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,670
And I didn't want to ruin

34
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,310
the hard-won peace between the two states.

35
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,830
What did Nanzhu Pavilion threaten you to do?

36
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,380
They asked me

37
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,220
to report the situation in the mansion to them,

38
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,180
so that they can find a chance to assassinate you.

41
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,540
I don't know much.

42
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,940
I only know that the leader of Nanzhu Pavilion

43
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,300
lives in Huaifeng Pavilion.

44
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,030
There is a tavern in the east of the city.

45
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,220
It's where they usually deliver secret letters.

46
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,470
Back then,

47
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,820
I was locked up in this tavern.

132

00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,580
Just for Shen Keyi and her baby?

380
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,460
Do you know what consequence there will be?

381
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,150
Princess,

382
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,110
I'm begging you.

383
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,550
Please let me go get an imperial physician.

384
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,910
If it's not too late,

385
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,870
the child might be saved.

386
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,340
If it's too late...

387
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:07,820
Why?

388
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,150
Why would everyone protect her?

389
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,940
I can give birth to a child for His Highness.

390
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,780
Why must it be her?

391
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,140
My life is worthless.

392
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,500
Even if I have to die today,

393
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,300
I will protect Her Highness

394
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,340
and the baby in her womb.

395
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:25,770
Really?

396
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,380
His Highness has Uncle Fu.

397
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,140
Uncle Fu is his family.

398
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,620
You've been protecting him all these years.

399
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:00,700
Uncle Fu,

400
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,860
this is not easy.

401
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,670
From now on, you'll take care of everything

402
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,420
related to Xingyue Pavilion.

403
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,700
All these years,

404
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,940
the scenery here hasn't changed a bit.

405
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,550
But it's the place I want to guard the most

406
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,820
in my life.

407
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,130
If there is a baby,

408
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,660
it wouldn't be so empty

409
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,150
or cheerless, right?

410
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,470
Is it better for the child to resemble His Highness

411
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,230
or Her Highness?

412
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,820
Maybe it's better

413
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,530
for the child to resemble Her Highness.

414
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,470
Your Highness, you're bleeding.

415
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,310
Tao.

416
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,020
Go see

417
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,510
if the imperial physician is here.

418
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,470
What about you?

419
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,710
I can do this.

420
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:29,950
Go now.

421
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:30,790
Okay.

422
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:31,950
Hang in there.

423
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,460
Keyi,

424
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,500
are you alright?

425
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,020
Steward Yi

426
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,820
may not come.

427
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,140
Without His Highness's permission,

428
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,350
why did Steward Yi have the guts...

429
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,010
You are lying.

430
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,940
No matter what,

431
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,380
His Highness would never do anything like this.

432
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,270
What medicine do you think you've been drinking

433
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,990
these days?

434
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,260
His Highness doesn't want this child at all.

435
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,990
That's why he's been hiding it from you

436
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,510
and giving you abortion medicine every day.

437
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,390
Nonsense!

438
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,900
I'm with His Highness every day.

439
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,510
We are very intimate.

440
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,620
I'm the one who knows him the best in this world.

441
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,830
I know what he thinks.

442
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:42,380
Why would I talk nonsense?

443
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:46,540
Keyi,

444
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,430
I forgot to tell you.

445
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:49,710
Actually,

446
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,270
I've known His Highness since I was little.

447
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,850
I was rebellious.

448
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,620
I even left a scar

449
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,780
on his palm.

450
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,350
A long time ago,

451
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,540
a little girl was going to be bullied.

452
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,540
I wanted to save her,

453
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,540
but I didn't expect her to scratch me.

454
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,870
Didn't she say she would give herself to you and marry no one else but you?

455
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,380
It was you.

456
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:16,970
Since then,

457
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,050
we've been in love with each other.

458
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,230
His Highness

459
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,060
gave me a dagger

460
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,220
as a token,

461
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,470
hoping we could meet again.

462
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:28,900
But I didn't expect

463
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,350
that you played a trick to marry into Prince Jin's Mansion and steal my lover.

464
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,500
Shen Keyi.

465
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,060
You are the fifth wheel.

466
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,580
These days, His Highness

467
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,660
has tolerated you and deliberately kept a distance from you.

468
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,580
He doesn't even want to acknowledge your child.

469
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,060
You wouldn't leave Prince Jin's Mansion.

470
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,140
That's why things have come to this.

471
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,340
I can leave.

472
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,690
I can leave now.

473
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,100
But please save my child.

474
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:01,290
I promise I'll take the baby far away

475
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:03,410
and never show up in front of you.

476
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,740
Save him.

477
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,460
You just had a miscarriage.

478
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:22,660
You should take good care of yourself.

479
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,660
Don't move anymore.

480
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,390
Let me go to the doctor.

481
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,130
Please.

482
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:38,760
♫I took off the winding light sent by the moon♫

483
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:46,500
♫I cut the hidden line at the center of the palm silently♫

484
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:50,110
♫We failed to meet again♫

485
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:54,170
♫This love has lasted for several rounds of reincarnation♫

486
00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:00,510
♫The mystery of love can't be solved, but I'm still indulged in it♫

487
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,930
♫Who is destined to♫

488
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:07,090
♫Lose his chance and face the chaotic situation?♫

489
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:09,990
♫The memories of happiness and sorrow♫

490
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:14,450
♫Are engraved in my heart, and have become my nightmares♫

491
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,970
♫Who stood opposite the destiny♫

492
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:22,100
♫And took one more look at the old smiling face?♫

493
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,260
Run.

494
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,790
I'd like to see in the mansion,

495
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,030
♫I'm not able to escape from♫

496
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:30,100
♫The parting where prosperity has withered♫

497
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,510
who else will come to save you.

498
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:33,990
Your Highness,

499
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,500
his name is Tang Ti.

500
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,230
He should be the leader of Nanzhu Pavilion.

501
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,250
This is the man who sold fishes at the fish stall in the west market, right?

502
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,070
Yes.

503
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:41,660
There is something fishy.

504
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,660
I've fought with the leader of Nanzhu Pavilion many times.

505
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:44,630
This person

506
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,350
doesn't look like him.

507
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:47,650
Sir,

508
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:50,430
do you mean the leader is someone else?

509
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,630
Anyway, we can't let our guard down.

510
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,230
Nanzhu Pavilion's people are very cunning.

511
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,030
Send more men

512
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,430
to patrol the capital.

513
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,340
If you find anyone suspicious,

514
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,260
report immediately.

515
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:00,980
Yes.

516
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,820
Report!

517
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,020
Your Highness,

518
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,660
Steward Yi asked someone to deliver a message.

519
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,110
You should go home as soon as possible.

520
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:06,500
Please.

521
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,770
Let me go to the doctor.

522
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,980
The child is innocent.

523
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:11,910
Innocent?

524
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,270
Both you and I were born

525
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,590
with the sin of our parents.

526
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:18,550
No one is innocent.

527
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,950
Without you,

528
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,100
he would definitely have feelings for me.

529
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:25,630
Today...

530
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,100
Ke.

531
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:35,190
Ke.

532
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:35,820
Ke.

533
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:36,870
How are you feeling?

534
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,340
I'm gonna take you to the doctor.

535
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:41,870
Let's go.

536
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:43,950
Who are you?

537
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:44,820
You can't take her away.

538
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,340
Get out of my way!

539
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,860
There are so many people who want to save you.

540
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:58,940
Just go.

541
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,710
Never come back.

542
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:08,380
Mr. Zhou. Mr. Zhou.

543
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:09,930
The doctor is here. This way.
