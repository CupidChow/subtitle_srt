Hurry up.

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,979

00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:39,380
Okay.

Hurry up.

11
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:48,020
Your Highness, thank you for pleading for me.

12
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,020
From now on, I'll do my best to serve you,

13
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:53,020
even at the expense of my own life.

14
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,090
Steward Yi,

15
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:56,580
You don't have to be so grateful.

16
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,940
It was just a small favor.

17
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,100
His Highness said that

18
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,300
there were too few servants in your residence,

19
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:02,980
so I

20
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,340
carefully selected some capable servants

21
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,100

His Highness said that

00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,300
Tao had made contributions by protecting her master,

30
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,780
so she should be rewarded.

31
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,460
You'll be promoted

32

Thank you, Steward Yi.

Thank you, Your Highness.

35
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,700
From now on,

36
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,900
you must serve Her Highness more carefully.

37
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,380
Yes.

38
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,300
From now on, I'll take good care of you, Your Highness.

39
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,020
Thank you for your arrangement, Steward Yi.

40
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,460
Don't thank me.

41
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,460
You should thank His Highness.

42
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,329
Everything

43
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,020

45
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,010
just do it quickly.

-Okay.

47
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,860
I've never seen you so patient,

48
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,730
and you've arranged so many things for your wife.

49

She was beaten in order to save Tao.

50
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,100
She's kind and faithful.

51
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,660
I should reward her.

52
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,020
It's such a valuable jade pendant.

53
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,620
It was the death-exemption plate given by the late emperor.

54
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,660
You just gave it to her like that?

55
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,980
This reward

56
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,580
is really big.

57
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,850
These are all worldly possessions.

58
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:17,940
I gave it to her without thinking too much.

59
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,340
By the way, Sister,

60
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,940
please prepare some

61
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,740
women's jewelry and clothes,

62
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:27,770
and send them to her

63
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,579
so that she won't always look so shabby.

64
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,260
Even the servants might not be able to recognize her.

65
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,340
Just now, didn't you say that

66
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,860
you would fulfill only one of her wishes?

67
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,900

70
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,770
I know that

71
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,660
your wife's surname is Shen.

72
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,020
It's hard for you to lower your guard against her.

73
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,490
But she is a good girl.

74
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:00,940
Look at this home.

75
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,900
It has become different because of her.

76
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,460
She is just a girl.

77
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,780
It's impossible that she's capable of changing the mansion.

78
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,820
In the past, if you came back to the capital,

79
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,540
you would stay in the military camp day and night.

80
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,370
But these days,

81
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:19,940
after you finished the court meeting, you would come back to your mansion.

82
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:23,460
There is even more food in the mansion.

83
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,820
I came back to the mansion in order to keep an eye on Shen Keyi.

84
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,380
I was worried that she would cause trouble again and again.

85
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,180
Fine.

86
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,490
Whatever you said is right.

87
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,460
But the saint also said that

88
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,180
we shouldn't recommend someone just because what he says is good,

89
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,740
and we shouldn't give up taking someone's advice just because of his bad conduct.

90
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,260
You're a well-educated man who has read many books.

91
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:47,659
Since when have you completely opposed someone

92
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,580
just because of a surname?

93
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,820
Your wife may be different from her father.

94
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:53,820
Right?

95
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,740
Your Highness.

96
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,260
In the character "An", there's the character "Nv".

97
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,740
It means that only with a woman

98
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,100
can this family be complete.

99
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,060
Though it's not easy to trust others,

100
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,460
you can't just give up trusting everyone.

101
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,340
Life is not a battlefield.

102
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,500
There's no need to see it very clearly

103
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,100
or decide who is the winner.

104
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,250
I've kept your words

105
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,540
in mind.

106
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,300
It's surprising that Prince Jin vented his anger for the sake of a girl,

107
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,900
which made people all over the city gossip about it.

108
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,659
Does he have a crush on her?

109
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:40,700
Your Grace.

110
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,890
Of course not.

111
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,340
A few days ago, His Highness even ordered that

112
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,540
Her Highness shouldn't go near the Shanglin Pavilion.

113
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,980
The personality of His Highness is always like this.

114
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,300
He can't bear to see someone bully the weak.

115
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,380
That's why he vented his anger for the sake of Her Highness.

116
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,420
Besides,

117
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,900
he could also teach Prime Minister Shen a lesson by doing this

118
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,860
so as to humiliate the Shen Family.

119
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,940
It was not because of love.

120
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,740
That's good.

121
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,940
It's good that Prince Jin has the wit to think of such a strategy.

122
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,780
I thought that

123
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,380
he fell in love with a girl,

124
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,380
which made him do something irrational.

125
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,460
He wouldn't.

What matters is that

How will we kill him?

137
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,780
Do we have to follow Shen Yurong's plan of

stealing the jade pendant

139
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,620

It'll still take some time for our reinforcements, Men of Sacrifice, to enter the capital.

144

gave her the jade pendant so easily.

His Highness even went to the Xingyue Pavilion for an investigation.

00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,820
isn't she always worried about her nanny?

189
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,180
How come she would dare to...

190
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,300
There's no nanny.

191
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,500
Her nanny died a long time ago.

192
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,940
Has she found out about it?

193
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,100
Madam.

194
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,580
What should we do now?

195
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:09,900
If His Highness knows this,

196
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,620
I'll be beheaded.

197
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,100
Madam, please save me!

198
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,260
Please save me!

199
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,300
By now, Wen Ye hasn't taken action yet.

200
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,260
It means he doesn't know it yet.

201
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,300
But if we still delay it,

202
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,620
I'm afraid we won’t be able to get any benefits from both sides.

203
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,100
We may even make the Prime Minister's mansion get into trouble.

204
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,500
Madam,

205
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,140
do you have any idea?

206
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,220
Since we've got the jade pendant,

207
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,900
Shen Keyi

208
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,380
must die.

209
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,530
Your Highness.

210
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,980
Here's the stone plate you asked for.

211
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:48,740
Okay.

212
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:55,820
Your Highness,

213
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,780
who taught you to make sugar figures?

214
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:58,940
My nanny.

215
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,700
My nanny said that

216
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,380
the degree of heating is the most important thing.

217
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,100
And I need to keep stirring it like this.

218
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,980
In this way, the syrup made by me

219
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,380
will be clean and clear.

220
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,490
When we sold sugar figures at a stall in the past,

221
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,700
we used this method to make syrup.

222
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,780
It's done.

223
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:47,820
Look.

224
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,140
Does this look like the back of His Highness when he was riding a horse?

225
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:50,860
How impressive!

226
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,740
Your Highness,

227
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,770
you even have this amazing skill.

228
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,780
Of course.

229
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,620
This is my skill for making money.

230
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,140
If

231
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,300
His Highness likes eating sugar figures,

232
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,660
my nanny can take this opportunity to enter the mansion.

233
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,940
My nanny's skills

234
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,420
are much better than mine.

235
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,890
Your Highness, here you are.

236
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,940
You made this sugar figure with my look. What does that mean?

237
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,940
Eating the hoof means that

238
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,780
the horse will stumble and I'll fall?

239
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,940
His Highness

240
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,460
is really straightforward,

241
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,780
and is so unromantic.

242
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,620
Your Highness,

243
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,780
how can you think like that?

244
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,530
I made this sugar figure for you

245
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:43,500
because I wanted to tell you that

246
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,780
for the sugar you didn't eat enough in childhood,

247
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,620
I would make it up for you.

248
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:51,420
Sir.

249
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,180
It's not poisonous.

250
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,660
Your Highness,

251
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,500
this is a thank-you gift I made for you personally.

252
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,740
How could it be poisonous?

253
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:02,820
However,

254
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,460
you can't eat too much of this.

255
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,980
If you eat too much of this, you'll...

256
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:12,980
What will happen?

257
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,460
Your Highness, look.

258
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,410
I ate too much sugar when I was a child.

259
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,020
Her Highness has bad teeth.

260
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,380
Tell the kitchen staff to make less sweet food for her.

261
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,460
I made a thank-you gift for His Highness.

262
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,020
Why did he still bully me?

263
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,540
Although His Highness is nearly 30 years old,

264
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,420
and looks composed and reserved,

265
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,050
he's actually no different from

266
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,140
those childish teenagers.

267
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,020
Look.

268
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,860
That scary Prince Jin is holding

269
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,020
a sugar figure in his hand.

270
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,820
That's very shocking.

271
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,220
The mighty Prince Jin

272
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,300
is even doing such a womanish thing.

273
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,060
Right. It's weird.

274
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,570
[Prince Jin's Mansion]

275
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,060
The palace banquet for celebrating the Lantern Festival will be held soon.

276
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,940
It'll be Your Highness's first time entering the palace.

277
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,140
You must dress up beautifully.

278
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,500
Yunying.

279
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,900
Is there a lot of delicious food in the palace?

280
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,060
In your mind,

281
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,020
there's nothing else

282
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,220
except food?

283
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,020
Try that on.

284
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,860
Madam. Your Highness.

285
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,380
The Shen Family sent a spring dress.

286
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,620
They said Your Highness can wear it during the palace banquet at the Latern Festival.

287
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,340
The Shen Family sent it to me?

288
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,460
This is the newly purchased Sichuan brocade.

289
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,660
Right.

290
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,900
Logically,

291
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,090
such Sichuan brocade

292
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,380
is only available in the palace.

293
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,940
The Shen Family said that they had been very careless,

294
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,220
and among the maids who went with Your Highness for marriage,

295
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,580
there had been an unfaithful evil servant.

296
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,460
Madam Shen felt very guilty,

297
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,300
so she asked the Noble Consort for the Sichuan brocade

298
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,580
and made a dress for Your Highness to express her apology.

299
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,220
This dress is indeed beautiful.

300
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,380
Your Highness,

301
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,460
your mother treats you so well.

302
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,900
She said she wanted to make an apology with this.

303
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,300
In fact,

304
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,180
she personally hopes to make you

305
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,300
look fabulous.

306
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,940
I don't think this fabric

307
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,260
looks very special.

308
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,100
Look at this fabric.

309
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,500
The stitches are dense.

310
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,740
There are even gold threads woven into it.

311
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,010
Under the sun and light,

312
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,860
it'll shine

313
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,940
and make the person who wears it look gorgeous and elegant.

314
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,580
We'll choose this dress.

315
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,980
But you prepared these clothes for me.

316
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,210
I'd rather wear the clothes you gave me.

317
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,090
Silly girl.

318
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,340
Those are the clothes given by His Majesty.

319
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,780
If you don't wear them,

320
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,020
it means you look down on His Majesty, right?

321
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,220
No, I don't.

322
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,180
This is the rule.

323
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:58,380
You need to wear the clothes bestowed by His Majesty when you attend the banquet in the palace.

324
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,650
That shows

325
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,940
your respect and gratitude to His Majesty.

326
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,060
If you don't wear them,

327
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,020
when His Majesty asks about that,

328
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,420
it'll be disrespectful.

329
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,300
There are so many rules in the palace.

330
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,740
I'm afraid I'll do something inappropriate

331
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,090
and get spanked again.

332
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:15,980
Yunying,

333
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,700
will you attend the banquet with us?

334
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:21,980
I...

335
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,980
I'm a widow.

336
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,140
It's inauspicious.

337
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,460
It's not good for me to enter the palace.

338
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,860
What does this have to do with being a widow?

339
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,820
You are His Highness's sister.

340
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,540
Why can't you attend the banquet?

341
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:36,820
Your Highness.

342
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,500
Her Ladyship just can't.

343
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,260
There's no reason.

344
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,060
But Nian Sanniang, who used to

345
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,740
sell folding fans next to us,

346
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,260
was kind and good at doing business.

347
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,420
Later, she remarried a scholar.

348
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,380
That scholar became an official.

349
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,220
Their life was getting better and better.

350
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:55,740
Your Highness.

351
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,060
What remarry?

352
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,900
Don't talk nonsense.

353
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:01,980
Madam.

354
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:04,780
Your Highness.

355
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,900
Yi Fu asked me to give this month's ledger to you.

356
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,740
Thank you, Guard Wan.

357
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,100
Your Highness,

358
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,380
this precious dress is really good-looking.

359
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,140
Look.

360
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,100
Even under the moonlight,

361
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,100
this dress seems to shine.

362
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,460
Of course.

363
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,700
This dress made with money can surely shine.

364
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,820
Your Highness, look.

365
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,340
You'll look like a fairy when you wear this.

366
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:55,900
What's wrong?

367
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,900
I don't know, either.

368
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,170
I didn't have the rash just now.

369
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,210
I merely washed the dress.

370
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,540
Rinse your hands with water.

371
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,300
Okay.

372
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,820
I'm used to washing clothes.

373
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,100
But I've never had a rash before.

374
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,460
Your Highness.

375
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,660
Is this dress

376
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,090
poisonous?

377
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,060
This must be Prime Minister Shen's plot.

378
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,780
When Biyun returned to Shen's Mansion,

379
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,140
she must have told Madam Shen that

380
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,260
I had got the jade pendant.

381
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,180
That's why they wanted to hurt me.

382
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,740
Well, Your Highness,

383
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,140
are you going to hand over the jade pendant to them?

384
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,860
I won't do anything to hurt His Highness.

385
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,820
Didn't I make a fake jade pendant?

386
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,940
I'll use the fake jade pendant to save my nanny.

387
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,500
But

388
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,180
what should we do with this dress?

389
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,740
Are you really going to wear it when you attend the banquet?

390
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,260
If you wear this dress,

391
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,580
your skin will rot.

392
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,380
If I'm seriously ill,

393
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,740
I don't need to enter the palace, do I?

394
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:50,580
If I don't enter the palace,

395
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,020
I won't have to wear this dress.

396
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,210
Nor will I be disrespectful.

397
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,540
I'll go pour the water now.

398
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,580
If animals drink it accidentally,

399
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,660
or someone finds that the water is poisonous,

400
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,940
it'll be harder to explain it clearly.

401
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,300
You should get back to work first.

402
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,220
What on earth does she want to do?

403
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,770
♫You come from the mortal world♫

404
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:39,080
♫And laugh at me for not knowing about that world♫

405
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,930
♫You waved your hand with flowers♫

406
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,980
♫I see through the crowd♫

407
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,180
♫I got an unexpected period of time♫

408
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:56,730
♫It was worth it to wander in loneliness in the past on a horseback♫

409
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:02,290
♫If it's a beautiful dream, what's wrong with going separate ways to our ends?♫

410
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:08,640
♫Love is a reward, and I'm willing to wander if it lasts long♫

411
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,330
♫Because the flowers once bloomed, I won't forget them after seeing them♫

412
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,160
♫Do you know this glance♫

413
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:23,770
♫Is the gaze which makes us stay so far away from each other?♫

414
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,020
Sir, are you alright?

415
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,140
Sir, the water is poisonous.

416
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,500
Sir.

417
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,060
Did you come back from the hill behind the mansion just now?

418
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,020
Is there something fishy on that hill?

419
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:51,620
I'll go take a look.

420
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,420
You musn't go there!

421
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,100
Both of you should leave.

422
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,420
What on earth does she wants to do?

423
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:47,130
[Xingyue Pavilion]

424
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,970
Your Highness, Her Highness caught a cold yesterday.

425
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,540
Your Highness.

426
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:07,900
No need to bow to me.

427
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,460
Are you sick?

428
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,860
I might have forgotten to close the window before I slept last night.

429
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,810
I've caught a cold.

430
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,810
I'm afraid I can't accompany you to attend the banquet in the palace.

431
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,380
You don't have a fever.

432
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,700
Is there any part of your body which feels unwell?

433
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,420
I have a bad cough.

434
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,380
I'm afraid it's inappropriate to enter the palace like this,

435
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,380
and I might embarrass you.

436
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:50,980
Is it that serious?

437
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,600
Then I'll ask the imperial doctor to check on you.

438
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:56,740
Wan.

439
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,420
Your Highness, it's not necessary.

440
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,570
It's just a minor illness.

441
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,220
Don't bother the imperial doctor, which might bring bad luck to the palace.

442
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:13,700
Fine.

443
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,940
Rest early. I'll come back later to check on you.

444
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,020
By the way,

445
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,860
when you sleep at night,

446
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,020
you must close the door and windows.

447
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,220
The servants told me that

448
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,660
in the mountain spring on the hill behind the mansion,

449
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:43,060
there was a female ghost

450
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,300
who soaked in water every day,

451
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,100
and she made people feel so chilly.

452
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,020
If she comes into your room,

453
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,540
your cold will get worse.

454
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,820
Your Highness, I got it.

455
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,620
If you see this female ghost,

456
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,820
you must tell me.

457
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,420
I will protect you.

458
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:33,300
Today is the day for me to get the fake jade pendant from the craftsman.

459
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,820
For the sake of my nanny, I can only take the risk first.

460
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,020
Thank you.

461
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,100
Don't you need to rest because you're feeling unwell?

462
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,220
Your Highness, I...

463
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,540
No wonder my sister always says that

464
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,970
you behave like a child.

465
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,940
You don't want to enter the palace,

466
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:20,690
and you want to go to the street market to have fun, right?

467
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,660
Your Highness,

468
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,420
aren't you angry?

469
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,620
Angry?

470
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,540
Why should I be angry?

471
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,180
I know you're bored in the mansion,

472
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,500
so you want to come out for some fresh air.

473
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,220
There are still two hours before the palace banquet begins.

474
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,380
I'll take a stroll with you at the lantern show.

475
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:12,610
Let's go.
