00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,140
Have you seen a girl

188
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,340
who is short with a round face,

189
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,180
and is wearing a blue dress?

190
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,260
No.

191
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,120
Shh!

192
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,060
This way.

193
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,100
This way.

194
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,140
This way.

195
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,540
Look at this lion.

196
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,100
I'm the lion's head. Just listen to my orders.

197
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,380
I can do the lion dance. Listen to my orders.

198
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,780
Then you should start dancing. Start dancing!

199
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,380
Why is the lion not moving?

200
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,100
Right.

201
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,220
This is strange.

202
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,860
Good!

203
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,980
This way. Hurry up.

204
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,500
Why is it so cold?

205
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:24,940
Right.

206
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,580
Let's go to the front and take a look.

207
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,020
Okay.

208
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,460
This lion is moving again.

209
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,070
Good!

210
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,810
Do it again!

211
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,140
She's over here! Chase her!

212
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,740
Go!

213
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
I can finally take off such heavy clothes.

214
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,340
Put down your sword.

215
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,620
Otherwise, I'll kill her.

216
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,650
Just kill her. I don't know her anyway.

217
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:12,540
You...

218
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:48,900
Sir.

219
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,260
I didn't see anything.

220
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,980
I won't tell anyone about it.

221
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,660
Just let me go. I'll give you all the money.

222
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,900
Help!

223
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,260
I'm just a little girl

224
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,900
who knows nothing.

225
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,100
It's useless for you to kill me.

226
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:11,700
Go forward.

227
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:14,740
Go!

228
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,260
You...

229
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,420
You... Wake up!

230
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,300
Wake up!

231
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,210
Wake up!

232
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,620
You fell asleep yourself.

233
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,980
It's not that I don't want to help you.

234
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,500
Don't chase me or kill me.

235
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,020
I have to find my nanny outside the city.

236
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,220
I can't help you.

237
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,300
Forget it.

238
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,860
By that time, if you want to kill me,

239
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,100
I'll definitely die.

240
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,100
[Anju Hall]

241
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,420
Nanny!

242
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,860
Nanny!

243
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,700
Why hasn't my nanny arrived here yet?

244
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,340
Chief.

245
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,340
Is Prince Jin

246
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,940
really dead?

247
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,580
I saw him fall off the cliff after being stabbed by a sword.

248
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:26,820
It can't be wrong.

249
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,220
But one of his soldiers escaped.

250
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,020
My men are hunting them down.

251
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,770
They will try to find them and kill them.

252
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,740
He's finally dead.

253
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,130
From now on, you can sleep well.

254
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,060
No one will talk about investigating

255
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,380
the case of delaying the delivery of army provisions anymore.

256
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,210
From now on, your position is only

257
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,500
inferior to His Majesty's in the imperial court.

258
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,900
Congratulations, Prime Minister Shen.

259
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,500
What's there to be happy about?

260
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,410
This incident was the action of the Nanzhu Pavilion.

261
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,980
The Nanzhu Pavilion is a spy organization of the State of Liang.

262
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,140
They had been planning to assassinate Wen Ye for a long time.

263
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,620
This false report about the battle

264
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,660
said that Prince Jin had died.

265
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,260
My daughter will also die and get buried with Prince Jin because of this.

266
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,860
I feel sad, too.

267
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,060
Prime Minister Shen, you're a man of great achievements.

268
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,300
Making sacrifices are inevitable.

269
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,020
Alright.

270
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,060
It's time for you to leave.

271
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,380
I've done my best to you.

272
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,420
This medicine was given to me by my nanny.

273
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,780
The herbs are expensive.

274
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,420
I've used all the medicine on you.

275
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,060
This is the reward you should give me.

276
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,610
For a bottle of medicine to treat wounds,

277
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:59,890
the market price is five qians of silver.

278
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,230
I'm not blackmailing you.

279
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,130
I'll put the rest back in the original place.

280
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,370
This man looked fierce when he was awake.

281
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,060
I didn't expect that he would look

282
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,650
so gentle when he's asleep.

283
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,180
As I'm watching him carefully,

284
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,670
he looks so handsome.

285
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:55,370
[Anju Hall]

286
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:22,750
You...

287
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,890
How could you do this?

288
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,450
It's me.

289
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,050
I saved you yesterday.

290
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:34,760
Stop!

291
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,140
Who was chasing you last night?

292
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:41,950
I...

293
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,340
I offended a rich family.

294
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,270
They wanted to report it to the police and catch me,

295
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,660
so I escaped.

296
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,420
You're lying.

297
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,120
Then why were you chased by those people?

298
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,060
None of your business.

299
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,590
Are you hungry?

300
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,970
Do you want to eat some snacks?

301
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,560
This is called Four-colored Pastry.

302
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,240
People also call it Bride Cake.

303
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,280
You ran away from marriage.

304
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:19,870
Why do you...

305
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,300
This is your wedding cake.

306
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,280
Don't talk nonsense.

307
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,380
Will you eat it or not?

308
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,110
I don't eat sweet food.

309
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,780
You don't eat sweet food?

310
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,300
There is someone in this world who doesn't eat sweet food?

311
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,990
I'm injured.

312
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,600
Get me some water.

313
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,840
In broad daylight,

314
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,560
there are many people who are chasing me outside.

315
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,200
No problem.

316
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,620
Since you gave the reward to me,

317
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,340
I'll take the risk and give it a try.

318
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:15,940
When you come back,

319
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,960
I will give you the money

320
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,390
and your luggage.

321
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:52,980
Well...

322
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,120
I'll go get some water. I'll be back soon.

323
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,390
Don't you care about your nanny?

324
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,480
[Anju Hall]

325
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:42,920
Your Highness.

326
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:44,680
Your Highness,

327
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,400
I knew you're still alive.

328
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,910
Your Highness.

329
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,680
We found you by following the clues

330
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,770
left by you.

331
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,530
Your Highness.

332
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,830
Let go!

333
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,990
Your Highness, are you alright?

334
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,710
We can't stay here for long.

335
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:59,590
What if there's an ambush?

336
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,180
There's an ambush?

337
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,520
Who dares to ambush His Highness?

338
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:03,370
Your Highness.

339
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,670
Let's go back to the mansion first.

340
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,520
People in the mansion are preparing for your funeral.

341
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,250
The report about the battle clearly said that it was a victory at the front line,

342
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:10,760
and that you would return to the capital in triumph.

343
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,530
After the report was sent to the capital, why did it become the news that

344
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,780
you sacrificed yourself for our country?

345
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,040
In this case, your death was considered

346
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,430
as something that had happened in the battlefield.

347
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,900
It would be inadvisable to investigate who was the murderer.

348
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,920
I'm afraid behind this matter...

349
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,220
This report about the battle

350
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,490
is the same as the army provisions which haven't arrived at the battlefield.

351
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,800
Both schemes were conducted secretly by someone in the imperial court.

352
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:26,510
Sir.

353
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,570
Are you suspecting that person?

354
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,580
Who else knows that

355
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,750
you came to find me?

356
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,350
Only Nan Bo and I know this.

357
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,190
Even the Empress Dowager  doesn't know this.

358
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,270
Then let's not go back to the capital for the time being.

359
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,180
Sir.

360
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,370
Do you want to give everyone a surprise?

361
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,750
I'm waiting for someone here.

362
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:48,940
Sir.

363
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,830
We have a secret sentinel station to help us inside the city.

364
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,090
We can even drink some hot tea there.

365
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,600
It's better than the environment here.

366
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,230
Yes.

367
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,070
Who are you waiting for?

368
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,370
I'll wait for that person here on behalf of you.

369
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,870
[Anju Hall]

370
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,060
Sir.

371
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,500
You've been waiting in this shabby temple for so long.

372
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,640
Are you waiting for that luggage?

373
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,460
Sir.

374
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,430
It turns out you're waiting for the assassins.

375
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,660
Just take the poison.

376
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:15,920
It's really the seven-tail hawk,

377
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,850
the symbol of Nanzhu Pavilion from the State of Liang.

378
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,340
So it's the Nanzhu Pavilion that has sent people to assassinate Your Highness.

379
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:24,190
Sir.

380
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,120
The Nanzhu Pavilion has discovered your whereabouts.

381
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,220
Let's go to the secret sentinel station inside the city.

382
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:47,750
My good father

383
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,890
gave birth to me but didn't raise me.

384
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,200
Now he even wants to use my life

385
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,890
as a stepping stone for getting promoted and becoming rich.

386
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,120
Ke.

387
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,020
In this way, it's good to see the true colors of the Shen Family clearly.

388
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,580
He has not deserved to be your father since a long time ago.

389
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,600
Take this jade comb.

390
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,320
It used to belong to your mother.

391
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,460
She asked me

392
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,510
to comb your hair when you get married.

393
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:11,820
But now,

394
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,540
I'm afraid it's too late.

395
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,600
Nanny, leave here with me.

396
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,990
I'm an old woman.

397
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,050
They won't do anything to me.

398
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,990
I'll sneak out from the back door when the house is in chaos.

399
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,090
Let's meet at the Temple of Local God outside the city.

400
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,350
Leave at once.

401
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,440
If you don't leave now,

402
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,950
we'll die.

403
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,770
Your nanny was tortured so severely,

404
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,370
but she wasn't willing to tell us where you were at all.

405
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,880
Shen Keyi.

406
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,020
Don't you feel sad about your nanny?

407
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,630
What do you want?

408
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,010
If you don't die to be buried with Prince Jin,

409
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,230
and our Shen Family can't hand over someone to them,

410
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,990
they'll ask my daughter to die and get buried with Prince Jin.

411
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,460
I have no choice.

412
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,030
As long as you return to Prince Jin's Mansion and get buried with Prince Jin obediently,

413
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,290
I'll let her go.

414
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:56,960
Okay.

415
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,150
I promise you.

416
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,550
Prepare a carriage for me now.

417
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,280
I want to personally see my nanny leave here.

418
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,360
Is that okay?

419
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,710
I've lived a hard life since I was a child.

420
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:20,860
My father abandoned me.

421
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,210
My mother died early.

422
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,400
