00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,860
how about you send her

189
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,700
to your villa outside the city?

190

like it?

Yes, he will.

He said he's going to tell me something on New Year's eve.

201

Is he going to hold

202

Xu Fang?

272
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,950
He was the Minister of the Ministry of Justice when the former emperor was alive.

273
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,020
What did he do?

274
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,540
Didn't he leave the state and defect?

275
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:04,060
He did.

I just got to know

277
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,750
that Xu Fang had defected to Liang State at that time.

278
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,500
To show that the leader of Liang State really wants to marry the princess to you,

279
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,700
he handed Xu Fang to His Majesty.

280

Okay.

281
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,270
So what?

282
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,300
Xu Fang was a minister trusted by the former emperor

283
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,900
but he had conflicts with our present emperor.

284
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,900
Xu Fang was afraid that he would be punished

285
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,420
so he defected when His Majesty ascended the throne.

286
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,460
Now he's back and he'll be sentenced to death this time.

287
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,630
But I've got the news

288
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,670
that Xu Fang told His Majesty a secret in the prison

289
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,270
in exchange of his life.

290
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,630
Go on.

291
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,450
That secret

292
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,140
is about an imperial order issued by the former emperor.

293
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,100
It said the former emperor

294
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,180
planned to let you accede to the throne.

Then why are you...

00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,780
I made a deal with Empress Dowager.

299
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,300
I didn't want him and me to be brothers who would hate each other

300
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,790
so I gave up the throne

301
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:02,990
and went to the border areas.

302
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:04,540
But I know

303
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,310
he never

304
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,860
fully trusts me.

305
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,350
Fortunately, Xu Fang

306
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,780
hasn't got any evidence now.

307
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,300
His Majesty won't make a big fuss about it.

308
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,180
But I'm afraid that someone might take this opportunity

309
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,010
to drive a wedge between you and His Majesty.

I wouldn't care about these things.

00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:27,260
But now,

313
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,550
Her Highness is pregnant.

That's my child!

317
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,670
His Majesty doesn't want you to have a child.

318
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,350
He made you marry a daughter of the Shen family.

319
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,940
And now he is making you marry the princess of Liang State.

320
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,710
Both of them are related to your enemies.

321
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,460
His Majesty believed you wouldn't like them.

322
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,300
He thought you wouldn't let them be pregnant.

323
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,620
I was born into the royal family.

00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:50,940
My life

325
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,890
is always at stake.

326
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,210

I know that day would come.

328
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,420
But that's my child.

329
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,980
I can't make her abort the child.

330
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,590
If you insist on keeping this child,

331
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,550
His Majesty will get Her Highness and your child

detained in the royal place as hostages.

333
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,100
You really want the child to lose freedom the minute he's born?

334
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,470
You really want your family to break apart?

335
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,070
If I force her to abort the child,

336
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,260
she will hate me forever.

337
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,270
If you want to keep the child and be free,

338
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,420

I'm guilty.

372
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,030
Uncle Fu,

373
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,620
I know you have no other choice.

374
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:38,900
I can see that.

375
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:40,580
Besides,

376
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,220
all these years,

377
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,260
you haven't done anything that harmed the mansion.

378
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,110
Thank you, Your Highness.

379
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:50,420
Uncle Fu,

380
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,350
I have a request.

381
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:55,590
Your Highness.

382
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,700
I know

383
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,150
what it is.

384
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,060
I won't tell anyone

385
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,810
including Empress Dowager

386
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,780
that Her Highness's pregnant.

387
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:05,670
Good.

388
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,020
Good.

389
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:10,550
Uncle Fu,

390
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:12,940
This is a big test for us.

391
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,300
From now on,

392
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,180
you'll need to take care of all the business in Xingyue Pavilion.

393
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,630
Don't worry, Your Highness.

394
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,140
I will

395
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,710
do my best.

396
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:42,340
Where is His Highness?

397
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:49,590
Your Highness.

398
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,030
His Highness hasn't gone up yet.

399
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,460
I want to see His Highness.

400
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:00,790
Your Highness.

401
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,750
Have some ginger soup.

402
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:06,910
You may leave.

403
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:07,620
Yes.

404
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:11,630
Your Highness.

405
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,140
I dreamed about you.

406
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,500
In the dream, I couldn't find you anywhere.

407
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,670
It's still cold.

408
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,870
Have some ginger soup first.

409
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,570
Your Highness.

410
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,630
Did I

411
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:47,190
do anything wrong in the past?

412
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,100
If I did,

413
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,830
I can correct the mistake.

414
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,340
Although

415
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,940
I was born on the street

416
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,550
and don't know many rules,

417
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,550
I'm willing to learn.

418
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,090
I can take care of the business in the mansion.

419
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,210
Can you

420
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,460
not marry that girl?

421
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,070
I thought

422
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:10,410
you were a sensible woman.

423
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,580
Since when have you become so jealous?

424
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:16,990
Your Highness.

425
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,590
Will you fall in with many women?

426
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:28,990
In the mansion,

427
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,460
there won't be only one woman.

428
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,350
You are my Princess Jin.

429
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,820
You should accept this.

430
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:43,670
If that's the case,

431
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,430
I will hate you very much.

432
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,420
A wife should be obedient to her husband.

433
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,380
You shouldn't think like that.

434
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,020
You'll be grounded in Xingyue Pavilion for a month.

435
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,700
Reflect on what you did wrong.

436
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,260
You think you did nothing wrong?

437
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,110
Prime Minister Shen

438
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,540
has told me about the substitute princess.

439
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,870
The culprit, Madam Shen

440
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,740
has been punished by law.

441
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,230
Your Majesty.

442
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,140
Since the truth has been found out,

443
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,260
let me

444
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,830
take my wife home.

445
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,810
Please.

446
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,270
Wen Ye.

447
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,100
I

448
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,430
know you want her home.

449
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,020
But now,

450
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,630
there's one more thing.

451
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,700
[Marriage Agreement]

452
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,650
[The marriage between two people of the noble families from each state can bring peace and prosperity.]

453
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:01,660
The leader of Liang State

454
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,300
wants to marry the princess

455
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,930
to a nobleman in our state to bring peace in the border areas.

456
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,460
I don't want any more wars.

457
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,340
So

458
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:09,830
I agreed.

459
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,110
Brother.

460
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,210
I won't fall in love with another woman.

461
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,050
I don't want to marry her.

462
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,100
Wen Ye.

463
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:19,940
You led our army and defeated the troops of Liang State.

464
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,510
So they fear you.

465
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,470
If the Princess of Liang State

466
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,460
is married to someone else instead of you,

467
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:25,740
they

468
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,500
won't rest assured.

469
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:30,340
I...

470
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,460
If you still want to reject this,

471
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,060
I'll have to let the girl of the Shen family

472
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,250
be punished by law.

473
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:40,990
If you

474
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,630
agree to marry the Princess of Liang State,

475
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,030
I will allow that girl

476
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,030
to continue to be with you.

477
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:49,150
She'll still be your wife, not your concubine.

478
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:52,340
Both of them will be Princesses Jin.

479
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,580
[Marriage Agreement]
