00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:35,900
I like her.

5
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:39,190
She is my wife.

6
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,460
But you let her down.

7
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,780
That's our domestic affair.

8
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,580
Then why did you let her...

9
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,700
Brat.

10
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,590
Your Highness, don't be angry.

11
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,660
Don't be angry.

12
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,509
He knows nothing

13
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,420
but making people angry.

14
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,900
If he did something to offend you,

15
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,750
please don't blame the fortress.

16
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,090
This... This has nothing to do with us.

17
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:56,700
Father!

18
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,780
Brat.

19
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,580
Shame on you.

20
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,060
Well...

21
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:00,820
Shame on you!

22
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,020
Father, be gentle.

23
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,030
Shame on you!

24
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,430
-Shame on you!
-Father!

25
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,650
Father, why are you using so much strength?

26
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,949
You're gonna twist off my ear. Let go of me.

27
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,140
How could you look down on your son's power

28
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,310
in front of others?

29
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,540
You have power?

30
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:15,950
Who is he?

31
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,300
He's a prince.

32
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,710
I think you're tired of living.

33
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,030
Stay out of their business.

34
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,470
Alright.

35
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,070
You've been a coward throughout your life.

36
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,579
I don't expect you to be tough.

37
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:27,990
But can you

38
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,290
not stop your son from chasing a girl?

39
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:31,380
You

40
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:32,590
can chase anyone you like,

41
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:33,660
except this one.

42
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,550
Why?

43
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,810
Just because he's a prince?

44
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,050
You fool!

45
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,070
Let me tell you.

46
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,790
He is the one who Miss Shen loves.

47
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,390
She usually

48
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,980
looks depressed.

49
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:44,850
But when she sees him,

50
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,740
her eyes sparkle.

51
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:47,579
See?

52
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,260
Nonsense.

53
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,070
She doesn't even want to talk to him.

54
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,310
You know nothing.

55
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,660
Let me tell you.

56
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,430
Being a couple is like practicing.

57
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,510
They are at the stage

58
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,940
of going through a calamity and ascending.

59
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,860
Be careful not to be struck

60
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,020
by thunder.

61
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,470
Enough.

62
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:07,900
You can just be a coward.

63
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,980
I must take her with me.

64
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,220
He will kill her.

65
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,830
You understand now?

66
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,350
You're so capable.

67
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,829
-You're so capable. You're so capable.
-Well, Father.

68
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,540
Your behavior

69
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,850
will give me false fantasies.

70

Please don't tease me.

71
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,940
You are my wife.

72
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,339
Why would I tease you?

73
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,070
Your Highness,

74
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,510
I know I've committed a big crime.

75
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,350
I'm a substitute.

76
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,550
And I stayed in the Prince's Mansion just to steal the jade pendant to save my nanny.

77
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,150
You gave me a chance.

78
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,590
But I didn't tell you the truth.

79
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,030
I'm not qualified to ask for your forgiveness.

80
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,260
No matter how you want to punish me,

81
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,180
just do it.

82
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,580
I was deceived before.

83
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,659

all this

85
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,350
is a conspiracy of the Shen family.

86
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,470
It has nothing to do with you.

87
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,540
But didn't you say

88
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,350

92

And I won't mention the 1-year appointment again.

93
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,110
Your Highness, you are a good official

94
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,710
and a kind person.

95
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,460
But I'm not a beggar.

96
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,470
You don't have to accept me because you pity me.

97
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,140
A fortune teller said

98
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,430
I'm destined to remarry.

99
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:40,070
I didn't believe it at first.

100
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:41,980
Now it seems

101
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,030
it might be true.

Sir,

115
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,750
it's not enough to coax women just once.

116
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,870
You have to be braver.

117
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,420
I didn't know

119
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,220
But now,

120
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,870
I want to apologize to her as if nothing happened

121
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,060
and ask her to forgive me for my absence.

122
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,070
Is it useful to apologize?

123
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,540
According to what you said,

124
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,630
it seems useless to apologize.

125
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:58,980
But

126
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,870
what if Her Highness won't come back?

127
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,070
I don't know.

128
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,580

129
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,260

130

Well...

131
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,780
This seems difficult.

But he has the power.

00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,380
He wanted to inform her,

194
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,250
but I caught him.

195
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,820
What did Madam Shen ask him to do?

196
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,590
Madam Shen locked down Qiyu Village first

197
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,990
using the excuse of searching for the murderer.

198
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,220
Then she ordered Commander Zhang to deliver a bowl of poison

199
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,380
to Her Highness in your name.

200
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,180
Fortunately, the men of Tianhe Fortress protected Her Highness on that day,

201
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,590
so that she could be safe.

202
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:45,790
But

203
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,140
Madam Shen already has your jade pendant.

205
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,540
I can't believe she did such a vicious thing.

206
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,390
Her Highness is pitiful.

207
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:56,550
It was life-and-death,

208
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,340
but she still wanted to protect your jade pendant.

209
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,190
No wonder.

210
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,950
No wonder she kept saying I wanted to kill her.

211
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,100
Your Highness,

212
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,580

Yes, Your Highness.

00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:24,430
Keep an eye on her.

226
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:25,630
Don't let her leave.

Young Master,

We can't afford to mess with him.

231
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,700
Come on. Let's go back to the fortress. Come on.

232
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,470
Father,

233
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,470
I can't just sit by and do nothing.

00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:03,710
Fine.

236
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:04,630
Okay.

237
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,780
You can go out to make trouble.

If you die outside,

239
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,620
don't say you're from Tianhe Fortress.

240
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,630
Don't say that. I can't afford to be humiliated.

Why haven't you eaten?

252
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,430
You suffered so much outside.

253

Now you're home.

Listen to me.

256
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,350
Eat some.

257
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,730
He doesn't respect me at all.

258

He took me back forcibly.

259

265
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,550
I don't understand

266
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,230
why he is doing this to me.

267
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,430
I did lie to him.

268
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,190
But why is he making me

269
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,390
a caged bird to torture me?

270
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,900
Silly girl.

He is your husband.

272
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,430
Why would he want to torture you?

273
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,340
No matter what happens outside,

274
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,500
you're still a couple.

275
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,730
He is definitely on your side.

276
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:21,820
Sister,

277
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,470
I also thought

278
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,610
that's what couples do.

279
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,070
But now it seems

280
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,100
the life in the Prince's Mansion

281
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,750
is really different from ordinary people's lives.

282
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,170

283
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,630

in your heart.

Her Highness is back.

294
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,380
Why are you still like this?

295
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:14,970
In the past,

296
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,650
I made so many mistakes.

297
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,380
I can only try my best to make it up to her,

298
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,420
so that I can be qualified to be her husband.

299
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,590
But if you lock her up in Xingyue Pavilion,

300
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,220
her mood will only get worse.

301
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,420
You're a couple.

302
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,030
You can communicate

303
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,300
with each other to eliminate the misunderstanding.

304
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,740
Sometimes,

305
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,870
it's useless

306
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,910
to just say it out.

307
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,630
I will explain to her.

308
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,020
But not now.

309
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,180
The Shen family

310
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,620
did too many things behind our backs

311
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:50,990
to

312
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,180
hurt her.

313
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,580
And all the disasters

314
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,580
were due to our marriage.

315
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,730
But if you investigate carefully,

316
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,410
it will definitely

317
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,090
involve the thing of her being a substitute princess.

318
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,510
In the end, she will still be the one to suffer.

319
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,020
So I can't do anything to her openly.

320
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,270
But I must avenge her.

321
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,630
Only in this way

322
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,230
can I give her an explanation.

323
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,950
What about the jade pendant given by the late emperor?

324
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,910
It is still in the hands of the Shen family.

325
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,619
What if they use it to threaten you?

326
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:21,770
As long as she's safe,

327
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,980
nothing can threaten me.

00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,030

330
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,030
Right.

331
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,700
If you have time,

332
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,670
help me check on her more frequently.

333
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,420
He has a mouth.

334
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,260
Why won't he say anything nice to coax her?

337
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,460
didn't you say

338
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,990
the prince would never fall for that girl?

339
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,780
What's going on now?

340
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,540
He actually mobilized his army without permission

341
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,070
to surround a village in the suburb of the capital just to find a woman.

342
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,350
Those who know

343
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,870
would think he did it for a woman.

344

Those who don't know

345
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,030

347
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,390
you misunderstood.

348
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,740
Actually,

349
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,860
His Highness didn't go there to save the princess.

350
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,060
He went there

351
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:34,190
because the jade pendant given by the late emperor was lost.

352
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,350
That's why His Highness led his troops to look for it.

353
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,030
Really?

354
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,530
Yes.

355
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:40,660
Actually,

00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:44,510
His Highness has put the princess under house arrest.

he has never gone to see her.

360
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,770
you should know

361
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,270
what the consequence will be

362
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,260
if you lie to me.

363
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,740
I know.

364
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,980
Everything I said

365
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,830
is true.

366
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,870
If you don't believe me,

367
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,790
you can ask someone to investigate in the Prince's Mansion.

368
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,330
I'm not doing this

00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:16,110
to harm the prince.

370
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,300
It's just that in the imperial city,

371
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,940
there are thorns everywhere. If he makes one mistake,

372
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,790
he'll lose everything.

373
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,180
Although he's not my biological son,

374
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,140
he has called me mother for so many years.

375
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,300
I need to protect him

376

377
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,530
Yes.

Your Grace.

379
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,220
I understand.

380
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,140
All right.

381
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,530
Go back first.

382
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,100
If you are out for long,

383
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,260
the prince will be suspicious.

384
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:51,420
Yes.

385
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,020
I'm taking my leave.

386
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:06,910
Sir,

387
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,820
this is the clue Wan and I found.

388
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,230
Someone died because Madam Shen's brother

389
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,010
wanted to capture a girl.

390
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:12,940
The girl's father

391
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,140
raised some money

392
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,170
and planned to sue him.

393
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:15,820
But unexpectedly,

394
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,180
they stopped him halfway.

395
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,420
And they even took the money.

396
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,870
The rice shop run by Madam Shen's parents' family

397
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:22,710
maliciously monopolized the market

398
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,060
and raised the price willfully.

399
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,460
The people are complaining about it.

400
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,300
Besides,

401
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,770
Madam Shen's nephew

402
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,100
bribed the government

403
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,030
and replaced a scholar who passed the imperial exam.

404
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,540
He even locked this scholar up

405
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,020
and threatened him not to tell anyone.

406
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,300
Let's expose them together

407
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,330
and make it a nice gift to Madam Shen.

408
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,230
Yes.

409
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,370
[Shen Mansion]

410
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,170
[Ye]

411
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,140
Madam.

412
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:03,860
Madam.

413
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:04,700
Bad news!

414
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,580
Look at yourself!

415
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,740
You're not a newcomer in the mansion.

416
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,170
Don't you know the rules?

417
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,260
Tell me.

418
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,070
Your brother's case can no longer be hidden.

419
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,210
He has been arrested and is in the prison of the Ministry of Justice now.

420
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,340
Also,

421
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,070
the rice shop on Ji'an Street has been sealed up.

422
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,140
What did you say?

423
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,110
Madam.

424
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,090
Madam.

425
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,750
Your nephew, Li Wulang,

426
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,180
was also dismissed.

427
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,660
Master! Master!

428
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,740
Master, bad news! Bad news!

429
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,650
Something happened.

430
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:36,830
Master.

431
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,170
You have to help me.

432
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:39,750
Master.

433
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,950
What are you doing?

434
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,110
Why are you in such a hurry? Look at you!

435
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:46,660
Master,

436
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,350
my parents' family

437
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,220
has always been helping you.

438
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,180
Both families have always been

439
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,380
in the same boat.

440
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,510
Now,

441
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,930
because of your daughter who has become the princess,

442
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,310
my parents' family

443
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,380
is suffering so much for no reason.

444
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,510
Next,

445
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,650
Prince Jin will take revenge on me.

446
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:05,940
Master,

447
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,340
you can't just sit by and do nothing.

448
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,150
I told you before

449
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,020
you should be careful.

450
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,140
Now things have gone south.

451
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,830
What kind of plan is that?

452
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,710
It's full of loopholes. And now there are so many problems.

453
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,500
You're really shortsighted.

454
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,470
Back then, you silently agreed

455
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,450
to my plan of kidnapping her and taking the jade pendant.

456
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,030
Besides, regarding what happened to Shen Keyi,

457
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,780
did I do it for myself?

458
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,540
I did it for Shen Mansion.

459
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,460
Now I think

460
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,390
Wen Ye is not doing these things

461
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,580
to avenge his princess.

462
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,940
He is doing these things

463
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,420
because he wants to take back the jade pendant and he's coming for you.

464
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,780
Where is the jade pendant?

465
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:49,900
It's here.

466
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,610
[Ye]

467
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:52,500
Smash it.

468
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,790
Smash it?

469
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:55,660
This...

470
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,950
This was given by the late emperor.

471
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,950
If you smash it,

472
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,910
maybe Wen Ye can be heroic today.

473
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,060
But he can't be arrogant forever.

474
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,420
Dear,

475
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,150
we've come this far.

476
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,770
We have to take a risk.

477
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,460
I will protect you.

478
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:19,590
Your Highness,

479
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,550
in terms of Commander Zhang, we've found an excuse

480
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,790
and banished him to the border.

481
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,700
In this way, Madam Shen has lost

482
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,110
another capable man.

483
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:29,530
Also,

484
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,500
we found a servant

485
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,910
coming out from Shen Mansion.

486
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,310
According to this servant,

487
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,580
Madam Shen is vicious and violent.

488
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,890
Sometimes she would even abuse and kill servants.

489
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,900
One day around your wedding day,

490
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,780
Madam Shen sent someone to catch a woman

491
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,990
and beat her to death.

492
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,510
And this woman

493
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,830
is Her Highness's nanny.

494
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,860
I can't believe a woman can be so vicious.

495
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:51,870
Sir,

496
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,510
this case is a breakthrough.

497
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,550
It can bring Madam Shen to justice,

498
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,420
and it won't involve the identity of Her Highness.

499
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,230
Titled Madam instigated someone to kill someone.

500
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,020
Report it to the Ministry of Justice.

501
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:04,900
Yes.

502
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,470
Yi Fu.

503
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,370
Yes, Your Highness.

504
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,940
Your Highness, what can I do for you?

505
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,100
Has she

506
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,340
eaten today?

507
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,390
Her Highness didn't eat the food we delivered.

508
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,270
She built a small stone kiln in the backyard

509
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,990
to cook some refreshments and ate them.

510
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:28,940
It's good that she ate something.

511
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,970
Whatever ingredients she needs,

512
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,500
deliver them to her.

513
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,300
Yes.

514
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,550
Your Highness,

515
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,530
aren't you going to visit Her Highness?

516
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:01,770
[Xingyue Pavilion]

517
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:58,380
Your Highness,

518
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,110
every snack looks good and tastes good.

519
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:01,810
They are very unique.

520
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,260
Your Highness, you are amazing.

521
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,420
My nanny taught me this.

522
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,860
My nanny knew many things.

523
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,780
This is just a piece of cake.

524
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,110
Your Highness,

525
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,150
are you going to give them to someone?

526
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:22,740
I'm leaving.

527
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,030
Your Highness, where do you want to go?

528
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:29,130
My nanny died alone.

529
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,310
I made her favorite food.

530
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,430
I want to make a memorial tablet

531
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,700
in memory of her.

532
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:36,940
But...

533
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,580
His Highness...

534
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,340
Tao.

535
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,530
Don't tell anyone about this.

536
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,190
His Highness won't let me go.

537
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,140
I have to go secretly.

538
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,390
Are you really not waiting for His Highness?

539
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,510
He hasn't come.

540
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:56,820
I don't want to wait anymore.

541
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,060
If I pin my hopes on him

542
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,390
and if it ends badly,

543
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,500
should I blame him

544
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,220
or myself?

545
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,110
So,

546
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,270
if you want to do something,

547
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,590
do it immediately.

548
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,190
Otherwise,

549
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,060
it will become a regret.

550
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:38,870
This is almost done.

551
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,230
I was told

552
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,170
Her Highness usually lives in the east yard.

553
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,460
It should be here.

554
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,530
Ke.

555
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,470
The Prince's Mansion has so many guards. I can't break in.

556
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,340
But through my observation these days,

557
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,690
I found that the west wall of the backyard doesn't have too many guards.

558
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:33,470
It's done.

559
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,510
The guards change shifts between 21:00 and 23:00. You can escape.

560
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:36,980
I'll take you away.

561
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,030
Zhou Yu.

562
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,540
I like His Highness.

563
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,630
He is heroic and unique.

564
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,020
The misunderstanding between us has been eliminated.

565
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,860
I want to grow old with him.

566
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:10,350
Don't worry. Please go back. Shen Keyi.

567
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,100
She saw it.

568
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,870
She didn't see it.

569
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:46,980
[I like His Highness. He is heroic and unique. The misunderstanding between us has been eliminated. I want to grow old with him. Don't worry. Please go back. Shen Keyi.]

[Prince Jin's Mansion]

571
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:58,830
Your Highness,

572
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:01,460
my daughter was sick a few days ago.

573
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,420
Sorry to make you worried.

574
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,910
I'm

575
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,780
really worried.

576
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,260
So I brought some nutritious things.

577
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,580
Sorry to bother you.

578
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,420
Please understand

579
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,250
my feelings as a father.

580
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,750
She has married me.

581
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,580
She is a member in the Prince's Mansion.

582
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,390
Prime Minister Shen, you don't need to worry.

583
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,980
You should worry about your own backyard.

584
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,870
Some people are physically sick.

585
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,060
They will be fine after taking some medicine.

586
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,740
But some people are mentally sick.

587
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,900
It's not easy to cure them.

588
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:38,950
You're right.

589
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:41,300
I will discipline

590
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,950
the people in the backyard of the Shen family.

591
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,510
But look, Your Highness.

592
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,670
I'm old.

593
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,940
As the saying goes,

594
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,540
what happens in the family stays in the family.

595
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,470
Your Highness,

596
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,830
would you please give me face?

597
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,060
You only cares about face, right?

598
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,690
Your daughter has suffered a lot outside,

599
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:02,630
but you are indifferent.

600
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,380
Now you are only talking about family affairs and face here.

601
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,990
No wonder you have been promoted to a high position.

602
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,470
I wonder how many bodies you've stepped on ruthlessly.

603
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:27,620
Your Highness,

604
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:28,710
this sounds

605
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,020
nasty.

606
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,220
How could I not care?

607
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,750
Just because I care about my daughter,

608
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,940
I'm making pros and cons

609
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,350
clear to you.

610
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,980
I'm afraid if you get impulsive,

611
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,310
you'll lose

612
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,830
both face and dignity.

613
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,230
I'm a rough soldier.

614
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,470
I don't care about face or dignity.

615
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,060
But since Prime Minister Shen is here to apologize,

616
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,620
these worldly things

617
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,100
are far from enough.

618
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,180
You have to give up

619
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,660
what you should.

620
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,940
According to what you said,

621
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,350
I'm afraid

622
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,300
it will be difficult.

623
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,260
Since it's difficult,

624
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,300
please leave.

625
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,430
Goodbye.

626
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:41,870
Your Highness,

627
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,300
let me remind you.

628
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,750
Taking one step back

629
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,980
is good for both of us.

630
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,750
Goodbye.

631
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,370
Goodbye.

632
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,230
Your Highness,

633
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,630
I've handed over the witness of the nanny's murder case

634
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,100
to the Ministry of Justice.

635
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:16,750
But

636
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,180
he suddenly died in prison.

637
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:19,970
I'm afraid there won't be a conclusion to this case.

638
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,860
We finally thought of a way

639
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,310
to bring Madam Shen to justice

640
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,340
without hurting Her Highness.

641
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,020
Now,

642
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,340
I'm afraid all our efforts are in vain.

643
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:29,860
Don't be angry, Your Highness.

644
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,340
Prime Minister Shen deliberately came here today to remind you.

645
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,420
It means he doesn't have much confidence either.

646
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,030
This time, we gave him a warning.

647
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,380
Over the next period of time,

648
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,660
I'm sure he won't have the guts to do anything bad

649
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,300
to harm you or Her Highness.

651
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:56,930
Yes.

652
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,690
Go to the street with Lady Yunying.

653
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,470
Tell her to buy a gorgeous dress

654
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,150
for the princess.

655
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:04,940
The dress has to be glittering

656
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,110
and eye-catching.

657
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,260
Yes.

658
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,620
You may leave.

659
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:10,610
Yes.

Where are you going?

662
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,150
Your Highness, it's not your concern.

663
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,260
The guards change shifts between 21:00 and 23:00. You can escape.

664
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,540
I'll take you away.
