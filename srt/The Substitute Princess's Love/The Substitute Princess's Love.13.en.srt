Wen Ye submitted a memorial to His Majesty.

8
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,259
He wants to build

9
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,620
a military base camp in Quezhou

10
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,380
to store arms and rations.

11
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,180
He's such a suspicious person.

12
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,020
It's really his style.

13
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,140
Even if our Liang State has already surrendered,

14
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,100
he's still wary of a possible war.

15
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,490
He did do something unnecessary.

16
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,100
Your Excellency, you told me such important information.

17
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,259
Is it because you don't think

18
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,660
Liang State is powerful enough to pose a threat?

19

Why would I give benefits to your Liang State?

23
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,380
We can sit here together

If you can screw up his plan,

27
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,850

The terrain of Mount Crane is precipitous.

On the top of the mountain, there's no one, not even a bird.

If Cang really has a base camp built in Quezhou,

69
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,210
they can mobilize

75
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,060
Building a base camp costs a lot of money and labor.

If they suffer great loss halfway,

77
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,540
Wen Ye will surely be held responsible.

78
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,380
Then it will be difficult for him

to keep his military power in hand.

80
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,740

at the hillside halfway up Mount Crane.

86
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,820
The fortress is in a high place,

87
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:02,780
so it's easy to be defended but hard to be attacked.

88
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,020
And its location is great.

89
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,180
If they send someone to attack our grain transportation unit,

90
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,940
it'll be hard for us to have the upper hand.

91

96
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:19,540
is reasonable

97
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,540
and upright.

98
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,100
He is a bandit,

99
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:22,890
but

100
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,820

To win the war, of course.

107
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,500
Wrong.

108

We build strong army and make our country wealthy,

109
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,540
not to invade other countries,

110
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,460
but to protect our people from war.

111
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,220
Tianhe Fortress is in our territory.

112
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,940
So the people there are the ones we need to protect.

113
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,820
As long as they don't do evil or rebel,

114
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,420
we can't hurt them.

115
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,180
Yes.

116
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,500
Only by capturing this fortress

117
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,820
can we attack Wen Ye's grain transportation unit in Mount Crane.

118
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,020
But Tianhe Fortress

119
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,460
has been on this mountain for over 30 years.

120
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,380
They never form cliques. It's hard to bribe them.

121
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,180
If we attack them by force,

122
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,940
it will take quite some soldiers

123
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,380
and be easy to cause noise and thus be discovered by Wen Ye.

124
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,300
Then our plan will be exposed.

125
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,620
They're just a bunch of reckless people.

126
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:13,820
It's not worth mentioning.

127
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,420
What good plans do you have?

128
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,610
The terrain is hard to attack,

129
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,260
but it's easy to disturb people.

130
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,860
We can start by bribing this guy.

131
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,620
Having a contact on the inside can increase our chance of winning.

132
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,340
But once we fight,

133
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,420
any movement

134
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,220
will disturb the royal army nearby.

135
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,620
What if Wen Ye is assassinated

136
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,180
or disappears?

137
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,500
All the royal army nearby will be out to look for him.

138
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:47,340
Then it'll be the best time

139
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,700
for us to take action.

140
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,860
You want to assassinate him again?

141
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,340
Last time in the mansion,

142
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,380
I copied a defense map of the city secretly.

143
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:56,610
With this map,

144
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,220
we can win.

145
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,460
Besides,

146
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,460
we'll just put on an assassination act

147
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,620
to lure him away.

148
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:07,530
Let's try then.

149
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,580
If we succeed this time,

150
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,060
Wen Ye will hand over his military power 
and stay away from the border.

151
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,340
By then,

152
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,740
we can take off these outfits for assassins

153
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,100
and go back to our country to report on the completion of task.

154
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,260
If you help get rid of such a pain in the neck,

155
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,060
His Majesty will definitely restore your title as Princess.

156
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:31,740
Princess.

157
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,580
I've long forgotten

158
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,980
how being a princess was like.

159
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,180
When my mother was convicted and exiled to the border,

160
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,820
my life became worthless.

161
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,659
Even if I had to become a spy

162
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,250
or a knife in my father's hand,

163
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,500
I wanted to live.

164
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,300
My father sent you to follow me.

165
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,220
Did he also give you the right

166
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,580
to get rid of me at any time?

167
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:06,460
It doesn't matter.

168
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,380
That's how spies are.

169
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,940
We can never get a sincere heart.

170
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:16,980
Here.

171
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:17,740
Be careful.

172
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,460
Thank you, Master.

173
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,380
Look.

174
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,940
You even have to fix such a minor problem yourself.

175
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,260
You're welcome.

176
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,660
Come to me directly if you need anything in the future.

177
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,540
OK.

178
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:27,900
Master.

179
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,420
Why didn't I see the Young Master?

180
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,900
Did he get a girl

181
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,419
and was too happy to want to come home?

182
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,820
Impossible.

183
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,220
If he had got a girl,

184
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,059
he would have brought her back to show off.

185
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,820
Now, I think he's failed.

186
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,260
And he's too ashamed to come back.

187
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,060
Let him be.

188
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,140
Young people need to experience some setbacks.

189
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,890
Otherwise, they don't know who they are.

190
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,340
You are right.

191
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,580
Dao is back.

192
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:57,900
Master.

193
00:08:59,420 --> 00:08:59,860
Dao,

194
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,450
you've been going down the mountain many times these days.

195
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,380
Is there any news?

196
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,450
I've been watching a caravan

197
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,740
down the mountain with my men.

198
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:08,940
Their food, clothes, and the things they use

199
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,340
all looked very expensive.

200
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,420
They are transporting about a dozen big boxes.

201
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,420
But there are few bodyguards.

202
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,380
When they arrive at the valley,

203
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,900
I'll ask our men

204
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,100
to do something big!

205
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:20,940
That's not right.

206
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,380
How can anyone bring so many goods without bodyguards?

207
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,140
Something is wrong with this caravan.

208
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,820
We might as well stay away from them.

209
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,380
Bro,

210
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,980
you think too much.

211
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,340
These people are obviously new here, so they don't know the rules.

212
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,580
They are stupid and rich.

213
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,340
Let's do something big,

214
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,500
and this winter,

215
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,220
we'll have enough money for food and clothes.

216
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,420
Dao,

217
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,780
I think we should forget it this time.

218
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,460
I heard that Wen Ye, the Prince Jin,

219
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,100
will build a military base camp in Quezhou.

220
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,460
The troops that transport the supplies 
will definitely pass Mount Crane.

221
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,100
We don't know when he'll be here.

222
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:49,940
I think

223
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,300
we should play it safe.

224
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,500
Don't make any trouble.

225
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,540
OK.

226
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,100
I'll listen to you, Master.

227
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,420
We won't go down the mountain these days.

228
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,020
In a few days,

229
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,460
it'll be the thirtieth anniversary

230
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,260
that we came to Tianhe Fortress to start our clan.

231
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,140
How about

232
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,620
we let our brothers

233
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,970
have a good drink?

234
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:08,940
Sure.

235
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,170
I'll leave it to you.

236
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,300
Arrange it well.

237
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,250
OK.

238
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,380
Da, come here.

239
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,180
I have something to ask you.

240
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:16,500
Let's go.

241
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,340
That old thing.

242
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,980
He's been a coward all his life.

243
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,860
I don't know what he's afraid of.

244
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:36,980
If you don't do it,

245
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,540
I'll do it myself.

246
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,260
The people of Nanzhu Pavilion are really generous.

247
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,220
As long as I help them finish this task,

248
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,620
I can live a rich life in the future.

249
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,180
I won't have to be a deputy

250
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,300
in this shabby fortress anymore.

251
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,740
Your Highness.

252
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,060
Your Highness.

253
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,060
Tao.

254
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,260
Your Highness.

255
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,740
His Highness will be out for a long time.

256
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,010
He hasn't come back yet.

257
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,340
♫You come from the mortal world♫

258
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,660
♫And laugh at me for not knowing about that world♫

259
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,500
♫You waved your hand with flowers♫

260
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,560
♫I see through the crowd♫

261
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,800
♫If I can just follow my heart♫

262
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:38,130
♫And let everything happen naturally♫

263
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,190
♫Only a few years to spend with you♫

264
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,520
♫Are far from enough♫

265
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,010
Tao.

266
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,490
No need to follow me.

267
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,330
I'm fine

268
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:54,130
♫I got an unexpected period of time♫

269
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:58,690
♫It was worth it to wander in loneliness in the past on a horseback♫

270
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:04,240
♫If it's a beautiful dream, what's wrong with going separate ways to our ends?♫

271
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:10,590
♫Love is a reward, and I'm willing to wander if it lasts long♫

272
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:15,290
♫Because the flowers once bloomed, I won't forget them after seeing them♫

273
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,780
Your Highness!

274
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:19,120
♫Do you know this glance♫

275
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,140
You're back!

276
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:25,720
♫Is the gaze that has made us stay so far away from each other?♫

277
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,140
I'm back.

278
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,300
Your Highness.

279
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,180
Have you lost weight?

280
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,020
It's good as long as you didn't lose weight.

281
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,220
Your Highness, you've been away for half a month.

282
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,500
I haven't eaten well.

283
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,420
How could I not lose weight?

284
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,330
Then let me have dinner with you tonight.

285
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,260
OK.

286
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,180
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

287
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,660
Your Highness, eat this.

288
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,780
This is also delicious.

289
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,220
This, too.

290
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:51,860
Your Highness, eat it.

291
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,260
Eat.

292
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,860
Why aren't you eating?

293
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,930
Your Highness, you don't know?

294
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,340
His Highness travels day and night

295
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,900
just to have dinner with you.

296
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,700
What's the need to eat? 
He'll be full by looking at you.

297
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,700
Right, Your Highness?

298
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,460
Let's eat.

299
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,580
By the way, Your Highness,

300
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,940
last time you promised to have an outing after you came back.

301
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,380
Is that promise still valid?

302
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,700
I have prepared a lot of baggage. I don't even unpack it.

303
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,260
Of course it's valid.

304
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,460
Let's go to Kunling Lake then.

305
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,940
I heard there's Chrysanthemum Festival over there.

306
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,780
It's very lively.

307
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,300
OK.

308
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,060
It's all up to you.

309
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,060
Let's eat.

310
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:39,890
OK.

311
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:55,900
Look.

312
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:56,900
Like this.

313
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,460
Put your hands over here.

314
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,740
Hook it over here and then there.

315
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:02,940
Your Highness, it's your turn.

316
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:04,580
How to play it?

317
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,620
Your Highness, put your hand here.

318
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,180
The same goes for your other hand.

319
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,890
Yes, flip it down.

320
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,140
That's it.

321
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,060
When I pull the thread with my hand like this…

322
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,860
♫On Willow Street, Peach Blossom Wine is brewing, brewing♫

323
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,770
♫I make a jar of it whose fragrance drifts for ten miles and which I'll preserve for half of my life♫

324
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,120
♫Raise the paper fan and sing♫

325
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,580
♫Sing to pray our lives are long and safe♫

326
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,820
♫With the bright Moonlight Shining and climbing up the fence♫

327
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,600
♫My longing is still hot and far from over♫

328
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:50,270
♫The bead curtains are swinging, shaking off the old times♫

329
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:55,820
Your Ladyship,

330
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,900
Her Highness asked me to send this.

331
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,060
Go in and try it?

332
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,100
OK.

333
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:04,740
Your Ladyship,

334
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,100
this is the Green Plums with Fermented Glutinous Rice made by Her Highness.

335
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:07,900
Have a taste.

336
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,060
It's very sweet and delicious.

337
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:17,940
And it's refreshing, too.

338
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,940
Although it's delicious,

339
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,340
the fermented rice is intoxicating.

340
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,220
Your Ladyship, you'd better not eat too much.

341
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,530
Everyone, come and have a look.

342
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,260
This flower

343
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,500
is a three-colored chrysanthemum that only blooms once in five years.

344
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,180
Your Highness, look, there's something interesting over there.

345
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,500
-Let's go and have a look.
-It's rare.

346
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,500
Let's go.

347
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,060
Come and have a look.

348
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,700
Let's go have a look too.

349
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,340
It's fun.

350
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:49,780
Mu'er.

351
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,380
Why don't you go and take a look?

352
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,940
I'll stay here with Your Ladyship.

353
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,140
Go.

354
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,060
Go and see what's fun.

355
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,210
Come back and tell me.

356
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:00,740
Well...

357
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,900
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

358
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,260
I don't think you can find another one like this in the capital.

359
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,220
Today is the Chrysanthemum Festival.

360
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,780
I'll use this three-colored chrysanthemum as a reward.

361
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,250
If anyone can go to the tower in the middle of the lake

362
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,660
and get the flower in the bottle on top of the tower

363
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,610
without getting his clothes wet,

364
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,780
I'll give him this three-colored chrysanthemum.

365
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:32,980
Your Highness.

366
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,490
It's so beautiful.

367
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,660
I've never seen a three-colored chrysanthemum before.

368
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,460
Let me try.

369
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,330
Awesome.

370
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,260
Don't show off.

371
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,620
Let me try.

372
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,220
Great!

373
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,850
What a pity.

374
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,100
He's not even as good as I.

375
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:09,980
It's so beautiful.

376
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,260
I've never seen a three-colored chrysanthemum before.

377
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:17,980
Your Highness.

378
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,020
Your Highness, you don't know this,

379
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,500
but His Highness has always been afraid of water.

380
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,740
He never dares to go anywhere near water.

381
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:27,660
Good.

382
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,860
Good job, Your Highness.

383
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,540
Bravo.

384
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,220
Murder!

385
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:53,620
[Sugar]

386
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,900
Nan Bo, take them away first.

387
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,340
Yes.

388
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,180
Let's go!

389
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,420
Go!

390
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,420
Your Ladyship, are you alright?

391
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,220
I'm alright.

392
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:23,660
Watch out!

393
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,220
Your Ladyship!

394
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,700
Leave me alone. Leave now.

395
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:47,860
Your Highness.

396
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,340
Brothers,

397
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,620
it's been 30 years.

398
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,180
Tianhe Fortress has been built

399
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,540
for 30 years.

400
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,770
30 years ago,

401
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,490
Tianhe Fortress was still a piece of barren land.

402
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:17,860
Today,

403
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,060
we are a happy big family.

404
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,220
We

405
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,700
have meat and wine.

406
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,170
We are here guarding our territory

407
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,060
happily and harmoniously.

408
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,940
I thank you all here.

409
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,860
-Thank you, Master.
-Thank you, everyone.

410
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,380
My family had a piece of land before.

411
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,100
Because we couldn't pay the rent,

412
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,500
the landlord took it back.

413
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,260
If it weren't for our fortress,

414
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,100
my family of five would have starved to death.

415
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,860
Today, I must propose a toast to Master.

416
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,860
OK. Come on.

417
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:48,620
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

418
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,620
My wife and I

419
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,900
were refugees fleeing here to Mount Crane

420
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,380
from the North.

421
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,770
Thank you for taking me in

422
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,900
and giving me a home.

423
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,460
Master.

424
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,500
I'll propose a toast to you, too.

425
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,180
Here.

426
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:03,500
Cheers.

427
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,660
Great!

428
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,100
Come on.

429
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,220
Let's propose a toast to Master together.

430
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,380
-OK. Cheers. 
-Cheers.

431
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,980
Brothers, fill the wine.

432
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,380
-Cheers! 
-Cheers!

433
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,460
Big Bro, come on. Fill it up.

434
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,610
What did you come so late?

435
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,060
What took you so long, Uncle Dao?

436
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:28,940
Brothers,

437
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,740
there's no limit to the wine and meat for you today.

438
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,460
OK.

439
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:33,780
You...

440
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,450
Come on.

441
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,060
Fill it up.

442
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:36,860
OK.

443
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:37,980
Come on, eat more.

444
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:39,420
Cheers.

445
00:21:59,140 --> 00:21:59,620
Your Highness.

446
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:00,660
Your Highness.

447
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,100
Your Highness.

448
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:03,850
Your Highness.

449
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,100
Your Highness.

450
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,020
Your Highness.

451
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:16,500
I'm fine.

452
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,220
Your Highness.

453
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,700
This seems to be the downstream of the river.

454
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,770
It's a wasteland.

455
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,380
Don't be afraid.

456
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,740
Nan Bo will come to look for us along the river.

457
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:27,900
After such a long time,

458
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,660
he should be able to find us soon.

459
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,740
I remember there's a lookout post not far away ahead.

460
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,380
Let's go.

461
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:34,820
OK.

462
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:40,620
Your Highness.

463
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,260
Your leg...

464
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:49,180
Don't look.

465
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,580
It's alright now.

466
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,340
What's wrong?

467
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,100
Your Highness.

468
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,020
Does it hurt?

469
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,260
It's fine.

470
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:23,540
It's just a minor injury.

471
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,460
I can even carry you.

472
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,460
You always say it's fine.

473
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,820
But we are both humans.

474
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,340
We were both born to a mom.

475
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,100
For me, a scratch would hurt.

476
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:39,940
Your Highness is bleeding so much.

477
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,900
How can it not hurt?

478
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,900
All the people in the world only care

479
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,540
whether I win the battle

480
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,500
or how many cities I've seized.

481
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,380
Only you care whether I'm in pain

482
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,810
or hurt.

483
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,020
My wife

484
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,140
is the person who loves me the most in the world.

485
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,380
I will tell you everything in the future,

486
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,540
whether it's a good thing or a bad thing.

487
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,140
OK?

488
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,620
That's more like it.

489
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:21,780
Let's go.

490
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,420
Your Highness, wait a moment.

491
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,300
Your Highness.

492
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,660
Try this.

493
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,460
I look like an old man.

494
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,660
Then I'll be the old wife of Your Highness.

495
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:53,620
Let's go.

496
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,420
Your Highness.

497
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,090
Lean on me.

498
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:05,350
[Hall of Loyalty]

499
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:05,980
Big Bro.

500
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,220
Come on, drink more.

501
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,820
I can't drink anymore.

502
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:12,820
The wine today

503
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,340
is too strong.

504
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:15,980
I can't drink anymore.

505
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,620
No, I won't drink anymore.

506
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,060
I can't drink anymore.

507
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,500
Go back.

508
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,460
It seems something is wrong with the wine today.

509
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,500
Embroidery of an iris?

510
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,340
Who would use this kind of embroidery?

511
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:01,900
Your Highness.

512
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,220
Who on earth were the people

513
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,300
who attacked us today?

514
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,300
I seemed to have seen a small iris

515
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,260
embroidered on their clothes.

516
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,300
Irises like warm and moist weather.

517
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,420
They grow in the State of Liang.

518
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,020
Those are the assassins of Nanzhu Pavilion from Liang State.

519
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,260
But Your Highness,

520
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,340
haven't you already defeated Liang State?

521
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,260
Although they have been defeated,

522
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:25,940
they

523
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,380
have been

524
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,780
planting spies and assassins in the capital.

525
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:29,740
That's how

526
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,220
Nanzhu Pavilion appeared.

527
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,010
The State of Liang refuses to give up their evil designs.

528
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,220
They're ready to invade us at any time.

529
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,460
What a despicable country.

530
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,620
They

531
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,540
tried to assassinate me once.

532
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,820
But they only dared to do it

533
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,380
when I was careless and unalert on my way back to the capital.

534
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,540
I don't know why they suddenly

535
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,580
came to assassinate me with great fanfare today.

536
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:50,820
Besides,

537
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,900
the time and place of the assassination

538
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,540
are not the most appropriate.

539
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,100
Based on my past experience dealing with them,

540
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,300
that

541
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,380
is not like something they'd do.

542
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,140
Do they

543
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,730
want Your Highness to wander in the suburbs?

544
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,820
But what would they gain by doing that?

545
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,380
Oh no.

546
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:16,860
Tomorrow morning,

547
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,820
the grain transportation unit will pass the valley of Mount Crane.

548
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:19,980
Your Highness.

549
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,500
Your Highness.

550
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,020
I'm late.

551
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,740
Send someone to send Her Highness back.

552
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,140
The rest of you, come with me.

553
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,020
Yes.

554
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,530
This is the symbol of the Nanzhu Pavilion.

555
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,620
I've been watching a caravan

556
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,220
down the mountain with my men.

557
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,620
Their food, clothes, and the things they use all looked very expensive.

558
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,620
They are transporting about a dozen big boxes.

559
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,620
But there are few bodyguards.

560
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,460
When they arrive at the valley,

561
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,940
I'll ask our men

562
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,290
to do something big!

563
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,300
If those caravans go to Quezhou to build the camp,

564
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:54,660
then

565
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,700
Nanzhu Pavilion wants to make use of us

566
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,090
to attack them.

567
00:27:59,540 --> 00:27:59,980
Dao.

568
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,220
Dao.

569
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,340
That Dao.

570
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,980
Master, what's wrong with you?

571
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:14,820
Leave me alone.

572
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:15,500
Hurry.

573
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,850
Go to the foot of the mountain and tell those caravans

574
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,100
not to set off tonight.

575
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,140
Go.

576
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:21,580
Yes.

577
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,580
A group of bandits

578
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,940
are trying to inform the officials and soldiers.

579
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,660
How interesting.

580
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:42,940
You...

581
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,820
If you want to live,

582
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,420
Tianhe Fortress must surrender to me

583
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,300
and be the secret post of Liang State from now on.

584
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,020
Liang...

585
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,260
Liang State?

586
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:14,860
You...

587
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,020
You are really from Liang State?

588
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,020
Dao, what…

589
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,140
What is going on?

590
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,140
I begged Chief

591
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,340
to spare your life.

592
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:26,820
Dao.

593
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,500
You know this.

594
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,340
We Tianhe Fortress can't do

595
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,140
anything to betray our country.

596
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,060
At this time,

597
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:34,660
yet you're still stubborn.

598
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,610
I didn't expect,

599
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:36,780
after all these years,

600
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,780
you are really an ungrateful man 
who'd betray your brothers.

601
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:48,900
No!

602
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,420
No!

603
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,260
No! No! No!

604
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,420
Please.

605
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,300
Please.

606
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,810
Stop killing them.

607
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:05,620
Please.

608
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:14,460
As long as you surrender to me,

609
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,100
your brothers won't die anymore.

610
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,220
Let me think about it.

611
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,660
Let me think about it.

612
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,660
For the sake of

613
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,740
you taking me in for so many years,

614
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,180
I took the blame for you.

615
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,370
Don't be ungrateful.

616
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,340
Dao.

617
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,020
All these years,

618
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,780
I've always been a coward.

619
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,820
But there's one thing that can't be changed.

620
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,660
We can't commit treason.

621
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,020
You know that.

622
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,660
You stubborn old man.

623
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,980
If you dare to get in my way again,

624
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:57,940
I'll kill you.

625
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,490
For the sake of our many years of friendship,

626
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:01,730
I advise you

627
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,700
to stop it before it's too late.

628
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,900
Stop talking nonsense.

629
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,740
I'll give you another half hour,

630
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,460
think it over.

631
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,380
Brothers,

632
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,140
you've been with me for so many years.

633
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,500
Even if I lose my life today,

634
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,020
I won't let you

635
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,260
be taken as traitors.

636
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,460
Zhou Yu.

637
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,740
Son.

638
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,060
From now on,

639
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,500
you'll have to rely on yourself.

640
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,460
This old man has been a coward all his life.

641
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,660
He even tried to set fire to himself before he died

642
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,780
to attract the soldiers.

643
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:37,500
Everyone,

644
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,610
evacuate immediately.

645
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,900
But everything we did will be in vain.

646
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,380
Once the mountain is on fire,

647
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,810
Wen Ye's soldiers will come here.

648
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:44,060
How many lives do you have to cast away?

649
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,180
My old man likes drinking spirit the most.

650
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:03,610
This

651
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,300
should be able to shut him up.

652
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,460
If he laughs at me for not being able to get a girl,

653
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,540
I'll run away from home.

654
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:17,940
Look how it's burnt.

655
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,860
Who did it?

656
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,700
What's going on?

657
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,179
Father!

658
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:15,420
Father!

659
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:26,260
Father!

660
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:28,980
Father!

661
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,179
Father!

662
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,460
Father!
