Your Highness, His Highness asked us to dress you up.

Why?

10
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,500
The person riding a horse is Prince Jin.

11
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,220
He doesn't look like a fierce devil.

12
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,460
He's so handsome.

00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,890
Prince Jin came to our mansion

with a lot of his guards.

22
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,700
Your Highness, why are you here

23
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,579
with such a large procession or parade?

24
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,180

25
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,140
Prime Minister. Don't you need to kneel to me?

26
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,540
Greetings, Your Highnesses.

27
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,620
The Princess and I have been married for some time.

28
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,220
I accompanied her

29
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,660

The Princess and I are close.

33
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,100
We're in a good relationship.

34
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,220
So I gave her the jade pendant I used to bring with me.

35
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,220
This jade pendant belonged to the late emperor. It's very meaningful.

36
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,740
We didn't expect that when the Princess went back here

38
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,980
she left the jade pendant here.

00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,690
Maybe Her Highness

40
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,460
accidentally lost it.

41
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,260
It's so valuable.

42
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,100
I'll send someone to find it.

43
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,740

45
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,340
We found the jade pendant in Madam Shen's room.

51
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,020
tell me,

how should we punish her?

53
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,460
Your Highness, since it's your jade,

54
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,620
it is

55
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,180

00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,220
Honey, you can't leave me alone!

58
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,460
How embarrassing!

59
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,820
You didn't cherish the gift bestowed by the late emperor.

60
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,620
Hurry and plead with the Her Highness for her great mercy

61
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,540

71
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,620

She likes to flog the servants

76
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,700

00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,980
No, don't.

80
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,940

00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,220
Madam Shen is 48 this year.

82
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,020

Aren't you worried that if someone wants to harm you,

you won't

175
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,460

With you by my side,

191
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,460
I'm not afraid of anything.

192
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:31,940
So,

193
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,900
are you not angry?

194
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,380
No.

195
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,900
When I saw you writing the divorce agreement that day,

196
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,500
I panicked.

197
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,660
That's why

198
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,780
I forced you to come back.

199
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,020
Actually,

200
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,140
I couldn't continue

201
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,170
after writing three words.

202
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,020
I know

203
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,420
you are sincere to me.

204
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,140
But

205
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,100
I can't get over the past.

206
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,940
Is the remarriage

207
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,580
true?

208
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,700
That's all a fortune-teller's nonsense.

209
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,100
You can't take that seriously.

210
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,700
I was angry at that time.

211
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,660
So I said it without thinking.

212
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:25,700
I'm sorry.

213
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,860
As your husband,

214
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,780
I failed to protect you.

215
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,300
I even doubted you

216
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:33,940
and rejected you

217
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,300
for a long time.

218
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,860
If I had known the truth earlier,

219
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,500
I wouldn't have let you suffer so much.

220
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,260
Your Highness.

221
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,820
I know

222
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,260
you and my father are political enemies in the court.

223
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,060
It's difficult

224
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,900
for you to trust me.

225
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:01,780
But do you know

226
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,820
why I have such a huge grudge against him?

227
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,460
I used to have a bunch of fellows

228
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,180
who shared woe and weal with me.

229
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,660
As soldiers in the Tiger Army,

230
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,020
they fought with me for ten years.

231
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,860
When the State of Liang came to attack,

232
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,020
we were ordered to guard the Zhenxi Pass.

233
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,820
We had been trapped for more than half a month.

234
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,540
We waited for the provisions sent by the court.

235
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:24,970
Unexpectedly,

236
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,180
Prime Minister Shen embezzled military funds

237
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,460
for his own selfish desire

238
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,580
and caused the delay of the provisions.

239
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:32,340
In the end,

240
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,850
Zhenxi Pass was lost.

241
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,460
My men

242
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,140
escorted me out of the encirclement.

243
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,500
In the end, I was the only one

244
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,380
in the Tiger Army who survived.

245
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,090
Prime Minister Shen attempted to undermine me

246
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,660
to safeguard his career.

247
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,180
There were attacks from the known

248
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:53,540
and the hidden,

249
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,260
from enemy nations,

250
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,580
and the court.

251
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,660
With this going on for a long time,

252
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,410
I couldn't feel at ease at all.

253
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,100
I became suspicious

254
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,500
and cautious.

255
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,420
I dare not trust anyone.

256
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,810
Your Highness, I thought

257
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,500
you were as invincible

258
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,500
as a god.

259
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,980
After what you told me today, I realized

260
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,620
you've suffered so much.

261
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,890
Compared to your hardships,

262
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,740
mine

263
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,580
are nothing to mention.

264
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,260
You are my princess.

265
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,180
Your emotions are important to me.

266
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,380
Although your surname is Shen,

267
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,420
you have nothing to do

268
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,060
with what he did.

269
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,380
I'm telling you this today

270
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,340
to show you my sincerity.

271
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,780
Your Highness, you are a good general

272
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:07,819
and a good husband.

273
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,060
Regardless of whether the future path

274
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,250
is smooth or challenging,

275
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,980
I will walk it with you.

276
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,180
Cheers.

277
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,980
Your Highness. Why do you have the bracelet I bought?

278
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:23,460
What about yours?

279
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,820
This gift may not be valuable

280
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,020
or flashy,

281
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,860
but it carries my most heartfelt wishes.

282
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,100
We'll be together forever.

283
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,980
We need to be paired up

284
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,380
like this bracelet

285
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,900
and never be apart.

286
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:48,860
Okay.

287
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,460
We will never be apart.

[Xingyue Pavilion]

289
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,210
Your Highness.

290
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,780
Last night, we...

291
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,580
We drank a little wine last night.

292
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,740
You were drunk.

293
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,250
I had to carry you back.

294
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,340
You had to?

295
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:38,980
Yes.

296
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:39,980
Don't worry.

297
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,260
Nothing happened.

298
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,260
Nothing happened?

299
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:45,740
It's true.

300
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,580
I promise

301
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,540
there's nothing between us.

302
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,380
Your Highness.

303
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:54,620
Stop talking.

304
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,100
Please go back to Shanglin Pavilion for breakfast.

305
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,660
There'll be something between us if you stay here for too long.

306
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,100
[Xingyue Pavilion]

307
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:23,900
Sir.

308
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,740
The two of you, come to my study.

309
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,860
I have something important to discuss with you.

310
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,940
Did anything happen

311
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,140
in the court overnight?

312
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,460
His Highness had just walked out of the Her Highness's room

313
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,340
when he approached us to discuss an important matter.

314
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,260
I think this matter

315
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,260
must be about Prime Minister Shen.

316
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,420
It must be about Prime Minister Shen.

317
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,420
I was right.

318
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,020
Sister Yunying.

319
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,660
I have something to tell you.

320
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,220
What's wrong?

321
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,500
Why are you in such a hurry?

322
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,300
Let's go.

323
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,580
Let's sit down first.

324
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,260
Then she pushed me out.

325
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,180
Why was she suddenly angry?

326
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,340
That's it?

327
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,100
Objection?

328
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,660
Did Her Highness get angry

329
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,060
when Your Highness did nothing?

330
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,460
This question is quite difficult.

331
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,380
Yes.

332
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,980
Are all women so strange?

333
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,860
His Highness has gone too far.

334
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,100
We slept in the same bed,

335
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,940
but he said nothing happened.

336
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,180
Her Highness might be disapproving

337
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,050
of your sleeping habits.

338
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,620
Did you snore?

339
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,780
Do I snore?

340
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,220
How could I snore?

341
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,180
Does he think I'm not in good shape,

342
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,980
not pretty or charming enough?

343
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:06,820
I see.

344
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,740
Her Highness's final words were to have you return

345
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,810
to the Shanglin Pavilion for your breakfast.

346
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,660
This means Her Highness has always been thrifty.

347
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,380
She just didn't want you to eat at her place.

348
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,380
That's very possible.

349
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:27,970
Sir.

350
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,860
I think

351
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,770
you are more important

352
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,820
than breakfast to the Princess.

353
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:34,860
Maybe

354
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,300
Her Highness had something troublesome on her mind.

355
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,660
Something troublesome?

356
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,260
Sister, why are you laughing?

357
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,060
His Highness despises me.

358
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,260
How can I be his wife?

359
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,140
I have no mood for breakfast today.

360
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,420
My silly brother

361
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,980
is really unthoughtful.

362
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,460
But I promise you

363
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,180
that he doesn't dislike you.

364
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,060
He still likes you.

365
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,580
But he grew up in a military camp.

366
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,660
He knows nothing about romance.

367
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:09,780
In this aspect,

368
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,740
he is clueless.

369
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,300
Your Highness, look.

[Swear Love]

371
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,020
In Chinese, the word "Swear"

372
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,780
only involves the mouth, not the heart.

373
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,780
And the word "Love"

374
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,140
contains a "heart" in it.

375
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,100
Only by feeling with the heart,

376
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,180
gathering all the details together,

377
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,620
is this the way of love.

378
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,060
Sister Yunying.

379
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,340
I understand.

380
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,500
His Highness is nice to me.

381
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,500
I like His Highness too.

382
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,340
But

383
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,500
I was too anxious

384
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,220
and didn't get the way.

385
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,180
I got angry with His Highness unreasonabaly.

386
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,700
It turns out that being a wife is also a skill to be learned.

387
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,580
Then I'll have to learn it well in the future.

388
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,100
Being a wife is a great skill to be learned.

389
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:25,660
The first thing

390
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,860
you need to learn

391
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,500
is to manage the house.

392
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,900
How can I do that?

393
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,380
I can't even manage myself.

394
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,700
Silly girl.

395
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,300
You are the Princess,

396
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,500
the hostess of the mansion.

397
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,820
It's natural for you to manage the mansion.

398
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,980
It's time to hand over the backyard accounts

399
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,500
and the keys to the storeroom to you.

400
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,290
I do have something that I want to do for her.

401
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,100
Prepare the carriage. We will go to Dazhao Temple.

402
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,300
To the Dazhao Temple?

403
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,050
Yes.

404
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,780
Bring the Princess here in the afternoon.

405
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,460
Sister Yunying.

406
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,570
His Highness is His Majesty's brother

407
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,180
and Prince Jin with great military achievements.

408
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,260
But I don't think

409
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,540
our mansion is wealthy.

410
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,060
My brother

411
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,980
neither likes gold and silver

412
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,060
nor has an interest in antiques.

413
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,700
He has nowhere to spend his salary.

414
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,700
His money is either used

415
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,460
for disaster relief and aiding refugees,

416
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,450
or it goes to the military

417
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,620
to purchase equipment and supplies.

418
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,180
The rest of the money

419
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,420
is just enough for all expenses in the mansion.

420
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,340
I wonder if the money is enough.

421
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,140
It's said that a newly appointed official always needs to do a few impactful things first.

422
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,100
Your Highness,

423
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,490
what is the first thing

424
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,460
you want to do?

425
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,140
I've always wanted to do something for His Highness.

426
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,580
Tell me.

427
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,140
Your Highness, as long as you want to do it,

428
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,060
I'll support you.

429
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,620
Yi Fu,

430
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,420
go to the market with Her Highness

431
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,260
and buy everything she needs.

432
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:27,970
Yes, My Lady.

What do you want?

This, this,

And these two.

439
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,620

443
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,340
5 taels? Madam.

444
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,140
You negotiated for too deep a discount.

445
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,210
I won't sell it.

446
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,180
Boss.

447
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,500
Look.

448
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,020
Your fabric has been left outside for too long,

449
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,140
and the quality has deteriorated.

450
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,220
And these.

451
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,340
Spring is short.

452
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,180
If you don't sell it to me, by the time it goes out of season,

453
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,300
you won't be able to make much money from it.

454
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,140
Boss,

455
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,060
I really want it.

456
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:23,740
How about this?

457
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,460
I'll add more.

458

We will definitely come back to patronize your business.

463
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,300
Alright, Madam.

464
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,060
You should come here more often

465
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,620
and patronize my business.

466
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,700

Your Highness, you're really something.

471

473
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,100
I don't have to worry

474
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,980
about the monthly expenses.

475
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,810
Steward Yi. You flatter me.

476
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,980
I only know how to save money.

477
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,780
I still have a lot to learn.

478
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,140
Your Highness, you are too modest.

479
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:03,820
Please wait here.

480
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,700
I'll get the carriage ready.

Miss. A letter for you.

482
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,220
It's not convenient in the city.

483
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,220
I will wait for you in the bamboo grove at Mount Ting on the outskirts of the capital.

484
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,140
I have something important to tell you.

Where is Her Highness?

I couldn't find Her Highness in the mansion.

Please punish me.

493
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:00,820

So I stayed longer.

00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,340
I stayed at the post at the foot of the Dazhao Temple.
