00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,140
Thief! Catch the thief!

193
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:22,940
Go find His Highness!

194
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,020
Catch the thief!

195
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,580
No, go find Steward Yi. Go.

196
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:28,900
Thief.

197
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,500
She really is a thief.

198
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,420
How dare she steal so many things?

199
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,900
You bold servant!

200
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,780
How dare you steal things from Her Highness's residence?

201
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,340
According to the rules of the Prince's Mansion,

202
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,620
she should be taught a lesson and severely punished.

203
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,700
Yes.

204
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,100
Stop!

205
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,060
I'm the princess. How dare you hit me!

206
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,460
Have you seen Her Highness before?

207
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,060
No.

208
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,260
Is she going crazy trying to climb the social ladder?

209
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,060
Why is she vomiting blood?

210
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,500
My goodness.

211
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,700
Could she have any disease

212
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,860
that can infect people?

213
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,180
I heard that many people in the suburbs

214
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,900
have recently contracted a strange disease with coughing up blood.

215
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,140
Kill this thief!

216
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,620
Don't let her spread the strange disease to the mansion.

217
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,140
I'll kill you!

218
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,420
I'll kill you!

219
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,700
Steward Yi!

220
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,460
Lower your voice.

221
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,660
Steward Yi, a maid named Tao is looking for you.

222
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,340
Steward Yi, a thief was caught in the laundry in the backyard.

223
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,180
You...

224
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,140
Why did you come to me for such trivial matters?

225
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,780
Ask the people in the backyard to take care of it.

226
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,820
Or beat her up and throw her out.

227

[Pristine Atmosphere and Pure Spirit]

228
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,380
Yes.

229
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:33,540
Yes.

230
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,740
These are not the paper and ink in the mansion.

231
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,060
Is His Highness willing to see me?

232
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,860
Leave. His Highness is busy.

233
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,780
Please let me meet His Highness.

234
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,340
Go away.

235
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,860
Don’t make trouble for the front yard.

236
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,100
Can just anyone impersonate our princess?

237
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,060
Someone fell into the water!

238
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,220
Help!

239
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:53,770
Go take a look.

240
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,460
Okay.

241
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,260
How are you?

242
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,100
Are you okay?

243
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,210
Your Highness.

244
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,620
No one believes me.

245
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,570
This is the only way I can see you.

246
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,380
Her Highness is in the backyard. Please save her.

247
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,410
Your Highness, the servants said

248
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,700
there was a thief in the backyard. Could it be...

249
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,700
Your Highness, I'm guilty.

250
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,220

-Yes.

You didn't.

300
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,140
It was my fault.

301
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,060
Tell me.

302
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,860
What's your reason?

303
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,220
Who did this

00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,500
to Her Highness?

305
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,340
Sister.

306
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,700
Apply some medicine for her

307
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,930
and get her changed. The imperial physician will be here soon.

308
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,210
Okay.

309
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,340
[Qulan Pavilion]

310
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:38,620
Your Highness.

311
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,580
Sister.

312
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,220
Is she okay?

313
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,420
She's asleep.

314
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:46,740
Your Highness.

315
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,060
I have something to tell you.

316
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,170
I suspect

317
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,020
something is wrong with the servants in Her Highness's chamber.

318
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,780
Her Highness has some old injuries.

319
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,220
It looks like she was pinched and beaten.

320
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,380
The culprit even picked places

321
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,820
that are not easy to find.

322
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,820
The imperial physician also checked Her Highness's pulse

323
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,940
and found that Her Highness was poisoned with a very hidden poison.

324
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,860
This poison will cause abdominal pain at the beginning,

325
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,980
but there won't be anything wrong with her pulse.

326
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,970
If I hadn't suspected that something was amiss

327
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,060
with the servants in the princess's chamber,

328
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,540
I wouldn't have started thinking about poisoning

329
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,900
as the cause of the pulse examination results.

330
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,220
Can the poison be detoxified?

331
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,540
Fortunately, she didn't take much.

332
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,660
The imperial physician has already used acupuncture and released the toxic blood.

333
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,780
She should be fine after a few days of recuperation.

334
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,620
Your Highness,

335
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,500
the relationship in the backyard of the Shen family

336
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,420
is much more complicated than we thought.

337
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,180
Prime Minister Shen has several wives and concubines.

338
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:34,820
He has many children.

339
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,020
It's not surprising for them to fight for fortune and power.

340
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,700
I'm afraid Her Highness's just a sacrifice.

341
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,260
But since she's here in our mansion,

342
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,940
we must protect her.

343
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:49,740
Don't worry.

344
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,900
I will investigate this thoroughly.

345
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,940
Your Highness, I don't know.

346
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:10,780
It's...

347
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,260
It's Biyun.

348
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,140
Biyun bullied Her Highness and stole her dowery behind my back.

349
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,740
She deserves to die thousands of times.

350
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,500
There's a mole in this yard.

351
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,460
It's my fault. Please punish me.

352
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,980
Since she's from the Shen family,

353
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,460
put the maid in the handcuffs

354
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,620
and stab the character "Shen" in her face.

355
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,810
After flogging her 50 times,

356
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,220
you take her back to the Shen family.

357
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,380
What do you think, Aunt Xin?

358
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,380
Thank you, Your Highness.

359
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,780
Please spare my life, Your Highness. I know I was wrong.

360
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,460
Spare my life, Your Highness!

361
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,380
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

362
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,660
Spare my life, Your Highness!

363
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,020
Your Highness.

364
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,620
This was found in Aunt Xin's room.

365
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,820
Your Highness, this is not poison.

366
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,580
It's tonic.

367
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,380
I thought Her Highness was not feeling well,

368
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,780
so I wanted to give her some nourishment.

369
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,180
Tonic?

370
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,380
Since it's tonic,

371
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,660
I'll reward it to Aunt XIn.

372
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,740
Your Highness.

373
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,260
Open your mouth.

374
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,260
Yi Fu.

375
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,500
Yes, Your Highness.

376
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,490
Aunt Xin has done a great job protecting her master.

377
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,580
She should be rewarded.

378
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,420
Feed her this every day.

379
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,340
Yes.

380
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,620
Your Highness, please spare my life.

381
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,180
Sir.

382
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,940
Aunt Xin is obviously the culprit.

383
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,420
Why didn't you kick her out of the mansion?

384
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,020
Some assassins deliberately framed the Princess,

385
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,220
accusing her of being disloyal to me.

386
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,940
I'll assume that the assassins

387
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,340
used the Princess as a scapegoat

388
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,780
to cover the true instigator behind them

389
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,940
because they knew about my conflict with the Shen family.

390
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:05,860
But

391
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,180
what a coincidence!

392
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,900
Even those servants of the Shen family dare offend their master.

393
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,860
This is really strange.

394
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:14,860
Sir.

395
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,140
You think these two things are connected?

396
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,100
I'm not clear about the conflicts among the women

397
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,980
in the Shen family.

398
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,540
But it seems that the Princess was not treated well in the Shen family.

399
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,460
That's why she was bullied.

400
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,020
But they dare to reach into the Prince's Mansion.

401
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,860
There must be the tacit consent of Prime Minister Shen behind them.

402
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,500
Even the vicious tiger won't eat its cubs.

403
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,460
The way the Shen family did it is so strange.

404
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,700
There must be something

405
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,940
that we don't know.

406
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,380
Sir.

407
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,570
We've found out what happened in the backyard.

408
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,250
It's Biyun who served in Xingyue Pavilion.

409
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,480
wanted to bully Tao.

410
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,580
Her Highness saved Tao.

411
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,900
But the Princess rarely ordered the servants around.

412
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,260
So few people have seen her.

413
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,810
Biyun took advantage of that

414
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,420
and framed Her Highness as a thief

415
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,460
and led the people in the backyard to attack Her Highness.

416
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,020
Did she suffer this

417
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,860
just to save a little maid?

418
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,260
That's true.

419
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,060
Sir.

420
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,660
Through what happened today,

421
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,660
I don't think Her Highness is pretending.

422
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,220
She is indeed a warm-hearted person

423
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,380
who likes to fight injustice.

424
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,540
She and her father

425
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,580
aren't on the same page.

426
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,100
But the Princess sneaking out of the mansion today

427
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,740
is indeed suspicious.

428
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,330
Go ask around

429
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,900
and see who she met

430
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:19,820
and what she did today.

431
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:20,700
Yes.

432
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,540
Sir.

433
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,740
Why don't you ask Her Highness yourself?

434
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,380
What if Her Highness will lie to His Highness?

435
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,660
What if she won't?

436
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:42,940
Wouldn't this hurt their relationship?

437
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:50,030
[Shanglin Pavilion]

438
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,020
Get up if you're awake.

439
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:10,540
Shen Keyi.

440
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,340
I know everything.

441
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,300
Your Highness.

442
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,300
You already know?

443
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,740
I've found out

444
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,290
what happened in the backyard.

445
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,380
Your servants poisoned you

446
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,740
and tried to kill you.

447
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,940
Why did they do that?

448
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,420
Are you not favored in the Shen family?

449
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,180
At first, they only wanted you to be a widow.

450
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,060
But they didn't expect you to become the real princess.

451
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:44,940
They were jealous of you.

452
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,460
That's why they wanted to hurt you.

453
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,420
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

454
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,020
Your Highness, you didn't like me.

455
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,140
You may not believe me even if I told you.

456
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,380
I admit

457
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,100
I'm a very suspicious person.

458
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,380
But from now on,

459
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,100
as long as you don't lie to me,

460
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,530
I will try to believe you.

461
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,940
I won't set any strange rules

462
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,140
and neglect you.

463
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:20,980
Your Highness.

464
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:22,810
Is what you said

465
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,020
true?

466
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,540
Then why did you go out

467
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,780
today?

468
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,620
Your Highness, you ignored me.

469
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,740
So I wanted to find a way out.

470
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,340
It was all my fault.

471
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,700
I made you suffer.

472
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,620
What kind of compensation do you want?

473
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:48,780
Just tell me.

474
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,100
Don't you blame me for hiding things from you?

475
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,290
I know

476
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,060
you are a pure good girl.

477
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,780
But you have your reasons.

478
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,260
So I don't blame you

479
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,420
for hiding things from me.

480
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,540
Your Highness.

481
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,620
That maid, Tao, is innocent.

482
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,780
Tao is loyal to her master.

483
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:15,940
It's commendable.

484
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:17,900
I won't punish her.

485
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,380
But Steward Yi

486
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:25,980
didn't manage the backyard properly

487
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:26,980
and neglected his duty,

488
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,660
I'll flog him 20 times

489
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:29,980
and ask him to reflect on himself.

490
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:31,860
Your Highness.

491
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,380
Forget it.

492
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,180
I'm fine now.

493
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,060
Don't punish Steward Yi.

494
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,020
Getting flogged really hurts.

495
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,380
He's getting old.

496
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,540
If he is severely hurt,

497
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,220
he won't be able to perform

498
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,580
"I'm guilty" again.

499
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,260
Approved.

500
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,140
But I was asking you to ask for compensation.

501
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,700
Yet you're pleading for others.

502
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:55,580
Then,

503
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,860
can you take back what you said?

504
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:02,100
Which sentence?

505
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,180
You said

506
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,460
you wouldn't allow me to go near Shanglin Pavilion

507
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,620
and you don't want to see me again.

508
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,220
[Ye]

509
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,100
This is my token.

510
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,740
Seeing this is like seeing me.

511
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,500
You can move freely in the mansion at will if you bring this with you.

512
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,260
Even if servants who haven't met you

513
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,740
will obey you.

514
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,690
[Ye]

515
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:35,780
Take it.

516
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,340
For me?

517
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:41,980
You don't want it?

518
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:43,860
But...

519
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,460
This is your token.

520
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:48,820
You must have worn it for a long time.

521
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,090
[Ye]

522
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,820
It's very important, isn't it?

523
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,180
Father gave it to me.

524
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,940
It's a death-exemption plate.

525
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,380
With this jade pendant,

526
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,700
I can avoid going to the fief,

527
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,500
retain my military power,

528
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:07,020
and escape capital punishment.

529
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,300
Then...

530
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,820
if you give me this jade pendant,

531
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:14,100
you'll be in danger

532
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,460
without the amulet, will you?

533
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,100
What danger will I face?

534
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,850
I haven't used it once in these years.

535
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,660
Even without this jade pendant,

536
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,060
I can protect myself.

537
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,780
This jade pendant

538
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,180
is just an external possession to me.

539
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,780
But when it's on you, it can protect you well.

540
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,380
It's worth it.

541
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,460
Keep it.

542
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,020
If you lose it,

543
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,380
I won't forgive you.
