[Episode 9]

4
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:41,420
Get out of my way!

5
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,380
Drop your weapons.

6
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,009
His Highness is taking over this place.

7
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,170
Your Highness,

8
00:01:58,539 --> 00:01:59,300
according to investigation,

9
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,980
there were suspicious people in this yard.

10
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,700
The people here just left.

11
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,130
About 6 to 7 people.

12
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:45,940
Didn't Her Highness buy this?

13
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,579
She did come here.

14
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,140
I asked the soldiers in the military camp.

15
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,380
Even a fly can't get out

16
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,260
these days,

17
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,820
not to mention 6 to 7 people.

18
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,329
Block the mountain roads.

19
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,060
Block the mountain roads?

20
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:56,940
Sir,

21
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,380
we need a lot of people to do that.

22
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,780
Mobilize the Tiger Army.

23
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,420
Mobilize the army?

24
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:00,980
Sir,

25
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,180
this place is very close to the capital.

26
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,500
If you mobilize the army,

27
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,180
what if someone takes advantage of that?

28
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:05,460
Well...

29
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,500
I'm already very close to her.

30
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,980
Even if there is only a ray of hope,

31
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,860
I must find her.

32
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,230
[Ye]

33
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,220
With this,

34
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,420
Prince Jin will no longer be a hard nut to crack.

35
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,020
And His Excellency can be further promoted

36
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,820
and be invincible in the imperial court.

37
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,020
Madam,

38
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,260
Prince Jin personally sent troops

39
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,460
to look for her in Qiyu Village.

40
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,500
He sent troops?

41
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,340
Such a big move.

42
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,540
Is he crazy?

43
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,500
According to Commander Zhang,

44
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,540
since the beginning,

45
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,460
Shen Keyi has been protected by a powerful man.

46
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,900
Then Prince Jin went to Qiyu Village himself.

47
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,060
It seems that he got some news.

48
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,020
If Wen Ye finds her,

49
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,780
he will know we lied, right?

50
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,570
No.

51
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,660
Go find Commander Zhang now.

52
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:03,980
Tell him

53
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,300
no matter what it takes,

54
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,500
he has to kill Shen Keyi before Wen Ye finds her

55
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,180
and frame those bandits.

56
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:10,380
Otherwise,

57
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,260
if they know about this,

58
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,020
it will end badly for all of us.

59
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,170
Yes, Madam.

60
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:32,980
You're awake.

61
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,060
Have some water.

62
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,580
You are my hostage.

63
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,700
But I've been poisoned.

64
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,380
I'm a dying person.

65
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,060
You can't use me to get the ransom.

66
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,420
Silly girl.

67
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:09,980
If you hadn't

68
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,300
baked sweet potatoes,

69
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,940
I would still be hungry now.

70
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,580
I'm indebted to you.

71
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,890
I won't leave you alone.

72
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,060
Besides,

73
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,020
I have a connection with your nanny.

74
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,620
For her sake,

75
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,740
I should take good care of you.

76
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,700
I didn't expect that when I'm in a tight corner,

77
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,300
the person I count on the most

78
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,780
wants to kill me,

79
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,420
but a stranger who just met me a few times

80
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,170
has been of great help.

81
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,460
Oh right.

82
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:47,380
Eat something.

83
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,860
I picked this from the cliff.

84
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,140
Although I've never seen this kind of fruit before,

85
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,290
it tastes

86
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,420
sweet.

87
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,260
It can make you full.

88
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,970
Hang in there.

89
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,100
After I take you to my fortress,

90
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,330
my father knows medical skills,

91
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,420
and he can cure you.

92
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:08,940
Is it sweet?

93
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,780
I used to love sweet food.

94
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,300
Now I know

95
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:21,820
sweetness

96
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,900
is felt not through the tongue,

97
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,460
but the heart.

98
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,340
The rashes on her body are gone.

99
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,460
And her fever is gone too.

100
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,420
I think she's recovered.

101
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:18,740
Ke.

102
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:20,860
How are you feeling?

103
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,180
This is my father.

104
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,420
These are the people in our fortress.

105
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,860
Are we in the fortress now?

106
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:35,540
No.

107
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,690
We're still in Qiyu Village.

108
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,940
You are so weak.

109
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,210
How can I let you move?

110
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,130
Then why are they...

111
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,090
My son is a troublemaker.

112
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,820
I planned to come here to collect his body.

113
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,060
I didn't expect that he's still alive.

114
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:50,940
Father,

115
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,900
can you say something good about me?

116
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,970
Look at you.

117
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:55,580
I...

118
00:07:58,659 --> 00:07:59,100
Ke,

119
00:07:59,570 --> 00:07:59,980
don't be afraid.

120
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,260
These people

121
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,300
won't hurt you.

122
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:03,060
Then...

123
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,660
why have I recovered?

124
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,460
Do you see this?

125
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,860
This is called the Earth Spiritual Fruit.

126
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,380
The leaves are bitter, but the fruits are sweet.

127
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,820
Some leaves fell into the river

128
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,940
and blended into the underground water.

129
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,540
It was not poisonous at first.

130
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,460
But I don't know

131
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,260
who put sleeping drugs in the well.

132
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,820
When blended with the leaves,

133
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,580
it's highly toxic.

134
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,900
Luckily, the fruits can eliminate the poison.

135
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,900
You accidentally took the antidote

136
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,300
to save your life.

137
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:27,780
Father.

138
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,060
Well...

139
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,380
Let's go back to the fortress now.

140
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,220
The soldiers have blocked the roads.

141
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,260
I think it's more difficult for us to leave.

142
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,380
That's right.

143
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:36,700
Let's go.

144
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,220
If some villagers who don't know this

145
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,900
drink the poisonous well water,

146
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,370
then...

147
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,700
They have the imperial court.

148
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,100
Their doctors are much more capable than me.

149
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,620
We are bandits.

150
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:55,940
We don't dare to face the soldiers.

151
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,140
That's right, Ke.

152
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,580
The soldiers have blocked the roads to arrest you.

153
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,660
You can't walk right to them.

154
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,900
If you're really worried,

155
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,180
I'll go back on behalf of you.

156
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,930
Mind your own business.

157
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,740
Do you know whose soldiers came this time?

158
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,380
Prince Jin's Tiger Army.

159
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,260
It's easy to kill 10 of you.

160
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,260
Well...

161
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,540
Did he come in person?

162
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,140
Yes.

163
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,620
He even sent a lot of soldiers.

164
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,180
Considering such a big move,

165
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,580
who dares to mess with him?

166
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,020
He's coming for me.

167
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,620
I can't get you implicated.

168
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,300
I'm going to go back to Qiyu Village

169
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,780
and apologize to him.

170
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,940
And I can tell the villagers about the cure.

171
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,220
Ke,

172
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:36,780
wait for me.

173
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:37,980
I'll go with you.

174
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,940
I said I will protect you.

175
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,140
I don't care if he's a prince.

176
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,780
He shouldn't bully a weak girl.

177
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,300
Let's go.

178
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,220
Let's go.

179
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,500
Look at him chasing a woman.

180
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,060
Fool.

181
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,620
Master,

182
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,780
what should we do?

183
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,540
What should we do?

184
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,260
Collect his body, of course.

185
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:06,860
Let's go.

186
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,100
Commander Zhang,

187
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,900
His Highness has been lured to the bottom of the cliff.

188
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,380
But we may not be able to stall him for too long.

189
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,460
Do it now.

190
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,220
Ke, don't be afraid.

191
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,420
Sir, please.

192
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,780
Every debt has its debtor.

193
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,420
They caused trouble. Don't attack us.

194
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:10,940
Old man,

195
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,580
stop talking nonsense at this critical moment.

196
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,370
Leave now. Do you want to get your father implicated?

197
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,890
Ke, let's go.

198
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,060
Arrest them!

199
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,380
Your Highness.

200
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,180
They told me

201
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,220
they found the princess's shoe here.

202
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,820
The sole is too clean.

203
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,340
It rained heavily these days.

204
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,900
There is mud everywhere around the cliff.

205
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,900
If the princess fell from here,

206
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,660
the sole should have been covered with mud.

207
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,460
Something is wrong.

208
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,780
Someone is deliberately

209
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,780
leading us to a wrong direction.

210
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,460
Come on!

211
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,980
You can't escape anymore.

212
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,860
You guilty substitute.

213
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,940
You're a scourge wherever you go.

214
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,540
You've gotten His Highness implicated.

215
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:53,820
Before you die,

216
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,340
do you still want to get another person implicated?

217
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,010
Don't listen to him.

218
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,420
You're not a scourge.

219
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,980
You bastards!

220
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,170
Let me

221
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,140
play with you.

222
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:19,740
Zhou Yu.

223
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:56,740
Your...

224
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,180
Your Highness.

225
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:58,940
Your Highness.

226
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,060
Ke.

227
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:39,820
Your Highness,

228
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,140
I'm a concubine's daughter,

229
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,700
not a noble lady.

230
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:46,940
It was

231
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,220
all my fault.

232
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,900
It has nothing to do with them.

233
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,060
Please let them go.

234
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,260
Whether it's the death penalty or not,

235
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,060
please punish me alone.

236
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:00,860
Stand up.

237
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:04,890
Shen Keyi.

238
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,540
In your heart,

239
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,580
do you think I'm just here to punish you?

240
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,420
Your Highness,

241
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,620
please let them go.

242
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,890
Is it true

243
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,260
about stealing the jade pendant?

244
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:32,820
Yes.

245
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,740
Do you have anything to explain?

246
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,380
No.

247
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,780
I'll take the responsibility.

248
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,940
Your Highness,

249
00:15:59,260 --> 00:15:59,980
please let them go.

250
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,940
I will die

251
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,450
as you wish.

252
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:11,780
Ke!

253
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,370
What are you doing?

254
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,060
When did I say I want you to die?

255
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,500
Your Highness,

256
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,340
everything I said

257
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,780
and everything I did are not true.

258
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,620
I'm an evil person,

259
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,660
just like what you think.

260
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,300
I approached you

261
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,820
with a secret.

262
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,380
I wanted to hurt you.

263
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,500
It was all my fault.

264
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,740
It has nothing to do with them.

265
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:25,859
Leave.

266
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:02,960
♫I took off the winding light sent by the moon♫

267
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:10,710
♫I cut the hidden line at the center of the palm silently♫

268
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:14,480
♫Among the clouds and in the sky♫

269
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,280
♫My missing of you is hidden secretly♫

270
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:24,830
♫Only a light of our predestined love is left there, and it's flickering♫

271
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,500
Your Highness,

272
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,620
since we met,

273
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:31,230
♫I vaguely remember that in our previous life, we passed by each other♫

274
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,620
you've saved me so many times.

275
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,100
This time,

276
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:38,280
♫But it's a vow that we can't fulfill in this life♫

277
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,460
let me save you.

278
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,620
Nanny is gone.

279
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,440
♫We failed to meet again♫

280
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,660
No matter what,

281
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,490
♫This love has lasted for several times of reincarnation♫

282
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,060
I can't be the sword of Prime Minister Shen anymore.

283
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:52,830
♫The mystery of love can't be solved, but I'm still indulged in it♫

284
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,260
♫Who is destined to♫

285
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:59,430
♫Lose his chance and face the chaotic situation?♫

286
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,460
I will always remember

287
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,310
♫The memories of happiness and sorrow♫

288
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,700
your protection for me

289
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:06,780
♫Are engraved in my heart, and have become my nightmares♫

290
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,780
and your kindness to me.

291
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,780
I will remember every bit of them.

292
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,300
♫Who stood opposite the destiny♫

293
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:14,430
♫And took one more look at the old smiling face?♫

294
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,900
Your Highness,

295
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,890
I'm sorry.

296
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,350
♫I'm not able to escape from♫

297
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,780
I have to leave you.

298
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:22,420
♫The parting where prosperity has withered♫

299
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:32,620
Your Highness,

300
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,460
I heard

301
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,940
the men of Tianhe Fortress were just passing by.

302
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,420
They've always been well-behaved.

303
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,020
They are not like those who do bad things and commit crimes.

304
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,340
But I wonder why Commander Zhang

305
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,050
wouldn't let them go.

306
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,060
This matter

307
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,460
is not as simple as he said.

308
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,660
Prime Minister Shen sent the soldiers from the military camp.

309
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,340
Shen Keyi was trapped here.

310
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,940
It was Madam Shen's trick.

311
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,220
I don't believe these two things are not related at all.

312
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,380
Commander Zhang

313
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:55,820
should be investigated carefully.

314
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:56,740
Yes.

315
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,620
By the way, Your Highness,

316
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:00,700
I also found out

317
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,580
the villagers here

318
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,820
were poisoned

319
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,740
because they drank the water in the well.

320
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:04,900
And the antidote

321
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,420
is the Earth Spiritual Fruit growing on the edge of the cliff.

322
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,180
Her Highness will go pick the fruits tomorrow

323
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,020
to cure the villagers.

324
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,900
Why don't we go help her?

325
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,090
So you can take the chance

326
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,260
to talk to Her Highness.

327
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,700
It concerns people's livelihood.

328
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,260
Of course we should send someone.

329
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,620
What do you mean by taking the chance to talk to her?

330
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,380
Do you think I would do such a thing?

331
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,260
I shouldn't have said that.

332
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,980
Thank you, Guard Wan.

333
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,460
Madam,

334
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,980
you've been kneeling for two days without eating or drinking.

335
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,460
Your body won't be able to take it if you keep doing this.

336
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,420
I can't help with anything outside.

337
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,740
I can only pray for His Highness and Her Highness

338
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,100
to come back safely.

339
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,220
Please forgive me.

340
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:48,580
Guard Wan.

341
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,060
What are you doing, Guard Wan?

342
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,340
Guard Wan.

343
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,420
Put me down!

344
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,620
Guard Wan!

345
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,700
Guard Wan, put me down.

346
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,220
Please punish me, Madam.

347
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,420
Guard Wan,

348
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:09,900
you may leave.

349
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,380
I...

350
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,580
I'll keep watch at the door.

351
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,500
The wind is strong tonight.

352
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,780
But don't be afraid.

353
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,020
Guard Wan,

354
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,700
actually, what I fear the most

355
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,140
is that I will see my loved ones dead again.

356
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,380
My brother and the princess

357
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,130
are among my only kinsfolk.

358
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:41,380
If possible,

359
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,780
I'm willing to exchange my life

360
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,100
for their safety.

361
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,420
Your life

362
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:50,940
is also precious.

363
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,580
Be careful.

364
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:20,910
Hold it.

365
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:21,910
Pull me up.

366
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,900
Father.

367
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,580
Are they together?

368
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,490
Why are they dressed differently?

369
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,500
In my life,

370
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,220
I've never seen bandits and soldiers

371
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,860
get along with each other.

372
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,700
How interesting.

373
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,140
Thank you.

374
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,780
Let me do it. You go have some water.

375
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,130
Don't move.

376
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,610
You can't go.

377
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,140
Why?

378
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,140
Your Highness, you're so nosy.

379
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:04,940
Give it back to me.

380
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,660
Wait here.

381
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,380
Consider them picked by you.

382
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,500
It's too dangerous for you to go down alone.

383
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,540
I will take care of myself.

384
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,940
I haven't punished you yet.

385
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,700
You have to be safe.

386
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,260
Your Highness,

387
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,620
how will you punish me?

388
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,980
I will think about it.

389
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,780
Then can you let me go now?

390
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,460
Your Highness,

391
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,780
go get a doctor now

392
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,300
to bandage your wound.

393
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,740
You did this.

394
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,180
You should bandage my wound.

395
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,180
When I was picking the fruits,

396
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,220
I tore the wound.

397
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,340
Does it hurt?

398
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,340
Yes.

399
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,340
I'm clumsy.

400
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,140
You should find someone else.

401
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,540
It doesn't hurt anymore.

402
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,220
Keep bandaging it.

403
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,780
My sister knows you're safe.

404
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,180
So she asked someone to deliver some desserts to you

405
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,900
from the mansion.

406
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:25,100
They should be your favorites.

407
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,540
Thank Sister Yunying for me.

408
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,370
But I don't like these anymore.

409
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,180
Don't you always like desserts?

410
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,620
I used to like them,

411
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,620
but I don't like them now.

412
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:40,940
Your Highness,

413
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,660
it's done.

414
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,620
I'm leaving.

415
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,980
We must have carried more than them.

416
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,580
We've been living in the mountains.

417
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,700
Climbing a cliff is easy.

418
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,260
We've gone through fire and water with His Highness.

419
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,980
We've been through all kinds of terrains.

420
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,260
This cliff

421
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,010
is like the flat ground to us.

422
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,020
Stop bragging.

423
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,180
You're bragging.

424
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:24,940
-Young Master.
-You're bragging.

425
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:25,820
It seems the number of their baskets

426
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,380
is as many as ours.

427
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,140
We have another basket.

428
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,100
We won.

429
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,260
You're shameless.

430
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,540
She's the princess.

431
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,100
This basket belongs to us.

432
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:41,500
Your Highness.

433
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,460
Ke,

434
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,980
you must be on our side,

435
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,460
right?

436
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:46,780
Your Highness.

437
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,540
Childish.

438
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,620
Why don't you distribute the fruits to the villagers after picking them?

439
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,900
Did you hear that? Her Highness said you are childish.

440
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:56,380
Here.

441
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,180
Thank you.

442
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:58,620
Here.

443
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:00,740
Thank you.

444
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,140
Wen Ye

445
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,250
didn't give me a hard time.

446
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,660
I don't know how he will punish me.

447
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,420
If he dares to hurt you,

448
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,260
I'll put up a desperate fight with him.

449
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,820
I don't want you to risk your life.

450
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,340
You'll become a hero someday.

451
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:16,700
Me?

452
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,420
A hero?

453
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,580
I will only protect you.

454
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,100
Thank you.

455
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:24,500
Sir,

456
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,620
should we get rid of him?

457
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:27,540
I don't care

458
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:28,940
a man like him, right?

459
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,700
What are you doing here?

460
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,060
I'm here to distribute the fruits to the villagers.

461
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:44,740
Your Highness,

462
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,580
don't bother.

463
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:47,700
Everyone is busy.

464
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,340
I should help.

465
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:50,980
You have so many men.

466
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,340
Why are you here?

467
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:56,900
Then thank you.

468
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,540
Ke.

469
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,180
Thank you.

470
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,140
Interesting.

471
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,410
You're the ones who bullied a weak woman.

472
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,130
You're also the ones who are pretending to serve the people.

473
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,340
What?

474
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,260
Is the stage in the capital not big enough,

475
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,620
so you came here to act?

476
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,860
A villain thinks he's a good man

477
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,740
just because he did something good.

478
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,140
Being an extreme villain

479
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,020
is better than

480
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,170
being a hypocrite like you.

481
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,620
Ke has seen your true colors.

482
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,060
She won't trust you anymore.

483
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,180
Stay away from her.

484
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,740
I like her.
