Your Highness.

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:43,580
Your Highness.

6
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,580
All five assassins committed suicide by taking poison.

7
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,130
But we managed to save one.

8
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,100
He's very stubborn

9
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,259
and refused to tell anything.

10
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,820
Try every means to make him confess.

11
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:52,539
How dare they hurt my people!

12
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,460
This time,

13
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,780
I won't let them get away with it.

14
00:01:59,340 --> 00:01:59,780
Your Highness.

15
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,500
Do you think

16
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,980
Her Highness knows how to practice martial arts?

17
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,220
Watch out, Your Highness!

18
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,810
I don't think so.

19
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,300
She just has a strong body.

20
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,460
She's like an angry cat.

21
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,020
By the way,

22
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,460
I remember someone from the imperial court

23
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,860
once gave us a facial cream called Snow Hibiscus Cream.

24
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,780
It can keep the wounded skin from leaving a scar.

25
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:35,700
Where is it now?

26
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,300
Didn’t you give it to Princess Yun Xi?

27
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:38,980
You gave it to her.

28
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:39,700
Ask her to return it

29
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,180
and give it to Shen Keyi.

30
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,579
I hope her cut will not leave a scar.

31
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,900
She'll be upset if she has scars on her body.

32
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,900
But you gave the cream to Princess Yun Xi.

33
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,100
It's embarrassing to ask her to return it.

34
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,690
It's your business.

35
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,660

36
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,380
Use your brain to find a way.

37
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,329
Why should I ask her to give it back?

38
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:54,940
She is Princess Yun Xi.

39
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,460

Your Highness.

44
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,340
I want to become a girl you like

45
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,260
as a way to repay you.

46
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,900
Nonsense.

I'm your Third Uncle.

48
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,980
What you just said is a stupid idea.

Your Highness.

50
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,090
Didn't you ask me

51
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,140
not to consider myself as your relative?

52
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,420
Then I can only try to be your girlfriend.

53
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,180
It seems that you haven't recovered.

54
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,860
I'll ask the doctor to see you again.

55
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,490
His Highness refused to tell me.

with her cheeks as red as a monkey's butts.

111
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,020

all put make-up on their faces.

Then why didn't you

117
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,460
learn to put on makeup properly from them?

118
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,980
I had no money.

119
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,100
-Every time I sneaked into the shop,
-No money?

120
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,300
they made me leave right away.

121
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,980
I didn't see how they put on their make-up.

122
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,020
It's okay.

How dare you not wait on your master

155
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,100
but think of yourselves as masters?

156
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,180
Do all servants of the Shen family behave like this?

Okay.

168
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,530

00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,340
you are too kind to them.

171
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,820
How could you let your servants be so disrespectful?

172
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,380
If you don't discipline them,

173
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,780
they will disobey you one day.

174
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,250

00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,260
I am.

Mu'er.

Are you teaching me how to be a princess?

180

So you really think I'm a princess now?

181
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,780
I know.

182
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,740
Everyone treats me as a joke.

183
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,980
No one really sees me as a princess.

184

That's not true.

185

You are the princess.

00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,300
People in the Prince's Mansion are all very nice.

194
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,260
His Highness is also very nice to me.

195
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,300
But I have to lie to him

196
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,820
and steal something from him.

197
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,540
If His Highness finds out

198
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,780
my real intention...

199
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:41,780
Your Highness.

200
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,860
I can become a girl you like

201
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,740
as a way to repay you.

202
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,180
I know

203
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,420
I'm just a nobody.

204
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,410
But if you need,

205
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,020
you can rely on me.

206
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,300
Your Highness.

207
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,460
Your Highness.

208
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,860
There is something new about the assassins.

209
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,900
I advise you to go check it by yourself.

210
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:11,620
Your Highness.

211
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,420
This is the map of the mansion

212
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,420
we found from the assassin.

213
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:22,660
Who gave it to him?

214
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,940
He said

215
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:25,860
Her Highness had given it to them.

216
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,380
The assassin said

217
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,410
thanks to the princess's map,

218
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,450
they could have found

219
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:32,820
where the garden was.

220
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:33,820
He also said

221
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,700
Her Highness had stopped the arrow

222
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,220
from going into your body

223
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,420
to gain your trust.

224
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,580
Does Her Highness really know how to practice martial arts?

225
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,180
For all kind of martial arts in the world,

226
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,420
speed is the key.

227
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,780
What kind of martial arts is she practicing?

228
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,570
Guard Nan.

229
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,020
Why are you here?

230
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,260
Your Highness.

231
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:22,940
I...

232
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,940
I was just passing by.

233
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,540
I saw you practicing here.

234
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,740
To be honest,

235
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,540
I know a lot

236
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,940
about martial arts.

237
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,300
I'm not practicing martial arts.

238
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,100
I'm practicing the Eight Brocade Moves that the folks often practice.

239
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,340
The Eight Brocade Moves?

240
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,420
I've been a little tired recently.

241
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,650
So I practiced those moves to relieve tiredness.

242
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,060
It can help me become healthier

243
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,420
and improve blood circulation.

244
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,220
Help me become healthier?

245
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,060
Then...

246
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,540
Your Highness,

247
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,020
can you teach me how to practice those moves?

248
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,060
Of course.

249
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,780
Come on, Guard Nan.

250
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,580
Let's do it together.

251
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,620
Hold the hands high with palms up to regulate the internal organs.

252
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,980
Pose as an archer shooting both left- and right-handed.

253
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,620
Look backwards to prevent sickness and strain.

254
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:15,890
Your Highness.

255
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,170
The Eight Brocade Moves

256
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,420
are so amazing.

257
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,700
I may look tired now,

258
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,860
but I feel energetic.

259
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,460
When did you meet?

260
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,540
What was she wearing?

261
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,540
Her Highness was wearing a light yellow dress.

262
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,940
After she made apricot blossom pastry in Pavilion,

263
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,860
she went back to Xingyue Pavilion and met me.

264
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,900
Of course.

265
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,940
My nanny said

266
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,180
as long as you practice the moves every day for a month...

267
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,220
Your Highness.

268
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,490
What's wrong?

269
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,940
Let me take you to a doctor.

270
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,530
Thank you, Guard Nan.

271
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,100
Let's go.

272
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,380
Take care.

273
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,280
[Virtue and Benevolence]

274
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,060
Your Highness.

275
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:07,810
Your Highness.

276
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:08,700
You want to see me?

277
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,260
Did you step on your left foot first when you walked in?

278
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,060
Maybe.

279
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,300
Is there anything wrong with it?

280
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,329
Do you know it's inauspicious to step on your left foot first?

281
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,210
I don't know.

282
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,089
I have to punish you. Clean the chamber pot for a month.

283
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:22,780
You...

284
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:23,819
Go out!

285
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,640
[Virtue and Benevolence]

286
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:29,740
Clean the chamber pot?

287
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,300
Why should I clean the chamber pot?

288
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,660
Thank you, Guard Wan.

289
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:44,980
Sorry, Lady Yunying.

290
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:46,460
You're so careless.

291
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,660
Pay attention to pedestrians when you're walking.

292
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,620
Are you possessed by a devil?

293
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,740
How dare I?

294
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,500
The real devil is inside.

295
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,340
Lady Yunying.

296
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,820
I'll take my leave.

297
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,070
[Virtue and Benevolence]

298
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,260
Mu'er.

299
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:56,780
Let's go.

300
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:04,740
Sister.

301
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,300
Did Nan Bo

302
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,860
do something wrong again?

303
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,050
We bought some mung beans

304
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,940
which are very good quality.

305
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,690
So I made some mung bean cakes for you.

306
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,420
The cakes are tender and tasty.

307
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,300
They can also clear the extra heat in your body.

308
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,940
I don't need to clear the extra heat in my body.

309
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,290
If you don't like them,

310
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,620
let me

311
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,450
give them to Her Highness.

312
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,500
Don't give them to her.

313
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:58,570
Your Highness.

314
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,300
Let me help you.

315
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,180
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

316
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:02,860
I'm sorry.

317
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,540
It's okay.

318
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,020
Aunt Xin poisoned my water?

319
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,060
No.

320
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,300
I can't tell this to His Highness.

321
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,060
If His Highness makes an investigation into it,

322
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,460
he will know my identity.

323
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,660
I'd better go to the kitchen to get some water.

324
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,460
I am Nan Bo.

325
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,700
How could he let me wash the chamber pot?

326
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,340
If others know about this,

327
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,620
I will lose face.

328
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,460
Mr. Chamber Pot,

329
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,300
is it fair that His Highness

330
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,420
let me wash you

331
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,500
just because

332
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,020
I stepped on a wrong foot?

333
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:10,980
Is this fair?

334
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,380
So you also think

335
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,540
this is unfair, right?

336
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,620
Mr. Chamber Pot.

337
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,500
Which foot do you step on first when you walk into a room?

338
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,460
Are you cleaning the chamber pot by talking to it?

339
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,260
Wan.

340
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,540
My good bro.

341
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,100
Don't touch me with your dirty hands.

342
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:26,580
You...

343
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,060
Aren't you here to help me clean the chamber pot?

344
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:28,820
No.

345
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,700
I want to run away from the mansion.

346
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,980
You can go wherever you want.

347
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,100
But I should warn you.

348
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,820
Stay away from Her Highness.

349
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,500
Otherwise, you'll be the one in trouble.

350
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,100
What does this have to do with Her Highness?

351
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,220
This is a huge misunderstanding.

352
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,380
I was just...

353
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,490
I was just learning the Eight Brocade Moves from Her Highness.

354
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:48,900
I...

355
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,570
Why should I explain to you?

356
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,580
I'll explain to His Highness.

357
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,940
If His Highness really misunderstood,

358
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,980
the punishment you'll get is far more than cleaning the chamber pot.

359
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,980
What's going on?

360
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,060
Don't ask questions.

361
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:04,380
Well.

362
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:04,820
Wan.

363
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,820
I don't understand. That's why I asked.

364
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:07,780
Well,

365
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,900
do I still need to clean the chamber pot?

366
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,220
Yes.

367
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,420
Clean it with your mouth.

368
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,330
With my mouth?

369
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:16,740
But...

370
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,300
The chamber pot is so big.

371
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,300
How can I clean it with my mouth?

372
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,380
Your Highness, wait.

373
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,940
-You can't do this.
-Uncle Fu.

374
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,220
Let me go.

375
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,620
Wait, let me tell His Highness you're coming first.

376
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,420
Wait.

377
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,020
-Your Highness, wait.
-Your Highness.

378
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,060
Your Highness.

379
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,060
Your Highness. I'm sorry

380
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,540
for not stopping Her Highness disturbing you during your tea time.

381
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,130
Why did you punish Guard Nan?

382
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,860
I was going to ask you to come

383
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,500
but you came to me first.

384
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,420
Guard Nan just learned the Eight Brocade Moves from me.

385
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:47,780
Why did you need to punish him?

386
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,740
He is my guard.

387
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,420
I can punish him as I want to.

388
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,530
Why do you need to stand up for him?

389
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,060
I...

390
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,500
I don't want others to be punished because of me.

391
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,020
If you have to punish someone,

392
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,860
punish me.

393
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:10,940
Good.

394
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,460
Very good.

395
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,260
You're a good friend to him.

It's going to rain.

397
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,660
Go kneel at the door.

398

00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,020

He's been buying shops and houses in many places recently.

You haven't got the thing yet.

564
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:45,820
You're useless.

565
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,380
Unlock the door.

566
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,540
Unlock the door?

567
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,050
I can.

568
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,570
Kneel down and beg me.

569
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,220
Kneel down.

570
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,620
You want me to kneel down?

571
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,330
No way!

572
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,420
You bastard!

573
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,340
Do you really think you are a princess now?

574
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,450
Aunt.

575
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,660
Don't be angry with her. That's not worth it.

576
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,380
In this mansion,

577
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,100
it's you who are in charge.

578
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:48,900
Nanny.

579
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,460
It hurts so much.

580
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,380
Who is it?

581
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,420
Who are you?

582
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,739
Didn't you see I was watering it?

583
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:51,300
What are you doing?

584
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:51,980
Leave.

585
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:53,260
His Highness is going to court. He'll pass by here.

586
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:54,739
Leave. Hurry.

587
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,580
Your Highness.

588
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:26,900
Nanny.

589
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,220
I was poisoned so I have a stomachache.

590
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:34,820
But why do I feel so heartbroken?
