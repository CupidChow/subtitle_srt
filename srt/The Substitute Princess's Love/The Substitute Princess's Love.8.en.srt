[Episode 8]

4
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,190
Tao.

5
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:37,220
Your Highness.

6
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,110
The Shen family

7
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,539
wants to harm Her Highness.

8
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:43,990
Go on.

9
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:46,950
Madam Shen is the stepmother of the Princess.

10
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,150
She has been harsh on Her Highness.

11
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,490
I'm afraid

12
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,970
in Shen Mansion, Her Highness

13
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:52,830
would be…

14
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:59,100
But this is the internal affair of the Shen Family after all.

15
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,590
It's not appropriate for us to interfere.

16
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,270
Wan.

17
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,030
Get the horse ready.

18
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:03,950
Yes.

19
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,740
Let's go to the Shen Mansion.

20
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:20,340
Your Highness, please wait a moment.

[Shen Mansion]

22
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:23,670
Madam.

23
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,220
Madam.

24
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,690
Prince Jin suddenly barged in.

25
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,870
He said he was looking for the Princess.

26
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,700
Prince Jin?

27
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,329
Yes.

28
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:52,980
Your Highness.

29
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,340
What brings you here

30
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,500
at such a late hour?

31
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,110
Lord Shen,

32
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,460
I'm here to pick up my princess.

33
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,950
The Princess?

34
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,220
Isn't Her Highness in your mansion?

35
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:03,700
Nonsense.

36
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,970
She came back to Shen Mansion at the Lantern Festival.

37
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,420
Well...

38
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,030
Well...

39
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:08,620
My lord.

40
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,700
Madam, you came at the right time.

41
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:11,790
Has Her Highness ever

42
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:12,990
come back home?

43
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,460
No.

44
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,300
Your Highness.

45
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,310
We can settle our grudges in the court.

46
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,070
Why do you have to take it out on my daughter?

47
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,780
She doesn't know anything.

48
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,350
My poor daughter.

49
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,940
She's been living in fear in the Prince's Mansion every day.

50
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,829
Maybe she was too scared

51
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,110
to go back to the Prince's Mansion

52
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,579
or tell us the truth,

53
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,900
so she went somewhere to hide.

54
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:38,860
Move aside.

55
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:39,910
Your Highness.

56
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,460
Your Highness.

57
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,260
Your Highness.

58
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,030
Your Highness.

59
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,270
I told you.

60
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,390
-She's really not here.
-Your Highness.

61
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,590
That's right, Your Highness.

62
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,870
She's really not here.

63
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:50,630
Mother.

64
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,700
Who is this man?

65
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:52,980
This is Prince Jin.

66
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,060
Go back to your room quickly.

67
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,030
Your Highness.

68
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,530
In this yard lives

69
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,710
Her Highness's sister who isn't married yet.

70
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,020
That's right, Your Highness.

71
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,410
If this gets out,

72
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,930
my daughter's innocence will be ruined.

73
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,060
If Her Highness is really in our mansion,

74
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,500
why would we hide her?

75
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:15,770
If something happens to her,

76
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:18,140
Prime Minister's Mansion can't take such a great responsibility.

77
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,620
Your Highness, you should go out and look for her.

78
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,580
A husband and a wife would make up very quickly after a fight.

79
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,790
Maybe Her Highness was just in a fit of pique.

80
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,390
Just find her

81
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,750
and coax her. That will do.

82
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,910
That's right.

83
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,110
If I find out you are lying,

84
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,810
don't blame me for being ruthless.

85
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:44,770
Your Highness.

86
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,659
Take care and goodbye.

87
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,340
Wen Ye has noticed something.

88
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,100
We can't delay any longer.

89
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,110
Tell Commander Zhang to act quickly.

90
00:04:58,659 --> 00:04:59,020
Yes.

91
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:01,900
Your Excellency,

92
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:02,780
I...

93
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,190
Don't leave any trace.

94
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,610
Now the soldiers have found out,

95
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,750
we won't be able to leave tonight.

96
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,130
Then stay one more day.

97
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,710
It's safer this way.

98
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,430
We're running out of food.

99
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,350
There must be some food in this village.

100
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:22,910
I'll go find some.

101
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:23,820
You...

102
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:24,660
Come with me.

103
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,140
How dare you!

104
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,510
How dare you set fire?

105
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,900
I just wanted to protect myself.

106
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,020
Protect yourself?

107
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,140
Do you know what will happen

108
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,550
to the women held in captivity in the fortress

109
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,100
in the end?

110
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:46,870
Are you scared now?

111
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,510
Then behave yourself.

112
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,670
If you don't make any trouble,

113
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,100
I'll keep you safe.

114
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:52,650
Otherwise,

115
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,380
I myself don't know what I'll do.

116
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:57,700
You...

117
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,100
What will you do?

118
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,740
I'm a bandit. I can do anything.

119
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,420
I remember you.

120
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,250
You helped me catch a thief on the street.

121
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,870
You are that righteous man.

122
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,870
I...

123
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,830
I was just adopting a long-term plan to secure something big.

124
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,220
And you gave me

125
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,820
that half of the steamed bun on purpose.

126
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,190
I don't think

127
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,150
you're a villain.

128
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,140
You don't have to pretend to be fierce.

129
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,150
I want to live.

130
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,630
Can you help me?

131
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,100
Help you?

132
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,830
This is valuable, right?

133
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,710
Give it back to me.

134
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,860
As long as I let it go,

135
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,220
it will be smashed into pieces.

136
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,950
Don't.

137
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,910
Is it so important?

138
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,630
If you have to exchange it with your life,

139
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,340
will you agree?

140
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,990
If you can keep your promise,

141
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,750
I will.

142
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,470
This is so important?

143
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,020
Does it belong to a man?

144
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,100
This belongs to my husband.

145
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,820
It's just a jade pendant.

146
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,270
Is it worth your life?

147
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,230
I think you are a good person.

148
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,670
You won't kill me for real.

149
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,659
Don't challenge my authority.

150
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:37,820
If you kill me,

151
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,909
you won't get anything.

152
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,740
If you let me go

153
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,420
and let me leave from the cliff behind,

154
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,590
no matter how much money you want,

155
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:44,940
I'll send it to your fortress

156
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,860
when I get it ready in the future.

157
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,060
Do you know

158
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,060
what is the least valuable thing in the capital?

159
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:50,909
What?

160
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,420
Women.

161
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,470
My husband is not a heartless man.

162
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,750
He will protect me.

163
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:57,659
Also,

164
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,580
I can help you find food to satisfy your hunger.

165
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:03,710
Okay.

166
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,140
Find the food first then.

167
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:10,730
Your Highness.

168
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,540
I saw with my eyes that the maid from the Shen Mansion came looking for Her Highness.

169
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,140
No one threatened her.

170
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,980
She left with the maid happily.

171
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,580
She's not in the Shen Mansion,

172
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,610
nor did she come back to our mansion.

173
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:22,980
What on earth is she doing?

174
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,020
Did the Shen family hide her?

175
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:27,790
Sir,

176
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,260
shall we send people out to look for her?

177
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,250
Okay.

178
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,110
Go.

179
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:31,980
Remember.

180
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,190
Don't let anyone know.

181
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,429
Yes.

182
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,570
Is this edible?

183
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,059
This is called sweet potato.

184
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:43,870
It looks black,

185
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:45,590
but it's sweet inside.

186
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,580
And it makes you full.

187
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,100
It seems to be a crop which only grows in the south.

188
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,060
I heard that many people in this village

189
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,140
had fled here from the flood

190
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:53,810
of the south.

191
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,270
So we dug out a lot of sweet potatoes in the ground.

192
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,710
How about we try them?

193
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,260
Sure. I'm hungry now.

194
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,420
Try it.

195
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,390
You can share it.

196
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,020
So sweet.

197
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,580
It's quite sweet.

198
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,030
It's delicious.

199
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,130
Good for you.

200
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,860
You found so much food.

201
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,030
Thank you.

202
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,110
What's your name?

203
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,580
Shen Keyi.

204
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,150
Keyi?

205
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,260
What an interesting name.

206
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,700
My mother gave me the name

207
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,350
because she hoped I could be at ease anywhere

208
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,420
and be fine with anything.

209
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,700
So, do you want to make a bet with me?

210
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,220
You're an interesting hostage.

211
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,870
No matter who comes,

212
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,740
I won't want to let you go.

213
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,310
You're cheating!

214
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,260
All right.

215
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,180
I promise you.

216
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,910
Whether anyone comes to redeem you

217
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,700
or whether your husband comes to pick you up,

218
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,580
I won't kill you.

219
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:08,900
You...

220
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,580
Are you really not going to kill me?

221
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,390
No.

222
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,470
I knew it.

223
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,700
You are different from other bandits.

224
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,020
Actually, I don't want to be a bandit.

225
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,830
But I was born

226
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:22,580
and raised in the fortress.

227
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,150
I don't know what else I can do except be a bandit.

228
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,310
I just listen to the stories

229
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,030
and

230
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,900
live a carefree life every day.

231
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,470
You shouldn't be a bandit.

232
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,100
You should…

233
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:38,700
be a hero.

234
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:40,660
Me?

235
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:41,750
A hero?

236
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,310
A dragon gives birth to a baby dragon, and a phoenix, a baby phoenix.

237
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,710
The son of the bandits

238
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,830
will be a bandit all his life.

239
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,940
Where did you get this?

240
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,780
I got this from an old lady.

241
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,780
Where is she?

242
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,500
Where did you meet her?

243
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,430
When I met her,

244
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,420
she was dying.

245
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,500
She was holding this tight in her hand.

246
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,060
I was going to ask her what happened,

247
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,780
but she died.

248
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:24,540
Madam.

249
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,110
Ke.

250
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:27,940
Ke.

251
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,910
This belonged to my nanny.

252
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,540
I recognize it.

253
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,590
Nanny!

254
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,470
Nanny.

255
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,110
Nanny.

256
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,290
You're awake.

257
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,190
What's wrong with me?

258
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,670
You fainted, probably because

259
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,740
you were too sad.

260
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,150
Nanny is my only family in this world.

261
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,140
Now she's gone, too.

262
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,940
Isn't there that man?

263
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,060
He hasn't arrived until now.

264
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,470
Do you still believe in him?

265
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,310
He gave me the most important jade pendant.

266
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,170
I believe in him.

267
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,550
Young Master.

268
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,310
Young Master.

269
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,230
Young Master.

270
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,820
What is it?

271
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,030
It's getting so late.

272
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,500
We agreed to leave today.

273
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,950
Uncle Dao is angry.

274
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,370
You don't have to delay our schedule

275
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,510
because of a sick girl.

276
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:57,660
Let's wait for another day.

277
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,940
With her current condition,

278
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,020
how can she climb the mountains?

279
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,630
I'm sure she won't be able to hold up halfway there.

280
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,550
But Uncle Dao can't wait any longer.

281
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,500
Why don't we give up the ransom?

282
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,700
Our lives are more important.

283
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:08,670
I'll talk to Uncle Dao.

284
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,420
Okay. Uncle Dao is over there.

285
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,190
It's good.

286
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,430
It's delicious.

287
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,420
What's going on?

288
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,300
What happened?

289
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,020
Are you alright?

290
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,390
Young Master, look.

291
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,300
What's going on?

292
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:34,340
Are you okay?

293
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,260
Zhou Yu.

294
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:37,950
That girl

295
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,270
put poison into our food.

296
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,370
She wants to poison us.

297
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:46,250
Look.

298
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,310
That girl must have poisoned us on purpose.

299
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,020
No.

300
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,470
Something is wrong with the water.

301
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,630
Commander Zhang, she's Princess Jin.

302
00:14:59,050 --> 00:14:59,870
If we kill her,

303
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,170
will we be avenged by Prince Jin?

304
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,540
Madam Shen said

305
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,940
that the princess ran away from home

306
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,150
because she was bullied in Prince Jin's Mansion.

307
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,860
Then she was kidnapped by bandits, unfortunately.

308
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,540
Then it's the bandits who have kidnapped

309
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,610
and killed her.

310
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,460
What does it have to do with us?

00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:22,860
Your Highness.

313
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,940
We're here under His Highness's order.

314
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,190
Did His Highness come to pick me up?

315
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,900
Your Highness, take the medicine first.

316
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,060
His Highness is very worried about your health.

317
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,220
After you take the medicine,

318
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,750
I'll take you out of here.

319
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,090
Something's wrong.

320
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,780
Why aren't Nan Bo and Guard Wan here?

321
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,340
His Highness got the news that you were kidnapped by bandits

322
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,850
and asked me to get you home.

323
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,500
He learned that I was kidnapped by bandits.

324
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,980
Didn't he ask anything?

325
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,470
Of course His Highness is worried about you.

326
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,180
You're lying.

327
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,220
If His Highness knew I was kidnapped by bandits,

328
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:14,670
he wouldn't have sent

329
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,390
someone I don't know to pick me up.

330
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,700
Who sent you here?

331
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,780
His Highness wanted to save your face,

332
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,380
but you just don't know how to appreciate favors.

333

Go!

Are you okay?

343
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,810
I'm a liar. It's all my fault.

344
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,069
Even if you lied to him,

345
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,069
he shouldn't kill you like that.

346
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,710
His Highness already knows that you got married in place of your sister

His Highness wouldn't want to kill me.

00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,020
He wouldn't do this to me.

Her Highness told me not to tell you.

But for the sake of her safety,

357
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,980
I must tell you.

The Shen family sent this poisonous dress

359
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,460
and forced her to wear it at the Palace banquet on Lantern Festival.

360
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,270
They wanted to kill Her Highness.

361

In order not to enter the Palace,

362
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,660
Her Highness soaked in the cold spring for hours.

Sir, the water is poisonous.

00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,020
I might have forgotten to close the window last night when I was sleeping.

366
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,870

00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,940
The Shen family didn't want their legitimate daughter to be a widow,

380
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,510
so they let Her Highness get married in replacement.

381
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,700
But then Your Highness suddenly came back to life and came back home.

382
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,110
Her Ladyship and His Excellency

383
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,460
then gave the Princess a task.

384
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,510
They asked her to steal…

385
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,380
to steal…

386
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:58,990
What?

387
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,350
To steal your jade pendant.

388
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,390
Go on.

389
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:10,410
Later they found out that Your Highness gave the jade to Her Highness.

390
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,670
Her Ladyship wanted to kill Her Highness

391
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:14,670
after getting the jade pendant.

392
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,790
But about the current situation of Her Highness,

393
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,860
I really don't know.

394
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,030
I was only in charge of the affairs in the mansion.

395
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,540
As for the scheme outside the mansion,

396
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,310
Her Ladyship wouldn't tell me either.

397
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,140
Take her away.

398
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:26,270
Take her away!

399
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,980
Your Highness, please spare my life.

400
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,500
I've told you everything I know.

401
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,990
Your Highness.

402
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,900
Her Highness is the Prime Minister's illegitimate daughter 
who didn't grow up in the Prime Minister's mansion.

403
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,780
Your Highness suddenly came back to life and came back home.

404
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,740
My daughter is married to you.

405
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,420
We are in-laws.

406
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,380
Her Ladyship and His Excellency then gave the Princess a task.

407
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,020
Third Uncle,

408
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,700
we are relatives now.

409
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,230
Can't I stay in your house?

410
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,550
Your Highness.

411
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,500
Good morning.

412
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,830
Thank you, Your Highness.

413
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,500
After eating your food, we'll be family.

414
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:00,420
Your Highness.

415
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,980
I can become the person you like

416
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,110
to repay you.

417
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,630
Weren't you afraid when you blocked the arrow for me?

418
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,100
Actually, I had a selfish motive.

419
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,910
But what can I do?

420
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,350
Can I choose my own fate?

421
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,030
Your Highness.

422
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,700
I remembered that the maid Princess met

423
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,900
at the Lantern Festival

424
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,620
claimed to be a servant of the Shen family.

425
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,030
Her Highness left with her.

426
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,420
I met her again on the street today.

427
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,380
I felt something was wrong.

428
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,580
So I followed her

429
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,350
and threatened her.

430
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,380
Then she confessed everything.

431
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,390
Her name is Nian Sanniang.

432
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,670
She's not a servant of the Shen family,

433
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,540
but a neighbor that the Princess knew from before.

434
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,500
That night, she was under Madam Shen's instigation

435
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,130
to deceive Her Highness.

436
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,540
She took Her Highness into a carriage and left the capital.

437
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:02,740
And then?

438
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,300
And...

439
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,020
Then...

440
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,780
I found only this much about Nian Sanniang.

441
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,020
By the way, Wan told me

442
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,480
[Xingyue Pavilion]

443
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,660
Her Highness once sneaked out of our mansion

444
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,510
and had a fake jade pendant made in the jewelry shop.

445
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,020
The fake jade pendant

446
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:12,870
is exactly the same as yours.

447
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,030
I don't know why she wanted that jade pendant.

448
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,100
Interrogate all the carriage drivers in the whole city.

449
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,990
Focus primarily on those who left the city

450
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:25,830
on the night of the Lantern Festival.

451
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,230
Yes.

452
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,080
[Xingyue Pavilion]

453
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,380
Take them away.

454
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,010
Go.

455
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,260
Take them away.

456
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,020
Go.

457
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,150
Let's go back.

458
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,060
Your Highness.

459
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,150
I really don't know

460
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,540
it was the Princess who was in the carriage that day.

461
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,990
If I knew,

462
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,990
I wouldn't dare to do it

463
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,500
even if you lend me much courage.

464
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,470
Please spare my life, Your Highness.

465
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,620
Please spare my life.

466
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,900
What did the person who hired you want you to do?

467
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,700
The employer asked me

468
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,490
to snatch a jade pendant from her

469
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,020
and then kill her.

470
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,070
At that moment a group of people suddenly rushed out

471
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,170
and took her away.

472
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,820
I didn't kill anyone.

473
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,370
I don't know what happened next, Your Highness.

474
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,100
Take him away.

475
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:20,580
Your Highness.

476
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,140
Spare my life, Your Highness!

477
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,750
Please spare my life!

478
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,300
Take a roll call.

479
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:24,870
Yes.

480
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:30,670
Let's drink.

481
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,350
Master. Master.

482
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:32,980
What?

483
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,590
The God of War, Prince Jin, Wen Ye

484
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,010
is blocking the gate of our fortress.

485
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,190
Why did he come here?

486
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,140
They said

487
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,940
we kidnapped their princess

488
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,540
and asked us to hand her over.

489
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,510
But we haven't seen

490
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,210
a trace of their princess at all!

491
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:49,790
I see.

492
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,420
It must be Zhou Yu who did it down the mountains.

493
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,020
He hasn't come back for days.

494
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,420
Tell Jin Wenye that…

495
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,940
It's Prince Jin, Wen Ye.

496
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,300
Never mind!

497
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,100
Go tell him.

498
00:22:59,190 --> 00:22:59,780
Just tell him…

499
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:02,630
Forget it.

500
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:03,700
I'll go by myself.

501
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:05,660
Move aside.

502
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,300
Your Highness.

503
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,220
The person you're looking for

504
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,900
must be taken away by my son Zhou Yu.

505
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,420
He hasn't been back for days.

506
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,380
This has nothing to do

507
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,660
with our fortress.

508
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,220
All in all, every injustice has its perpetrator, and every debt its debtor.

509
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,500
He should take the full responsibility.

510
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,700
Your Royal Lordship Jin,

511
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:25,980
please go to him directly.

512
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:26,990
Where is your son?

513
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,190
I don't know.

514
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,350
He could be alive…

515
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,620
or dead.

516
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,830
That's nonsense!

517
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,620
Anyway, he's indeed not here in the fortress.

518
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:35,650
It should be that

519
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,330
he went down the mountain three days ago.

520
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,850
He might stop over at any village along the way.

521
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:40,230
Search!

522
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:40,990
Yes.

523
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,060
Your Highness.

524
00:23:59,420 --> 00:23:59,860
We've finished searching.

525
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,580
Indeed she's not here.

526
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,150
A team stays here.

527
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,580
You go with me and search along the way.

528
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,100
Yes.

529
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:07,950
Take care, Your Highness.
