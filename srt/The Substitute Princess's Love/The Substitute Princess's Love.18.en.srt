Her Highness has swallowed grievances alone.

219

I'll say it again.

376
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,390
If you want to leave the Prince's Mansion,

377
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:12,990
I can help you.

378
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,020
I don't know where to go.

379
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:22,340
You used to say I was free.

380
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,260
But I just wanted a home.

381
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,580
I finally have a home.

382
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:31,990
I don't want to give it up.

383
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,230
But you don't have to

384
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,390
suffer so much.

385
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:38,630
Besides,

386
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,420
the reward he gave you is

387
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,870
to marry another princess?

388
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,030
Don't you have any resentment?

389
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,230
Of course I do.

390
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,180
But

391
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,470
you need someone to respond to your emotions

392
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,110
so that you can vent them, right?

393
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,370
No matter what I do now,

394
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,790
he seems indifferent.

395
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,620
It seems that he doesn't love me anymore overnight.

396
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:09,660
What kind of person is that?

397
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,750
I told you

398
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,060
there is no love in the big mansions.

399
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,310
There are only

400
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:20,060
fools who believe in love...

401
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,150
You call me a fool?

402
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,180
You are.

403
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:27,460
Let her go!

404
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,260
Why are you here

405
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,190
instead of being in your bridal chamber?

406
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,990
I thought you were more mature after being trained in the army

407
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,940
and you could become somebody.

408
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,410
I didn't expect you to be so impulsive.

409
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,220
Don't be so condescending

410
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,060
and try to intimidate me.

411
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:41,780
Let her go.

412
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,750
She can't drink.

413
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,140
Why do you care so much?

414
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,500
She can do whatever she wants.

415
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,630
She is my princess.

416
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,270
Why can't I care about her?

417
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,570
Then you should protect her.

418
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,190
Why does she always get harmed?

419
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,230
Do you deserve her?

420
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,210
Silly girl.

421
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,150
Your Highness.

422
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,750
I'm Zuo Shuangzhi.

423
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:57,830
Your Highness,

424
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,950
at the wedding ceremony just now,

425
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,210
I heard you were not feeling well.

426
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,740
Are you feeling better now?

427
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,860
I was fine.

428
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,710
I just didn't want to get married.

429
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,110
It's late.

430
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,500
Go back and rest.

431
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:14,220
Your Highness,

432
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,150
is this Sister Shen?

433
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,980
Do you need my help?

434
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,590
Don't touch her.

435
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,110
I'm not targeting you.

436
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:26,830
Go back.

437
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,070
Your Highness.

438
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,030
I know

439
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,300
I suddenly married into the Prince's Mansion

440
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,050
and ruined your life with Sister Shen.

441
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:36,500
But this was not what I wanted.

442
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,380
I couldn't object to

443
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,270
my parents' and the matchmaker's order.

444
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,460
I know my place.

445
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,070
I don't expect any love from you.

446
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,620
I just want a place

447
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,180
in this mansion.

448
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,980
I'm glad you know.

449
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,220
Just stay like that and do nothing.

450
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,380
I'll give you

451
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:59,620
the status and position you deserve.

452
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,030
Status.

453
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,670
Position.

454
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,740
What do I need those for?

455
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,180
When will you look at me?

456
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,830
I met you first.

457
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,590
Don't come to my dream again.
