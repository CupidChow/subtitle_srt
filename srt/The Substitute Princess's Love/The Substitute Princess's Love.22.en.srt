Yunqing.

5
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,390
What's wrong?

6
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,020
I had a dream.

7
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,300
In the dream, Her Highness was covered in blood.

8
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,660
I wanted to save her.

9
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,950
But I couldn't get to her.

10
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,670
Her Highness will be fine.

11
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,190
You don't need to be so worried.

12
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,470
Take good care of your health.

13
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,820
Let's wait for Her Highness to come back.

14
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,180
Last year

15
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,430
was my happiest time in the mansion.

16
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,430
But since the Princess of Liang came,

17
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,140
everything has changed.

18
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,860
His Highness had to do that to save Her Highness.

19
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,410
No one could have foreseen things would turn out this way.

20
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,750
Stop thinking too much.

21
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,390
The more worried you are, the more difficult it is for you to recover.

22
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,700
You've been here for several days.

23
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,100
Go back and have a rest.

24
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,070
No.

25
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,750
I just want to stay here.

26
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,980
I'm not a kid.

27
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,100
I don't need you to watch me sleep.

28
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,700
I just want to be with you.

29
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,100
Spring is coming.

30
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,829
Stop staying in my room.

31
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,270
You smell like my medicine now

32
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,870
and you don't look well.

33
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,190
You should go out

34
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,540
and see the birds and flowers outside

35
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,270
so that you'll have a better mood.

36
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,100
Are you asking me to leave?

37
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,140
I'll be fine.

38
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,750
I know it.

39
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,990
Gu Yunqing.

40
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,380
I like you.

41
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,230
I know.

42
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,310
I finally got Guard Wan to go back to sleep.

43
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,460
He was here with you

44
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,150
for three days.

45
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,140
He must have been exhausted.

46
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,420
Your Highness.

47
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:17,990
Mu'er.

48
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,580
Sister Yunying.

49
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,220
I'm glad you're finally back.

50
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,070
I came back secretly.

51
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,260
Don't tell His Highness.

52
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,390
Your Ladyship, Your Highness.

53
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,220
You two can have a chat.

54
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,710
I'll be standing at the door.

55
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,340
Okay.

56
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,270
Your Highness.

57
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:41,110
You look much thinner.

58
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,140
The last time we met was during the Spring Festival.

59
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,870
We had a good time in the mansion at that time.

60
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,300
I didn't expect

61
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:50,780
after a few days,

62
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,490
everything has changed.

63
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:54,900
Sister Yunying.

64
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,860
I'm not the princess anymore.

65
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,540
When you're not in the mansion,

66
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,710
this place is not lively anymore

67
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,180
and it smells like medicine every day.

68
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:07,900
It's

69
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,690
not like home now.

70
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,190
It's all my fault.

71
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,820
I should have come back earlier that day.

72
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,070
No, Sister Yunying.

73
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,860
Don't say that.

74
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:24,950
It's my fault.

75
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,550
I'm sorry I made you worried.

76
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,650
Sister Yunying.

77
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,980
You've been taking a lot of bitter medicine lately, right?

78
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,420
There's nothing else I can do for you.

79
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,780
I just made you some candies.

80
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,750
The medicine won't taste that bitter if you take it with the candies.

81
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,420
They look like flowers.

82
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,430
So beautiful.

83
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,630
Real flowers will wither.

84
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,590
But these candy flowers

85
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,860
will always taste sweet.

86
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,540
Your Highness.

87
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,980
Thank you.

88
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,270
Your Highness.

89
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,390
What brings you here?

90
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,710
Did you drink alcohol?

91
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,110
Hurry.

92
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,270
Sister.

93
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,660
You're still up?

94
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:29,340
Your Highness.

95
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:31,940
Without her, this place

96
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,310
is not home but a mansion which is not lively anymore.

97
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,620
It's too quiet and empty.

98
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,470
So I want to chat with you.

99
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,180
We had a feast in the royal palace today.

100
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,860
There were people singing and dancing.

101
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,390
It was a very happy occasion for them.

102
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,740
Then Your Highness,

103
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,180
did you feel happy today?

104
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,190
Some people said I had a cold heart.

105
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:01,980
It seems

106
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,660
they were right.

107
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,070
They didn't understand you.

108
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,380
All these years,

109
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,940
you know me the best.

110
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,150
You taught me how to be a good man

111
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,620
and how to have a good family.

112
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,260
It's all my fault.

113
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,930
I ruined our family.

114
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,540
Your Highness.

115
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,390
You didn't mean to let it happen.

116
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,540
Don't blame yourself.

117
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,220
How can I not blame myself?

118
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,730
She must hate me very much.

119
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,230
Otherwise, she wouldn't just disappear

120
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,700
and refuse to see me.

121
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:37,780
I wonder

122
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,260
how she's doing now.

123
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,340
Does she still often smile?

124
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,940
If she doesn't smile often because of me,

125
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,580
I can never

126
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,260
forgive myself.

127
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:57,810
Your Highness.

128
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,820
If...

129
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,100
If what?

130
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,100
Nothing.

131
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,380
It's late.

132
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,500
And you're drunk.

133
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,890
Go to bed early.

134
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,180
Sister.

135
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,750
Take care.

136
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:25,970
Okay.

137
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,140
Sister Yunying.

138
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,510
I'll leave now.

139
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,820
Your Highness.

140
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,270
Be careful

141
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,350
on your way back.

142
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,350
Don't worry, Sister Yunying.

143
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,090
Your Highness.

144
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,210
It's our fault. We're so sorry.

145
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,290
But you must believe

146
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:15,970
that His Highness still loves you.

147
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,180
He was really happy about you being pregnant.

148
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,070
He really wanted to keep that child.

149
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:22,590
Sister Yunying.

150
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,780
I don't want to think about what happened that day.

151
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,030
Everything that happened that day

152
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,380
and what everyone did

153
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,980
was just a nightmare.

154
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,300
Alright.

155
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,740
Your Highness.

156
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,030
Take care.

157
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,030
We'll wait for you.

158
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,420
Mu'er.

159
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,820
This is a gift from Her Highness.

160
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,310
Put it way.

161
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:48,900
Sister.

162
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,950
Was she here just now?

163
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,420
Tell me where she went.

164
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,470
Let me see her.

165
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:09,870

Your Highness, what's wrong?

173
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,020
Find Her Highness.

174
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,340
Okay, find Her Highness.

175
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,030
You two, go over there.

176
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,270
Yes.

177
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,150
You two, follow me.

00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,220
and I need 100,000 soldiers.

194
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,790
Your Majesty, I have an objection.

195
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,460
Have you heard that

196
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,780
the former Princess Jin is living with Zhou Yu now?

197
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,590
If so,

198
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:55,910
Prince Jin will definitely kill Zhou Yu.

199
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:56,970
Right.

200
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,820
Your Majesty.

201
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,390
Before the war starts,

202
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,790
we'll need to repair the granaries at Pingyu Pass.

203
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,460
Your Majesty, I have an objection.

204
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,290
What is Zhou Yu doing?

205
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:09,300
Is he crazy?

206
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,050
Your Majesty, I think...

207
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,830
Your Majesty, I have an objection.

208
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,190
Urgency from the North!

209
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,020
Urgency from the North!

210
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:28,300
Your Majesty.

211
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,790
The Nomadic Tribes in the North

212
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,820
have been our threat for so many years.

213
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,470
Recently, they robbed several villages

214
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,070
claiming that they were looking for their lost sheep.

215
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,980
This shows that they want to start a war against us.

216
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,580
Your Majesty.

217
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,900
Please issue an imperial order to send troops to the North.

218
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,390
Please declare a real war against them.

219
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:48,750
Your Majesty.

220
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,100
I'm willing to lead troops to the North.

221
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,140
and restore stability in that area.

222
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,220
Your Majesty.

223
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,070
Your Majesty.

224
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,500
We need to be cautious about sending troops.

225
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,860
Our army is short of soldiers.

226
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,590
It's not a right time to send a lot of troops.

227
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,950
How about we continue to

228
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,410
take an approach of conciliation to the Nomadic Tribes?

229
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,470
Your Majesty, the approach of conciliation

230
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,820
will only make them more provocative.

231
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,470
And our people in the border areas will suffer.

232
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,590
Your Highness, leading the troops will bring you glories.

233
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,860
But fighting a war costs a lot of money.

234
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:24,660
Your Highness.

235
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,700
Have you ever thought about that?

236
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,010
As long as you don't appropriate the money,

237
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,420
I think

238
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,100
we have enough money to do that.

239
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:32,750
You...

240
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,740
Stop.

241
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,500
I know what you're thinking.

242
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:38,950
The North

243
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,870
has always been a big problem.

244
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,500
If the Nomadic Tribes go through Pingyu Pass,

245
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,590
the capital will be in danger.

246
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:48,830
This war

247
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,230
is inevitable.

248
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,510
But

249
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,550
the north border is long.

250
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,190
There will be many battle fronts.

251
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:59,060
All of them are equally important.

252
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,580
Prince Jin is called God of War, but we need another general.

253
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,900
So in our army

254
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:07,790
who can take the responsibility

255
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,510
to be the second general?

256
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:18,990
Your Majesty.

257
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,619
I'm willing to fight the war

258
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,150
and serve the state.

259
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,550
Good for you.

260
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,470
You deserve everything I gave to you.

261
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,380
Zuo Shuangzhi

262
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,420
is useless now.

263
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,540
What is she thinking?

264
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,050
Why is she willing to be put under house arrest by Wen Ye?

265
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,740
You may leave.

266
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,140
Your Majesty, I have an objection.

267
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,750
I'm willing to fight the war and serve the state.

268
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,620
Have you heard that

269
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,910
the former Princess Jin is living with Zhou Yu now?

270
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,820
If so, Prince Jin will definitely kill Zhou Yu.

271
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:33,740
Yes.

272
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,790
Wen Ye is determined to fight the war against the North.

273
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,510
Then I'll just need to find someone

274
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,510
who sees Wen Ye as an enemy in the army.

275
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,500
Then Wen Ye will definitely lose the war.

276
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,500
Imperial Order from His Majesty:

277
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,790
The border areas in the north are in chaos.

278
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,940
The Nomadic Tribes have been provocative in the border areas.

279
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,350
We now need to take action to show our power

280
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,770
and educate them.

281
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,980
I hereby appoint Captain Zhou Yu as general

282
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:12,430
who will assist Prince in fighting the war.

283
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,900
You shall show our power

284
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,710
and subdue them.

285
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:22,470
Wherever you go, my spirit is with you.

286
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,420
Hope you can fulfill your mission.

287
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,180
Respect it.

288
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,230
My sincere gratitude goes to His Majesty.

289
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,580
I won't let His Majesty down.

290
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,110
What is it?

291
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,710
Why can't you say it in front of her?

292
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,380
You really want to fight the war?

293
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,790
It's none of your business.

294
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,670
You think you're more high-powered than me

295
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:05,870
so you came to stop me?

296
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:08,580
If you really want to fight the war,

297
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,500
whatever I say in the court, you just object to it.

298
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,350
Why are you helping me?

299
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,900
If I go fight the war alone,

300
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,820
I won't rest assured if my wife is with you.

301
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,260
This is the reason?

302
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:30,900
I was wrong about you.

303
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,370
I didn't expect you to be so petty.

304
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:33,300
No one can take away

305
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,700
what belongs to you.

306
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,570
Then why do you want to fight the war?

307
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,180
I want to win glories.

308
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,190
I want to protect the state and her.

309
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,060
You need to prove you can do that by yourself.

310
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:06,940
The firewood I made

311
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,710
should be enough for you to use for many days.

312
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,980
You've chopped so much firewood. It's enough.

313
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,460
Let me repair the roof now.

314
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,550
Be careful.

315
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:25,710
Don't worry.

316
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,180
It's okay. Come down and have a rest.

317
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,470
You'll start off tomorrow. You need to have a good rest.

318
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:36,030
I'll be away for at least half a year.

319
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,100
I don't know when I'll come back.

320
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,350
There are only two women here. I'm afraid

321
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,460
you won't be able to take care of yourselves.

322
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,380
Then work hard and win the war soon.

323
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,870
Come back safely.

324
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,590
Will you wait for me to come back?

325
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,190
It’s okay.

326
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,140
When Wen Ye and I are away,

327
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,790
take your time to think about it. Trust me.

328
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,200
I will become

329
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,710
a real man like him.

330
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:12,550
I can give you

331
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,430
what he can give you.

332
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,430
I believe

333
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,380
you will be a great hero.

334
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:18,940
But...

335
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,380
Don't say "but" today.

336
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,220
Go.

337
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,140
Treat me to a nice meal before I leave.

338
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,620
Okay, let's have a nice meal.

339
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,050
Sister.

340
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,860
I'll start off tomorrow.

341
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,900
So I won't be able to attend your wedding.

342
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,030
I've requested an imperial order for you

343
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,070
so you can remarry now.

344
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,910
With it,

345
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,630
you and Wan can get married.

346
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,870
Even if those in marquis' mansion disagree,

347
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:51,740
they can do nothing about it.

348
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,740
Thank His Majesty.

349
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,510
Thank you, Your Highness.

350
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,300
Sister.

351
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:04,980
After I leave,

352
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,950
you must take good care of yourself.

353
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,030
Hope you'll recover soon.

354
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,710
Take care, Your Highness.

355
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,260
The battlefield is so dangerous.

356
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,900
You must be very cautious.

357
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,300
Wen Ye.

358
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,180
You always worry about others

359
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,620
and think for us.

360
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,630
These days,

361
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,980
you look fine.

362
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,790
Actually, you must feel miserable.

363
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,610
We are humans. We have feelings.

364
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,340
You don't have to try to be perfect all the time.

365
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,510
If you made a mistake, correct it.

366
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,300
If you want her back, go find her.

367
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,740
Life is...

368
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,420
Do not wait

369
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,110
until it's too late.

370
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,850
♫Lend me the stars so that they can be my companions♫

371
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:55,590
♫While I'm going through the long night♫

372
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:59,160

374

♫Lend me some ink♫

376
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,250
If you want her back, go find her.

377
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:09,860
♫So that I can draw a portrait for you♫

378
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,330
Don't wait until it's too late.

379
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:13,350
♫I've been missing you♫

380
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:17,680
♫There's so much to say♫

381
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,030
♫I'll ask♫

382
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,860
Buddha, bless us.

383
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:28,880
♫The moon to answer your questions for me♫

384
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,220
I pray for their safety.
