00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,070
This is strange.

5
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,380
Every time we came back, Uncle Fu

6
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,539
would be the first one to welcome us.

7
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,140
Why isn't he here welcoming us today?

8
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:48,100
Uncle Fu.

9
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,580
Uncle Fu.

10
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,580
Uncle Fu.

11
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,660
Uncle Fu.

12
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,660
Uncle Fu, what happened?

13
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,990
Uncle Fu, what happened?

14
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,460
Shen Keyi.

15
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:09,940
He was fine a few days ago.

17

18
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,020
Yes.

19
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,750
What happened?

20
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,070
Your Highness.

21
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,329
You're finally back.

22
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:36,510
What happened in the mansion?

23
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,380
Steward Yi fed Her Highness a bowl of medicine.

24
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,390
Her Highness kept bleeding after taking it.

25
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,780
I don't know

26
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,100
what Steward Yi fed Her Highness.

27
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:43,970
Where is she now?

28
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,050
I just took Her Highness to the clinic.

29
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,820
Then a man suddenly barged into the mansion.

30
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,540
He pushed me to the ground

31
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,829
and carried Her Highness away.

32
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,820
I wanted to stop him.

33
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,660
I'll go after him.

34
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:56,750
Your Highness.

35
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:00,780
Your Highness.

36
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,100
When I arrived at the clinic,

37
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,140
Her Highness was already gone.

38
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,470
But Zhou Yu took three days off in the army.

39
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:06,790
He drove a carriage

40
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,330
in the direction of Qingzhou a moment ago.

41
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:42,790
Where is she?

42
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:43,850
Who are you talking about?

43
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,460
I'm asking you where she is.

44
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,750
Now you are anxious.

45
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,940
Why did you let her

46
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,540
watch you being close to the new princess?

47
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,310
Why did you make her lose her child?

48
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,070
I didn't.

49
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,630
That's my child.

50
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,380
How could I bear to do that?

51
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,420
Anyway, that happened in your mansion.

52
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,140
You couldn't even protect your wife and child.

53
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,630
What right do you have to see her?

54
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,870
That's between me and her.

55
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:03,980
I must see her.

56
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,430
Let me make it clear.

57
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,780
She doesn't want to see you at all.

58
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,990
She wants to stay away from this sad place

59
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,010
and never see you again.

60
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,630
Are you able to stop me?

She's safe now.

65

Since she married you,

66
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,590
she has suffered so much.

Yes.

74
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:13,820
Mother.

75
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,900
This is all your idea, right?

76
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,390
Don't you know

77
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,950
why I did this?

78
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,650
How could I not know?

79
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,460
I'm not your biological son.

80
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,660
All these years,

81
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,330
your favoritism has long been taken for granted.

82
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,110
Why do you

83
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,670
say that?

84
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:34,190
In order to stabilize the court

85
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,510
and for the harmony among the princes,

86
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,710
you didn't allow me to fight for the throne.

87
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:37,820
I understand it.

88
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,380
You asked me to stay away from the court

89
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,140
and guard the border.

90
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,750
You don't want me to be more successful than the emperor.

91
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:43,460
I understand it too.

92
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,780
But they are my princess

93
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,140
and my child.

94
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,620
They are innocent.

95
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,700
Why did you take things to this extent?

96
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:52,700
You forced Yi Fu to die

97
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,970
and drove my wife away.

98
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:57,659
Listen.

99
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,390
I did this

100
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,990
for the big picture.

101
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,310
For the big picture?

102
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,140

103
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,670
do you know what I want?

104
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,770
All these years,

105
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,420
I treated you as my mother.

106
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,150
I want to get a little warmth

107

00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,860
Haven't I treated you

109
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,300
as my own child?

Now I have a family,

111

but you want to take her away from me.

112
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,740
Why?

113
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,460
Let me tell you.

114
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,230
I did everything

115
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,860
to ensure your safety.

116
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,100
Besides,

117
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,659
only when you and your brother get along

118
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,140
will the people be safe.

119
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,100
Mother.

120
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,990
Stop making excuses.

121
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,350
From now on,

122
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,180
I'm no longer your child.

124
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,390
you can't just refuse to eat or drink.

125
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,020
How about

126
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,140
I get you some porridge?

127
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,590
At least take a bite.

128
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:24,870
Mr. Zhou.

129
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,790
You're back.

130
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,590
Miss Tao.

131
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:32,900
Go get a bowl of porridge.

132
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,580
I'll talk to her.

133
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,300
Okay.

134
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,020
I saw him.

135
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,980
I gave him the divorce agreement.

136
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,140
He thought the child was gone.

137
00:07:58,659 --> 00:07:59,500
But he said

138
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,980
he didn't want to hurt the child.

139
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,030
Should we tell him the truth that the child...

140
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:10,870
No.

141
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12,830
Don't tell him.

142
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,020
The child belongs to me.

143
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,030
Okay.

144
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,150
Okay.

145
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,670
You can stay here for now.

146
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,770
You're weak now.

147
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,390
It's not suitable for you to travel.

148
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,390
It's easier to hire doctors and midwives here than in the countryside.

149
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,550
Besides,

150
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,860
I've already told him that you've left the capital.

151
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,470
To get here from the Prince's Mansion,

152
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,860
he has to cross much of the capital city.

153
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,659
He won't find us here.

154
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,190
Ke.

155
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,830
But you can't go on like this.

156
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,030
Have you forgotten your determination to save the child?

157
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:48,710
The doctor said

158
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,790
if it was not for your strong will to survive,

159
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,110
you and your child

160
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,650
wouldn't have survived.

161
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,590
It's not easy for you to survive.

162
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,070
Don't be hard on yourself.

163
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,110
You're exhausting yourself.

164
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:02,910
Don't you want the child anymore?

165
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,670
Of course, I want the child.

166
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,660
It's my life now.

167
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,710
Then take the medicine

168
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:16,790
and eat well

169
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:17,940
for the child

170
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,290
and yourself.

171
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,030
OK?

[Virtue and Benevolence]

173
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,660
Sir.

174
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,220
This is what Steward Yi ordered in the silk shop

175
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,730
when he was alive.

176
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,410
They just arrived at the mansion.

177
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:51,860
Steward Yi

178
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,110
selected the best fabric

179
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,750
to make baby swaddles.

180
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,930
They are to wear from one month

181
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,460
to one year old.

182
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,710
They are for both boys

183
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,310
and girls.

184
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,620
But why was he so muddled

185
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,020
and did such a thing?

186
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,550
Uncle Fu promised

187
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,460
to protect the Princess and the child.

188
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,310
He had prepared so many things.

189
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,980
He must be looking forward to this child's arrival.

190
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,940
If he liked the child so much,

191
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,590
why did he give her the medicine?

192
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,550
Find a coroner

00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,740
to examine Uncle Fu's body.

194
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,550
Sir.

195
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,220
This is the autopsy result of the coroner.

196
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,630
Steward Yi didn't hang himself.

197
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,310
He was strangled by someone else

198
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,590
and then staged to look like a hanging suicide.

199
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,230
The murderer is very clever.

200
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,270
If we don't observe carefully,

201
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:45,900
it's hard to find

202
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,460
there are scratches on Steward Yi's body.

203
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,300
And

204
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,830
there are noticeable bloodstains and skin flakes

205
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,180
beneath the right-hand nails of Steward Yi.

206
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,260
He probably scratched the murderer's arm

207
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,790
while fighting with the murderer.

208
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,740
In other words,

209
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,100
the person with a scratch on the arm

210
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,270
could be the murderer.

211
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,150
That's right.

212
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,710
We only

213
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,390

214
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,110

215
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:10,790

as long as you behave yourself,

235
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,180
there would be a place for you in the mansion.

You asked me to be stronger.

But Steward Yi didn't obey.

00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,780
For ten years, I've been the widow of Zheng Zhi,

381
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,030
enduring ten years of humiliation from you.

382
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:09,680
♫Lend me a lamp♫

383
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,740
The eternal lamps I've lit these past few days

384
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,250
♫To warm my lonely heart♫

385
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,580
are my final gesture of relationship to the Zheng family.

386
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,510
♫Lend me some ink♫

387
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:14,980
Now

388
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,910
I owe you nothing.

389
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:20,400
♫So that I can draw a portrait for you♫

390
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:19,980
Madam.

391
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,870
♫I've been missing you♫

392
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,190
Please remember your words.

393
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,190
After I walk out of this ancestral hall today,

394
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,220
♫There's so much to say♫

395
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,220
I'll have nothing to do with the Zheng family.

396
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,570
♫I'll ask♫

397
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:39,440
♫The moon to answer your questions for me♫

398
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,510
Wan.

399
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,260
Take me home.

400
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,180
Okay.

401
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,670
Stop them!

402
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,260
Move!

403
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,180
You...

404
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,340
Sister.

405
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:14,790
Your Highness.

406
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,020
I know my own health.

407
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,590
The imperial physician was telling the truth.

408
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,460
Your Highness.

409
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,340
Have you heard from Her Highness?

410
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,030
I know where she is.

411
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:37,180
But I shouldn't bother her now.

412
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:38,990
I can only ask someone

413
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,340
to protect her secretly.

414
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,190
After such a big thing happened,

415
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,860
it must be hard for Her Highness to let it go.

416
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,260
If she doesn't want to see you at the moment,

417
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,340
give her some time.

418
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,380
It's all my fault.

419
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,900
We are in the royal family.

420
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,940
Many things

421
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,830
can't be manipulated by us.

422
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,420
How is the Princess of Liang?

423
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,470
Are you planning to keep her locked up like this?

424
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,380
I'll lock her up for the time being.

425
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:20,850
Now,

426
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,310
the North is not peaceful.

427
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,350
I keep her alive

428
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,380
to appease the State of Liang.

429
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,550
Otherwise...

430
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,260
Everyone has their own fate.

431
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:45,740
Sister.

432
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,860
Don't worry about these.

433
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,270
Getting well

434
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:50,380
is the main thing.

435
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,780
I'm already very satisfied.

436
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,860
I just can't stop worrying about you.

437
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:14,200
[Shanglin Pavilion]

438
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,220
Sir.

439
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,140
Sir.

440
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,070
Where are you going?

441
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:16,340
To the court.

442
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,220
Wan.

443
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,860
You don't have to go with me.

444
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:21,950
Your Highness...

445
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:22,580
Wan.

446
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,710
As long as you treat her well,

447
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,180
as long as she can be happy,

448
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,780
other things are just bygone.

449
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,780
If anyone gossips,

450
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:31,870
I will

451
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,070
make him shut up.

452
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:37,950
Thank you, Your Highness.

453
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,950
Keep her

454
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:47,820
when you can.

455
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:11,830
I'm back.

456
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:12,860
Look at my...

457
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,340
What a feast!

458
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,100
I bought something from the market.

459
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,460
I wanted to add more dishes.

460
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:21,980
Looks like we can only eat them for dinner.

461
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,510
I'll take them to the kitchen.

462
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,780
Why do you look so good today?

463
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,030
Her Ladyship took the medicine today

464
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,390
and left the bed to take a walk.

465
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,540
She also sunbathed in the yard.

466
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,620
You're right.

467
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,780
I can't be depressed anymore.

468
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,550
Even if it's for the sake of the child,

469
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,950
I should pull myself together

470
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:48,670
and eat well.

471
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,590
Loving to eat is what defines Shen Keyi.

472
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,270
Eat up.

473
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,550
I didn't expect

474
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,670
I can live like this.

475
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,460
By the way, Your Ladyship,

476
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,030
when I went to the pharmacy to get the medicine for you,

477
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,710
I met a servant from the Prince's Mansion.

478
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,180
I heard

479
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,820
Lady Yunying is seriously ill.

480
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,100
She might not make it.

481
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,060
I'm sorry.

482
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,780
I shouldn't have said that.

483
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,670
Don't be sad.

484
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,340
The doctor said

485
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,500
you should focus on your pregnancy.

486
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,030
You can't be in a bad mood.

487
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,820
Lady Yunying is like my sister.

488
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,710
She's still so young.

489
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,470
How come...

490
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,380
No.

491
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,650
I need to visit her.
