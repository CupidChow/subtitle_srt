Good!

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:43,539
Madam.

6
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,020
His Highness and General Zhou won the battle.

7
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,780
We've been worried for so many days.

8
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,860
Now we can finally stop worrying.

9
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,590
Yes.

10
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,450
This is not the only happy thing.

11
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,220
Yunying said that she would marry Guard Wan

12
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,950
after the victory in the first battle.

13
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,660
Really?

14
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:07,870
Sister,

15
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,620
you have a white hair here.

16
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,539
Let me remove it for you.

17
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,790
Just keep it.

18
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,140
I'm old now.

19
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,540
You're not old.

20
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,020
You will live a long life

21
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,790
and grow old with Guard Wan together.

22
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:41,470
You gave all your good wishes to others.

23
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,940
What about yourself?

24
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,990
Are you really not going to tell His Highness about it?

25
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,780
What's the use of telling him?

26
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,700
It will only distract him.

27
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,420
Besides,

28
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,130
I've divorced His Highness.

29
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,190
You know

30
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,020
what kind of person His Highness is.

31
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:18,860
It's impossible that

32
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,380
he would love someone else.

33
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,260
But I also know

34
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,050
what the imperial family is like.

35
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,780
In the past,

36
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,020
I believed that the will of humans can conquer Heaven,

37
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,870
and I was fearless.

38
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,590
But now I'm pregnant,

39
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,660
and I can't take risks anymore.

40
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,130
I understand.

41
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,550
Trusting someone is something very difficult.

42
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,380
Once I didn't believe that

43
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,140

44
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,220

45
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,260
But my wish has also come true.

46
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,130
Right?

47
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,310
Don't do the same as me.

48
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,390
I used to be trapped in my own worries,

49
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,940
and I didn't realize the truth until the end.

50
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,180

we've won a big victory in the battle.

130

The nomads from the northern border sent a large number of

131

soldiers additionally to attack our troops in the Linsha Valley,

132
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,670
but our troops evaded their attack with the tactic of luring the enemies away from their base.

133

Our troops attacked the enemies' central region instead,

134

00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,150
Wan.

191
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,060
I got it.

192
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:07,430
My sister

193
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,750
has fulfilled her wish anyway.

194
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,100
However,

195
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,950
we still have to move forward.

196
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,590
Wan.

197
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,580
Yunying.

198
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,540
I've brought Su to see you.

199
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,790
These are the pastries for celebrating Su's completion of her first month of life.

200
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,500
I think Su's birth and growth

201
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,630
must be blessed by you in destiny.

202
00:14:59,270 --> 00:14:59,860
Madam.

203
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,430
Are you still not

204
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,580
going to tell His Highness about the child?

205
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,780
What's wrong?

206
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,740
Has Nan Bo asked you for my family letter again?

207
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,940
No.

208
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,070
He said he would come back in a few days to help His Highness handle something.

209
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,060
I'm just worried that with his big mouth like that,

210
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,510
he won't be able to conceal it.

211
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,550
Nan Bo is coming back?

212
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,310
There have been many reports of victory from His Highness in the past six months,

213
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,550
and the situation has stabilized.

214
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,910
It is said that he has been summoned back here

215
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,310
in order to send the Princess of Liang State back.

216
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,830
Madam.

217
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,540
His Highness did all these things

218
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,740
for you.

219
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,950
Are you still going to ignore him?

220
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:49,900
Madam,

221
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,490
this is...

222
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,750
This is my family letter.

223
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,310
Okay.

224
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,580
Yunying,

225
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,340
I seem to understand

226
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,690
what you said to me at that time.

227
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,420
It's been half a year.

228
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,710
I've sent her ten letters or so about my victory,

229
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,700
but she has never replied.

230
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,380
At this point,

231
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,670
she suddenly sent me several pastries.

232
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:31,860
What do you think

233
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,550
is the meaning of these pastries?

234
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,500
Your Highness.

235
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,270
There's no meaning at all.

236
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,660
This is just an ordinary snack among commoners.

237
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,140
Smell it.

238
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:53,670
It smells good, right?

239
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,020
Zhou Yu.

240
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,340
I hope this letter finds you well.

241
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,630
I read a book yesterday.

242
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,500
Time keeps passing day and night

243
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,740
like flowing water.

244
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,109
It means that

245
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:10,630
how time flies

246
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,790
[Shen Keyi]

247
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,349
and we can't go back to the past.

248
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,980
After Yunying passed away,

249
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,060
I gave birth to Su.

250
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,630
All these changes

251
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,829
made me suddenly realize that

252
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,660
time is precious,

253
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,260
and I can't waste it anymore.

254
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,390
I still want to follow my heart

255
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,300
and believe it again.

256
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,340
I hope you can also find

257
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,150
the future you want to work hard for.

258
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,700
Shen Keyi.

259
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:41,860
General.

260
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,340
I'll escort the envoy of the northern border back now.

261
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,220
You must be careful.

262
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:51,710
There are still

263
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,310
many spies at the northern border.

264
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,630
If at this point,

265
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,270
the envoy is intercepted and killed halfway,

266
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,910
it will definitely affect the peace talk.

267
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:58,660
Don't worry.

268
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,470
Even if I risk my life,

269
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,630
I'll send him there safely.

270
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:03,830
Zhou Yu.

271
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,550
You should also come back alive.

272
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,980
If the peace talk goes well,

273
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,340
the northern border can be safe for ten years.

274
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,660
The war

275
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,890
will finally be over.

276
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:37,940
Yes.

277
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,460
Your Highness can also return to the imperial court without any worry.

278
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,070
Your Majesty,

279
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,470
I'm bold to give you this advice,

280
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,710
and it is not out of my selfish motive at all.

281
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,470
Instead,

282
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,030
I'm going to say this for the sake of

283
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,670
Your Majesty and the imperial court.

284
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,340
Prince Jin will return to the imperial court in a few days.

285
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,220
Such outstanding military contributions and prestige

286
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,460
are unique

287
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,060
in the imperial court,

288
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,140
and he's already

289
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,010
a very respected prince.

290
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:42,980
Your Majesty,

291
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,350
how do you want to reward him?

292
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,460
Moreover,

293
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,060
after Prince Jin got married, he hasn't gone to his territory yet,

294
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,780
and he has troops in the capital.

295
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:52,870
As the saying goes,

296
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,550
if a minister's contributions are too big, the emperor's position might be threatened.

297
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,110
That's what the current situation is like.

298
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,030
In that case,

299
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,430
in your opinion,

300
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:02,660
how

301
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,300
should I reward him?

302
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:10,420
I know Your Majesty is a wise emperor who values brotherhood and righteousness.

303
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:11,660
I

304
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,020
dare not say it.

305
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,180
Prime Minister,

306
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,260
just say it.

307
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,110
I'll just take it

308
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:19,980
as a tongue-in-cheek remark.

309
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,510
Your Majesty,

310
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,260
heroes will eventually get old.

311
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,420
Who can guarantee that Prince Jin

312
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,740
will be loyal to you all the time?

313
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:34,750
How about

314
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,390
making Prince Jin

315
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,660
stay at the current moment forever

316
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,780
so that he can be respected and worshipped

317
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,100
by many people in the Imperial Ancestral Temple?

318
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,590
Report!

319
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,270
Report!

320
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,150
General Zhou is here.

321
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,140
There were about 20 spies this time.

322
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,700
They tried to intercept and kill the envoy halfway.

323
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:05,830
After we killed them,

324
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,990
the envoy returned to the northern border safely.

325
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,100
However,

326
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,820
only one spy survived in the end.

327
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,530
Kneel!

328
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,860
Nanzhu Pavilion?

329
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,660
You were the chief culprits who eliminated my Tianhe Fortress.

330
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,420
You guys are still active now?

331
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:36,590
General Zhou.

332
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,020
Zhou Yu.

333
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,870
Please interrogate him

334
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,590
and find out about the truth.

335
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,740
Take him to see the military doctor.

336
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,140
Be careful.

337
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:55,860
Guards!

338
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,460
Take him away.

339
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,260
Yes.

340
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:01,580
-Go!
-Go!

341
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:06,810
Your Highness.

342
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,820
We obviously killed all the members

343
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,660
of the Nanzhu Pavilion.

344
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,470
Why did they still appear at the northern border?

345
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,110
Could it be that

346
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,750
they wanted to ruin our peace talk

347
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,220
with the Nomadic Tribes?

348
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,890
This is too strange.

349
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:21,730
This person

350
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:23,540
must be interrogated carefully.

351
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:24,820
Yes.

352
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:42,870
Here comes the imperial edict!

353
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,540
Your Majesty.

354
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,340
You don't have to bother with it.

355
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,710
Mother,

356
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,540
are you blaming me

357
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,700
because I sent

358
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,250
that imperial edict to Wen Ye?

359
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,990
You asked him to guard the border for another three years,

360
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,150
and forbade him from returning to the imperial court.

361
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,110
He has been fighting on the battlefields for so many years.

362
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,230
Shouldn't he have a chance to rest now?

363
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:23,660
Mother.

364
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:24,900
Wen Ye

365
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,110
is in charge of the three armies alone.

366
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,180
Even though I believe that he's loyal,

367
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,870
people in the imperial court will still gossip about it.

368
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,870
Not everyone can hold an impartial view

369
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,980
and is willing to believe him.

370
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,020
I arranged this

371
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,770
because I thought if Wen Ye could endure it during these years,

372
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:42,860
it would be considered

373
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,710
as his loyalty to the imperial court.

374
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:46,980
In three years,

375
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:48,500
I

376
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,390
will not

377
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,150
restrict his freedom anymore.

378
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,190
I'm old.

379
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,860
I can't interfere anymore.

380
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,220
From now on, for the things between you and your brother,

381
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:12,980
you can

382
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,630
decide according to what you think is suitable.

383
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,820
Thank you for your understanding, Mother.

384
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,940
You've bandaged all your wounds?

385
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,300
They're just minor injuries and are not serious.

386
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:04,060
I'm just a little tired.

387
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,790
Then why don't you go to sleep now?

388
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,540
This is good wine.

389
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,050
[Hero Liang]

390
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,350
This wine can only be found and drunk in the capital, right?

391
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,820
I heard about the imperial edict today.

392
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,510
Why didn't they let you go back to the capital?

393
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,670
That is so unreasonable.

394
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,100
You’ve been in the army for so long.

395
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,830
Haven't you learned the rules?

396
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,510
Many things are unreasonable.

397
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,620
Isn't it fine as long as we can win the war?

398
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,710
Why do they have to think about so many rules?

399
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,830
So what if we win the war?

400
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,950
You won't understand.

401
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,380
I don't understand indeed.

402
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,700
I used to be arrogant

403
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,990
and thought that I was nearly as good as you,

404
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:07,670
and that the only gap between us was our birth.

405
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,140
But in this war,

406
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,410
we fought bravely together.

407
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,450
I admire you.

408
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:18,620
If it weren't for you,

409
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,260
with such a small number of soldiers and such a long border,

410
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,580
we wouldn't have defended this place so well.

411
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,470
It's not easy to have heard this

412
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,550
from you.

413
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,390
I'm just telling the truth.

414
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,550
We made a triumphant return,

415
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,670
and it was all thanks to you.

416
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,630
But as the commander-in-chief,

417
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,700
you'll be kept at the border just because of an imperial edict.

418
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,010
The army will leave here, but you'll still need to stay here.

419
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,290
What kind of justice is that?

420
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,060
Is this how the imperial family

421
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,630
treats those officials who have made contributions?

422
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,510
If you want to be a good general,

423
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,110
all these grievances

424
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,150
should be endured by yourself silently.

425
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,870
Without humanity,

426
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,980
how can a person be a good general who cares about the people?

427
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,230
What about the way of treating your family?

428
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,830
Do you also ignore them?

429
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,530
Family?

430
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,300
I can only comfort myself by thinking that

431
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,980
she lives in the peaceful and prosperous world under my protection.

432
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:36,930
In this way,

433
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,660
it's like guarding each other.

434
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,530
[Noble Quality and Elegant Temperament]

435
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,530
[Noble Quality and Elegant Temperament]

436
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,260
Is His Highness back?

437
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,740
Is he willing to see me?

438
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:34,190
His Highness said he wanted to send you away.

439
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:35,980
Where will I go?

440
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,190
You'll be escorted back to the State of Liang.

441
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,350
That's impossible.

442
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,220
I'm the princess of Liang State.

443
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,150
I've married him and I'm his wife.

444
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,750
It's impossible that he'll send me back.

445
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,950
Nothing is impossible.

446
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,710
His Highness doesn't even want to look at you.

447
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,100
What's the point

448
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,510
of staying here?

449
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:52,940
Be sensible.

450
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:54,620
Leave here with me obediently.

451
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,900
I'm still the princess here.

452
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,150
This is a marriage for maintaining peace between the two countries.

453
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,100
He just can't cancel it so easily like that.

454
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,140
His Highness is about to return to the imperial court in triumph,

455
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,260
and the world will be peaceful

456
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,180
from now on.

457
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,740
What's there for him to worry about?

458
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:09,580
A marriage for maintaining peace?

459
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,630
He doesn't care about it at all.

460
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,940
I live for him,

461
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,500
but he doesn't even care about me.

462
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,340
Wen Ye is too biased.

463
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,060
He doesn't even come to see me.

464
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,780
Take her to the carriage.

465
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,310
Don't touch me!

466
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,390
If you keep forcing me like this,

467
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,020
I will definitely make you regret it.

468
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:55,540
Your Highness.

469
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,900
Are you a servant of Prince's Mansion?

470
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,980
Yes, Madam. Something serious happened in Prince's Mansion.

471
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,220
What's wrong?

472
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,980
The Princess of Liang State reported that there was something

473
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,990
about rebellion hidden in His Highness's tent.

474
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,700
There is no one in our mansion who can make decisions.

475
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,740
It's a mess now.

476
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,780
Rebellion?

477
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,100
Yes, Your Highness.

478
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,060
Please go back now to take a look.

479
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,910
How do you know that I live here?

480
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,660
Guard Nan Bo told me about it.

481
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,940
If you don't believe me, you can ask him next time.

482
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,150
Alright.

483
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,350
I'll go back and take a look.

484
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:34,430
[Prince Jin's Mansion]

485
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:11,790
Shen Keyi.

486
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,060
We haven't seen each other for a long time.
