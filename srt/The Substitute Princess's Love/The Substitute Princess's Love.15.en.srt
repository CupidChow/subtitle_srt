4
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:33,700
Come on.

5
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,530
Your Highness.

6
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,500
I can do it myself.

7
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:39,420
Don't move.

8
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,340
Does it hurt?

9
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,780
I've made you suffer.

10
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,540
Your Highness.

11
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,340
I don't feel wronged.

12
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,780
But it seems that I'm not a good husband.

13
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,690
I've made you wait at home day and night,

14
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,820
let you suffer in front of my relatives,

15
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:21,780
and turned you into an adult

16
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,980
who endures the pain silently

17
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,820
no matter how much it hurts.

18
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,380
Your Highness.

19
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,579
I did all these things voluntarily.

20
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,500
Just take them

21
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,100
as my own thoughts.

22
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,540
I think if I can sacrifice more,

23
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,730
you'll love me more.

24
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,380
I love you.

25
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,500
Your Majesty, why do you have time

26
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,540
to take a stroll with me here today?

27
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,180
Accompanying you is what I should do.

28
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,260
No matter how busy I am with state affairs,

29
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,660
I should spend some time with you.

30
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,500
It's delicious.

31
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,460
Right.

32
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,220
Mine looks great.

33
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,300
Greetings, Your Majesty.

34
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,300
Greetings, Your Grace.

35
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,820
Since when have we been able to buy sugar figures in the palace?

36
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,780
Did you sneak out

37
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,290
of the palace to buy them?

38
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,460
Your Majesty, Your Grace,

39
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,420
I dare not do it.

40
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,860
I swear to God that

41
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,460
I've never stepped out of the palace.

42
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,220
This sugar figure

43
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,420
was made by a sugar-figure chef hired by

44
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,250
a certain master in the palace.

45
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,260
It is said that this chef's skill is the best in the capital.

46
00:03:58,579 --> 00:03:59,890
I couldn't help but long to eat it,

47
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,900
so I queued up to ask the chef to make several sugar figures.

48
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,900
These are just some low-end snacks among the commoners.

49
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,740
Can they be so delicious?

50
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,700
As the candidates for the emperor's harem, you ate sugar figures here secretly.

51
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,380
How inappropriate!

52
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,660
Your Grace, please forgive me.

53
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:17,500
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

54
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:19,060
I won't dare to do it again.

55
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,779
Mother, don't be angry.

56
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,500
I think

57
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,620
this sugar figure

58
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,020
looks quite interesting.

59
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,940
It's vivid.

60
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:32,900
The skill

61
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,300
is excellent.

62
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,500
Next time, invite a sugar-figure chef to the Imperial Kitchen

63
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,580
so that these candidates for my harem won't feel bored.

64
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:41,900
This should be

65
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,340
a product from the top time-honored

66
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,500
brand in the capital, right?

67
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,180
The sugar-figure chef said that

68
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,610
he dared not claim to be

69
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,020
the top one in the capital.

70
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,020
There was a girl who used to run a stall next to him,

71
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,980
and the sugar figures made by her tasted better than those made by him.

72
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,300
However, later that girl

73
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,060
entered a prince's mansion and became the prince's wife.

74
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,980
Since then, she has never run the stall anymore.

75
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,460
Why don't I know that

76
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,900
there is prince who has

77
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,140
such a wife who was born as a commoner?

78
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,260
When did they get married?

79
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,860
I don't remember.

80
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,020
But that sugar-figure chef said that

81
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,500
it might have happened last winter.

82
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,820
The only one who got married last winter

83
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,380
is Prince Jin.

84
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,580

89
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,500
so as to quell your anger.

90

The weather

91
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,140

92

My heart

93
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,900
also feels cold.

94
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,820
I know that

95
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,580
Prime Minister Shen is an important and capable minister of yours.

96
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,940
But Wen Ye

97
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,490
is also your younger brother who grew up with you

98
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,180
and guarded the border painstakingly for you.

99
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,580
The Shen Family asked a fake legitimate daughter to marry him in order to embarrass him.

100

In the future,

101
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,500
they might do something to bully him.

102
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,620
Let me tell you.

103
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,660
if you don't uphold justice

104
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,620

109
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:28,620
I've already

110
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,700
asked the Supreme Court to investigate this case.

111
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,420
By then,

112
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,490
I won't go easy on them.

113
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,900
Their homes will be searched and their property will be confiscated,

114

or their clan members will be all executed according to their crimes.

115
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,700
I'll give you and Wen Ye an explanation.

116

Just don't think about

117
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,980

Now I can't bear to hear such bloody news.

119
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,100
Just kick the substitute princess out,

120
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,300
and cancel their marriage. Then it'll be fine.

121
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:50,820
Yes.

please come with us to the Supreme Court.

00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,780
You'll know when you get there.

please wait until His Highness comes back. Okay?

We're here to arrest her under His Majesty's order.

Now His Majesty

163

has asked the Supreme Court to try this case openly.

164
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,260
It will implicate our whole family,

and we will bear the blame for deceiving His Majesty.

166
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,540
At this point,

167
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,580
it's useless for you to be anxious.

168
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,780
What are you talking about?

169
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,980
If the members of Shen Family are implicated because of this,

00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,700
can you still live like this?

is there any difference?

I'm not like you.

so cleverly and so well.

185
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,260
I'm sure you must

probably in order to

191
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,900
give an explanation to the imperial court and the harem.

192
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,700
As long as

193
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,220
the initiator is punished severely,

194
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,780
our Shen Family won't be implicated much.

195
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,900
Of course we should

196
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,340
let Shen Keyi take all the blame.

197
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,700
This thing is bit serious now.

198
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,740
We still need

199
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,220
some solid evidence.

200
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:07,780
What evidence?

201
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:34,380
Father.

202
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,020
Father.

203
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,260
Why are you here?

204
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,340
Father, look.

205
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,460
This is a new dress the Liuxian Pavilion sent to me today.

206
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,340
Is it beautiful?

207
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,100
Yes.

208
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,700
It's very beautiful.

209
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:54,660
Father.

210
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,780
Why did you come back home so early today?

211
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,700
Have you finished all your work in the imperial court?

212
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,020
Ling,

213
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,460
do you think

214
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,220
I'm good to you?

215
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,980
Of course you're good to me.

216
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,660
If I want the stars and moon in the sky,

217
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,860
you'll be willing to pick them for me.

218
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,060
Ling.

219
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,250
I...

220
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,820
I want to ask you

221
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,060
to do me a favor now.

222
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,380
Are you willing to help me?

223
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,140
Of course I'm willing to help you, Father,

224
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,220
as long as I'm able to do it.

225
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:31,620
Father.

226
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,890
Why is your hand bleeding?

227
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:36,820
This...

228
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:42,500
Ling!

229
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,220
Ling!

230
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,860
Come out at once!

231
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,300
Madam!

232
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:50,930
Madam!

233
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,540
Ling.

234
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,820
My child.

235
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,100
My child.

236
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,700
I'm late.

237
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,380
Shen Yurong!

238
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,500
She is your legitimate and biological daughter!

239
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,130
Your Highness!

240
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:51,780
Your Highness.

241
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,340
Her Highness was taken away by people from the Supreme Court.

242
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,410
What?

243
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,720
[Supreme Court]

244
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:10,980
My lord.

245
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,740
We arrested Princess Jin.

246
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,220
If Prince Jin wants to blame us for it,

247
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:14,860
we...

248
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,420
we can't afford the consequences.

249
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,380
We arrested her under His Majesty's order.

250
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,980
Why do you think we can't afford the consequences?

251
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,540
Don't talk nonsense.

252
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,820
Be careful, or you'll be beheaded.

253
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:26,660
Yes.

254
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,260
I'm sorry.

255
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,300
I was talking nonsense.

256
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,650
Your Highness, please wait.

257
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,090
[Supreme Court]

258
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,060
Your Highness.

259
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,260
His Majesty ordered that

260
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,420
you should avoid suspicion in this case.

261
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,580
After the Supreme Court finds out about the truth,

262
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,860
they will give you a satisfactory explanation.

263
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,090
What if I don't avoid suspicion?

264
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,100
His Majesty has also said that

265
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,820
if you insist on taking this step,

266
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,420
Her Highness will be executed

267
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,340
at noon tomorrow.

268
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,220
Please go back to your mansion and wait for the news.

269
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,380
The Supreme Court will make a fair verdict.

270
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,660
Your Majesty,

271
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:09,860
Your Grace,

272
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,060
Lord Shen wants to see you.

273
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,380
We won't see him.

274
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,540
Ask Prime Minister Shen

275
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,300
to go back to his mansion to reflect on himself

276
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,380
and wait for his punishment.

277
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,060
Go at once!

278
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,460
Your Majesty,

279
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,460
Prime Minister Shen is kneeling outside with three

280
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,620
chaste tree twigs on his back and with his legitimate daughter.

281
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,500
He said he was willing to take the punishment.

282
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,580
If Your Majesty and Your Grace don't see him,

283
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,500
I'm afraid he'll kneel there forever.

284
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,580
What?

285
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,500
Is he trying to use the trick of torturing himself to get my sympathy?

286
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,340
Mother.

287
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:38,980
Well,

288
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:39,860
Shen Yurong

289
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,580
is an important official in the imperial court after all.

290
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,180
If he keeps kneeling there like this,

291
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,620
and other officials see that, it'll not be good.

292
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,460
What will those imperial censors say about me?

293
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,380
Mother.

294
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,420
Why don't we just see him?

295
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,740
Let's see how he'll explain it.

296
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:53,740
By then,

297
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,980
it won't be too late to punish him.

298
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:58,620
Let him in.

299
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,300
Yes.

300
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:13,940
Your Highness!

301
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,620
Your Highness!

302
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,140
His Majesty is having a meeting in the study room.

303
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,460
Please let me inform him first.

304
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:19,580
Your Highness!

305
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:20,060
Brother!

306
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:22,860
Brother.

307
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,100
Come with me.

308
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,060
My lord.

309
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,420
Who is it?

310
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,090
My lord.

311
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,740
Under the order of my master Lord Shen,

312
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,780
I'm here to give you some small gifts.

313
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,420
My master hopes that you can enforce the law impartially,

314
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,700
and won't let her off easily.

315
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,940
My master has drafted the document about her crime.

316
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,850
He hopes that the Supreme Court can close the case as soon as possible.

317
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,480
But she's the wife of Prince Jin.

318
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,460
I can't punish her so easily.

319
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,620
Don't worry, Lord Gao.

320
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,220
My master has said that

321
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,780
Prince Jin can't interfere in this case.

322
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,330
His Majesty's order

323
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,700
will be sent to the Supreme Court soon.

324
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:35,070
[Jiaxi Palace]

325
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,500
Your Majesty, Your Grace, this is the misfortune of my family.

326
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,060
On that day, when I heard that Prince Jin had sacrificed his life for our country,

327
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,620
and my legitimate daughter needed to marry him and become a widow,

328
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,380
as her father, I had a selfish motive indeed,

329
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,130
and didn't want her to marry him.

330
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,580
But I thought that Prince Jin had spent his whole life being a soldier

331
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,860
and making contributions to our country,

332
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,540
so it was our Shen Family's honor that

333
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,900
my daughter could be a widow for him.

334
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:00,900
However, I didn't expect that

335
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,900
after Shen Keyi knew this news,

336
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,780
she took the initiative to come to us,

337
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:06,780
saying that

338
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,380
in order to get a high position and great wealth,

339
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,180
she can be a widow in place of her elder sister.

340
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:14,339
Of course I wouldn't agree.

341
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,060
But

342
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,060
she ruined the face of her sister.

343
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,460
I panicked at that time,

344
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,579
and thought that my family's scandal couldn't be exposed.

345
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:26,900
I was muddled at that time,

346
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,170
and even concealed the truth for that girl.

347
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,100
I

348
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,380
didn't teach my daughter well.

349
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,180
You mean in order to be a substitute bride,

350
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,340
Shen Keyi hurt her sister's face?

351
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,100
But I think

352
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,820
this scar looks light red.

353
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,820
It doesn't look like an old wound.

354
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,690
Your Grace,

355
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,420
you know what?

356
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,460
this illegitimate daughter of mine was so evil-hearted that

357
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,660
she put poison on the dagger.

358
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,820
Because of that, Ling's wound has failed to heal all the time.

359
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,380
If you still have doubts,

360
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,660
you can ask the imperial physician to check the wound.

361
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,420
But it's all my fault,

362
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,140
and I should be blamed.

363
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,260
I should have let this illegitimate daughter

364
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,980
stay by my side so that I could educate her myself.

365
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,100
Then she wouldn't have gone astray like this.

366
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,340
Your Majesty.

367
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,340
Your Grace.

368
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,170
If you need to punish someone,

369
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,010
just punish me.

370
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,100
I can't believe that

371
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,100
there's such a secret behind the story.

372
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,380
Mother,

373
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,420
you're just

374
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,340
too kind-hearted.

375
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,300
This girl

376
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,740
is disloyal, unfilial, heartless and unrighteous.

377
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,100
Once we find out about the truth,

378
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,420
I'll punish the criminals severely

379
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,140
and bring justice to Prince Jin's Mansion and the Shen Family.

380
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,900
I believe Your Majesty is fair and strict,

381
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,020
and won't tolerate such crimes.

382
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,420
You poisoned your elder sister,

383
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,020
and forced the Prime Minister to send you to Prince Jin's Mansion.

384
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,210
Now everybody knows what you did.

385
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,220
If you confess sooner,

386
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,500
you'll suffer less physical pain.

387
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,370
Why should I confess something

388
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,100
I've never done?

389
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:53,930
Don't be so stubborn.

390
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,380
Sign your name on this document about your crime

391
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,500
so that you won't suffer physical pain anymore.

392
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:01,740
My lord,

393
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,340
I grew up in the countryside

394
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,540
and I've never attended school,

395
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,900
so I can't write my name.

396
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,900
Sorry to disappoint you.

397
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,660
Since you don't want to accept my kindness,

398
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,060
I'm afraid I have to torture you.

399
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,700
Can you write your name now?

400
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,220
Minister of the Supreme Court,

401
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,250
you don't go find out about the truth of the substitute bride,

402
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,260
but you're in a hurry to make me confess by torturing me here.

403
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,900
However, I can endure

404
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,540
such little pain.

405
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,340
Go on torturing her.

406
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,220
How many soldiers and horses can we use inside the city?

407
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,780
Do you want to break into the prison and rescue Her Highness?

408
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,180
Brother,

409
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,660
in order to make his lie plausible,

410
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,380
Prime Minister Shen even ruined his legitimate daughter's face.

411
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,180
If you say that he's lying, who would believe that?

412
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,660
Then what about Shen Keyi?

413
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,180
Do you want me to give up on her?

414
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:43,820
Brother,

415
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,740
she is just a woman after all.

416
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,780
Compared with what we've been doing,

417
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,420
namely, eliminating the bad officials around His Majesty to maintain law and order in the imperial court,

418
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,060
these sacrifices are nothing.

419
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,580
She is not a pawn that I can give up.

420
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,700
She's my family whom I want to protect.

421
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,980
If I sacrifice my family for the great cause,

422
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,660
what's the difference between Shen Yurong and me?

423
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:00,380
Brother,

424
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,900
Prime Minister Shen will use unscrupulous methods

425
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,410
to get your wife's confession.

426
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,780
Once people of the Supreme Court torture her,

427
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,220
how long can she endure it under the cruel torture?

428
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,340
When I have no chioce,

429
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,060
I can only do this.

430
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,020
Sir.

431
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,060
Don't worry.

432
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,820
I'll go to the prison and save Her Highness

433
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,580
out of that place even at the cost of my life.

434
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:19,660
Sir,

435
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,220
this is too risky.

436
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,140
Even if we save Her Highness out of the prison,

437
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,500
in the future,

438
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,900
she won't have a decent identity.

439
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,500
Will she need to hide herself all the time?

440
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,780
I'll risk everything to protect her.

441
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,100
Your Highness.

442
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:35,820
Sister.

443
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,580
This is an unwise tactic after all.

444
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,140
We still have a chance

445
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,900
to save your wife.

446
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,220
Why did you say that?

447
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,580
Have you ever thought that

448
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,780
who dared to bypass Prime Minister Shen

449
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,500
and directly report to His Majesty

450
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,380
about deceiving the emperor with the substitute bride?

451
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,220
Why did this person report the secret in the harem,

452
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,260
instead of the imperial court?

453
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,260
Maybe the informant

454
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,210
is a woman.

455
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,780
You mean that...

456
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,820
I don't understand politics in the imperial court,

457
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,340
but I know a little about what women in the harem think.

458
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,380
Maybe

459
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,180
since Prime Minister Shen protected himself selfishly

460
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,940
and wanted to protect his official position by sacrificing his family,

461
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,220
someone from the Shen Family has betrayed him.

462
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,460
Brother,

463
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,140
the Mid-Autumn Festival is coming soon.

464
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,810
You must bring her back.

465
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,690
She needs to be brought back here

466
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,260
justifiably with the identity of Princess Jin.

467
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,340
I got it.

468
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,060
Thank you, Sister.

469
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,700
I'd like to ask you to

470
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,290
prepare some things for me

471
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,660
and send them to her in the prison.

472
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:46,980
Please say it, Your Highness.

473
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:49,860
Just make some mooncakes

474
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,500
and put lotus petals

475
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,180
inside the mooncakes.

476
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:55,900
Lotus petals?

477
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,620
This is a hamper from Prince Jin's Mansion, and it's for you.

478
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,540
When you see the unstained lotus which has emerged from the dirty soil,

479
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,620
you should know that you need to keep a pure heart.

480
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,140
She will understand what I mean.

481
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,290
Daughter,

482
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,180
I will find you a famous doctor

483
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,460
to treat the wound on your face.

484
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,740
You contributed a lot to our Shen Family.

485
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:10,900
No matter what you want,

486
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,860
I'll give it to you.

487
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,500
With a face like this,

488
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,500
which man from an aristocratic family would marry me?

489
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:21,700
How can I get married?

490
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:22,780
Ling,

491
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:24,660
don't forget that

492
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,740
I'm the Prime Minister, and you're my daughter.

493
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,540
No one will look down on you.

494
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:29,900
I will

495
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,620
definitely find you a good husband.

496
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:34,540
Do you know

497
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,210
Minister Li's son?

498
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,820
Recently,

499
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,780
they've come here to propose a marriage several times.

500
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,500
I think we should just...

501
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,740
Doesn't Minister Li's son suffer from mental deficiency?

502
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,540
But Minister Li is a high-ranking official in the imperial court.

503
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:51,980
His family is prosperous.

504
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,620
They've been a prestigious family for three generations.

505
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,380
If you marry his son,

506
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,820
it will be beneficial

507
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,660
for our Shen Family.

508
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,300
Ling.

509
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:06,740
Ling.

510
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,290
In the end, you even want to

511
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,820
sell your daughter at a good price.

512
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:10,740
Ling.

513
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,540
Great.

514
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:12,340
You...

515
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,420
How can you think of me like that?

516
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,420
I just want to find you

517
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,620
a good husband.

518
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,690
Only when our Shen Family is good

519
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,980
will you be good.

520
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,300
Right?

521
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,250
Fine.

522
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,420
I'll listen to you.

523
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,220
Minister Li's son who has mental deficiency.

524
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,340
I should have married a prince or an earl,

525
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,780
and lived a wonderful life.

526
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,020
The family who loves me the most

527
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,020
has actually ruined my life.

528
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,900
What a joke.

529
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:08,700
Who?

530
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:16,900
Your Highness.

531
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,780
If you resist by killing yourself,

532
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,740
It'll be quite unfair to yourself.

533
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:23,820
Fairness?

534
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,180
Don't you think that

535
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,170
it's quite ridiculous to talk about

536
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,580
whether a woman's experience

537
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,380
is fair or not here?

538
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,460
In this big house surrounded by high walls,

539
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,050
benefits are more important

540
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,730
than family affection.

541
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,620
If everything is fine,

542
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,820
we will love each other.

543
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,980
If there is a disaster,

544
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,060
we can only run away respectively.

545
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:52,940
Those who escape slowly

546
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,900
will be sacrificed.

547
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,980
Don't you want to use the east wind

548
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,180
to be the one who escapes fast?

549
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,380
Are you the east wind?

550
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,860
Prince Pingxiu’s fief is in Luo City.

551
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,020
He is the only prince who has a different surname in our dynasty.

552
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,300
I've always been on good terms with him.

553
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,300
I can write a letter to ask him to take you in

554
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,020
so that you can be safe all your life.

555
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,460
If I only want to be safe all my life,

556
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,290
my father can also help me achieve this goal.

557
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,660
You're a smart woman.

558
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,780
Just don't deceive yourself.

559
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,020
What do you want?

560
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,020
Enter the palace with me

561
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,820
and expose your father's lies.

562
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,300
I thought you came here

563
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,620
to win me over

564
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,410
and ask me to help you overthrow your political enemy.

565
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,860
So you're here to save Shen Keyi.

566
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:54,940
She is my wife.

567
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,220
She is just an illegitimate daughter who married you in place of me.

568
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,860
If I had married you...

569
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,060
There's only the relationship about interests between you and me.

570
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,570
I won't help you save her.

571
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,620
If you don't agree,

572
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,300
we won't even have the relationship about interests.

573
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,220
I'm jealous.

574
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,740
She's a wild girl whose background

575
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,660
and appearance are worse than mine.

576
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,020
How come she can live better than me?

577
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:33,700
So,

578
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,340
you're willing to end up like this?
