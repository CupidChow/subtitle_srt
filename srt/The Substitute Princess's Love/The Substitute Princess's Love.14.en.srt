00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,660
I didn't see you clearly last time.

191
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,140
This time, I do.

192
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,660
You are younger and more beautiful than I thought.

193
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,820
So you used to think

194
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,540
I was an old, ugly woman?

195
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,780
No, I didn't dare to think that way.

196
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,740
Now I know

197
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,540
you're really good at flattering people.

198
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:58,020
No wonder His Highness is obsessed with you.

199
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,990
I didn't know he had said that.

200
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,380
His Highness never told me that before.

201
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:10,710
Your Grace.

202
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,770
These are the desserts I made for you.

203
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,579
Thank you.

204
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,950
[Beauty and Grace]

205
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,940
I'm glad you came today.

206
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,180
I

207
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,890
have something to discuss with you.

208
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,340
Show the portraits.

209
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,560
[Wu Xue, Grand Preceptor's daughter, aged 20]

210
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,900
They are daughters of noble families in the capital.

211
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,760
[Wang Qiuyue, daughter of Head of State Security Bureau, aged 18]

212
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,820
You choose one from them to be a concubine for His Highness.

213
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,660
So that she can help you with the business

214
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,470
in Prince's Mansion in the future

215
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,860
and produce offspring for His Highness.

216
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,100
Please forgive me, Your Grace.

217
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,140
I can't do this.

218
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,980
There're many good girls in the world.

219
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,420
But His Highness only wants me to be together with him.

220
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,900
I have no right to select

221
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,860
a few concubines for him.

222
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:27,710
Princess Jin is a jealous wife. It's against women's virtue.

223
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:32,060
According to the palace rules, she should be warned and slapped in the face.

224
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:32,860
Yes.

225
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,950
Your Grace.

226
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,140
I knelt at the door

227
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:09,910
and got punished by you.

228
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,390
If there's nothing else,

229
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,140
I'll go back to Prince's Mansion.

230
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,380
I need to go back now

231
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,230
and make birthday noodles for His Highness.

232
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,790
I don't know if you know

233
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,430
today is His Highness's birthday.

234
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,310
I want to keep him company today.

235
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,930
From this year on,

236
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,860
His Highness will not spend his birthday alone.

237
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,230
All right, you may leave.

238
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,030
I now know what kind of girl she is.

239
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,870
No wonder His Highness likes her.

240
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,030
Go.

241
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,030
Summon Yi Fu to the palace.

242
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:17,980
Yes.

243
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,150
That woman in the palace

244
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,780
slapped my face harder than Aunt Xin did.

245
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,220
Your Highness.

246
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,820
Tell it to His Highness once we get back to the mansion.

247
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,230
He will do something about it.

248
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,070
Don't do that.

249
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,980
Why not?

250
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,150
This is so humiliating.

251
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:45,280
[Jiaxi Palace]

252
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,660
Today is his birthday.

253
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,630
We should all be happy.

254
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,510
I don't want him to be worried because of this.

255
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,230
I'm fine.

256
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,230
I just need to use some ointment.

257
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,310
It must have hurt very much.

258
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,030
Greetings, Your Grace.

259
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,210
Stand up.

260
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,260
Thank you, Your Grace.

261
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,980
Is His Highness in the mansion today?

262
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,460
His Highness is busy with military affairs.

263
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,420
He hasn't been back to the mansion for many days.

264
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,270
This day last year,

265
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,170
did he come to the royal palace?

266
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,140
Yes, Your Highness.

267
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,540
And he did it the year before last year.

268
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,900
And three years ago.

269
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,420
As long as he was in the capital that day,

270
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,950
he would come to the palace.

271
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,460
He would always sat here for a while

272
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,910
and he wouldn't say anything.

273
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:41,550
Now I know

274
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,420
he just wanted to hear me, his mother

275
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:49,310
say happy birthday to him.

276
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,900
But I

277
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,670
just forgot that.

278
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,870
Your Grace.

279
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,670
How about I bring a birthday gift to him?

280
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:04,630
Forget it.

281
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,350
By the way,

282
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,300
how is the relationship

283
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,020
between Prince Jin and his wife?

284
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,390
His Highness has been busy with military affairs.

285
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,550
and has no time to spend with her.

286
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,070
They...

287
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,230
Yi Fu.

288
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,420
Your Grace, forgive me.

289
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,710
I didn't tell you the truth.

290
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,470
Actually,

291
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,100
I feel sympathetic towards His Highness.

292
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,830
He has finally

293
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:40,420
met someone who really understands him.

294
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,140
But she is the daughter of the Shen family.

295
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,420
But she

296
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,900
is such a good girl.

297
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,220
His Highness got to know her identity long ago.

298
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,980
The Shen family has abandoned her.

299
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,830
I know

300
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,150
the girl he likes

301
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,180
must be a good girl.

302
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,020
But

303
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,500
unless he goes to his fief,

304
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,430
he can never fall in love with anyone

305
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,980
in the capital.

306
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,540
The stability of the border areas of Liang State has been restored,

307
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,660
but the North State is still a big threat to us.

308
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,140
We need Prince Jin to protect our state.

309
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,260
He can't leave now.

310
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:28,990
Your Grace.

311
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,390
I watched His Highness

312
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,020
grow up.

313
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,390
From a little boy

314
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,830
to an excellent general.

315
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,990
But he should be treated as a man with feelings first.

316
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,950
He's not just an excellent general.

317
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,060
He has chosen to be

318
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,830
a general respected by the people,

319
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,100
so he should know

320
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,740
the emperor can never fully trust him.

321
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:01,100
Before the former emperor passed away,

322
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,540
he actually wanted Prince Jin to accede to the throne.

323
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:08,450
If I hadn't made a deal with Prince Jin,

324
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,550
the two brothers

325
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,750
would have tried to kill each other.

326
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,590
Since he ascended the throne,

327
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:19,950
His Majesty has never fully trusted Prince Jin.

328
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,660
The two brothers have lived in peace with each other for many years.

329
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:26,930
But if there is a big change,

330
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,870
no one knows what will happen.

331
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,030
Besides,

332
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,910
the amulet given to Prince Jin by the former emperor

333
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:38,290
is useless now.

334
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:39,740
Your Grace.

335
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,910
You don't

336
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:45,780
believe that His Highness can handle all this?

337
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,540
I can't afford any risk.

338
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,550
I owe him a lot.

339
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,010
I won't be able to repay him.

340
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:56,910
I can only owe him forever.

341
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,150
Your Grace.

342
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,420
Even if I do nothing about it,

343
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:05,220
Madam Shen will take action

344
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,540
and she has already done it in the palace.

345
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,430
Princess Jin

346
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,510
won't be able

347
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,030
to be with Prince Jin for long.

348
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,540
[Quezhou Defense Map]

349
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,590
Your Highness.

350
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,270
The grain transportation units have arrived in Quezhou.

351
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:29,990
That's good.

352
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:31,950
Where are the people from Nanzhu Pavilion?

353
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,710
After they arrived at Mount Crane,

354
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,810
no one can find them.

355
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:36,510
And those Men of Sacrifice were too stubborn.

356
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,660
They refused to tell anything.

357
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,900
I've had many battles with the chief of Nanzhu Pavilion.

358
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,470
I rarely gained the upper hand.

359
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,940
She is skilled and mysterious.

360
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,110
If we can't capture her, it will be a big trouble.

361
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,060
Should I try harder to search the mountain area?

362
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,510
No need.

363
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,570
Remove all our troops.

364
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,630
She's good at hiding herself.

365
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,910
We can't find her here.

366
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,470
Let her go to the capital

367
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,020
where we'll set a trap for her.

368
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,500
Your Highness.

369
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,540
Why are you so sure that she will go to the capital?

370
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,540
Without an accomplice in the capital,

371
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,190
she couldn't assassinate me

372
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:19,420
and launch a sneak attack at Tianhe Fortress at the same time.

373
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,300
If grain transportation units can't reach us

374
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,180
we will not be able to build a military base camp

375
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,270
in Quezhou.

376
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,820
This will give Liang State an advantage.

377
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,700
At the same time,

378
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,340
those officials will begin to lose trust in me.

379
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,660
Let's wait and see what she'll do next.

380
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:35,940
I want to solve this problem once and for all.

381
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,470
Your Highness, happy birthday to you.

382
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,290
Today is my birthday?

383
00:26:59,460 --> 00:26:59,940
Yes.

384
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:01,870
Your Highness.

385
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,340
No matter how busy you are, you can't forget your birthday.

386
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,460
This is the first time that

387
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,030
somebody in my family has made birthday noodles for me.

388
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,620
Then in the future,

389
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,910
I'll make birthday noodles for you on your birthday every year.

390
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:44,980
Ye.

391
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,900
You'll know when you grow up.

392
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,950
In some places, no matter how much charcoal you burn, you won't feel warm.

393
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,980
But there is a place where you'll feel warm

394
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,110
even when the roof is leaking and windows are broken.

395
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,820
What place is that?

396
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,140
It's home

397
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:07,990
where a family live together in a house.

398
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,820
That's the warmest place in the world.

399
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,270
Your Highness, it's almost midnight.

400
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,220
Make a wish.

401
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,700
My wish has been fulfilled.

402
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,190
I am now

403
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,510
in the warmest place in the world.

404
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,580
The warmest place?

405
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,620
The warmest place

406
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,740
is my home where you're with me.

407
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:46,860
Your Highness.

408
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,690
There's a scar on your hand.

409
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,540
I didn't notice it before.

410
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,790
I got it a long time ago.

411
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,620
I don't even remember it.

412
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,100
It seems that at that time I saw a girl who was about to be bullied.

413
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,740
I was going to help her,

414
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,670
but she scratched me.

415
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,500
And then?

416
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,210
Nothing happened.

417
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,210
Didn't she say she could only repay you by being your wife

418
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,300
and she would never marry anyone else?

419
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,860
You've read too many stories.

420
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,140
Your Highness.

421
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,580
Did you go to the royal palace today?

422
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:40,030
I heard that you would go to the royal palace to visit Empress Dowager

423
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,700
on your birthday every year.

424
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,100
So I went to the palace and visited her on your behalf.

425
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,220
Your Highness.

426
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,700
Why are you looking at me like this?

427
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:57,390
I did a great job in the palace today.

428
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,670
But I got lost

429
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:01,870
and hit the wall.

430
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,140
That's why my face is red.

431
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,430
It's getting late.

432
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,590
I'll go to bed now.

433
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,700
Bye, Your Highness.

434
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,230
It's really him.

435
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,310
Why him?
