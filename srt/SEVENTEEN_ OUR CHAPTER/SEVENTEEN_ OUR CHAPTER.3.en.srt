[staff] Throughout the 10-year journey,

2
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,177
what has been the driving force
for SEVENTEEN?

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,470
The driving force?

4
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:13,263
There really are...

5
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,725

We fight sometimes. We talk a lot.

8
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,105
I think that's very important.

9
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,233
I think it's our wish to bring joy

10
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,818
to those who love us.

11
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:32,908
I think my own values have been
the driving force behind my hard work.

12
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:34,952
Do I need to say more?

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,623
Being away from them helps. [chuckles]

14
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,296
Don't even get me started with the CARATs.

15
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,799
It's a wonderful career,

16
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,384
and I'm enjoying every moment.

17
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,052
For me.

18
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,029
Well, first of all,

19
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:13,615
I actually...

AS SEVENTEEN NEARS THEIR 10TH ANNIVERSARY,
THEY PREPARE THEIR FIFTH STUDIO ALBUM

21
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,714
We've already achieved a lot of our goals,

22
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:35,053
now our goal is to enjoy
and sustain everything steadily.

23
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:38,473
The short-term goal
is to finish the studio album well.

24
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,560
We need to discuss

25
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,229

of the 10th anniversary album,

26
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,732

[♪ tense music playing]

28
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:52,863
We did say we wanted
the album to drop on May 26th,

29
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,948
but the timeline is a bit tight.

30
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,703
[staff] Postponing the album
lessens its meaning.

31
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:00,996
It does lose its meaning.

32
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,539
Since the timeline is so tight,

33
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,375
the production team
wants to postpone the schedule

34
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:12,090
and start the album promotion on May 26th.

35
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,552
But we want to drop it
on our 10th anniversary

36
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,387
even if it means pushing ourselves.

37
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:21,683
For now, I don't want
to look too far ahead.

38
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:25,479
I want to focus on creating this album
with all 13 members.

39
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,522
After the studio album,

40
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,192
I hope to enjoy SEVENTEEN's new

41
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,486
and slightly different tour experience.

42
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,488
I actually think
going with "Birthday" straightforwardly

43
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,697
-isn't bad.
-Me too.

44
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,032
[BUMZU] You mean for the keyword?

45
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,117
[HOSHI] That's not bad.
And then with parentheses...

46
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:42,579
If you want to convey
that kind of idea as well...

47
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,414
[BUMZU] Then, "0526" in the parentheses.

48
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,957
-"0526"?
-"Birthday" is too common.

49
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:50,337
I disagree because
this keyword is so common.

50
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,089
[WOOZI] I mean, keywords come and go

51
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,091
-as we proceed.
-True.

52
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,928
[WOOZI] We had been working on
potential title tracks

53
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,847
and had already failed a few times.

54
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:05,268
I wish we could take the word "Birthday"
and give it a twist.

55
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,978
-[SEUNGKWAN] Me too.
-[VERNON] Just a little bit.

56
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:10,273
I think when you hear the word "Birthday,"

57
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,734
-it feels a bit too frilly.
-[MINGYU] Cut the umbilical cord...

58
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,111
When you hear the word "Birthday,"

59
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,654
-it could either feel hip...
-[VERNON] Yes.

60
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,656
...or it could feel frilly.

61
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,866
That's what I think.

62
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,326
-It would work if we make it hip.
-Yes.

63
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,162
Considering the song's tempo
and other elements,

64
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:26,039
the genre would be closer to EDM.

65
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,708
-[MINGYU] But "Birthday" doesn't...
-It would hit like this.

66
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,713
-[VERNON] That's not bad.
-It depends on the music and lyrics.

67
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:38,468
It was our 10th anniversary album,
so everyone pitched in their ideas.

68
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:42,305
We really went over each song, the themes,

69
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:46,435
the album cover, and the music videos.

70
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:50,272
Every component was reviewed with care.

71
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:56,570
Every album took a lot of work,
but we truly put our hearts into this one.

72
00:03:56,653 --> 00:04:00,198
Let's move on to the solo tracks.

73
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:04,619
In short, this album is trying to convey
a kind of rebirth, right?

74
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,289
As if shedding old skin and being reborn.

75
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:11,334
We can tie all the songs together
by having the theme be about "me."

76
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,670
To explore that theme,
it could be about your past,

77
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:17,174
present, or future selves.

78
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,759
-But I don't think that matters.
-"Just me."

79
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:23,013
You are free to express "me" in any form.

80
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,766
And then, the "rebirth" concept

81
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:28,477
can be expressed through the group song.

82
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:33,356
This is the 10th album,
so if it's possible, we should be more...

83
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,735
When we create an album,
we think about its story,

84
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:42,115
the messages in the photos,
and the story told by the music videos.

85
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,367
All of these elements come together

86
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,703
to tell a story like a great film.

87
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:47,996
That's why

88
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,081
working on the story and the messages

89
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,793
is the most important step.

90
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,837
It's the 10th anniversary album.
Let's give it our all.

91
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,507
-Let's go!
-Let's do this!

92
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,511
Even after 10 years
and five studio albums,

93
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:06,223
we keep pushing forward

94
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,059
and striving to improve.

95
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:14,272
That's the kind of team we are,
and that's the message we want to convey.

96
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:19,903
So we decided to lean into
the birthday party concept.

97
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:23,990
With "HIT," we wanted to break everything.

98
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,535
And with "Super," we tried so hard...

99
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,662
-[HOSHI] To rise through the ranks.
-Right.

100
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,039
We pushed ourselves
to rise through the ranks.

101
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,333
But we don't have the same goal
as back then.

102
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,669
-[HOSHI] True.
-Our vibe is not the same.

103
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,797
To be honest,
this is our current team vibe.

104
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:45,178
"What can we work harder on?"

105
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,514
In any case, we must try our best.

106
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:51,142
I will be coming into the studio
during the break,

107
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,478
so I will have something worked on.

108
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,981
Now we have to work with 11 members,

109
00:05:56,064 --> 00:06:01,111
which raised some concerns.

110
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,446
WOOZI had also been
thinking a lot about that.

111
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,782
This album was made by all 13 members

112
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,869
before the absences occurred.

113
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,162
After the fifth studio album,

114
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:15,166
we all knew it might take a while
for SEVENTEEN to be complete again.

At the time, Jihoon was worn out
from writing so many songs.

I understand
where you're coming from, BUMZU.

173
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,870
Musically, I felt more confident
in "Thunder" than in "HBD,"

174
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,122
which is why I said I like "Thunder."

175

is how the members feel about it.

176

If they can have fun with it,
it'll be the song that shines.

177
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,549
So honestly, I don't know
what the right answer is.

178
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,843
I'm not sure
how the members feel yet either.

179

I'll be able to make a final decision.

185

I think "Thunder"
shows a different side of SEVENTEEN.

186
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:38,828
I also think "Thunder"

187
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,123
is a song that people can accept easily.

188

-[VERNON] I think so too.
-[THE 8] Definitely.

189

-[MINGYU] "Thunder" is?
-The keyword is great too.

190

When I first heard "Thunder,"

191

194
00:09:56,638 --> 00:10:00,058
this one shows a fresh, different side.

195

197

I became even more certain.

198
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,652
The song itself is really good,

199
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:14,197
and I think
people will want to listen to it.

200
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,784
I think that's an important criteria
we should focus on,

201
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,495
and "Thunder" fits that standard better.

202
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,164
[SEUNGKWAN] That's why
"Thunder" became the title track.

203
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:26,209
Compared to our past songs,

204
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:30,213
it is sharper, more stylish, and groovier.

205
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,715
It shows people a different side of us.

206
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,551
It was literally a new challenge.

207
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,554
I like both songs,
but "Thunder" has more votes so far.

208
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,765
So let's go with "Thunder"
and rework the lyrics.

209
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,142
We go with "Alo, alo."

-Yeah.

-Drop the beat!

518
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:50,484
[in Korean] Tecate Pa'l Norte
was actually our first festival in Mexico.

519
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:51,985
We haven't been there in a long time.

520
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:54,905
We already knew
the energy and vibe would be amazing.

521
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:58,534
As we prepared for the stage,
we kept imagining what it'd be like.

522
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,245
We're so happy
to meet you all at this festival,

523
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,956
and we hope to come back next time
with a concert.

524

[MINGYU] Every festival
makes my heart race.

525
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,835
It's not just CARATs out there.

526
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:10,963
There are people who don't know us
but are there to enjoy the music.

527
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,632
So there's always that pressure
to win them over.

528
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,844
[HYELIM] Let's do "God of Music"
before the choreography team comes.

529
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:18,137
[MINGYU] The choreography team?

530
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,765
We'll change "God of Music," "March,"
and "Super" into an 11-member formation.

531
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:23,559
In my opinion,

532
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,311
it'll be easier
compared to "HOT" or the last one.

533
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:29,356
We'll try to keep the changes
to a minimum.

534

-Yes, like this.

Then, you take one step forward.

542
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,372
Compared to learning something brand new,

543
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:49,626
it's harder to change
what you already know.

544
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:53,297
We had to make those changes
to every song for Tecate Pa'l Norte.
