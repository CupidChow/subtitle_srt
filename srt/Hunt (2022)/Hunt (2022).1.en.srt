This film takes place in the 1980s.
Nonetheless this is a work of fiction,
and any similarity to persons living or dead, agencies and institutions,

2
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,534
or actual events and cases mentioned
in the film is purely coincidental.

3
00:00:59,534 --> 00:01:03,534
1983, Washington

4
00:01:04,367 --> 00:01:07,992
Summit Turns Its Back
on Trampled Democracy

5
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,540
Down with the dictator!

6
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,290
No more dictatorship!

7
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,510
Down with the dictator!

8
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,850
Drive him out!

9
00:01:50,992 --> 00:01:53,534
Got it, report in as soon as
he leaves the White House!

10
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,992
When is the protest being broken up?!

11
00:01:58,992 --> 00:02:02,909
They have an official permit.
We can’t break it up.

12
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:05,367
Stop the massacres!

13
00:02:05,367 --> 00:02:07,326
Stop them! Stop them!

14
00:02:09,242 --> 00:02:12,034
Look at those effigies
of the president!

15
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:17,492
Call me when the president
passes Georgia Avenue.

16
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,784
Murderer

17
00:02:34,867 --> 00:02:35,992
Chief Park!

18
00:02:36,701 --> 00:02:38,451
Why don’t you do something?

19
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:40,784
Get your Foreign Unit
to break up the crowd!

20
00:02:40,951 --> 00:02:42,742
Want the president
to use the back door?

21
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:51,409
Why’s the Domestic Unit here
breathing up our asses?

22
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:00,409
Chief Park.

23
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:04,034
Can you feel the passion
for our president out there?

24
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:07,909
What should the tone
of my article be?

25
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:11,034
Mr. Kang, a reporter
needn’t worry about tone.

26
00:03:11,242 --> 00:03:13,326
Come with me,
I’ll educate you.

27
00:03:18,326 --> 00:03:19,742
They sure are opinionated
after abandoning their country.

28
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:22,867
They sure are opinionated
after abandoning their country.
Director of KCIA Chief of East Asia, CIA

29
00:03:23,576 --> 00:03:28,992
I hear Korean students keep demanding
the withdrawal of US troops.

30
00:03:30,784 --> 00:03:37,284
It’s all because the president
suppressed citizens by force

31
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:42,076
Come on, Director,
that’s all in the past.

32
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:46,576
It was a just suppression.

33
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:50,326
You know why it’s so important
he holds onto power?

34
00:03:51,367 --> 00:03:54,617
If Korea falls, Okinawa will too,

35
00:03:54,784 --> 00:03:58,742
and our entire military presence
in the Asia-Pacific.

36
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:02,451
The existing order will collapse.

37
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,034
Don’t you worry.

38
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:08,784
He’s amending the constitution and
the election process to retain power.

39
00:04:39,951 --> 00:04:40,826
Sir!

40
00:04:40,826 --> 00:04:44,034
The CIA detected a plot
to assassinate the president!

41
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:44,826
What?

42
00:04:46,867 --> 00:04:48,117
Stop the car! Now!

43
00:06:11,992 --> 00:06:13,409
What’s his location?

44
00:06:14,034 --> 00:06:15,909
He’s passing the dressing room!

45
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,409
Ju-kyung!

46
00:06:57,867 --> 00:06:58,909
Ju-kyung!

47
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:00,117
I’m okay!

48
00:07:13,034 --> 00:07:14,034
Sir!

49
00:07:20,701 --> 00:07:22,284
Need to capture him alive!

50
00:07:53,701 --> 00:07:55,784
How could you kill
the suspect?

51
00:07:55,784 --> 00:07:57,867
You shouldn’t have been
taken hostage!

52
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:02,451
Wipe off that blood.

53
00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:21,576
No more!

54
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:25,659
No more dictatorship!

55
00:08:25,826 --> 00:08:29,492
Restore democracy!

56
00:08:33,326 --> 00:08:35,367
How could they send
riot cops onto campus?

57
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:39,951
Everyone disperse!

58
00:08:43,951 --> 00:08:45,784
Go home, and be careful.

59
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,492
Hey! Over here!

60
00:08:59,492 --> 00:09:00,701
Open the gate!

61
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,742
Please open the gate!

62
00:09:05,951 --> 00:09:07,992
The screwdriver!
Pull it out!

63
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:09,826
Right there! Screwdriver!

64
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:49,451
Hello?

65
00:09:51,742 --> 00:09:53,076
Yes, this is he.

66
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:57,159
My God, I didn’t know,
I am so sorry!

67
00:09:57,284 --> 00:09:58,326
Motherfuckers!

68
00:09:58,367 --> 00:10:00,826
You think your parents
paid tuition for you to do this?

69
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,076
You piece of shit!

70
00:10:03,534 --> 00:10:04,992
Stop hitting them!

71
00:10:04,992 --> 00:10:07,326
Hey! That girl, there.
Move, you idiot!

72
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:08,492
Hey, stop!

73
00:10:08,492 --> 00:10:09,951
Are you out of
your fucking mind, bitch?!

74
00:10:09,951 --> 00:10:10,742
Det. Kim!

75
00:10:10,742 --> 00:10:12,409
Yes, yes, of course, sir.

76
00:10:12,409 --> 00:10:13,742
Yes, I understand!

77
00:10:13,992 --> 00:10:15,076
Everyone out!

78
00:10:39,951 --> 00:10:41,659
Watch his head.

79
00:10:44,117 --> 00:10:45,701
Thank you so much, sir.

80
00:10:45,992 --> 00:10:47,451
Go to my place.

81
00:10:50,992 --> 00:10:52,867
I’m hungry, let’s go.

82
00:11:07,451 --> 00:11:09,284
So I’m your father?

83
00:11:09,617 --> 00:11:11,117
I didn’t say you were my father.

84
00:11:11,117 --> 00:11:14,076
Now you protest with them
instead of studying?

85
00:11:14,284 --> 00:11:15,784
I wasn’t protesting.

86
00:11:15,826 --> 00:11:17,367
Sir, don’t misunderstand.

87
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:20,367
Your daughter wasn’t protesting,
she just opened the gate for us.

88
00:11:24,992 --> 00:11:27,576
That’s the truth,
I wasn’t protesting at all.

89
00:11:30,742 --> 00:11:32,492
Send them away,

90
00:11:33,784 --> 00:11:35,076
and don’t ever hang out with them.

91
00:11:35,076 --> 00:11:38,117
Yes sir, we won’t hang out
with your daughter!

92
00:11:38,117 --> 00:11:39,451
He’s not my dad!

93
00:11:46,076 --> 00:11:48,034
Tuition fee for this semester.

94
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:56,617
Stay for dinner!

95
00:12:00,784 --> 00:12:02,951
Director Kang called the meeting.

96
00:12:03,284 --> 00:12:05,617
It seems he got grilled
by the president

97
00:12:05,617 --> 00:12:07,992
for not finding who planned
the Washington incident.

98
00:12:07,992 --> 00:12:12,451
Agents of Foreign Unit are active
in cities visited by the President,

99
00:12:12,451 --> 00:12:18,909
and the Domestic Unit is questioning
delegations, to Washington especially.

100
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:23,409
Director is trying to pin
this on Prof. Shin Ki-cheol.

101
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,742
Why him?

102
00:12:25,284 --> 00:12:29,076
He was on the Washington delegation
on an economic mission.

103
00:12:29,242 --> 00:12:33,576
Director Kang says he’s ‘Donglim’,
the leader of an espionage cell.

104
00:12:34,409 --> 00:12:35,617
Donglim?

105
00:12:37,242 --> 00:12:41,576
First, name that professor
as the spy Donglim.

106
00:12:41,909 --> 00:12:45,492
Link him with the assassins
and prepare a report for the president.

107
00:12:45,701 --> 00:12:49,076
But the US hasn’t shared
its intel with us yet,

108
00:12:49,076 --> 00:12:51,617
so proving a connection
with North Korea...

109
00:12:51,617 --> 00:12:52,742
Look, Chief Kim!

110
00:12:52,742 --> 00:12:56,159
They knew all the president’s
movements in advance!

111
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:59,326
Did you investigate the whole
delegation before the US trip?

112
00:12:59,326 --> 00:13:01,326
But you call yourself
the Chief of the Domestic Unit?

113
00:13:01,326 --> 00:13:04,409
This is why the President’s Office
wants to disband the KCIA!

114
00:13:07,117 --> 00:13:09,159
Get his confession now.

115
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:11,701
If you don’t resolve
the Washington incident,

116
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:13,201
you two are done.

117
00:13:13,201 --> 00:13:14,492
Yes, sir.

118
00:13:14,492 --> 00:13:15,826
One more thing...

119
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:18,784
What should we do about 417 Special Forces?

120
00:13:18,784 --> 00:13:20,076
What about it?

121
00:13:20,117 --> 00:13:22,701
The op begins at midnight in 2 days.

122
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:24,951
Then stick to schedule!

123
00:13:24,951 --> 00:13:27,617
It’s an op with very low
chance of success, sir.

124
00:13:27,617 --> 00:13:31,534
Why not use my Foreign agents to
gather intel on the nuclear threat?

125
00:13:31,742 --> 00:13:33,701
You want me to scrap it now?

126
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:36,034
It’s approved by the president!

127
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:37,326
Proceed!

128
00:13:40,201 --> 00:13:44,284
This is the President’s itinerary
for his Japan visit, sign off on it.

129
00:13:55,326 --> 00:13:57,701
Chief of Foreign Unit
Park Pyong-ho

130
00:13:57,742 --> 00:14:00,951
Chief of Foreign Unit Chief of Domestic Unit
Park Pyong-ho Kim Jung-do

131
00:14:02,701 --> 00:14:05,576
He’s a tough nut since
he has the president’s ear.

132
00:14:05,909 --> 00:14:09,534
I’m still not used to this since
I spent my life in the army.

133
00:14:09,784 --> 00:14:11,701
I’d appreciate your guidance.

134
00:14:12,534 --> 00:14:14,201
Speaking of which,

135
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:16,909
My wife told me to invite
my colleagues for dinner,

136
00:14:17,326 --> 00:14:19,534
but my home is too tiny
to invite them all.

137
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,034
Would you like to
join us for dinner?

138
00:14:26,284 --> 00:14:27,451
Certainly.

139
00:14:34,617 --> 00:14:35,992
He’s ripe for picking.

140
00:14:35,992 --> 00:14:38,201
Let’s wrap up
the Donglim case.

141
00:14:38,576 --> 00:14:40,242
Bring him to Room 2.

142
00:14:50,617 --> 00:14:52,034
Afternoon, sir.

143
00:15:01,117 --> 00:15:03,117
You dislocated his shoulder again?

144
00:15:03,826 --> 00:15:07,201
Why keep doing that?
Your job is to break his will.

145
00:15:08,034 --> 00:15:10,242
Dress him
and bring him to Room 2.

146
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,159
Yes, sir.

147
00:15:11,951 --> 00:15:13,242
Lift him up.

148
00:15:13,784 --> 00:15:15,742
Codename, Donglim.

149
00:15:16,117 --> 00:15:19,284
North Korea’s Ministry of the People’s
Armed Forces, 5th Division,

150
00:15:19,284 --> 00:15:23,784
infiltrated the South in 1970,
sociology professor at Horim...

151
00:15:23,784 --> 00:15:25,076
Sir, please...

152
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:29,576
How could I possibly be
a top North Korean spy?

153
00:15:29,992 --> 00:15:31,034
I’m...

154
00:15:31,076 --> 00:15:33,034
I’m not a spy, really!

155
00:15:33,242 --> 00:15:35,784
The government asked me to join
the delegation as a consultant...

156
00:15:35,784 --> 00:15:37,451
I’m done playing nice.

157
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:46,992
The jerks who conspired with you
have all confessed.

158
00:15:47,117 --> 00:15:48,826
They say you’re Donglim!

159
00:15:48,826 --> 00:15:51,284
Who says I am Donglim?

160
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,076
They are setting me up!

161
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,326
Sit!

162
00:15:55,326 --> 00:15:59,409
You leaked the president’s
itinerary to the North,

163
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:01,867
when you went to the US
with the delegation!

164
00:16:01,909 --> 00:16:03,826
To assassinate him!

165
00:16:04,242 --> 00:16:06,367
That’s absurd!

166
00:16:06,576 --> 00:16:08,742
Sir, how could I...

167
00:16:08,784 --> 00:16:10,159
Restrain him!

168
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:14,576
Sir! Please don’t kill me!

169
00:16:14,576 --> 00:16:17,076
He’s gonna kill another one...

170
00:16:56,742 --> 00:16:58,201
Donglim

171
00:16:58,201 --> 00:17:00,076
417 Special Forces

172
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:01,117
Infiltration

173
00:17:05,867 --> 00:17:09,701
Gangnam apartments cost
$30,000 each nowadays.

174
00:17:10,492 --> 00:17:17,326
How’s it possible to con $640 million
without help from top officials?

175
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:20,534
How many apartments
would that buy?

176
00:17:21,034 --> 00:17:23,742
This country is in a dire state.

177
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:27,159
Are you drunk already?
Go easy with the drinks.

178
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:29,784
I want to live here a long time.

179
00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:33,534
I heard you two were
well acquainted.

180
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:38,201
Your husband told you that?

181
00:17:38,201 --> 00:17:40,284
That you worked with him for a bit.

182
00:17:40,284 --> 00:17:41,284
Honey.

183
00:17:41,534 --> 00:17:44,909
What? You said it was awkward
since it’s been so long.

184
00:17:50,992 --> 00:17:52,534
Awkward?

185
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:57,159
Honey, please excuse us.

186
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,034
We have something to discuss.

187
00:17:59,034 --> 00:18:03,951
After the last president’s assassination,
all KCIA agents were detained.

188
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:08,034
He was my interrogator.

189
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:11,701
We were together 10 days or so?

190
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:16,451
The nerves in my hand got severed,
I can’t still use it properly.

191
00:18:16,451 --> 00:18:18,034
Sir, back then...

192
00:18:19,451 --> 00:18:20,951
I’m so sorry.

193
00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:25,867
I shouldn’t have said anything,
I’ll leave you two alone.

194
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:50,534
Yes?

195
00:18:55,784 --> 00:18:57,826
Sorry to call you so late,

196
00:18:57,867 --> 00:19:00,617
but I have an urgent matter
to report, sir.

197
00:19:00,784 --> 00:19:01,909
Go on.

198
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:08,201
The North and Japan are having
unofficial talks on colonial reparations,

199
00:19:08,701 --> 00:19:11,909
and a high-ranking official
wants to defect.

200
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:14,784
Defect? What’s his prize?

201
00:19:14,784 --> 00:19:19,076
A nuclear reactor blueprint,
R&D files and a list of researchers.

202
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:24,617
Good, bring him in before
Japanese intelligence clues in.

203
00:19:24,617 --> 00:19:25,992
Understood, sir...

204
00:19:39,284 --> 00:19:42,492
Tokyo

205
00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:14,492
Hello?

206
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:18,951
Is there someone from
Taeyoung Corp. in Hakone?

207
00:20:19,034 --> 00:20:22,409
Yes, this is Nishigara
from Taeyoung Corp.

208
00:20:23,326 --> 00:20:24,742
Where are you now?

209
00:20:24,742 --> 00:20:28,867
I can’t tell you that,
but we just started moving.

210
00:20:28,867 --> 00:20:29,992
‘We’?

211
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:32,326
I brought my family.

212
00:20:32,326 --> 00:20:35,992
Wait, you never said
anything about your family.

213
00:20:37,826 --> 00:20:40,076
State your name,
affiliation and rank.

214
00:20:40,492 --> 00:20:42,076
I can’t disclose that yet.

215
00:20:42,076 --> 00:20:46,159
You have a mole in your agency,
our safety may be compromised.

216
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,659
I’ll tell you in person.

217
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:52,451
Hello, sir.

218
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:56,409
The exfil route is secure,
so please identify yourself.

219
00:20:56,534 --> 00:20:59,326
I just said there is a mole
in your ranks.

220
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:03,784
I’ll tell you about Donglim tomorrow
when we land in the South.

221
00:21:03,784 --> 00:21:06,117
There cannot be a mole
in our agency.

222
00:21:06,117 --> 00:21:09,076
And Donglim has already
been captured.

223
00:21:09,742 --> 00:21:12,659
If you don’t believe me,
we’ll drop this op.

224
00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:15,284
State your name,
affiliation and rank.

225
00:21:15,784 --> 00:21:19,117
Spec Ops 417 will infiltrate the North
to gather nuclear intel today.

226
00:21:19,117 --> 00:21:22,159
North Korea, West Coast

227
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,034
Donglim informed us
of it last night.

228
00:21:26,784 --> 00:21:27,992
Approaching Point Gamma.

229
00:21:27,992 --> 00:21:29,284
Spec Ops 417, landed.

230
00:21:29,284 --> 00:21:30,451
All in position.

231
00:21:30,451 --> 00:21:32,409
KCIA Operation Center
Commencing op.

232
00:21:32,784 --> 00:21:35,451
If you can’t believe me,
I’ll hang up.

233
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:44,451
Understood. Give us the time
and location for rendezvous.

234
00:21:44,451 --> 00:21:46,284
This is Agent Yang Bo-sung
of Foreign Unit.

235
00:21:46,492 --> 00:21:49,867
417 infil op is compromised,
withdraw now.

236
00:21:49,867 --> 00:21:50,617
What?

237
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:51,909
This is Tokyo.

238
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:54,867
We received this intel from
a North Korean asylum seeker!

239
00:21:57,992 --> 00:22:00,742
All units! Return to base at once!

240
00:22:00,992 --> 00:22:02,576
- Halt op and return at once!
- Nobody move!

241
00:22:21,284 --> 00:22:24,492
We took 8 of your heads!

242
00:22:24,492 --> 00:22:26,576
Stop by any time!

243
00:22:30,701 --> 00:22:31,992
What happened?

244
00:22:33,492 --> 00:22:35,534
They've all been eliminated.

245
00:22:39,076 --> 00:22:44,867
Chief, does this legitimize
the claim of a mole in the agency?

246
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,826
We can’t rely on unverified intel.

247
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:50,367
We will expose the truth today.

248
00:22:58,534 --> 00:23:00,284
They’re on the move.

249
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:02,951
Find the green briefcase,
which one is it?

250
00:23:02,951 --> 00:23:05,492
The gray suit is carrying
a green briefcase.

251
00:23:06,784 --> 00:23:08,117
Isn’t that Director Pyo?

252
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,326
You’re right.

253
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:11,951
He’s a key player in
the nuclear development effort.

254
00:23:11,951 --> 00:23:13,576
Everyone on your toes.

255
00:23:13,576 --> 00:23:15,701
This op has to succeed.

256
00:23:18,076 --> 00:23:19,451
One moment.

257
00:23:22,784 --> 00:23:23,992
I’m changing the plan.

258
00:23:23,992 --> 00:23:26,451
Agent Yang get the family,
and I’ll take the prize.

259
00:23:26,451 --> 00:23:29,617
I repeat, Yang go for the family,
I’ll take the prize!

260
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:30,534
Chief,

261
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,201
if you change now,
we'll all get crossed up.

262
00:23:33,201 --> 00:23:35,867
In case of emergency,
leave the family and support me.

263
00:23:35,867 --> 00:23:36,867
The prize comes first.

264
00:23:36,867 --> 00:23:37,867
Initiate!

265
00:23:39,242 --> 00:23:40,951
Says who, dammit!

266
00:23:47,617 --> 00:23:49,201
Agent Yang, what are you doing?!

267
00:23:49,242 --> 00:23:50,242
Listen up!

268
00:23:50,284 --> 00:23:52,659
We are sticking with the HQ’s plan!

269
00:23:53,034 --> 00:23:54,451
Stick to the original plan!

270
00:23:57,826 --> 00:23:59,534
Turn the car around!

271
00:24:00,367 --> 00:24:01,409
Agent Yang!

272
00:24:01,576 --> 00:24:05,159
The Director said intel on
Donglim is our top priority!

273
00:24:05,367 --> 00:24:06,284
Agent Yang!

274
00:24:09,951 --> 00:24:11,326
Listen up everyone.

275
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:14,409
When we complete this mission,
everyone will get promoted!

276
00:24:14,701 --> 00:24:16,326
Trust me on this.

277
00:24:34,326 --> 00:24:36,242
Where are you going?

278
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:39,076
Taeyoung Corp. in Hakone.

279
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:55,701
Get in!

280
00:25:01,201 --> 00:25:01,742
What are you doing?!

281
00:25:01,742 --> 00:25:02,826
I’m leading this op.

282
00:25:02,826 --> 00:25:05,867
Intel first, what do you know
about Donglim?

283
00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:08,534
I said I’ll tell you
once we arrive in South Korea.

284
00:25:08,576 --> 00:25:11,784
Spec Ops 417 was
wiped out yesterday.

285
00:25:12,117 --> 00:25:14,117
Intel on the mole first.

286
00:25:14,117 --> 00:25:17,034
Is this the best South Korea can do?

287
00:25:17,034 --> 00:25:18,201
Open the door now!

288
00:25:18,201 --> 00:25:21,826
If you don’t tell me,
we’ll pull out immediately.

289
00:25:22,867 --> 00:25:25,201
Why isn’t he letting him in?

290
00:25:25,909 --> 00:25:30,367
On October 15, 1982, Osaka,
and May 11, 1983, Tokyo,

291
00:25:30,367 --> 00:25:34,326
he met North Korea 35
Chief Li Yong-su.

292
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,617
Cross reference it with
flight logs of your agents.

293
00:25:37,617 --> 00:25:39,784
We learned all your top secrets
through him,

294
00:25:39,784 --> 00:25:41,201
he’s Donglim.

295
00:25:41,451 --> 00:25:42,867
Open the door!

296
00:25:42,867 --> 00:25:44,409
Comrade Pyo!

297
00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:53,659
Stop!

298
00:25:54,742 --> 00:25:55,659
Open fire!

299
00:26:30,492 --> 00:26:31,492
Chief!

300
00:26:31,534 --> 00:26:34,409
The prize and Agent Yang
are trapped at the scene!

301
00:26:34,451 --> 00:26:36,701
Agent Yang is shot
and stuck in his vehicle!

302
00:26:36,742 --> 00:26:38,242
What should we do?

303
00:26:44,951 --> 00:26:46,826
Wait, what are you doing?!

304
00:26:47,867 --> 00:26:49,701
Get out! Out!

305
00:26:50,992 --> 00:26:52,326
Please don’t do this!

306
00:26:52,326 --> 00:26:53,617
- Where’s my husband?
- I’m sorry.

307
00:26:53,617 --> 00:26:55,867
Please don’t abandon us!

308
00:26:56,367 --> 00:26:57,617
Listen to me!

309
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:17,576
Tell them our location! Hurry!

310
00:27:28,242 --> 00:27:29,201
Watch out!

311
00:28:30,867 --> 00:28:31,992
Come out, quick!

312
00:28:34,742 --> 00:28:36,492
Agent Yang first!

313
00:28:52,826 --> 00:28:54,117
Agent Yang!

314
00:28:54,117 --> 00:28:55,701
Wake up, sir!

315
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:58,867
Sir! Agent Yang!

316
00:29:15,576 --> 00:29:17,576
Are you really not hurt?

317
00:29:18,409 --> 00:29:21,742
Director was summoned
and got his ass whipped.

318
00:29:21,784 --> 00:29:24,451
Things are tense
because of the botched Pyo op.

319
00:29:24,451 --> 00:29:29,117
Also, the president’s Japanese summit
is confirmed, top secret.

320
00:29:32,201 --> 00:29:33,409
Chief.

321
00:29:35,201 --> 00:29:39,867
The intel about Donglim being
a KCIA mole, is it credible?

322
00:29:47,784 --> 00:29:52,034
How can you botch every op
the president approves?

323
00:29:52,034 --> 00:29:55,451
Fuck, what am I doing
with these amateurs?

324
00:29:56,617 --> 00:29:59,034
Resign now, you morons!

325
00:29:59,909 --> 00:30:01,451
Get the fuck out!

326
00:30:08,242 --> 00:30:09,534
What do you want?

327
00:30:09,867 --> 00:30:12,117
Spec Ops 417

328
00:30:12,284 --> 00:30:15,492
was massacred
due to your bad judgment.

329
00:30:15,492 --> 00:30:16,701
What the fuck?

330
00:30:16,701 --> 00:30:20,867
And why give two conflicting
orders for the Pyo op?

331
00:30:21,617 --> 00:30:24,742
You told me to retrieve him,
why give the agents other orders?

332
00:30:24,742 --> 00:30:25,742
You son of a bitch!

333
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:31,617
We lost two agents
and Director Pyo,

334
00:30:32,034 --> 00:30:36,742
and Agent Yang is
gravely wounded, in a coma.

335
00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:40,826
The 417 and Pyo ops,

336
00:30:40,826 --> 00:30:42,784
you fucked them all up.

337
00:30:42,784 --> 00:30:45,659
Are you out of
your goddamn mind?!

338
00:30:46,492 --> 00:30:49,409
This is the list of
all the bribes you’ve taken.

339
00:30:50,242 --> 00:30:52,784
Agents risk their lives in the field,

340
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:55,784
but the KCIA Director
fattens himself on bribes.

341
00:30:58,701 --> 00:31:04,367
We kept this agency alive
until you came along.

342
00:31:05,492 --> 00:31:08,576
How would the president
react to this?

343
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,367
Take the bullet and
retire with your honor.

344
00:31:12,909 --> 00:31:17,367
Won’t it be wiser to keep
the money you stole thus far?

345
00:31:17,867 --> 00:31:19,117
Park Pyong-ho!

346
00:31:20,034 --> 00:31:21,867
How dare you investigate me?

347
00:31:23,617 --> 00:31:26,617
This is a recording of you
and those businessmen.

348
00:31:28,451 --> 00:31:31,284
You’ve got a week to clear out.

349
00:31:51,867 --> 00:31:54,576
Who said anything about revolution?
We’re after reform!

350
00:31:54,576 --> 00:31:56,284
We can’t be cornered as left wingers!

351
00:31:56,284 --> 00:31:58,076
The public won’t listen to us!

352
00:31:58,076 --> 00:32:00,659
When on earth can you achieve that?

353
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:03,034
After we’re all dead?

354
00:32:03,034 --> 00:32:05,367
Yoo-jung, you tell us,
is he right or am I?

355
00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:06,826
Speak up. Who’s right?

356
00:32:06,867 --> 00:32:09,576
Let’s just go.
Yoo-jung, come on.

357
00:32:09,617 --> 00:32:11,492
You son of a bitch!
Where you going?!

358
00:32:11,617 --> 00:32:14,659
We came here to find a solution,
why are you leaving?!

359
00:32:14,659 --> 00:32:15,951
Bring him over here!

360
00:32:15,951 --> 00:32:18,034
Back off... Damn you...

361
00:32:20,534 --> 00:32:22,367
Bastard, how could you
throw that at a friend?

362
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:27,076
Stop it! Just stop it!

363
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,284
Thank you, sir.

364
00:32:47,451 --> 00:32:49,159
Where are you going?

365
00:32:51,284 --> 00:32:53,117
I need another drink.

366
00:33:15,242 --> 00:33:16,742
That’s enough.

367
00:33:18,867 --> 00:33:22,534
They say a dictator’s pawns
are worse than the dictator.

368
00:33:26,534 --> 00:33:28,534
A dictator’s pawn...

369
00:33:34,451 --> 00:33:38,992
I don’t care what you do,
but don’t hang around bad guys.

370
00:33:40,117 --> 00:33:42,701
Don’t let me regret bringing you here.

371
00:33:44,284 --> 00:33:45,742
Bad guys?

372
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:49,451
Who’s worse?

373
00:33:52,326 --> 00:33:55,076
How long have you
worked for the agency?

374
00:34:02,617 --> 00:34:04,034
13 years.

375
00:34:08,242 --> 00:34:10,492
The world is changing,

376
00:34:12,534 --> 00:34:14,284
but it’s still so stupid...

377
00:34:23,451 --> 00:34:25,201
3 years ago, Tokyo

378
00:34:25,201 --> 00:34:27,409
What took you so long?

379
00:34:27,617 --> 00:34:30,076
A pun quiz for you.

380
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:33,117
Wars that take place in space?

381
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:35,951
‘Star Wars’.

382
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:39,034
A war that takes place
in the winter?

383
00:34:39,451 --> 00:34:40,867
‘Cold War’.

384
00:34:41,076 --> 00:34:45,451
What’s a war that never ends?

385
00:34:48,492 --> 00:34:50,284
‘Korean War’.

386
00:34:53,784 --> 00:34:55,534
That’s funny?

387
00:34:55,576 --> 00:34:58,326
Laugh for once,
it’s called a joke.

388
00:34:58,367 --> 00:34:59,617
Practice,

389
00:34:59,909 --> 00:35:02,617
you’re way too serious.

390
00:35:04,742 --> 00:35:07,242
I’ve been wanting to get away
from everything lately.

391
00:35:08,242 --> 00:35:10,076
That’s a great idea.

392
00:35:13,742 --> 00:35:15,201
Where to though?

393
00:35:25,451 --> 00:35:26,742
He’s here, we’re on!

394
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:30,784
I always wondered where
that beast disappeared to,

395
00:35:30,784 --> 00:35:32,201
but in the end,
it’s all about love.

396
00:35:32,242 --> 00:35:34,701
Gotta hand it to your intuition.

397
00:35:37,909 --> 00:35:39,576
Stay right behind me!

398
00:35:51,117 --> 00:35:52,617
Won-sik!

399
00:35:53,701 --> 00:35:55,284
Pyong-ho...

400
00:35:56,492 --> 00:35:58,117
I’m sorry...

401
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:01,534
Soon, someone else will come.

402
00:36:19,617 --> 00:36:21,117
Is that Dad?

403
00:36:24,867 --> 00:36:26,451
How old are you?

404
00:36:44,659 --> 00:36:45,784
Yes?

405
00:36:46,034 --> 00:36:48,242
- Sir, it’s Ju-kyung.
- Yeah.

406
00:36:48,492 --> 00:36:51,492
The new director is
the president’s chief secretary.

407
00:36:53,826 --> 00:36:59,034
Mr. President said, if the KCIA
does not reform, it need not exist.

408
00:36:59,034 --> 00:37:05,576
Our priority must be capturing
North Korean spies who provoke us.

409
00:37:05,784 --> 00:37:09,409
$10,000 reward and
special promotion will be given

410
00:37:09,409 --> 00:37:12,159
to any agent with
outstanding performance.

411
00:37:20,992 --> 00:37:24,617
Don’t kill me!
I’ll do what you ask!

412
00:37:25,909 --> 00:37:27,492
Stay right there.

413
00:37:30,784 --> 00:37:32,159
That’s enough.

414
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:33,617
Let’s call it a day.

415
00:37:35,034 --> 00:37:38,076
What’s the matter?
We’re almost there.

416
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:42,159
I said that’s enough!

417
00:37:43,784 --> 00:37:45,201
Let’s go home.

418
00:37:47,451 --> 00:37:49,201
Let the kids sleep.

419
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:02,367
A long day?

420
00:38:04,076 --> 00:38:05,367
Get some sleep...

421
00:38:08,409 --> 00:38:12,034
I’m assigned to KCIA
starting next week.

422
00:38:13,576 --> 00:38:17,409
I’ll report through
CEO Choi at Jupiter Corporation.

423
00:38:18,451 --> 00:38:19,992
- Salute!
- Yes, sir! 3 years ago, Gwangju

424
00:38:20,034 --> 00:38:21,159
3 years ago, Gwangju

425
00:38:21,201 --> 00:38:23,034
The commander is approaching!

426
00:38:25,867 --> 00:38:29,409
We got the green light to open fire.
Wipe them all out!

427
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:48,617
Major Kim, it’s been a while!

428
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:50,492
Congratulations on your promotion.

429
00:38:50,909 --> 00:38:54,576
Pretty cushy working
as a public servant?

430
00:38:55,076 --> 00:38:57,492
How long has it been?

431
00:38:57,701 --> 00:38:59,992
4 months now, sir.
It’s worse than hell.

432
00:38:59,992 --> 00:39:01,034
Sit!

433
00:39:02,034 --> 00:39:05,367
Do you know why
the president sent me?

434
00:39:08,534 --> 00:39:10,701
KCIA has gotten too soft!

435
00:39:10,951 --> 00:39:14,201
Government agencies and press
must embrace his governing ethos

436
00:39:14,409 --> 00:39:17,826
for him to relax, is that so hard?

437
00:39:18,284 --> 00:39:19,659
It will be done, sir.

438
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:22,117
Let’s go one step at a time.

439
00:39:23,034 --> 00:39:26,076
I looked over the reports.
We got a mole situation?

440
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:28,451
Donglim?

441
00:39:28,701 --> 00:39:31,784
It’s not verified, sir.

442
00:39:32,034 --> 00:39:35,784
If major ops are failing,
there’s an underlying problem.

443
00:39:37,034 --> 00:39:38,367
Am I right?

444
00:39:40,867 --> 00:39:43,117
What is this?

445
00:39:43,617 --> 00:39:46,534
Dates when Donglim
contacted someone in Japan.

446
00:39:47,076 --> 00:39:52,076
Yang relayed that intel to
my predecessor after the incident.

447
00:39:53,492 --> 00:39:56,826
Cross reference it with everyone
in the Pyo op.

448
00:39:56,909 --> 00:39:58,409
The Foreign Unit?

449
00:39:58,617 --> 00:40:00,659
It’s not my team, how could I...?

450
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:05,034
That’s why want you to do it.

451
00:40:06,784 --> 00:40:11,867
Where there’s smoke,
there’s fire.

452
00:40:13,909 --> 00:40:15,659
Strip them naked.

453
00:40:17,659 --> 00:40:19,159
Yes, sir.

454
00:40:20,909 --> 00:40:22,659
Donglim

455
00:40:22,659 --> 00:40:24,117
Tokyo Op Agents

456
00:40:24,117 --> 00:40:26,659
Chief of Team 1
Park Pyong-ho

457
00:40:28,992 --> 00:40:30,076
Yes.

458
00:40:30,742 --> 00:40:32,409
Wait, right now?

459
00:40:33,701 --> 00:40:35,034
Yes, sir.

460
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:40,242
Chief Kim is investigating
all agents from the Pyo op.

461
00:40:41,117 --> 00:40:43,242
Must be Director Ahn’s order.

462
00:40:50,076 --> 00:40:55,659
Why didn’t Agent Yang drive off
with Pyo after making contact?

463
00:40:56,201 --> 00:41:01,117
Our West German bureau fell for
a North Korean plot last year.

464
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:05,617
Many men got fired,
so now we verify ID and intel on site.

465
00:41:06,909 --> 00:41:09,951
Donglim popped up on our radar
since mid ‘70s,

466
00:41:09,992 --> 00:41:11,576
but he never fully surfaced.

467
00:41:11,617 --> 00:41:14,576
Donglim may not even exist!

468
00:41:14,784 --> 00:41:20,076
Maybe they want to throw us off
by planting the idea of a mole!

469
00:41:21,951 --> 00:41:25,867
Agent Yang drew up
and led all ops in Japan.

470
00:41:26,076 --> 00:41:27,909
He’s the head of Japanese...

471
00:41:27,909 --> 00:41:29,992
Okay, dammit! I’m Donglim!

472
00:41:30,201 --> 00:41:33,992
Chief Kim is Donglim,
you’re Donglim! We’re all him!

473
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:40,117
You made anyone into spies,
now you suspect your own?

474
00:41:40,117 --> 00:41:43,117
Check your own
unit first, assholes!

475
00:41:43,742 --> 00:41:45,117
That fucking bastard.

476
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:48,492
What? What can you do?
What do you have on me?!

477
00:41:51,201 --> 00:41:54,909
Agent Yang probably got
intel about Donglim from Pyo.

478
00:41:54,909 --> 00:41:59,159
He kept trying to call
the former Director before passing out.

479
00:41:59,576 --> 00:42:03,117
What if Yang intentionally
sabotaged the op,

480
00:42:03,117 --> 00:42:05,242
and his intel isn’t credible?

481
00:42:05,409 --> 00:42:08,534
Are you implying
Agent Yang is Donglim?

482
00:42:09,951 --> 00:42:11,076
That’s insane.

483
00:42:12,076 --> 00:42:13,576
What the hell is going on?!

484
00:42:13,576 --> 00:42:17,451
Who authorized this?
You have no jurisdiction!

485
00:42:19,117 --> 00:42:21,326
It’s an order from the director.

486
00:42:21,742 --> 00:42:24,784
Donglim was part of the Pyo op?

487
00:42:25,117 --> 00:42:27,951
I’ve worked with all these men
for at least 5 years!

488
00:42:28,117 --> 00:42:30,826
We got a complaint from
Japanese Foreign Affairs.

489
00:42:30,867 --> 00:42:34,826
They want us to investigate
and make an official apology.

490
00:42:35,242 --> 00:42:39,992
If you don’t comply, I’ll put you
on top of the suspect list.

491
00:42:43,409 --> 00:42:45,784
I’ll report to the director myself.

492
00:42:46,034 --> 00:42:47,617
Stop this witch hunt.

493
00:42:47,826 --> 00:42:49,576
Guys, come on out!

494
00:42:49,576 --> 00:42:50,242
Chief!

495
00:42:50,242 --> 00:42:51,867
Don’t you dare!

496
00:42:56,451 --> 00:42:57,492
We got an emergency!

497
00:42:57,492 --> 00:43:00,242
A North Korean fighter jet has
entered South Korean airspace!

498
00:43:14,034 --> 00:43:16,159
This is the Office of Civil Defense,
attention please.

499
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:18,534
This is a security alert to
all regions including Seoul

500
00:43:18,534 --> 00:43:19,909
This is a live situation.

501
00:43:19,909 --> 00:43:23,909
A North Korean fighter jet has entered
South Korea over the west coast.

502
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:50,951
He knew all about our missile
and air defense systems,

503
00:43:50,992 --> 00:43:52,617
so it was easy for him to defect.

504
00:43:52,617 --> 00:43:54,034
What a joke.

505
00:43:54,617 --> 00:43:57,451
All our security measures
are open to the commies.

506
00:44:01,826 --> 00:44:06,409
Damn, this is amazing!

507
00:44:06,409 --> 00:44:09,367
It’s beyond my imagination.

508
00:44:11,201 --> 00:44:14,367
I found ramyun packaging
on a beach near the base.

509
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:20,409
I thought, so that’s how noodles are
sold down South, and read the label.

510
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,951
I wondered if it was real.

511
00:44:24,326 --> 00:44:29,409
‘Damaged or expired products
can be exchanged.’

512
00:44:30,742 --> 00:44:37,159
Southerners care about the convenience
of people over such a small thing.

513
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:41,201
It really is a land of the people!

514
00:44:43,492 --> 00:44:45,242
So he just took a fighter jet
and defected?

515
00:44:45,242 --> 00:44:47,284
Give me a cigarette.

516
00:44:47,909 --> 00:44:50,242
This is why I can’t trust soldiers.

517
00:44:51,784 --> 00:44:53,659
Speaking of which...

518
00:44:56,159 --> 00:44:58,826
Dates when Donglim
made contact in Japan.

519
00:44:59,242 --> 00:45:01,784
Strip Chief Kim’s men.

520
00:45:13,409 --> 00:45:16,451
Southern cigarettes
sure taste smoother.

521
00:45:16,659 --> 00:45:19,701
If that’s out of your system,
let’s get to the main topic.

522
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:22,076
Why’d you come here?

523
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:26,326
I came to this land of the free...

524
00:45:26,326 --> 00:45:28,242
No, not that.

525
00:45:31,701 --> 00:45:34,201
Why’d you betray your country?

526
00:45:37,576 --> 00:45:38,826
What?

527
00:45:39,826 --> 00:45:41,617
What did you say?

528
00:45:42,576 --> 00:45:43,826
Betray?

529
00:45:46,492 --> 00:45:48,451
I’m a traitor?

530
00:45:49,409 --> 00:45:52,826
You’re just a government
ass licker!

531
00:45:52,867 --> 00:45:54,159
You son of a bitch!

532
00:45:55,784 --> 00:45:57,617
Fucking bastard.

533
00:46:16,409 --> 00:46:23,409
I can’t fucking believe I get called
a traitor by South Koreans.

534
00:46:25,451 --> 00:46:29,576
I love my country and my people.

535
00:46:30,451 --> 00:46:38,117
But the current leadership
is deceiving us all.

536
00:46:41,867 --> 00:46:46,659
The son inheriting the people’s party?
Even a dog would laugh.

537
00:46:46,659 --> 00:46:49,534
Will you stop making speeches?

538
00:46:49,909 --> 00:46:51,992
It’s the truth.

539
00:46:52,492 --> 00:46:55,034
What do you want me to do then?

540
00:46:55,367 --> 00:46:57,159
You know very well,

541
00:46:58,076 --> 00:47:00,576
what intel would be useful to us.

542
00:47:02,867 --> 00:47:07,242
I knew you’d say that.

543
00:47:07,826 --> 00:47:10,409
Pay for the ramyun, huh?

544
00:47:11,909 --> 00:47:13,492
Bring me my notepad.

545
00:47:18,117 --> 00:47:25,451
You probably couldn’t decode
recent encrypted broadcasts or messages.

546
00:47:26,826 --> 00:47:32,784
We adopted Russia’s newest cipher
for added security.

547
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:36,117
This is it.

548
00:47:38,034 --> 00:47:44,867
We dispatched more covert operatives
to the South for a big event.

549
00:47:46,951 --> 00:47:49,701
A few will be in here too!

550
00:47:52,909 --> 00:47:55,576
Use this to reel them in.

551
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:03,742
Activate 48-hour Code 3
to capture the mole.

552
00:48:03,909 --> 00:48:05,451
Yes, sir, right away.

553
00:48:06,951 --> 00:48:08,992
I hate stones left unturned.

554
00:48:10,492 --> 00:48:11,951
Let’s do this right.

555
00:48:19,534 --> 00:48:21,076
This is an emergency notice.

556
00:48:21,076 --> 00:48:23,159
As of 20:23 hours,

557
00:48:23,159 --> 00:48:27,451
we are under Code 3
for the next 48 hours.

558
00:48:29,701 --> 00:48:31,909
The director wants us to
dig into Chief Kim’s men.

559
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,492
I’ll get on it!

560
00:48:34,034 --> 00:48:35,742
This is Unit Chief Park Pyong-ho.

561
00:48:36,367 --> 00:48:39,742
From now on,
bring new intel to me first.

562
00:48:39,742 --> 00:48:41,242
Yes, sir.

563
00:48:42,617 --> 00:48:44,659
Chief Kim wants the intel first,

564
00:48:44,659 --> 00:48:47,409
and so does Chief Park...

565
00:48:47,409 --> 00:48:50,992
So who do we line up with?

566
00:48:51,034 --> 00:48:53,201
Goddamn, they’re at it again.

567
00:49:24,784 --> 00:49:26,034
Chief Kim.

568
00:49:29,076 --> 00:49:31,034
Dead Drop Location Analysis

569
00:49:31,076 --> 00:49:33,159
Everyone move to
the exposed spots, now!

570
00:49:33,451 --> 00:49:36,242
Dead drop A,
Sinjung Mountain, 150-9.

571
00:49:36,242 --> 00:49:39,117
Dead drop B,
Sangbong 481-3.

572
00:49:39,117 --> 00:49:41,701
Dead drop C,
Hongje Mountain 47...

573
00:49:44,742 --> 00:49:45,784
Chief Park.

574
00:49:46,659 --> 00:49:48,951
Current assessment, sir.

575
00:49:49,826 --> 00:49:50,951
Over here! Here!

576
00:50:03,909 --> 00:50:08,659
There was a delivery mishap case of
$60,000 at police department.

577
00:50:08,701 --> 00:50:12,701
And Chief Kim transferred
the investigation to our agency,

578
00:50:12,701 --> 00:50:14,284
but the suspect never arrived here.

579
00:50:14,284 --> 00:50:16,326
Where was the money headed?

580
00:50:16,326 --> 00:50:19,826
A military supply contractor
called Jupiter Corp.

581
00:50:20,326 --> 00:50:22,576
Should I dig further?

582
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:29,242
This arrived as soon as
the president signed off on it.

583
00:50:29,242 --> 00:50:31,826
So when is the president
leaving for Japan?

584
00:50:31,826 --> 00:50:33,076
On the 6th next month.

585
00:50:33,076 --> 00:50:35,826
What if the plan fails again,
like in Washington?

586
00:50:35,826 --> 00:50:38,117
I’ll take care of it myself.

587
00:50:38,409 --> 00:50:41,701
The pro-democracy movement is
spreading to the general public.

588
00:50:41,701 --> 00:50:45,951
If they declare martial law again,
it won’t be easy for us to mobilize.

589
00:50:45,992 --> 00:50:48,534
I agree with that.

590
00:50:49,034 --> 00:50:50,159
Let’s proceed.

591
00:50:50,201 --> 00:50:53,742
The 6th next month in Tokyo.
Let’s do it then.

592
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:03,034
Thanks to ongoing support
from the military,

593
00:51:03,034 --> 00:51:06,409
Jupiter Corp grew exponentially
to a medium size enterprise.

594
00:51:06,409 --> 00:51:09,659
Let’s all raise a glass to that.

595
00:51:09,867 --> 00:51:13,659
When I say ‘We are’,
shout ‘family!’

596
00:51:14,284 --> 00:51:16,951
- We are!
- Family!

597
00:51:19,492 --> 00:51:20,867
Thank you, thank you.

598
00:51:43,117 --> 00:51:44,701
A bicycle heading in.

599
00:51:49,451 --> 00:51:51,159
Black poncho confirmed.

600
00:52:07,826 --> 00:52:08,784
Chun

601
00:52:08,784 --> 00:52:09,784
Bo

602
00:52:09,784 --> 00:52:10,742
San

603
00:52:10,742 --> 00:52:11,659
Chun Bo-san

604
00:52:27,701 --> 00:52:30,784
He came here after taking
a package from Dead Drop D.

605
00:52:30,784 --> 00:52:33,617
It’s been 20 minutes,
and no contacts so far.

606
00:52:35,367 --> 00:52:36,742
How many inside?

607
00:52:36,742 --> 00:52:38,242
No one went in, sir.

608
00:52:40,076 --> 00:52:42,534
Good, we move in immediately.

609
00:53:16,284 --> 00:53:17,201
Dammit!

610
00:53:17,201 --> 00:53:18,909
Get upstairs! Go!

611
00:53:52,367 --> 00:53:53,534
Agent Jang!

612
00:54:36,409 --> 00:54:38,409
Top Secret

613
00:54:40,576 --> 00:54:42,617
President’s Itinerary
for Korea-Japan Summit

614
00:54:51,284 --> 00:54:54,742
Intelligence Bureau 225
North Korea

615
00:55:01,367 --> 00:55:03,742
Top Secret Document

616
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:06,826
Korea-Japan Summit

617
00:55:06,826 --> 00:55:09,201
Intel gathered by Donglim

618
00:55:46,701 --> 00:55:47,784
Chief,

619
00:55:48,034 --> 00:55:51,784
Jupiter’s military transactions
went up by 600% in 2 years.

620
00:55:52,451 --> 00:55:57,242
Chief Kim seems closely
involved with the organization.

621
00:55:57,409 --> 00:56:00,951
If we get a ledger from Jupiter Corp,
we may find something.

622
00:56:02,784 --> 00:56:04,242
Also...

623
00:56:04,992 --> 00:56:10,951
Kim has widened the investigation
to anyone who flew out of the country,

624
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:13,076
and in it,

625
00:56:13,701 --> 00:56:16,492
he included you as his next target.

626
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:22,284
Kim Jung-do, that son of a bitch.

627
00:56:23,367 --> 00:56:25,659
We hit Jupiter Corp today.

628
00:56:32,201 --> 00:56:33,701
Arrest CEO Choi first!

629
00:56:33,951 --> 00:56:35,284
Search everything!

630
00:56:38,867 --> 00:56:40,409
Who are you?!

631
00:56:40,742 --> 00:56:42,284
Where are you from?

632
00:56:42,909 --> 00:56:44,492
The KCIA, asshole!

633
00:56:44,492 --> 00:56:45,909
Arrest this fucker.

634
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,242
Push through!

635
00:56:57,784 --> 00:56:59,159
Burn them all!

636
00:57:12,076 --> 00:57:13,284
Who are you?!

637
00:57:15,492 --> 00:57:17,076
Who the hell are you?!

638
00:57:19,951 --> 00:57:21,492
Let go of me, asshole!

639
00:57:23,326 --> 00:57:24,951
CEO Choi,

640
00:57:25,701 --> 00:57:27,742
you know Chief Kim Jung-do, right?

641
00:57:27,742 --> 00:57:30,742
What? Who are you people?

642
00:57:30,742 --> 00:57:33,992
You’ve supplied the military
since 1980, with his help.

643
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:37,284
I don’t know!
I don’t fucking know!

644
00:57:43,409 --> 00:57:45,659
Peaceful Revolution #1

645
00:57:52,659 --> 00:57:54,826
A call from the President’s Office.

646
00:57:54,826 --> 00:57:57,659
The Japan summit is cancelled
due to the Laundry incident,

647
00:57:58,326 --> 00:58:00,409
but the president’s Asia tour
will proceed, sir.

648
00:58:02,451 --> 00:58:04,951
This is very serious.

649
00:58:05,242 --> 00:58:07,576
If something so
top secret was leaked,

650
00:58:07,576 --> 00:58:09,867
it means the mole is
a high-ranking officer.

651
00:58:10,617 --> 00:58:13,659
Agent Yang was in charge
of the Pyo op,

652
00:58:13,659 --> 00:58:16,284
but Park tried to take over
and ruined it.

653
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:19,784
I hear he’s digging up dirt on you.

654
00:58:22,284 --> 00:58:24,992
He raided a military supplier
called Jupiter Corp today,

655
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:28,576
and arrested its CEO,
but hasn’t brought him here.

656
00:58:29,034 --> 00:58:32,617
He may try to make it seem
like Donglim is in our unit.

657
00:58:33,617 --> 00:58:36,326
Sir, we can’t just sit and watch.

658
00:58:36,534 --> 00:58:38,826
We have to strike first.

659
00:58:42,826 --> 00:58:46,576
Put 24/7 surveillance
on Park immediately.

660
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:58,742
Begin.

661
00:58:59,326 --> 00:59:01,409
Keep going until you hear
Kim Jung-do’s name.

662
00:59:01,617 --> 00:59:02,701
Son of a bitch!

663
00:59:27,284 --> 00:59:30,117
The president’s Japan Summit
has been cancelled.

664
00:59:30,117 --> 00:59:32,284
Abort all ops.

665
00:59:32,534 --> 00:59:36,659
Before that, KCIA’s Chief Park
took CEO Choi away.

666
00:59:36,867 --> 00:59:38,909
I know, just stop all active ops.

667
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,659
I’ll take out Park Pyong-ho.

668
00:59:42,451 --> 00:59:45,409
No, not Park.
Take out CEO Choi.

669
00:59:57,409 --> 00:59:58,826
What did you say?!

670
00:59:58,992 --> 01:00:00,534
CEO Choi won’t be able to
withstand the torture.

671
01:00:00,576 --> 01:00:01,701
How dare you?!

672
01:00:01,701 --> 01:00:05,034
If he blows our cover,
we’re all in danger.

673
01:00:52,242 --> 01:00:54,242
You met them too.

674
01:00:54,742 --> 01:00:58,617
They were taken in 2 weeks ago,
please help.

675
01:00:58,826 --> 01:01:00,742
You said it was an emergency,

676
01:01:01,076 --> 01:01:02,992
and ask about this petty thing?

677
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:04,367
Petty?

678
01:01:05,326 --> 01:01:09,034
Their families don’t know
if they’re alive or dead...

679
01:01:09,159 --> 01:01:09,951
Pyong-ho!

680
01:01:09,992 --> 01:01:11,409
What is wrong with you?!

681
01:01:11,409 --> 01:01:14,201
You know what happens
when they take you away.

682
01:01:14,492 --> 01:01:16,742
If you’re going to act up,
don’t call me.

683
01:01:36,284 --> 01:01:38,409
You two, grab the honey pot!

684
01:01:41,201 --> 01:01:42,659
Name, Harada Hitomi.

685
01:01:42,659 --> 01:01:45,992
From North Korea
she came through Osaka

686
01:01:46,034 --> 01:01:48,409
and entered South Korea
3 years ago,

687
01:01:48,409 --> 01:01:51,284
disguised as transfer student
Cho Yoo-jung.

688
01:01:51,284 --> 01:01:53,534
Her father Cho Won-sik
was Park’s informant,

689
01:01:53,576 --> 01:01:55,617
when he was chief of
Tokyo branch 4 years ago.

690
01:01:55,659 --> 01:01:58,284
Cho is currently missing,
his family unaccounted for.

691
01:01:58,284 --> 01:02:00,784
Are you absolutely sure?

692
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:04,117
We’re going up against
Park Pyong-ho.

693
01:02:04,701 --> 01:02:07,367
This is our chance
to get him for sure.

694
01:02:07,701 --> 01:02:10,284
Let’s carve him up.

695
01:02:11,534 --> 01:02:20,909
Why hide that you attended
North Korean schools in Japan?

696
01:02:22,492 --> 01:02:28,076
I didn’t want people to think
I was a commie.

697
01:02:30,367 --> 01:02:32,242
Is that so?

698
01:02:33,742 --> 01:02:37,076
All right, tell me,

699
01:02:38,826 --> 01:02:40,534
why did you hide it?

700
01:02:40,951 --> 01:02:44,409
I only went there to learn Korean,

701
01:02:45,284 --> 01:02:47,201
I’m not a commie.

702
01:02:47,909 --> 01:02:51,409
Fucking bitch,
can you hear yourself?

703
01:02:52,659 --> 01:02:55,659
You hid it because
you’re a fucking commie.

704
01:02:57,409 --> 01:02:58,492
Look here.

705
01:02:58,659 --> 01:03:01,576
We got you fleeing from the scene.

706
01:03:01,826 --> 01:03:05,492
The evidence we have is
enough to get you hanged.

707
01:03:05,992 --> 01:03:10,826
You trained at the North Korean
Labor Party’s special facility

708
01:03:10,992 --> 01:03:15,117
to become a next-gen spy,
codename Chun Bo-san.

709
01:03:15,534 --> 01:03:21,242
You infiltrated through Japan
and together with other spies,

710
01:03:21,867 --> 01:03:24,826
plotted to overthrow South Korea!

711
01:03:25,617 --> 01:03:27,367
Am I right?!

712
01:03:32,492 --> 01:03:36,492
Kim must’ve lost his mind
after our raid on Jupiter.

713
01:03:42,034 --> 01:03:45,034
There’s no evidence
Cho Won-sik was your father,

714
01:03:45,284 --> 01:03:47,576
why do you keep insisting?

715
01:03:47,826 --> 01:03:50,326
Detaining an innocent person,

716
01:03:50,992 --> 01:03:55,659
and framing me for
something I didn’t do is illegal.

717
01:03:56,117 --> 01:03:58,826
Shit, I went too easy
on this commie bitch.

718
01:03:59,326 --> 01:03:59,992
Hold her down.

719
01:04:20,492 --> 01:04:21,617
Everyone out.

720
01:04:24,534 --> 01:04:25,659
Now.

721
01:04:29,867 --> 01:04:31,367
Everyone out.

722
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:34,784
Kim, you’re investigating me?

723
01:04:35,826 --> 01:04:37,117
Sir,

724
01:04:38,409 --> 01:04:41,117
how deep have you
looked into her?

725
01:04:41,367 --> 01:04:42,701
Cho Yoo-jung.

726
01:04:42,742 --> 01:04:45,659
Who helped you transfer
to university in Korea in 1980?

727
01:04:45,909 --> 01:04:47,826
The man in front of you, right?

728
01:04:48,159 --> 01:04:50,701
So, you’ll make her
into a spy and tie me to her?

729
01:04:50,701 --> 01:04:53,159
We believe she’s Chun Bo-san.

730
01:04:53,867 --> 01:04:56,076
Therefore, she must know
who Donglim is.

731
01:04:56,492 --> 01:04:57,784
Cho Yoo-jung,

732
01:04:58,034 --> 01:04:59,867
you are Chun Bo-san.

733
01:04:59,867 --> 01:05:03,742
Your mission is to pass
Donglim’s intel to the North, right?

734
01:05:04,451 --> 01:05:05,451
Spill it.

735
01:05:05,909 --> 01:05:08,284
You dare attack me
over Jupiter Corp?

736
01:05:08,284 --> 01:05:10,326
Chief Park!

737
01:05:10,867 --> 01:05:13,284
Look at the photos
in front of you!

738
01:05:19,117 --> 01:05:23,284
You’re here to topple
our government?

739
01:05:23,326 --> 01:05:24,909
You?

740
01:05:26,409 --> 01:05:29,617
If you intentionally
made contact with me,

741
01:05:30,992 --> 01:05:33,284
you won’t walk out of here alive.

742
01:05:34,367 --> 01:05:36,701
Even if you’re not,
you won’t walk free!

743
01:05:36,701 --> 01:05:37,701
Why not?

744
01:05:38,826 --> 01:05:41,992
You have to stay
until you confess.

745
01:05:41,992 --> 01:05:44,617
That’s what this place is!

746
01:05:48,409 --> 01:05:50,117
Do you...

747
01:05:52,784 --> 01:05:53,451
suspect me too?

748
01:05:53,451 --> 01:05:55,284
How dare you bitch...

749
01:06:01,534 --> 01:06:04,159
From now on,
don’t answer their questions.

750
01:06:04,409 --> 01:06:06,451
Endure it, no matter what.

751
01:06:07,076 --> 01:06:10,117
That’s the only way
I can get you out.

752
01:06:38,826 --> 01:06:39,951
Chief Park...

753
01:07:02,909 --> 01:07:04,409
Can you see this?

754
01:07:06,951 --> 01:07:13,242
Donglim... Li Yong-su...

755
01:07:13,742 --> 01:07:16,451
Change rooms immediately,
and strengthen security.

756
01:07:16,451 --> 01:07:19,159
Swap out security details
to our people.

757
01:07:30,117 --> 01:07:32,242
Take care of this quick.

758
01:07:36,284 --> 01:07:39,076
Agent Yang woke from his coma!

759
01:08:02,617 --> 01:08:04,909
Domestic Unit has sealed off the room.

760
01:08:04,951 --> 01:08:07,159
You should’ve secured Yang first!

761
01:08:13,242 --> 01:08:14,992
Go! Push through!

762
01:08:32,992 --> 01:08:33,784
Hold them off!

763
01:09:04,159 --> 01:09:06,367
Roof of opposite building,
10 o’clock!

764
01:09:06,367 --> 01:09:08,117
Get to the building!

765
01:09:26,117 --> 01:09:31,659
Li Yong-su is head of the Strategic Unit
at North Korea’s Labor Party 35.

766
01:09:31,701 --> 01:09:36,909
He visited Osaka on October 15, 1982,
and Tokyo on May 11, 1983.

767
01:09:36,951 --> 01:09:39,992
We are cross checking
all KCIA agent flight logs.

768
01:09:40,784 --> 01:09:46,742
Retired General Ahn was pushed out for
not supporting the president’s coup,

769
01:09:46,742 --> 01:09:50,451
but Jupiter funds
were funneled to him.

770
01:09:50,451 --> 01:09:53,201
He’s under house arrest,
so I checked the visitor log,

771
01:09:53,201 --> 01:09:57,576
and found Kim Jung-do in it.

772
01:10:02,201 --> 01:10:04,409
A KCIA agent was assassinated.

773
01:10:04,409 --> 01:10:06,242
While under our protection.

774
01:10:06,284 --> 01:10:07,951
What the hell is going on here?

775
01:10:07,951 --> 01:10:12,451
We’ve captured a female spy who
relayed Donglim’s intel to the North.

776
01:10:13,576 --> 01:10:16,201
We’ll expose Donglim soon enough.

777
01:10:16,242 --> 01:10:19,951
We’re tracking the finances
of a potential spy organization.

778
01:10:20,367 --> 01:10:22,201
We’ll reveal our findings soon.

779
01:10:22,742 --> 01:10:24,201
You mean Jupiter Corp?

780
01:10:25,951 --> 01:10:26,701
Chief Kim.

781
01:10:28,451 --> 01:10:31,534
Didn’t you serve with Jupiter’s
CEO Choi in the military?

782
01:10:33,367 --> 01:10:37,409
He’s just a military supplier now.
I have no ties to him.

783
01:10:47,659 --> 01:10:48,992
Listen you two,

784
01:10:49,867 --> 01:10:54,826
if you want to survive, wrap it up
before the president’s Asia tour.

785
01:10:56,826 --> 01:10:59,951
You know what’ll happen
if you don’t.

786
01:11:03,201 --> 01:11:05,992
We’ve obtained North Korean
Li Yong-su’s flight logs to Japan.

787
01:11:05,992 --> 01:11:09,076
Analysts are using 20 IBMs
to cross check, so we’ll know soon.

788
01:11:09,284 --> 01:11:12,034
Yes, and we’ll know
your role, too.

789
01:11:12,034 --> 01:11:14,576
Jupiter’s CEO Choi
will spill everything.

790
01:11:14,576 --> 01:11:17,201
How long will that spy bitch hold out?

791
01:11:17,201 --> 01:11:19,076
The interrogator can’t wait to meet her.

792
01:11:19,076 --> 01:11:21,534
Why’d you transfer Yang
out of his room?

793
01:11:22,576 --> 01:11:26,159
The interrogator assured me
he’ll get to the bottom of this.

794
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:28,784
Why move Yang
and leave him exposed?!

795
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:30,701
Don’t dare put his death on me,

796
01:11:30,701 --> 01:11:34,409
just tell me how long you were
in league with that bitch!

797
01:11:56,242 --> 01:11:58,867
That girl’s father was
my informant in Japan!

798
01:11:59,409 --> 01:12:02,034
He died during my op
and I’ve been watching over her!

799
01:12:02,034 --> 01:12:08,034
I don’t trust your informant,
his bastard child, or even you.

800
01:12:09,409 --> 01:12:11,326
I’m certain you’re Donglim.

801
01:12:48,951 --> 01:12:54,284
3 years ago, military coup d’etat
and 10-day citizen massacre

802
01:13:42,242 --> 01:13:44,034
Hello, Mr. Kim.

803
01:13:48,284 --> 01:13:49,159
Good to see you.

804
01:13:59,784 --> 01:14:01,742
You stay in Seoul nowadays?

805
01:14:01,742 --> 01:14:04,534
Mostly Hong Kong and Saipan.

806
01:14:04,534 --> 01:14:06,117
How are you doing?

807
01:14:07,784 --> 01:14:12,951
I’m just a white-collar now.
Why did you want to see me?

808
01:14:12,951 --> 01:14:16,826
I have a proposal for you.

809
01:14:17,034 --> 01:14:21,034
Really? If there’s any way
I can help, I certainly will.

810
01:14:21,409 --> 01:14:23,951
Not a favor, but a proposal.

811
01:14:27,076 --> 01:14:28,784
What do you have in mind?

812
01:14:28,951 --> 01:14:31,951
The thing you’re about to do,

813
01:14:33,326 --> 01:14:34,784
we want you to drop it.

814
01:14:36,867 --> 01:14:38,951
I don’t understand you.

815
01:14:39,034 --> 01:14:43,576
I hear Chief Park
detained Jupiter’s CEO Choi.

816
01:14:49,409 --> 01:14:51,826
Leave for the States.

817
01:14:53,242 --> 01:14:58,826
So long as we’re aware of it,
you will not succeed.

818
01:15:00,034 --> 01:15:02,076
I don’t understand what you’re...

819
01:15:02,701 --> 01:15:04,867
Operation Hunt Peter.

820
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:20,367
I didn’t want to report this
at the office.

821
01:15:20,534 --> 01:15:24,367
This is a conversation between
General Ahn and Chief Kim

822
01:15:24,367 --> 01:15:27,201
before he started working
at the agency.

823
01:15:27,201 --> 01:15:30,784
It may not sound like much,
but listen carefully.

824
01:15:32,284 --> 01:15:34,576
Your house arrest will end shortly,

825
01:15:34,576 --> 01:15:37,784
and you may have to
relocate your cottage.

826
01:15:37,784 --> 01:15:39,784
Is that so?

827
01:15:39,784 --> 01:15:42,409
What’s wrong?
Don’t like the location?

828
01:15:42,409 --> 01:15:44,492
The landlord suddenly
changed his mind,

829
01:15:44,534 --> 01:15:47,701
I thought it’d be best to move.

830
01:15:47,742 --> 01:15:50,867
Then it’ll have to be redesigned?

831
01:15:50,867 --> 01:15:54,492
In a different location,
the design will have to change.

832
01:15:54,492 --> 01:15:58,034
It isn’t easy building a small home.

833
01:15:59,076 --> 01:16:00,201
Do I ask too much?

834
01:16:00,201 --> 01:16:01,451
No, sir.

835
01:16:01,451 --> 01:16:04,159
Just a few minor adjustments.

836
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:06,951
Once you complete house arrest,
the cottage will be done.

837
01:16:07,826 --> 01:16:09,951
It’s tough to hear it
over the music, right?

838
01:16:09,951 --> 01:16:13,242
You can still hear
their conversation faintly.

839
01:16:13,242 --> 01:16:17,409
So, I got the audio techs to isolate it.

840
01:16:17,534 --> 01:16:18,867
This is it.

841
01:16:22,201 --> 01:16:25,409
It’s important to secure funds
for extra expenses.

842
01:16:25,659 --> 01:16:29,784
I told Jupiter’s CEO Choi
to come up with $500,000.

843
01:16:29,784 --> 01:16:34,034
He asked for a week,
I’m sure he’ll put it together.

844
01:16:34,201 --> 01:16:38,284
The cottage and the design
refer to their operation.

845
01:16:38,284 --> 01:16:42,659
I’m assigned to KCIA
starting next week.

846
01:16:47,492 --> 01:16:51,117
Please be careful.

847
01:16:52,284 --> 01:16:56,742
I’ll succeed with Op Hunt Peter
in Washington no matter what.

848
01:16:58,242 --> 01:16:59,534
Peter?

849
01:17:00,034 --> 01:17:03,159
I had so much trouble
figuring this part out.

850
01:17:03,159 --> 01:17:04,617
Peter is...

851
01:17:05,784 --> 01:17:07,367
the president’s Christian name.

852
01:17:08,784 --> 01:17:11,367
He tried to assassinate the president?

853
01:17:11,367 --> 01:17:14,284
We can’t ignore a potential
link to the North.

854
01:17:14,659 --> 01:17:18,242
But something’s been bothering me.

855
01:17:20,284 --> 01:17:23,492
This is the full list of KCIA agents
who flew to Japan.

856
01:17:23,784 --> 01:17:26,492
Not a single agent was present
at the time

857
01:17:26,492 --> 01:17:29,909
Donglim made contact
with North Korea’s Li Yong-su.

858
01:17:29,909 --> 01:17:32,951
Chief Kim wasn’t present on either date.

859
01:17:33,242 --> 01:17:36,242
You were in Tokyo on May 11, 1983,

860
01:17:36,409 --> 01:17:39,201
but not in Osaka on October 15, 1982.

861
01:17:39,201 --> 01:17:43,034
So, I looked into anyone
with a single date match.

862
01:17:43,034 --> 01:17:45,951
Also, about Cho Yoo-jung...

863
01:17:48,201 --> 01:17:49,909
You don’t need to worry.

864
01:17:49,909 --> 01:17:52,909
I asked the JCIA

865
01:17:52,951 --> 01:17:56,742
to confirm her relation to
Cho Won-sik, it’ll arrive tomorrow.

866
01:17:57,867 --> 01:17:59,867
Let’s see...

867
01:18:01,576 --> 01:18:05,784
Fly in date is right...

868
01:18:07,284 --> 01:18:09,451
October...

869
01:18:12,659 --> 01:18:14,951
Cha Hyung-dae, Osaka,
October 15,

870
01:18:15,659 --> 01:18:19,867
He has a fly in date,
but no fly out date.

871
01:18:22,451 --> 01:18:24,242
Which means he’s a ghost.

872
01:18:26,742 --> 01:18:28,242
Wait a minute.

873
01:18:31,201 --> 01:18:33,076
Cha Hyung-dae.  Real Name Aliases
Park Pyong-ho Cha Hyung-dae

874
01:18:34,659 --> 01:18:39,201
I made you this passport
for last year’s West Berlin op...

875
01:18:45,617 --> 01:18:48,284
Sir, you went to Japan
with this passport?

876
01:19:01,951 --> 01:19:03,242
Ju-kyung...

877
01:19:08,576 --> 01:19:10,326
You’re the one?

878
01:19:11,159 --> 01:19:12,909
Wait a minute!

879
01:19:15,742 --> 01:19:17,492
Wait, don’t come any closer.

880
01:19:17,534 --> 01:19:18,492
Ju-kyung.

881
01:19:19,576 --> 01:19:20,576
Stop right there!

882
01:20:44,701 --> 01:20:48,034
My government has accepted
this administration.

883
01:20:48,326 --> 01:20:50,701
What we want is simple.

884
01:20:51,159 --> 01:20:52,617
We want order.

885
01:20:54,659 --> 01:20:56,867
Forget everything, and leave.

886
01:20:56,867 --> 01:21:00,659
We’ll support you and your family.

887
01:21:03,701 --> 01:21:07,201
The military assault
that started on May 18th

888
01:21:07,451 --> 01:21:13,451
resulted in over 3,000
civilian casualties in 10 days.

889
01:21:14,284 --> 01:21:19,909
On the 21st, there was even
an attack by helicopters.

890
01:21:22,409 --> 01:21:25,034
Youngest casualty was
a 11-year-old child.

891
01:21:26,909 --> 01:21:33,951
A bullet passed through his chest,
and killed him instantly.

892
01:21:37,659 --> 01:21:41,451
You want me to accept
the killer of my people,

893
01:21:42,576 --> 01:21:45,201
and turn my back on my country?

894
01:21:47,117 --> 01:21:50,117
Your proposal is very insulting.

895
01:22:10,367 --> 01:22:11,326
Hello?

896
01:22:11,326 --> 01:22:14,617
Sir, it’s me!
Chief Park is Donglim!

897
01:22:15,117 --> 01:22:18,326
He killed Agent Bang Ju-kyung
and is on the move!

898
01:22:18,326 --> 01:22:20,576
- What’s his current location? - Heading towards Mapo!

899
01:22:20,576 --> 01:22:22,742
I’m on my way,
have our men ready!

900
01:22:22,742 --> 01:22:23,742
Yes, sir!

901
01:22:39,367 --> 01:22:42,159
Hunt South Korea’s #1 in Bangkok
on the 11th, intel by Donglim
The president’s revised itinerary.

902
01:22:42,201 --> 01:22:44,701
I need to meet the head of
the South Korean cell.

903
01:22:44,909 --> 01:22:47,034
You know cells can’t
meet face-to-face.

904
01:22:47,159 --> 01:22:49,284
Think we're in Storm Level 1?

905
01:22:50,992 --> 01:22:53,576
Who cares about that,
just make contact!

906
01:22:55,242 --> 01:22:57,409
I’ll hand this off in person.

907
01:23:10,451 --> 01:23:11,701
People are coming out.

908
01:23:11,951 --> 01:23:13,784
People are exiting the church.

909
01:23:13,784 --> 01:23:14,534
And Park Pyung-ho?

910
01:23:14,534 --> 01:23:15,576
Not yet, sir.

911
01:23:15,909 --> 01:23:16,826
Dammit.

912
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:21,159
Follow every one of them!
Don’t miss a single one!

913
01:23:22,326 --> 01:23:23,326
Follow your mark.

914
01:24:05,367 --> 01:24:06,576
Agent Jang.

915
01:24:07,367 --> 01:24:09,076
Why are you here?

916
01:24:10,076 --> 01:24:12,659
Chief Park, I’m...

917
01:24:13,659 --> 01:24:17,284
You’re what?
Are you tailing me?

918
01:24:17,492 --> 01:24:20,117
No, it’s not that.

919
01:24:21,992 --> 01:24:23,117
Chief!

920
01:24:39,076 --> 01:24:44,201
Jeez, KCIA fuckers
sure suck at their job.

921
01:24:47,576 --> 01:24:51,784
How could they go so easy
on a commie like him?

922
01:24:52,909 --> 01:24:55,742
Which agency do you work for?

923
01:24:56,451 --> 01:24:58,701
Don’t play dumb.

924
01:24:59,326 --> 01:25:03,034
Defense Security Command,
you can’t weasel out this time.

925
01:25:03,492 --> 01:25:04,492
Lift him up!

926
01:25:08,742 --> 01:25:12,451
Call Captain Kwon at once
and free me!

927
01:25:12,909 --> 01:25:14,909
You’re best buds with my captain?

928
01:25:15,951 --> 01:25:18,159
Go on, give him a massage.

929
01:25:31,784 --> 01:25:34,659
So? Feel like talking now?

930
01:25:35,284 --> 01:25:37,201
Did Kim Jung-do send you?

931
01:25:37,451 --> 01:25:40,534
You think killing me
will save Jupiter Corp?

932
01:25:40,742 --> 01:25:43,826
You think I don’t know
about Operation Hunt Peter?!

933
01:25:44,617 --> 01:25:47,451
What’s this asshole
blabbering on about?

934
01:25:47,451 --> 01:25:52,326
Get a whiff of your
burning skin and die!

935
01:25:54,992 --> 01:25:58,159
That college chick of yours
spilled her guts!

936
01:25:58,159 --> 01:26:01,534
That you’re Donglim, who’s been
spying on the KCIA for 13 years!

937
01:26:02,117 --> 01:26:05,326
She’s on the way here,
so fess up first.

938
01:26:05,992 --> 01:26:08,867
Only one of you gets to live.

939
01:26:09,576 --> 01:26:12,576
Call the KCIA now...

940
01:26:13,784 --> 01:26:15,534
Lieutenant Min!
Bring the documents.

941
01:26:15,534 --> 01:26:17,867
This fucker still thinks
he’s a KCIA agent.

942
01:26:19,492 --> 01:26:21,367
Look at it,
it’s your handwriting.

943
01:26:21,367 --> 01:26:24,242
“Hunt South Korea’s #1”
Assassinate our president?

944
01:26:26,826 --> 01:26:30,867
It’s a controlled leak,
you stupid thug!

945
01:26:34,534 --> 01:26:35,992
Bring him out.

946
01:26:41,201 --> 01:26:42,409
Fucking commies.

947
01:26:47,992 --> 01:26:49,617
State your objective!

948
01:26:49,617 --> 01:26:50,617
You goddamn traitors!

949
01:26:50,659 --> 01:26:51,992
You’ll be punished for high treason...

950
01:27:01,159 --> 01:27:02,242
Who are you?

951
01:27:03,867 --> 01:27:05,992
State your objective!

952
01:27:08,242 --> 01:27:09,617
Who are you?!

953
01:27:23,409 --> 01:27:25,159
You did well, comrade Donglim.

954
01:27:25,326 --> 01:27:27,784
Been a while since
your last loyalty check, no?

955
01:27:27,784 --> 01:27:31,909
I’m chief of the Ministry of People’s Armed Forces.

956
01:27:32,784 --> 01:27:35,534
Why’s the MPAF involved
in this operation?

957
01:27:36,867 --> 01:27:41,159
Connect me to
the United Front’s Li Yong-su.

958
01:27:43,451 --> 01:27:48,992
You won’t hear that peace lover’s
cries for negotiation ever again.

959
01:27:52,492 --> 01:27:54,034
Our leader changed the plan.

960
01:27:54,034 --> 01:27:57,242
Starting with Operation Flare,
we’ll attack the South militarily.

961
01:27:59,367 --> 01:28:01,159
Operation Flare?

962
01:28:01,159 --> 01:28:03,076
That’s nonsense,
an all-out-war?!

963
01:28:04,201 --> 01:28:06,326
You think the US
will just stand by?

964
01:28:06,617 --> 01:28:11,742
Doesn’t matter, 6 hours is
all we need to take the South.

965
01:28:11,951 --> 01:28:16,034
But millions will die
in those 6 hours!

966
01:28:17,242 --> 01:28:19,951
Our original plan to negotiate

967
01:28:19,951 --> 01:28:23,076
after killing their president
is most practical!

968
01:28:24,659 --> 01:28:27,492
Reunification is the party’s goal, no?!

969
01:28:27,492 --> 01:28:30,659
Don’t spoil the plan
for peaceful revolution.

970
01:28:30,659 --> 01:28:31,826
Comrade.

971
01:28:31,826 --> 01:28:34,617
Peaceful reunification
is an illusion.

972
01:28:34,617 --> 01:28:36,617
Your mission from now is
to assist in the assassination

973
01:28:36,617 --> 01:28:38,076
Your mission from now is
to assist in the assassination Hunt #1, then kill Donglim

974
01:28:38,326 --> 01:28:41,201
by accompanying the president
on his Asian tour.

975
01:28:43,534 --> 01:28:45,659
I cannot agree to that!

976
01:28:45,659 --> 01:28:48,701
You think I stayed alive this long
just to start a war?!

977
01:28:50,826 --> 01:28:54,034
Having some intel
puts you above our leader?!

978
01:28:54,034 --> 01:28:55,242
How dare you disobey an order!

979
01:28:55,284 --> 01:28:56,951
I can’t agree to a war!

980
01:29:03,201 --> 01:29:06,951
This will destroy all of us...

981
01:29:31,992 --> 01:29:33,451
Get the rifles!

982
01:30:07,951 --> 01:30:10,784
Hunt #1, then kill Donglim

983
01:30:15,951 --> 01:30:17,701
Back door! Back door!

984
01:30:17,742 --> 01:30:18,742
Go after him!

985
01:30:18,867 --> 01:30:20,701
You two, go upstairs!

986
01:30:31,409 --> 01:30:36,117
Peaceful revolution. Hunt South Korea’s #1
after verse 1 of National Anthem.

987
01:30:36,117 --> 01:30:38,284
Intel gathered by Donglim

988
01:30:41,367 --> 01:30:42,867
Peaceful Revolution #1

989
01:30:48,951 --> 01:30:50,451
Park Pyong-ho

990
01:30:58,367 --> 01:30:59,784
Hunt #1, then kill Donglim

991
01:31:14,492 --> 01:31:16,242
Free Chief Park!

992
01:31:46,909 --> 01:31:48,992
Donglim has been killed.

993
01:32:02,701 --> 01:32:04,034
CEO Choi...

994
01:32:05,951 --> 01:32:07,992
Where is he now?

995
01:32:12,409 --> 01:32:16,617
The director wants CEO Choi’s
confession today, whatever it takes.

996
01:32:19,201 --> 01:32:20,534
Who are you?!

997
01:32:33,992 --> 01:32:35,159
CEO Choi.

998
01:32:45,076 --> 01:32:48,242
What exactly is Jupiter Corp?

999
01:32:51,034 --> 01:32:55,034
Who are you in league with?

1000
01:33:01,117 --> 01:33:02,534
All right, fine.

1001
01:33:04,492 --> 01:33:07,034
You really want to go all the way?

1002
01:33:14,826 --> 01:33:16,076
Spill it.

1003
01:33:17,159 --> 01:33:20,576
Who’s involved, and their end goal.

1004
01:33:21,492 --> 01:33:23,742
If you don’t tell us, you die.

1005
01:33:25,784 --> 01:33:26,867
Very well.

1006
01:33:29,826 --> 01:33:31,201
That’s what I wanted.

1007
01:33:38,034 --> 01:33:39,409
Give me your best shot.

1008
01:33:52,409 --> 01:33:55,117
Sir, if we go any higher
he could die...

1009
01:34:49,659 --> 01:34:50,867
Status on CEO Choi?

1010
01:34:53,117 --> 01:34:57,617
He was a soldier to the end.

1011
01:35:01,534 --> 01:35:04,701
But the hunt of Peter is possible.

1012
01:35:05,034 --> 01:35:07,617
North Korea has a plan in motion

1013
01:35:09,034 --> 01:35:11,826
to assassinate the president on
October 11th at 10 AM in Bangkok.

1014
01:35:12,034 --> 01:35:14,659
What? North Koreans?

1015
01:35:15,659 --> 01:35:19,659
We obtained this intel at a raid
we conducted today.

1016
01:35:22,034 --> 01:35:24,659
Once they successfully
assassinate the president,

1017
01:35:24,659 --> 01:35:28,659
we can initiate Operation New World.

1018
01:35:29,034 --> 01:35:32,701
You want to carry out
a joint op with the North?

1019
01:35:32,701 --> 01:35:33,534
That’s preposterous.

1020
01:35:33,534 --> 01:35:37,076
How is that a revolution?
It has to be justified.

1021
01:35:37,076 --> 01:35:38,576
We’ll hold hands with commies?

1022
01:35:38,576 --> 01:35:40,617
This is not a revolution!

1023
01:35:44,701 --> 01:35:51,492
It’s about stopping the gruesome
violence against our people.

1024
01:35:54,034 --> 01:35:56,576
That’s our justification.

1025
01:36:00,826 --> 01:36:04,076
I’m flying out to Bangkok tomorrow.

1026
01:36:14,701 --> 01:36:17,534
Go as far South as possible.

1027
01:36:18,534 --> 01:36:22,409
Take the first bus to Namhae.

1028
01:36:23,576 --> 01:36:27,701
In Namhae,
there’s a temple called Boriam.

1029
01:36:29,159 --> 01:36:30,534
Go there.

1030
01:36:31,659 --> 01:36:33,701
It should be safe there.

1031
01:36:35,076 --> 01:36:36,617
What’s going on?

1032
01:36:38,742 --> 01:36:42,242
No matter what happens in
South Korea, stay at the temple.

1033
01:36:44,034 --> 01:36:45,951
What’s happening?

1034
01:38:30,701 --> 01:38:34,951
Bangkok

1035
01:38:41,326 --> 01:38:44,784
Reunification is at the tip
of our barrels.

1036
01:38:45,659 --> 01:38:49,201
We’ll celebrate our Grand Marshal
upon reunification.

1037
01:38:51,159 --> 01:38:54,701
The party has initiated
Operation Flare.

1038
01:38:56,034 --> 01:39:00,492
It’ll ignite on verse 1, final line
of the South Korean anthem

1039
01:39:01,534 --> 01:39:04,076
For our party and our country!

1040
01:39:04,784 --> 01:39:06,492
To our Grand Marshal!

1041
01:39:06,867 --> 01:39:09,367
To our Grand Marshal!
To our Grand Marshal!

1042
01:40:03,326 --> 01:40:05,492
Main gate, sitrep.

1043
01:40:05,951 --> 01:40:07,617
All in order, sir.

1044
01:40:07,659 --> 01:40:10,492
Report when you see
the motorcade approaching.

1045
01:40:10,534 --> 01:40:11,659
Yes, sir!

1046
01:40:14,576 --> 01:40:16,117
Why did you let me walk?

1047
01:40:17,909 --> 01:40:19,701
You know who I am.

1048
01:40:20,242 --> 01:40:22,742
You know what I’m trying to do.

1049
01:40:27,492 --> 01:40:30,034
How long can you fight
violence with violence?

1050
01:40:32,242 --> 01:40:35,117
You think the world will change
by removing one dictator?

1051
01:40:37,951 --> 01:40:41,242
You’ve seen how
this dictatorship evolved.

1052
01:40:41,909 --> 01:40:43,909
It’s time to end it.

1053
01:40:48,701 --> 01:40:51,451
Once the president arrives,
when does the anthem begin?

1054
01:40:52,159 --> 01:40:53,367
Yes, sir.

1055
01:40:53,367 --> 01:40:55,701
It’ll start once they pass
the memorial.

1056
01:40:56,492 --> 01:40:59,909
Once he’s assassinated,
the invasion begins.

1057
01:41:00,742 --> 01:41:02,867
That’s North Korea’s plan.

1058
01:41:05,326 --> 01:41:07,701
Reunification by force?

1059
01:41:08,367 --> 01:41:11,159
Are you still fooled by
such political theater?

1060
01:41:16,409 --> 01:41:18,242
What do you want from me?

1061
01:41:20,409 --> 01:41:23,326
Our goals are the same,
we can join up temporarily.

1062
01:41:25,701 --> 01:41:27,159
And then?

1063
01:41:30,284 --> 01:41:31,826
After that?

1064
01:41:34,534 --> 01:41:35,534
This is the main gate.

1065
01:41:35,534 --> 01:41:38,576
The director, ministers,
and reporters are heading in.

1066
01:41:39,909 --> 01:41:40,951
Roger.

1067
01:41:42,242 --> 01:41:43,826
No mistakes.

1068
01:42:07,534 --> 01:42:09,909
Good work, gents.

1069
01:42:10,076 --> 01:42:12,159
Let’s all have a drink
after this is over.

1070
01:42:12,201 --> 01:42:13,367
Let’s go inside.

1071
01:42:25,742 --> 01:42:28,076
Main gate, sitrep!
Has the president arrived?

1072
01:42:28,076 --> 01:42:28,784
Main gate!

1073
01:42:34,326 --> 01:42:35,492
Go confirm!

1074
01:42:46,117 --> 01:42:48,992
It’s not the president!
It’s Korean Ambassador to Thailand!

1075
01:42:49,367 --> 01:42:50,492
Stop the anthem!

1076
01:42:52,034 --> 01:42:53,367
Stop the anthem!

1077
01:42:53,451 --> 01:42:55,409
Stop! Stop it!

1078
01:42:55,867 --> 01:42:56,659
Stop!

1079
01:43:13,701 --> 01:43:15,826
The escort made you
look like the president.

1080
01:43:15,826 --> 01:43:17,201
He will arrive shortly.

1081
01:43:17,201 --> 01:43:18,867
- I see.
- Let’s go inside.

1082
01:43:38,826 --> 01:43:41,659
I’ll send you to wherever
you want to go.

1083
01:43:41,659 --> 01:43:43,326
When it’s all over.

1084
01:44:01,326 --> 01:44:03,992
Chief Kim, come say hello.

1085
01:44:07,284 --> 01:44:09,534
You’ve done a marvelous job.

1086
01:44:11,909 --> 01:44:13,742
Reunification at last.

1087
01:44:14,492 --> 01:44:17,742
He’ll be a great support
back home in the future.

1088
01:44:18,284 --> 01:44:25,992
Comrade, with Operation Flare,
South Korea will be destroyed.

1089
01:44:32,951 --> 01:44:36,284
This is the main gate,
the president is passing through.

1090
01:44:39,951 --> 01:44:43,242
The party and our country
are watching you today.

1091
01:44:48,492 --> 01:44:50,117
Good luck to you.

1092
01:45:07,659 --> 01:45:09,701
A North Korean spy...

1093
01:45:11,951 --> 01:45:13,326
A sniper!

1094
01:45:35,284 --> 01:45:36,909
Stop the anthem!

1095
01:45:37,576 --> 01:45:39,034
Stop the anthem!

1096
01:45:41,034 --> 01:45:42,576
What’s going on?!

1097
01:45:43,951 --> 01:45:45,117
Stop!

1098
01:45:46,451 --> 01:45:47,659
Stop!

1099
01:45:55,242 --> 01:45:56,576
Sniper!

1100
01:47:00,659 --> 01:47:02,451
Chief Kim, go rescue the president!

1101
01:47:04,076 --> 01:47:06,784
What are you doing?!
Go rescue him!

1102
01:47:06,826 --> 01:47:08,951
Why should I rescue him?!

1103
01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:51,576
Stop it! No!

1104
01:47:54,367 --> 01:47:55,284
Stop!

1105
01:49:33,284 --> 01:49:36,117
Lower your gun.
Don’t do this.

1106
01:49:39,201 --> 01:49:41,409
Stop! Everyone stop!

1107
01:49:44,159 --> 01:49:48,742
You’re sentenced to death for usurping
power and murdering our people.

1108
01:49:48,742 --> 01:49:50,034
Chief Kim!

1109
01:49:52,076 --> 01:49:53,451
Chief Kim!

1110
01:51:07,742 --> 01:51:09,909
Bring the car over!

1111
01:51:11,409 --> 01:51:14,909
Bring the car!
Get the car over here!

1112
01:51:22,159 --> 01:51:24,451
Mr. President! Are you okay?!

1113
01:51:40,576 --> 01:51:41,784
Drive!

1114
01:52:29,617 --> 01:52:31,367
Park Pyong-ho!

1115
01:52:33,867 --> 01:52:36,076
Park Pyong-ho!

1116
01:52:39,117 --> 01:52:41,034
Park Pyong-ho!

1117
01:52:45,784 --> 01:52:47,617
Park Pyong-ho!

1118
01:52:50,451 --> 01:52:52,117
Park Pyong-ho!

1119
01:53:17,617 --> 01:53:18,742
Why?

1120
01:53:21,034 --> 01:53:22,742
Why did you do it?!

1121
01:53:23,451 --> 01:53:24,784
Hold still,

1122
01:53:24,784 --> 01:53:26,284
you can survive this.

1123
01:53:34,617 --> 01:53:36,701
Did you want to live?

1124
01:55:11,492 --> 01:55:12,617
One moment.

1125
01:55:17,076 --> 01:55:20,076
Release her.
And give this to her.

1126
01:55:28,492 --> 01:55:29,992
Uncuff her.

1127
01:55:50,826 --> 01:55:51,951
Pull out.

1128
01:55:53,201 --> 01:55:54,576
Pull out.

1129
01:56:19,534 --> 01:56:23,701
My mission was to watch over you.

1130
01:56:24,534 --> 01:56:27,659
Soon, someone else will come.

1131
01:58:56,201 --> 01:58:57,492
Yoo-jung...

1132
01:59:02,242 --> 01:59:05,409
you can live a different life.

1133
01:59:24,326 --> 01:59:26,742
Park Eun-su
