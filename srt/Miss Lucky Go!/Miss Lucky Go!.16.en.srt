"I said what I said out of anger".

"Don't take it seriously".

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,220
"I know".

00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,120

Bao Zhendong looked at Lin Miaomiao

and smiled.

The misunderstanding between them has started to be addressed.

It's time

22
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:54,990
let me ask you a question.

23
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:56,550
What question?

24
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,550
Well,

25
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,330
what kind of boys do girls usually like?

26
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,250
It depends.

27
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,310
For example, your mom

28
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,220
and your cousin who is in high school

29
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,280
definitely don't like the same type.

30
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,780
What about the girls in our class,

31
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,190
such as Zhao Gu?

32
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,500
Zhao Gu doesn't like boys.

33
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,020
Zhao Gu only likes studying.

A mama's boy.

37
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,640
He has to be someone who can't take care of his own life independently

38
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,140
and is very irresponsible.

39
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,079

What's wrong?

195
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,220
Bao Zhendong, the new male lead,

196
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,920
is the new boyfriend of the heroine.

197
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,650
Originally, he would be by her side

198
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,160
whenever she is in need.

199
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,100
But now,

200
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,150
he told the heroine he was going to the company.

201
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,410
But he went into a strange hotel instead.

202
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,090
The male lead lied to the female lead.

203
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,380
The plot is going to collapse.

204
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,250
Now the key is

205
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,110
who the person in the room is.

206
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,930

207
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,800
how A Caged Bird will write the plot.

208
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,270
But according to the plot development,

209
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,870
she is either a spy sent by the stepmother

210
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,660
or the male lead's first lover.

211
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,720

212
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,030

213
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,910

215

216
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,720
it must be the best solution.

218

Aren't you?

566
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,110
If I wanted to be a two-timer,

567
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,000
I wouldn't have waited until now.

568
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:43,660
Right.

569
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,860
You are popular.

570
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,050
You can have many girlfriends.

571
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,420
I don't deserve you.

572
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,410
Why are you talking about that again?

573
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,530
Can you let me finish?

574
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,780
Why are you so unreasonable now?

575
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:59,070
Now you know.

576
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:00,920
It's not too late.

577
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:05,530
Chen Miren,

578
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,460
I'm gonna ask you one last time.

579
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,970
If you break up with me this time,

580
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,350
I won't wait for you again.

581
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,340
Don't regret it.

582
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,030
I don't.

583
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,750
I don't want you anymore!

584
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:52,870
♫I don't need to doubt that I've fallen completely♫
