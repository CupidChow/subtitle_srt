00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,700
Sir, Zhong Wei has asked for a leave.

7
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:30,930
Okay.

In terms of the transportation problem...

10

I've heard that Zhong Wei

11
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,270
is seriously ill this time.

12
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:39,600
He can't even get off the bed.

13
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,240
He even needs two people to help him to go to the toilet.

14
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,200
It's just an allergy.

15
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,430
He's not that seriously ill.

16
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,470
A boy from a rich family like him is delicate.

17
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,500

The chain is broken again?

23
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:16,740
Yes.

24
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,140
It's an old problem.

Nothing.

Someone gave it to me.

Why don't you open it and read it?

32
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:50,270
No.

33
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,180
I'm not interested in her.

34
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,240

There were no books on this seat.

39
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,210
So, theoretically,

You are the pervert!

This is an important workplace for me.

100

What do you know?

102
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,730
Do you think if Xu Miaomiao has a date,

103
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,960
she would come to the grove?

104
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,020
You're right.

105
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,160
For a beauty like Xu Miaomiao,

106
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,390
it's a bit inappropriate to go into the grove.

107
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,860
The grove is only suitable for ordinary students,

108
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,640

Wait.

115
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,610
Why did we run away?

116
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,299
I have a conflict with Zhao Gu.

117
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,390
It's too embarrassing to meet her.

118
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,440
Why are you embarrassed?

119
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,919
They should be the ones who feel embarrassed.

120
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:42,500
When this top student is in love,

121
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,720
she's so wild.

This is against my professional ethics.

00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,120
Give me two boxes of milk.

I've brought it back so as to keep is as a memento.

140
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,090
You might as well sell it on Goofish.

141
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,390
Maybe you can sell it at a good price.

142

Good idea. I'll post the sales information at once.

143

If someone comes to see you every day,

155
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,500

Of course not.

Almost like that.

160
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,890
It must be because you like him.

161

Let me tell you.

162
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,760
When I was in high school,

163
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,990
a boy liked me,

164
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,410
and he followed me for three years.

165
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,100
He went wherever I went.

166
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,830
He bought me water, milk tea and snacks.

167
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,800
He even brought me a pillow as I would sleep in class.

168
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,630
What happened later?

169
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,420
Was there a story?

170
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,390
Nothing happened after that.

171
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,930
He wasn't admitted to Hanhai University. I wasn't disappointed, either.

172
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,400
Because I didn't like him.

173
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,520
It's all right that he's gone.

174
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,530
Miaomiao, hearing what you said,

175
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,380
why do I feel that you're a little bad?

176
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,320
It seems I'm a bad girl.

177

00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,830
But I must have one.

[Chen Miren]

190
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,750
She really doesn't contact me.

191
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,240
Zhong Wei, the award for the Campus Ambassador has been issued.

192
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,100
Here you are.

193
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:00,720
You can have it.

194
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:01,860
Really?

195
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,840
Thank you so much.

196
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,400
To be honest,

197
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,200
I had been the seeded player of the school

198
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,940
table tennis team at elementary, junior and senior high schools.

199
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,690
You know the Golden Radish Cup, right?

200
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,550
I won the first prize for three years in a row.

201
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,320
This is a table tennis bat of Hong San Xi.

202
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,540
It's very precious.

203
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,550
I'm glad you like it.

204
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:23,280
Zhong Wei, I've made the whole process of how you were chosen

205
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,110
into a photo album, and have sent it to the class chat group.

206
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,310
This is the first group activity of our class.

207
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,370
It is very memorable.

208
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,710
This time, you were chosen,

209
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:32,770
and it was all thanks to Chen Miren.

210
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,050
I can still be selected without her.

211
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:39,920
Hello?

212
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,620
Zhong Wei, I have a piece of good news

213
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:43,690
and a piece of bad news.

214
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,460
Which one do you want to hear first?

215
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:45,870
Whatever.

216
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,090
The good news is that

217
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,120
the project of Self-heating Companion Cats

218
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,910
has been approved in the company's assessment meeting.

219
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,490
What about the bad news?

220
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,450
The company cut our budget.

221
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,050
They only allowed us to make 20,000 pieces.

222
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,420
20,000 pieces?

223
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,310
For this, it even took me a long time to persuade

224
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,350
your father to agree.

225
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,120
I've contacted the factory.

226
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,690
I'm leaving for Linzhou tomorrow.

227
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,790
I'll make the action figures first.

228
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,270
Then you should go.

229
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,350
You have no idea how stingy your father is.

230
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,960
I've applied for a travel allowance,

231
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,540
but it's not even enough to cover the cost of taking a business car.

232
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,230
Come pick me up at school tomorrow.

233
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:15,780
I'll go, too.

234
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,170
You'll go, too?

235
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:17,920
Why are you going?

236
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,180
To shoot a promotional video.

237
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,230
Well...

238
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,010
You always ask others to give you a ride.

239
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,500
Why are you more stingy than your father?

240
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,450
Luo Si, you're back.

241
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,720
Fang Mao's mother is sick.

242
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,130
He can't take care of her alone.

243
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,400
So...

You're such a good girlfriend.

245

Don't worry. We're here.

Yes.

Where is Chen Miren?

250
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,150
She has gone to Linzhou.

They're all here.

260

or there were more than 10,000,000 pieces at most.

Yes, there will be only 20,000 pieces sold in the world.

Actually, I can do it myself.

560
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,250
Mr. Zhong, welcome.

561
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,000
Mr. Wang.

562
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:43,580
Sorry to keep you waiting.

563
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,480
Why are you here again?

564
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:48,750
Security guards!

565
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,630
Mr. Wang, she's my...

566
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:51,550
Classmate.

567
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,050
Not only that.

568
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,090
I understand.

569
00:29:58,770 --> 00:29:59,870
Please have a seat.

570
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,210
Mr. Zhong.

571
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,350
I've heard that you came there this time

572
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,780
in order to shoot a video on a special subject.

573
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,040
My fans are very curious

574
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,510
about the production process of this action figure,

575
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,630
so I plan to shoot a video on this subject

576
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,660
so as to introduce it to them.

577
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,540
It's our honor that you've decided to

578
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,640
introduce our company.

579
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,090
I hope that

580
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,150
as a blogger who owns millions of fans,

581
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,800
you can help to promote our company more.

582
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:26,230
Okay.

583
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:27,660
Mr. Wang,

584
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,620
There's another favor I want to ask you to do.

585
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:30,410
Please say it.

586
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,190
My classmate

587
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,770
has a work,

588
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,340
and wants you to produce it.

589
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,990
Last time, I already told her that

590
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,890
the miniumu quantity of an order in our factory is 10,000 pieces.

591
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,070
How about this, Mr. Zhong?

592
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:49,090
This time, for the sake of you,

593
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,940
I'll make an exception for her and produce 8,000 pieces.

594
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:52,680
1,000 pieces.

595
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,800
Mr. Zhong, aren't you making things difficult for me?

596
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,450
I won't make things difficult for you.

597
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,930
I'll shoot the video if you can do this.

598
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,950
I won't shoot the video if you can't.

599
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:02,920
Let's go.

600
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:04,610
No. Wait.

601
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,140
I'll make 1,000 pieces.

602
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,490
20% off for the cost of processing.

603
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:12,710
Chen Miren, don't go too far.

604
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:13,600
Let's go.

605
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:14,620
Mr. Wang, I'm just kidding.

606
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:16,130
Just make 1,000 pieces.

607
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,300
With this work,

608
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,360
as an undiscovered talent,

609
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,630
I will finally shine.

610
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,440
If Heng Chang really hires me,

611
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,870
and then I become a famous

612
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,210
designer overnight,

613
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,830
do you think I should still go to school?

614
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:36,170
If I drop out of college, I won't have a diploma.

615
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:39,030
If I continue to go to school, Advanced Mathematics is too difficult.

616
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,500
Forget it. I'll quit school.

617
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,260
Chen Miren.

618
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,430
Go to bed early.

619
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,710
You'll have everything in your dreams.

620
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,700
Zhong Wei, don't you trust me?

621
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:58,560
If I become famous,

622
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,630
don't cry and beg to interview me.

623
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:03,270
I trust you.

624
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,020
We've been waiting for an hour.

625
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:15,900
Is there no bus?

626
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,910
Chen Miren, look.

627
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,980
There's a meteor! Make a wish!

628
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,040
Meteor, please bless me to join Heng Chang.

629
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,510
I hope I won't fail the higher mathematics exam,

630
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,540
and Cao won't come to talk to me.

631
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:27,080
Besides...

632
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:27,740
Chen Miren.

633
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,860
You're too greedy.

634
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,780
Even the meteor can't carry all your wishes,

635
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,660
and it has run away.

636
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:41,610
Why didn't you make a wish?

637
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,570
I made a wish a long time ago.

638
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,120
If you make too many wishes, they won't come true.

639
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,730
There's a meteor! Make a wish!

640
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,260
Zhong Wei, what wish did you make?

641
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,120
My wish is that...

642
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:10,500
No, it won't come true if I tell you.

643
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:12,800
How narrow-minded.

644
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,190
So, what wish did you make?

645
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:22,960
My wish was that

646
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,890
I hope we can go to the same university,

647
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,850
major in the same subject,

648
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,000
