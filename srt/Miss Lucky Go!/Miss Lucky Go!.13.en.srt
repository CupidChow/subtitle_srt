00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,140
Yes.

Send some staff to the Companion Cats Project Team.

9
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,950
We should develop the product and the scale simultaneously.

10
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,680
By the end of the third quarter,

11
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,830
our sales will definitely increase

12
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,060

Your experience store has been open

15
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,060
for a few months now.

16
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,630
How much is the total revenue by now?

17
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:37,490
One million.

18
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,240
How much capital was invested in the early stages?

19
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:41,070
Five million.

20
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,509
If I invest,

21
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:45,580
how long will it take to get the capital back?

22
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,830
I haven't calculated that in detail yet.

23
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,160
As your father,

24
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,360
I will support any decision you make.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,530
But as an investor,

26
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,450
I need to consider the return rate on investment.

27
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,480
Besides, I'm the owner of Heng Chang,

28
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,220
and I have to be responsible for the shareholders of my company

29

As expected.

35
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,100
Since we can't expand in scale,

36
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,440
we must win with quality.

37
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,420
Every Companion Cat product in the third quarter must be exquisite.

38

Okay.

39

Don't worry.

40
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,240
I promise to complete the task.

41
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,400
Everyone,

42
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,180

43
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,210
in the second quarter.

44
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,220
In the third quarter,

45
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,329

With resources as good as Zhong Wei,

155
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,660
you should use them

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,630
You really lack ambition.

Being a good housewife isn't something just anyone can do.

Can you knit sweaters, Zhao Gu?

Both of you are enough.

In my opinion,

164
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:36,100
we should rely on ourselves.

165

How can we rely on others?

her father was actually a scientist,

191

and she got sick and passed away at a very young age.

00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,410
Her father couldn't bear to let her go,

193
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,260
so he created

194
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,700
a robot identical to her.

195
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:57,910
As to this wolf...

196
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:58,610
Chen Miren,

197
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,970
our target audience is young people.

198
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,170
They simply don't have the time or interest to learn

199
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,610
about these so-called heartwarming stories behind them.

200
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,940
Our responsibility

201
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,700
is to visually impact them

202
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,700
in the most direct way

203
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,400
and arouse their desire to purchase.

204
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,510
But I don't believe

205
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,690
that young people are synonymous with impatience.

206
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,600
They also have the desire

207
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,220
to delve into the stories

208
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,450
behind outstanding works.

209
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,350
At least the market research results

210
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,740
prove I'm right.

211
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:26,780
But...

212
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,610
You're still young,

213
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,630
and there's a lot for you to learn.

214
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,000
As you know,

215
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,480
there are many people out there

216
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,670
trying to grab the position

217
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,260
of a designer in our gold medal project team

218
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,600
I hope you can cherish this opportunity.

219
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,020
I will make the changes.

220
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,270
Hello?

221
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,480
Hello, Zhong Wei.

222
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,270
I have a dormitory safety agreement on my desk.

223
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,730
Can you give it to the dorm keeper?

224
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,180
Sure, no problem.

225
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,730
Thank you.

226
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,000

[Author: A Caged Bird]

228
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,740
As Lin Miaomiao walked out of the company's gate,

229
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,450
she saw a luxury car parked on the side of the road.

230
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,040
After the car door opened,

231
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,160
a pair of feet stepped out.

232
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,240
Get in.

233
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,380
Are you hungry?

234
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,170
Kind of.

235
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,560
Do you want to go to the restaurant we went to last time?

236
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,480
I hope you can cherish this opportunity.

237
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:14,560
Sure.

238
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,450
I saw a new movie is on in the cinema.

239
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,640
It's your favorite horror movie.

240
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,150
Anything is fine. You decide.

241
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,180
Tell me what you think.

242
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,430
I want to be quiet.

243
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,090
OK?

244
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,200
Sorry.

245
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,690
I'm in a bad mood today.

246
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,820
I want to be alone.

247
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,130
Okay.

248
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,520
Where do you want to get off?

249
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,160
I'll leave you alone.

250
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,090
Zhong Wei.

251
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,500
What do you mean?

252
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,740
Nothing.

253
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,820
I just think

254
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,550
that if you have any issues with me, you can tell me directly.

255
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:02,100
There's no need for this silent treatment.

256
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,750
Who doesn't have bad days?

257
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,410
Do I have to put on a happy face in front of you

258
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,070
even when I'm not feeling good?

259
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,460
Are you okay?

260
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:22,990
Say something.

261
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,150
I'm not okay.

262
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,700
I've been working on the revisions day and night for several days,

263
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,040
and the director still rejected them.

264
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,970
I was just in a bad mood and didn't say much,

265
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,380
and you accused me of giving you the silent treatment.

266
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,800
You've been ignoring me for days.

267
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:49,960
Don't cry.

268
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:58,760
I'm sorry.

269
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,820
I didn't know you were in a bad mood.

270
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,620
I shouldn't have blamed you.

271
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:05,910
Actually,

272
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:09,380
it's not entirely because I was feeling down.

273
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,720
The girls told me

274
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,710
not to be too proactive in a relationship,

275
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,600
or else you wouldn't cherish me.

276
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,720
So, I deliberately distanced myself from you.

277
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,380
Distanced yourself from me?

278
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,030
By replying "Oh" to me?

279
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,000
Oh.

280
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,280
This is just right.

281
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,650
Later I found that

282
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:42,220
it was not good.

283
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,810
So I was planning to adjust my strategy.

284
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,130
Oh?

00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,880

00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,850
Look at your car.

It's okay, Sir.

289
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,990
You should fix your car and go home to accompany your wife.

Let me tell you.

00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,050
The most important thing in live streaming is the content...

00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,000
If you want to learn,

356
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,860
I can teach you another day.

00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,630
I'll go get changed now.

358
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:18,390
I'll wait for you.

359
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,270
Don't wait for me.

Today is the day when the results of the Winter Olympics Ambassador

378
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:25,760
election are announced.

379
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,790
My phone is dead.

380
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,300
Use mine.

381
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:33,950
Guo Xiaoya.

382
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,370
[No. 26 Xu Miaomiao]

383
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,370
Xu Miaomiao.

384
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,690
You're in first place.

385
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,280
Your practice of holding your breath for three and a half minutes paid off.

386
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:43,740
Don't mention it.

387
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,270
I almost got banned.

388
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:46,980
Why?

389
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,890
It's a long story.

390
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,860
However,

391
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,030
thanks to our monitor's quick thinking.

392
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,250
He pulled me out of the water,

393
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,170
so I didn't get banned.

394
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,920
That's a relief.

395
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,110
Otherwise, the Winter Olympics Ambassador

396
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,210
would have been Guo Xiaoya.

397
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,830
So

398
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,310
I have to treat him to a meal.

399
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,170
A meal?

400
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:04,820
Take me with you.

401
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:05,930
Why should I bring you?

402
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:26,280
[Xu Miaomiao]

403
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,930
Thank you for today.

404
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,480
I'll treat you to dinner tomorrow.

405
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:22,730
Okay.

406
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,810
What should I wear tomorrow?

407
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,800
Aren't you being too polite?

408
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,660
Last time you helped me buy ingredients for the livestream,

409
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,600
it was a big help to me,

410
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,710
and I haven't thanked you properly.

411
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,210
Let's consider this a thank-you meal for both occasions.

412
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,300
Aren't you eating?

413
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:15,720
I'm on a diet.

414
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,550
What's wrong?

415
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,820
The author I like

416
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,090
is campaigning for my livestream.

417
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,290
After all, the Winter Olympics is a national event,

418
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,110
and it's normal for you to receive attention.

419
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,740
Besides, in the new chapters he recently released,

420
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,340
a mysterious character named Bao Zhendong

421
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,850
appeared by the female lead's side.

422
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,380
The way things are going,

423
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,080
he seems poised to replace the male lead

424
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,520
and be with the female lead.

425
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,420
It's not meant to replace the male lead, is it?

426
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,580
Isn't love full of surprises?

427
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,130
Well, this is delicious.

428
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,970
This is delicious.

429
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:11,910
Please.

430
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,020
Zhao Gu?

431
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:19,980
Hello.

432
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:20,790
OK. Thank you.

433
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,810
Isn't Zhao Gu dating Shi Hou?

434
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:25,610
Why is she here on a date with a foreigner?

435
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,880
Enjoy your food.

436
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,580
Don't be as gossip-hungry as Huang Xiaoyue.

437
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,400
The vanilla cappuccino

438
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,450
is a specialty of this café.

439
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,670
I often come here for a cup.

440
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,750
I'm looking forward to it.

441
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,940
[Sandy]

442
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,940
[Decline] [Answer]

443
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:52,590
I need to use the restroom. Sorry.

444
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:53,350
Okay.

445
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,270
Miss.

446
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:02,570
This is the earring you left here last time.

447
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,590
It's not mine.

448
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,110
I've never been here before.

449
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,600
Sorry.

450
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,470
I thought you were the one

451
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,260
with Mr. Dylan last time.

452
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,900
Sorry to keep you waiting.

453
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,020
Who were you talking to on the phone?

454
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:31,190
My mom was asking me about travel tips

455
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,030
for China.

456
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:48,900
Where's Mr. Zhong?

457
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,380
Ms. Bai.

458
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,140
Mr. Zhong went out for a business meeting.

459
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:52,990
A business meeting?

460
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,340
Ms. Bai, have a seat.

461
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,270
I'll pour you some water.

462
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,400
A business meeting?

463
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,730
Zhong Wei.

464
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:04,840
Are you hungry?

465
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,810
Are you sure this meal is for me?

466
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,530
Who else can I give it to?

467
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,400
Tell me.

468
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,240
Is there a possibility

469
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:29,720
it's for my dad?

470
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,160
How could it be?

471
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,390
And then my dad isn't here.

472
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,360
Don't you trust me at all?

473
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,000
These are all my dad's favorite dishes.

474
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,970
Isn't your dad out for something?

475
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,390
That doesn't mean we should waste it, right?

476
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:48,920
Here.

477
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,940
Don't you hate wasting?

478
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:50,810
Here, eat more.

479
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,900
[Miss Charm]

480
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,220
Come to my dad's office.

481
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,020
There's something delicious.

482
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:00,620
Eat up.

483
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,820
Add a pair of chopsticks.

484
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:02,540
For whom?

485
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,440
My girlfriend.

486
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,550
I heard Ran is here.

487
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,290
Hello.

488
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,150
Two pairs.

489
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:08,780
No problem.

490
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,150
Eat slowly.

491
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,670
Eat more if she likes it.

492
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,140
Here.

493
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:18,850
Thank you. Sis.

494
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,350
You're welcome.

495
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,160
I didn't know

496
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,660
Chen Miren is good at flattering people.

497
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,030
I didn't expect that, either.

498
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,630
Sis.

499
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,240
You're so beautiful

500
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,550
and so good at cooking.

501
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,310
There must be a lot of people chasing you.

502
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,350
She's quite serious about flattering her.

503
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,250
Chen Miren.

504
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,550
That's enough.

505
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,680
What do you mean?

506
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,360
There are indeed many people chasing me.

507
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,840
But I'm devoted.

508
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,380
The man I love is mature,

509
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,690
handsome,

510
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,060
and full of manly aura.

511
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,420
Can you eat properly?

512
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,570
I think it's quite romantic.

513
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,630
How did you get together?

514
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,920
It was a romantic rainy night.

515
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,150
I wore a white dress

516
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:20,940
and walked on a path full of cherry blossoms.

517
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,710
Suddenly,

518
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,470
I almost fell.

519
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,140
At the critical moment,

520
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,480
a strong man

521
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,400
held me in his arms.

522
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,660
Mom, do you have any drinks?

523
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,070
Mom?

524
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,240
I'm not his biological mom.

525
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,560
Mom.

526
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,500
Although you're not my biological mom,

527
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:42,890
in my heart,

528
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,830
you're already my biological mom.

529
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,210
Let's not recall

530
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,450
my dad's love history.

531
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,880
Do you have drinks?

532
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,380
I want some too.

533
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,130
You eat first.

534
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:51,790
I'll buy it later.

535
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,040
Mr. Zhong.

536
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,650
Director Yu?

537
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:03,010
Director Yu.

538
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,260
Let's eat together.

539
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,190
Sorry.

540
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:07,480
There seems to be no seat left.

541
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:11,700
Mr. Zhong is not here.

542
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,090
I'll come back later.

543
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,880
I'll get back to work.

544
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,830
Thank you. Sis...

545
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,480
Thank you. Auntie.

546
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,090
Thank you for treating me.

547
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:26,800
Mom.

548
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,500
I don't have a son like you.

549
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,380
Where are our drinks?

550
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:31,610
Buy it yourself.

551
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,930
Director Yu.

552
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,620
Chen Miren.

553
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,240
What's your relationship with Zhong Wei?

554
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,510
He is

555
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,730
my boyfriend.

556
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,280
But I promise

557
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,420
I didn't leak any of

558
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,250
our team's business secrets.

559
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,280
I separated personal and professional.

560
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,550
Director Yu, don't worry.

561
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:56,800
OK.

562
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,430
I'll separate personal and professional, too.

563
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,880
It's finally done.

564
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,020
Oh no.

565
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,570
It's so late.

566
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,830

but didn't even dare to like it.

Not really.

I slept for 20 minutes at four.

603

At 4 a.m. this morning,

I thought it was thundering.

605
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,910
I was going to close the window.

606

But there was no thunder at all.

607
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,630
It was the sound Chen Miran made when she was asleep.
