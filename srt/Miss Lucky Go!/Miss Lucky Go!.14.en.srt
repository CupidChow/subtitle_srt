She left as soon as her boyfriend summoned her.

This kind of character

35
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,350
can't even be the female lead in novels.

36
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,820
Indeed.

37
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,700
The heroine in novels

38
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,960
would beckon with her finger

39
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,220
and the male lead would come.

40
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,670

What's wrong?

50
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:22,460
The status of the male lead was forcibly decreased.

51
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,490
It's fine if the supporting female and male characters are together.

52
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,720
But the supporting female character is so independent and strong.

53
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,140
How could she tell her colleagues

54
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,450

00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,920

Doesn't she want to succeed

All the boys in our class are weak

193
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,510
and lack exercise.

194
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,130
It's even hard for them to climb three floors.

195
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,090

Will you be participating in the competition?

203
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,760
Of course. Why not?

204
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,460
Your mood definitely changed

205
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,680

206

She's always drawing for her unscrupulous boss in the dorm.

It's okay.

Don't be afraid.

And she was very

253

passionate towards me.

Laugh if you want.

389
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,600
I ranked last and held back our class.

390
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,520
I admit it.

391
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,660
It's about participation.

392
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:41,890
You're already great.

393
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,800
Besides, who said you are the last?

394

Someone is even slower than us?

Something happened to Zhao Gu and Luo Si.

401
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,550
Don't cry.

402

Are you okay?

403
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,490

We're catching the adulterers.

406

What do you mean?

407
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,180
I told you the Poetry Society was here for inspiration.

Apologize to Weijing.

411
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,770
For what?

412
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,910
You should apologize to her.

413
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,340
Why should we apologize?

414
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,160
Exactly.

You hit people without hesitation.

416
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,290
I've never seen such a barbaric person.

417
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,320
You should have thought of this day

418
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,580
when you behaved so inappropriately with another person's boyfriend.

419

Apologize.

427
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,180
Then we're done.

428

What are you doing here?

431
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,430
I had to pee. I drank too much drinks.

432
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,850
I just went to the toilet.

433
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,570
Who knew I would come across such a melodramatic situation?

I just wanted to punch him.

436
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,270
I didn't expect them to come so soon.

437
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,890
They bullied me.

438
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,640
They don't have moral ethics.

Yes, apologize.

are all Luo Si's own business.

That's not acceptable too.

Fang Mao is doing this
