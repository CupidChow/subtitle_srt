Chen Miren.

6
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,340
Am I very overbearing,

7
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,300
self-righteous

8
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,120
and self-centered?

9
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,230
Why did you ask this question?

10
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,979
The result of the third quarter has come out.

11
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:36,970
It's awful.

12
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,140
It's all right.

13
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,350
There will be the fourth quarter.

14
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,570
As long as we work hard together,

15
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,550
we can make it.

16
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,430
As you said,

17
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,140
we should work hard together,

18
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,440
but nearly all the people in the team have joined other teams.

19
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,880
Chao has been left alone in the team because of me.

Chen Miren.

21
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,070
Do you think I'm such a loser?

22
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,400
Well, do you think you did something wrong?

23
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,780
If you think you did something wrong,

24
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,759
just go to see them, admit your mistake,

25
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,000
and ask them to come back.

26
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,660
Will they come back?

27
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,240
Just give it a try, and we'll know.

28
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,720
Everything is possible.

29
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,600
Okay.

30
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:21,900
Let's go.

31
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,880
You asked me to come

32
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,329
not to tell me to give up OHH, right?

33
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,300
Even if I tell you to give it up,

34
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:35,220
would you listen to me?

35
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,260
You've always been like this since childhood.

36
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,350
Once you've made a decision,

37
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,690
no one can make you change your mind.

38
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,410
This is your strength,

39
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,310
and also your weakness.

40
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,130
Couldn't one persist in something?

41
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,940
But when you persist in your own ideas,

42
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,520
can you also try to

43
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,990
understand others' persistence?

44
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,270
If you can try to understand

45
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,780
others' opinions and ideas,

46
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,560
it can broaden your vision

47
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,860
and make you understand this world

48
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,290
from multiple perspectives.

49
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,950
If you act in disregard of other people's opinions,

50
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,040
you will only make your team

51
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:14,960
fall apart.

52
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,720
No, no! None of them are okay.

53
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,840
Redraw it.

54
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:42,820
Director,

55
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,550
is your requirement too high?

56
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:46,230
I think those design drafts are good.

57
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,680
Just select one of them randomly,

58
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,829
and it'll still be better than other teams' design in our company.

59
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,110
The third quarter's promotion

60
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,000
has all been arranged in the fourth quarter.

61
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,410
If we can't design several

62
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,260
hot-selling products in the fourth quarter,

63
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,630
I'm afraid the situation won't be optimistic.

64
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,490
I've reflected on myself a lot these days.

65
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,230
I was so stubborn that

66
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,900
I didn't listen to your advice carefully.

67
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,730
I also ignored your feelings,

68
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,690
which led to failure.

69
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,510
I have to take the blame.

70
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,230
I'd like to

71
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,980
apologize to you all.

72
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,230
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,260
Today, I've asked you to come

74
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,010
in order to tell you that

75
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,330
in the fourth quarter,

76
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,560
we will resume our work,

77
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:34,720
adjust the plan,

78
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,820
and start all over again.

79
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,520
I sincerely hope that you can come back

80
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,010
and join us again.

81
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,430
I also hope that

82
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:44,730
you can trust me one more time.

83
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,630
Okay. With what you said,

84
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,260
I'll accept it if you ask me to revise the draft.

85
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,970
Right. I got tired of staying in the team next door long ago.

86
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,360
I've long wanted to come back.

87
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,560
Mr. Zhong, we trust you.

for the factory to process the products.

108
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,600
Okay. I'll write it down.

I'll send them to you at once when the goods arrive.

112
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,650
So I have a gift for design, right?

113
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,020
Of course.

114
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,230
I've said it 100 times.

115
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,900
When I was in Heng Chang,

116
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,170
I almost thought that I was not suitable to be a designer.

117
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:01,870
Bah!

118
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,980
That's because you encountered workplace mental control.

119
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,260
Don't deny yourself

120
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,330

155

Of course you should go to your favorite company.

157
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,500
Your favorite company is still Heng Chang, right?

Actually, no matter where I go,

159

165

What can he announce?

166
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,070
If we buy his action figures,

167
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,620

is a world-famous

190
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,080
top-level designer for action figures.

191
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,210
Hasn't this old guy announced his retirement?

192
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,840
How did Yu Dawei persuade him to do this?

193
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:33,890
Well, Zhong Wei,

194
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,070
I think these several design drafts are pretty good.

195
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,910
No.

196
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,580
They are just so ordinary.

197
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,350
It's been a few days.

198
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,980
You didn't like any of them.

199
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,370
What kind of design do you want?

200
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,300
I don't require too many design skills,

201
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,900
but they need to have their own style.

202
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,890
Their works

203
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,500
can reflect something they want to express,

204
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,730
and they can also make people feel touched.

205
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:04,620
Most importantly,

206
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,220
they need to make people feel warm.

207
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,840
This kind of person you described

208
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,430
is a top and chief designer in the world.

209
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,760
Where can we find him?

210
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,310
Do you think I can do it?

211
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,640
Is Chen Miren okay?

212
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:36,620
Sure.

213
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,190
Fine. If you think she's okay, she's okay.

214
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:44,980
As I said last time,

215
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,780
I've changed the design. It's not okay.

216
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,700
What should we do now?

217
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,700
There's nothing we can do.

218
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,050
Well, let's just do nothing.

219
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,620
Let me introduce a new colleague to you.

220
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,040
Hello, everyone.

221
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,270
I'm Chen Miren.

222
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,210
Nice to meet you.

223
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,500
Hello.

224
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,010
Hello.

225
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:20,700
Welcome.

226
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,380
Welcome.

227
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,390
What's its name?

228
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,140
Lucky.

229
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,670
Come here.

230
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:58,500
Come on.

231
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,700
The object which can accompany a person

232
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,450
is not necessarily a cute animal.

233
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,210
An old TV set

234
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,760
and a watch that has stopped working

235
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,870
can both become the objects for accompanying us.

236
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,900
That makes sense.

237
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,860
Each of us

238
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,310
has an old item that has accompanied us for a long time.

239
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,650
If we make them into action figures,

240
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,090
it will definitely arouse people's feelings for the old days.

241
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,280
We can give it life,

242
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,390
anthropomorphize it,

243
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,010
and create a complete world view.

244
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,340
Yes.

245
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,000
We can also randomly offer some small gifts for buying our products,

246
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,670
for example, a cartoon band-aid,

247
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,590
or a mini heating pad,

248
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,120
so that the customers who have bought our products

249
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,620
can truly feel

250
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,740
the warmth of being accompanied.

251
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,550
That's a creative idea.

252
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,390
I think the gift can be a hot-water bag.

253
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,540
It's good, right?

254
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,140
You might as well give our customers a heater.

255
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,360
Then I'll give them a thermos.

256
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,110
To make goji berries tea?

257
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,270
I'll give them ginger tea with brown sugar.

258
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,490
I'll give them a pressure cooker.

259
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,000
I'll put the pressure cooker inside here.

260
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:18,710
No.

261
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,400
I have to put this inside the pressure cooker.

262
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,910
Then I'll pour your goji berries tea into it.

263
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,890
Then I'll...

264
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,170
That's too dangerous.

265
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:25,860
For this cat,

266
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,980
actually, I think we can add some

267
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,320
other elements to it.

268
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,360
This seems a bit monotonous.

269
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,200
Come on, Mei.

270
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,230
Come on. Put it there.

271
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,130
Here you are.

272
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,140
Here you are.

273
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,500
Thank you.

274
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,410
Here you are.

275
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,570
Come on. Hurrg up.

276
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,700
Eat something.

277
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,340
Come on. One box of food for each of us.

278
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,700
Do you think

279
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,710
we're having a good time

280
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:15,180
with our boss' future wife?

281
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,650
It's the first time that I've felt so happy staying up to have a meeting.

282
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:24,420
Lin Miaomiao was the daughter of Chief of Lotus Sect on Mount Tianshan.

283
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,180
She was the 48th successor of Lotus Palm.

284
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:28,730
She was extremely beautiful.

285
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,130
Those who had seen her face

286
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,920
were all shocked by her beauty.

287
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,600
We agreed that this network novel should highlight the heroine.

288
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,310
Why did you create such a dramatic background?

289
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,200
She was extremely beautiful?

290
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,630
Shouldn't the key be that

291
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,090
the heroine fulfilled her dream

292
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,490
and saved the world

293
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,700
through her own efforts?

294
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,260
Just revise it.

295
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:48,790
Okay.

296
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,170
Lin Miaomiao was the adopted daughter

297
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,840
of the old man who sold salted fish at the foot of Mount Tianshan.

298
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,610
[The Swordswoman Who Went Down Mount Tianshan]

299
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,540
She looked plain,

300
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,890
but she was highly skilled at drying salted fish in the sunshine.

301
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,680
What are you doing?

302
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:12,680
I'm going to tutor you.

303
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,950
Haven't you said that having a meal together,

304
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,370
going shopping and watching movies

305
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,420
are all boring,

306
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,920
so you want to have a date in the library to find the feeling of freshness?

307
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,680
You even believe in

308
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,100
such nonsense of having a date in the library?

309
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:24,820
Chen Miren.

310
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,260
Why don't you change your name to Chen Naive?

311
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:30,750
Come back.

312
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,430
Why don't we go back to the company to work overtime?

313
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,340
We'll need to submit the proposal in a week.

314
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,860
You don't want to lose

315
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,090
your bet with Yu Dawei, do you?

316
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,540
The exam will be held in a week.

317
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,800
Do you want to be

318
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,780
a designer who can't even get a college diploma?

319
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,690
Lin Miaomiao was pushed off the cliff.

320
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,030
At the critical moment,

321
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,730
a figure flew over to her

322
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,030
and carried Lin Miaomiao in his arms,

323
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,940
spinning and jumping.

324
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,290
Lin Miaomiao looked up.

325
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,990
She saw Bao Zhendong's handsome face.

326
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,430
What are you doing?

327
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,550
The hero showed up to save the beauty.

328
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,090
The heroine could protect herself.

329
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:14,910
Did she need him to rescue her?

330
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,550
Revise it.

331
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,150
First subject, Math.

332
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:17,980
Come on.

333
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,090
Now we know that the curve Y in the upper half plane

334
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,820
equals...

335
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,490
What's the use of higher mathematics after we learn it?

336
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,340
If we go out to buy food,

337
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,220
we don't need such complicated algorithms.

338
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,480
And any point on the curve,

339
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,800
M, X...

340
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,060
Does my hair look good?

341
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,030
In terms of value, the gradient of the main oblique line

342
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:39,960
is equal to this curve.

343
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,680
Let me tell you.

344
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:42,610
Chen Miren.

345
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,030
You talk too much today.

346
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,540
Do you want to learn?

347
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:50,900
Yes.

348
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,120
Bao Zhendong looked at Lin Miaomiao's

349
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,710
blushing and cute face.

350
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,060
He couldn't help but hug her, lower his head

351
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,890
and kiss her.

352
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,230
What are you doing this time?

353
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,470
It's the third chapter.

354
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:13,910
It's time to kiss, right?

355
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,470
Being faced with the formidable enemy,

356
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,710
the whole martial arts world was in danger.

357
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,410
As the heroine,

358
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,520
how could I focus on the romantic relationship?

359
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:23,780
Delete it.

360
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,260
Where is it?

361
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:36,980
Here.

362
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,460
Write it.

363
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,260
Done.

364
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:45,640
Go on.

365
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,740
Bao Zhendong looked at Lin Miaomiao's

366
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,210
blushing and cute face,

367
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,000
he couldn't help but lower his head

368
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,990
and say this by her ear,

369
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,330
"Gor for it!"

370
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,510
"The future of the entire martial arts world

371
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:03,930
will depend on you."

372
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,590
I can't write anymore.

373
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,770
I have no inspiration now.

That's more like it.

378

Si, why are you in such a hurry?

379
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,090
Mrs. Fang,

380
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,590
I'm going to review the lessons with my classmates.

381

I'm going to be late.

382

Don't be in such a hurry.

383
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,190
I've bought you a garment.

384
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,930
Come on. Try it on.

385
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,120
You bought it for me?

386
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,900
Try it on.

387
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,570
Thank you, Mrs. Fang.

388
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,760
Can I try it on after I arrive at the school?

389
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,950
I'm really going to be late.

390
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,370
Okay. Just go.

391
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:49,950
Thank you.

392
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,410
Alright. I got it.

393
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,380
I'll wait for you in front of the library at noon.

394

When you are sad,

it will be there to comfort you.

406
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,850
You two will grow up together

407

and see the world together.

408
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,230
Sometimes, it makes a small mistake,

409
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,130
and you will educate it.

410
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,770
But as long as it comes over to lick your hands

411

and act in a cute way in front of you,

all the unhappiness

413
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,280
will be forgotten.

They're like friends and family.

415
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,570
How come you have so many thoughts on this?

416
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,540
Come on. Let me show this to you.

417
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:56,730
This photo

418
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,760
was taken when Bai had its first birthday.

419
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,380
I made this cake for it personally.

420
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:01,690
Bai liked the cake very much.

421
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,740
And this photo was taken while we were traveling.

422
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,590
That was the first time that Bai had gone on a trip.

423
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,990
Everything was novel to it.

424
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,290
I even couldn't stop it from running around.

425
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,540
And this one, too.

426
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,180
This photo was taken when Bai was scared

427
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,190
by its own snores

428
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,860
during its sleep.

429
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:16,870
Yes, yes, yes.

430
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,510
And that stray cat at school, too.

431
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,750
Thought it looks small,

432
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,800
its snores are lound.

433
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,310
Look at this. It's hilarious.

434
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,910
Isn't it cute?

And this one, too.

436
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,050
This is the last time I saw Bai.

437
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,530
I didn't even have the chance to hug it before it passed away.

438
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,260
But at least,

439
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,220
you spent the best time with it.

440
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:47,670
Don't be sad.

441
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,910
Actually, I'm lucky

442
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,130
to have met Bai.

443
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,470
If I can be with it again,

444
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,060
I hope I can spend more time with it,

Then we can check on our future partners mutally.

Mutually.

00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,160
Yes, mutually.

My world is big.

It sounds good.

It can also enhance customer viscosity,

That's right.

00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,350
For the goods of the third quarter,

745
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,020
we talked about returning the products.

746
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:49,980
Didn't we agree that

747
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,260
I would let you return them

748
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,170
after the fourth quarter?

749
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,179
I have no choice.

750
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,679
Companion Cats are selling well now.

751
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,440
I need to purchase more pieces.

752
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,670
I really need some money to purchase them.

753
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:01,330
Ms. Du,

754
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,400
how about this?

755
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,930
Just give me a few more days.

756
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,530
As soon as the fourth quarter ends,

757
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,590
I'll transfer the money to you at once.

758
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,530
We're old friends.

759
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:11,140
I'll give you a few more days.

760
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,450
Thank you, Ms. Du.

761
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:23,090
Cheers!

762
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,270
Zhong Wei.

763
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,870
Companion Cats are selling extremely well this time.

764
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,000
Will I get a commission?

765
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,070
Chen Miren has the final say.

766
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,190
Yes.

767
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,300
Really?

768
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,300
You've owed me 10 barbecue meals and 25 cups of milk tea,

769
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,730
and your commission can offset the money for buying them.

770
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,540
We are classmates.

771
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,900
We should help each other.

772
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,850
Our class monitor is right.

773
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,460
You two pairs of couples

774
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,180
should stop showing affection here, okay?

775
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:59,460
Have you ever considered the feelings of single people like us?

776
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,690
What's wrong with being single?

777
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,420
I think it's good to be single.

778
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,290
It makes one feel free and happy.

779
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,070
You can do many things which you want to do.

780
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,100
Luo Si.

781
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,060
I can't believe that

782
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,780
you said something like that.

783
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,750
You've changed a lot, huh?

784
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,970
Do you think everyone is like you,

785
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:16,590
who persist in waiting in the grove to discover gossip news all the time?

786
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,980
Why are you talking about me now?

787
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,090
Alright.

788
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,580
We haven't gathered like this for a long time.

789
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:23,490
Let's stop arguing.

790
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:25,020
Zhao Gu.

791
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,650
I've heard from Xu Miaomiao that

792
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,080
you're going to study abroad.

793
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:28,780
You're the first student

794
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,130
in our class who is going to study abroad.

795
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,250
I suggest that

796
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,520
we should drink a toast to Zhao Gu to say goodbye.

797
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,140
Cheers!

798
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,530
Cheers!

799
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,160
Cheers!

800
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,760
No need to say goodbye.

801
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:37,590
I'm not going.

802
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,110
You're not going?

803
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,040
Really?

804
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,400
Didn't you say that you would leave next week?

805
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,390
Why are you not going?

806
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,280
I just suddenly felt that

807
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:47,240
it was good

808
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:48,670
to stay.

809
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,610
Zhao Gu.

810
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,680
Let's drink for Zhao Gu's decision

811
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,330
to stay.

812
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,920
Cheers!

813
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,660
What about Harris?

814
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,540
We broke up.

815
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,790
I suggested it.

816
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,940
What did he say?

817
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:11,250
He said,

818
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,870
"You'll regret it."

819
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,080
Then what did you say?

820
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:16,970
What I said is very unpleasant to the ears.

821
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,080
You won't want to hear it.

822
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,400
Zhao Gu.

823
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,280
Actually, I'm quite curious.

824
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,420
About what?

825
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,500
What kind of boy do you like?

826
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:30,730
Someone like Wu Dabo.

827
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,770
What?

828
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:33,670
Wu Da...

829
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,780
I never thought that

830
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,820
you would like someone like Wu Dabo.

831
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,160
So in the election campaign of Campus Ambassador,

832
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,740
you also voted

833
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:46,390
for Wu Dabo, didn't you?

834
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,380
You four besties

835
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,370
should stop whispering to each other.

836
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,830
Come on. Let's chat together.

837
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,440
Thank you again for your help two days ago.

838
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:04,990
Come on.

839
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:07,640
May the Companion Cats sell well! Cheers!

840
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:09,710
Cheers!

841
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:15,860
♫I don't need to doubt that I've fallen completely♫
