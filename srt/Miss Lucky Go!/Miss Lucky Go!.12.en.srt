The reason I pack my leftovers and wear old clothes

00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,349
in the final exam.

378
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:14,170
Okay.

379
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:24,109
[Macroeconomics]

380
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:15,210
Alright.

381
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,530
Let's continue.

382
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:17,460
Chen Miren.

383
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,339
You will definitely lose.

384
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,720
I think we can be together for 80 years.

385
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,000
The optimized investment ratio...

386
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,580
The sales figures of the second quarter is out.

387
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:39,780
I've seen it.

388
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,060
The sales of Companion Cats has quintupled.

389
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,630
It's five times!

390
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,680
You came here

391
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,150
just to listen to my compliment?

392
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:56,910
Not really.

393
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,150
I just want to see if you regret it.

394
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,190
If you do,

395
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,340
you can invest now.

396
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,060
I can accept it unwillingly.

397
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,290
I won't make a decision

398
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,800
until I see the sales for the third quarter.

399
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:13,980
Okay.

400
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,440
Zhong,

401
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,940
I heard that your son Zhong Wei

402
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:31,860
opened OHH Performance Store?

403
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,780
Yes, he's doing quite well.

404
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,850
Zhong,

405
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,030
you supported your son's business

406
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,650
with company funds.

407
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,730
Is this abusing of power for personal gains?

408
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,730
Listen.

409
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,240
Don't misunderstand me.

410
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,800
He did ask me to invest.

411
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,900
But for the sake of the company,

412
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,160
I didn't invest.

413
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,220
I didn't spend a penny of the company.

414
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,460
Where did he get so much money

415
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,710
at such a young age?

416
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,150
He is capable.

417
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,430
He got the investment himself

418
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,570
and opened his own shop.

419
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,310
What's wrong?

420
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,040
Did he eat the rice in your bowl?

421
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,060
Okay. Fine.

422
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,020
Your son is the best

423
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,980
and most capable one.

424
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,260
I was wrong.

425
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,470
Calm down, Zhong.

426
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,680
Don't always be so isolated.

427
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,580
You should be high-sighted, high-positioning,

428
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:16,850
and have noble sentiment.

429
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,790
We need to learn from the young

430
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,980
and improve our thinking.

431
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,640
Otherwise,

432
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,520
we'll be eliminated by the society sooner or later.

433
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,600
Impressive. I admire you.

434
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,240
Don't be mad.

435
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,910
The sales figures for the second quarter are out.

436
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,960
Our department's performance

437
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,500
is still number one.

438
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,330
Okay.

439
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,890
Keep following my instructions

440
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,440
in the next quarter.

441
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,360
No one can drop the ball.

442
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,300
Am I understood?

443
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:42,890
Yes.

444
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,260
I heard that the Companion Cats project team next door

445
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,790
also has satisfactory result this time.

446
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,770
Yes, they're the top three of the company.

447
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,380
Let's see how long can they last.

448
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,660
The strange offline performance store

449
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,010
is just a publicity stunt.

450
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:58,960
In my opinion,

451
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,290
once the customers' novelty wears off, it will go bankrupt.

452
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,120
Exactly.

453
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,140
Zhong Wei did everything he wanted

454
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,160
just because

455
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,420
he's the son of our boss.

456
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,000
If we did everything

457
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,370
out of our personal interest,

458
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,790
we would have been fired.

459
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,200
As a kid who hasn't graduated from university,

460
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,610
he knows nothing about the market.

461
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,940
Zhong Wei is much better than you.

462
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,120
Chen Miren, what did you say?

463
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,820
I said

464
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,880
it's so easy

465
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,590
to defeat them.

466
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,680
Enough.

467
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,480
Instead of flattering me here,

468
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,910
you'd better do

469
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:33,770
what I told you to.

470
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,810
Unlike the leader of other team,

471
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,640
I'm much more strict.

472
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:39,840
Chen Miren.

473
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,290
How is the Mirage of the Forest

474
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,410
going?

475
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,920
I promise to submit the manuscript this week.

476
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,580
Very good.

477
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,020
Are you waiting for someone?

478
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,290
Chen Miren.

479
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,080
Chen Miren.

480
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,660
Zhong Wei and Chen Miren...

481
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,910
What's their relationship?

482
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,900
They're definitely not just classmates.

483
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,320
Chen Miren.

484
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,620
Why are you avoiding me?

485
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,830
You have no idea.

486
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:34,930
Yu Dawei

487
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,200
hates you so much.

488
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,040
I don't want to lose my job.

489
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,190
I know.

490

Chen Miren.

491
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,620
Are you trying to have a secret affair

492
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,720
with me again?

493
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,020
Keep your voice down.

494
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,160
I read the company's rules a few days ago.

495
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,540
Office romance is strictly prohibited.

496
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,440
Once it's found out,

497
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,420
one of the couple has to be fired.

498
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,330
You are not gonna be fired.

499
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,050
Then I must be the one.

500
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,640
How come?

501
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,170
I'm not an employee in Heng Chang.

502
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,500
That's right.

503
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,600
But your family owns Heng Chang.

504

505
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,330
You're doing a great deal of damage to my self-esteem.

506
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,110
You know?

507
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,730
It feels like I'm not allowed to be seen by others as your boyfriend.

508
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:11,630
No way.

509
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,510
I am the one who reaches out for you.

510
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,110
Let's go.

I'm hungry.

512
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:17,990
What do you want to eat?

513
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:19,690
Braised chicken with rice.

514
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,880
I miss it.

515
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,320
Let's go and eat something nice.

516
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,980
This is delicious. Eat more.

517

And this.

00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,190
This is their specialty.

519
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,180
Juice for table two is ready.

520
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:39,830
I'll get it.

521
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,380
Guess

who confessed first?

523
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,180
There's no doubt.

524
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,760
It must be that girl.

525
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,230
The boy's so handsome.

526
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,130
How can she be with him if she didn't take the initiative?

527
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,220
That's right.

00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,290
What's wrong?

Nothing.

531
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,110
Let's dig in.

532
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,730
There's something going on.

for five minutes.

537
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,250
This is unusual.

538
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,740
It's just the attraction

539
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,850
caused by hormone secretion.

540
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,510
It's simple.

541
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,080
You're quite the straight-A student.

Do you think you can help me

569
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,170
by randomly buying some on the street?

570
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,050

He helped me solve the factory problems.

He carried me back to the hotel when I was drunk.
