I‘ll announce the results of this test.

00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,580
The first place goes to Zhong Wei.

7
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,180
He obtained a perfect score of 100.

8
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:26,420
What? 100?

9
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,020
That's just insane!

10
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,820
This exam was so chanllenging.

11
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:30,340
Yeah.

12
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,660
The second place goes to Zhao Gu.

13
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,570
Zhao Gu, you got second place.

14
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,570
I thought I did a thorough check this time.

15
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,970
There's another student today

Huang Xiaoyue, who didn't pass the last entrance exam,

19
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:49,460
has achieved

20
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,220
an excellent score of 85 today.

21

Let's give him a round of applause!

22
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,480
As for Chen Miren,

23
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,400
I won't disclose the specific score here.

24
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,580
If you use your nap time

25
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,760
to learn from Zhong Wei,

26
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,650
you wouldn't have ended up with the lowest score.

27
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:12,460
If you don't put in more effort,

28
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,870
you might as well expect to fail the final exam.

29
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,600
Alright, let's continue with the lesson.

Why do you have my notebook?

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,370
Chen Miren gave it to me.

37
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,040
Zhong Wei, you really are a genius.

38
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,180
The summary is very accurate.

39
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,640
What about the area between x equals zero,

40
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:41,310
x equals one,

41
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,570
and the entire area under the x-axis?

42
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,730
Stop staring and pay attention to the class.

43
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,120
Zhong Wei, what's going on?

44
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,160
I was discussing this area just now...

45
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,100
Okay.

46
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,120
Now I've drawn the blue curve.

47
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,450
How do we calculate this area?

48
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,780
Is something wrong?

49
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,650
Why did you give my notebook to someone else?

50
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,510
I told you.

51
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,990
I'm used to relying on myself.

52
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,420
Fine.

53
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,730
Then why are you always avoiding me?

54
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,670
I'm just maintaining the distance that ordinary classmates should have.

55
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,510
Ordinary classmates?

56
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,140
Our relationship is just that of ordinary classmates？

00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,280
Of course.

What do you mean? Speak clearly.

59
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,120
Zhong Wei, behaving like this will only make me dislike you more.

Let others sing.

186
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,580
Others? Who?

187
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,660
They're playing games or gossiping.

188
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,190
Besides me, no one here want to sing.

189
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,200
[I miss you so much it's driving me crazy. When I call you, there's another beautiful girl in your arms.]

190
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,280
Come on, lst's eat.

191
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,980
Chen Miren, where is Xu Miaomiao?

192
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,580
She said she has something else to do, so she's not coming.

193
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,610
She just doesn't want to.

194
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,890
Being the campus belle,

195
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:18,860
it's a bit beneath her

196
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,820
to sing in a karaoke room

197
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,630
where you can sing all afternoon with a coupon, isn't it?

198
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,840
Look, Zhong Wei isn't here either.

199
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:25,730
Five fives.

200
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,360
Next time we plan a team building activity,

201
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,490
can we go for something a bit more upscale?

202
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,450
[I miss you so much it's driving me crazy. When I call you, there's another beautiful girl in your arms.]

203
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,190
Zhong Wei, you're here.

204
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,890
Zhong Wei, come and sit.

205
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:39,940
This way.

206
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,080
I don't like sitting in the middle.

207
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:54,450
[I miss you so much it's driving me crazy. When I call you, there's another beautiful girl in your arms.]

208
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,370
You don't like sitting in the middle,

209
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,030
but you sit in the middle of me and Chen Miren.

210
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:07,500
The supreme luxury strawberry ftuit plate is here.

211
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,530
What's wrong?

212
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,990
[I miss you so much it's driving me crazy. When I call you, there's another beautiful girl in your arms.]

213
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,700
I didn't order it.

214
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:14,980
I ordered it.

215
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,840
This is the basic style of a rich second-generation.

216
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,220
Everyone, don't be shy. Come on, let's eat.

217
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,230
Let's eat.

218
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,370
Chen Miren, don't you like strawberries?

219
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,490
My taste has changed.

220
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:41,030
Chen Miren, are you angry with me?

221
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:41,730
No,

222
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:42,850
why would I do that?

223
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,110
Why would I be angry with you?

224
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,570
Okay, then order a song for me.

225
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,470
Can't you order it yourself?

226
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,270
[I miss you so much it's driving me crazy. When I call you, there's another beautiful girl in your arms.]

227
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,120
It's too far.

228
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,220
Can you order the 'Single Dog's Song' for me?

229
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,060
You...

230
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,770
I'll order. I know this song too.

231
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,500
[I miss you so much it's driving me crazy. When I call you, there's another beautiful girl in your arms.]

232
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:08,140
[Two orioles sing among the emerald willows. You don't have a girlfriend yet.]

233
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,110
Let's sing this song together.

234
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,420
But there is a rule:

235
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,670
those who have a partner can't sing.

236
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,340
OK.

237
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,220
Two orioles sing among the emerald willows,

238
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:18,340
you don't have a girlfriend yet.

239
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,400
Male and female rabbits run side by side,

240
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,220
you don't have a boyfriend yet.

241
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,320
The river flows eastward in spring,

242
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,260
you don't have a boyfriend yet.

243
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,900
I wonder how much sorrow you can have,

244
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,270
I don't have a girlfriend yet.

245
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,340
Pull out the knife, and the water keeps flowing,

246
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,360
you don't have a boyfriend yet.

247
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,440
Raise your glass to dispel the worries,

248
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,380
I don't have a girlfriend yet.

249
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:54,690
I'm also a single dog.

250
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,780
Chen Miren, I can't believe Zhong Wei is still single.

251
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,260
The girls in our school will be crazy.

252
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,020
I don't have a girlfriend yet.

253
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,410

[Xiaoyue Gossip Forum]

255
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,580
Zhong Wei is still single.

256
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,550
The river flows eastward in spring…

257
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:15,490
[Jiajia.]

258
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,910
Zhong Wei is really single.

259
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,780
Then I have a chance.

260
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,000
So, the rumor about the girl with the sports car at the gate

261
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:20,330
[Little Lady.]

262
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,740
being Zhong Wei's secret girlfriend

263
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,980
for eight years

[Love in Ancient Times.]

265
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,500
turned out to be false.

266
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,340
I heard that

267
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,220
Zhong Wei's true love is actually Huang Xiaoyue.

268
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,340
Oh my god, the height difference between them makes them so adorable...

269
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,520
What are they talking about...

270
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,760
Xu Miaomiao…

271
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:10,740
Why is Xu Miaow...

272
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,830
Slow down.

273
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,940
Turn left. The dorm is on the left.

274
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,200
Are you okay?

275
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,090
Get up.

276
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,600
It's weird. Where are Zhong Wei and Chen Miren?

277
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,450
Tang, help Huang Xiaoyue up.

278
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,710
Be careful.

280
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,820
What makes you so happy today?

281
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,640
Tell me.

282
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,160
I...

283
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,240
My double chin dissappears today.

284
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,880
Your double chin is still there.

285
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,090
My mom increased my allowance today,

286
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:20,030
and at the cafeteria,

287
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,220
the auntie gave me two extra scoops of meat.

288
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,240
Chen Miren,

289
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,870
you seem to be easily pleased.

290
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,180
Zhong Wei.

291
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,780
The girl who brought you water

292
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,800
at the gym last time,

293
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,840
she's not your girlfriend, right?

294
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,850
You mean Bai Ran?

295
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,500
Are you jealous?

296
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,390
I'm not jealous.

297
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,770
I'm just curious.

298
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,670
Bai Ran is my one of my family members.

299
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:57,970
Family?

300
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,520
Sister.

301
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,830
Very sweet.

302
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,070
Chen Miren.

303
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,850
Why are you so happy when I don't have a girlfriend?

304
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:14,990
No.

305
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,090
I just suddenly remembered

306
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,560
how to solve a calculus problem.

307
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,170
Right, it involves the Pythagorean theorem:

308
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,110
a squared plus b squared equals c squared.

309
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,060
Isn't that the question in middle school?

310
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,860
Slow down. Don't fall down.

311
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,500

00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,240
Bao Jiaguo.

313
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,120
You didn't join the group activity,

314
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,119
and you're running around here?

315
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,210
It's all because of the Winter Olympics ambassador.

316
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,150
I finally shed some weight,

317
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,819
and then one steamed bun ruins it.

318
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,290
I have to rely on exercise to make up for it.

319
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,069
You don't have to run five laps.

320
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:17,470
How did you know?

321
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,710
Bao Jiaguo, are you spying on me?

322
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,380
I...

323
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,190
Huang Xiaoyue, be careful not to fall down.

324
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,370
I'm leaving.

325
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,160
No one's here...

326
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:39,330
Bao Jiaguo is getting weirder recently.

327
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,150
Chen Miren.

328
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,480
We can now

329
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,600
finally be together, right?

330
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,740
I...

331
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,500
I'm fine with this.

332
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,080
Why are your hands so cold?

333
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,270
I'm a little cold.

334
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,300
Let's go.

335
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,830
Chen Miren,

336
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,690
when did you start to like me?

337
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,610
Maybe…

338
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,220
It all starts from drawing the poster…

339
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,830
Really?

340
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,740
But why don't I know?

341
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,250
It's true.

342
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,830
I even brought that cardboard cutout

343
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,780
back to the dorm.

344
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,750
I can't sleep

345
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,530
without looking at it every night.

346
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,170
So,

347
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,380
that cardboard cutout

348
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,700
is our token of love.

349
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:03,890
Yes.

350
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,630
Then give it to me.

351
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,660
You look at yourself every day,

352
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,240
isn't that weird?

353
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,620
You drew it.

354
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,330
How could it be awkward?

355
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,050
Chen Miren,

356
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,700
did you throw away the human-shaped sign?

357
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,670
Of course not.

358
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,630
I just leave it in the dorm.

359
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,250
I'll move it to your room another day.

360
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,000
Okay.

361
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,540
Why are your hands sweating so much?

362
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,980
I'm hot. I'm hot.

363
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,330
Let's go.

364
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,300
Chen Miren,

365
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,820
why did you come back so late?

366
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,860
Wasn't it over early?

367
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,490
How would you know? You didn't go.

368
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,000
I bumped into Bao Jiaguo.

369
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,610
Ren.

370
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,530
I suspect Bao Guoguo is following me.

371
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,680
Why do you say that?

372
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,420
I ran five laps on the playground today.

373
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,570
And he knew about it.

374
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,000
It doesn't prove anything.

375
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,500
Maybe he just bumped into you.

376
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,390
Actually, I think

377
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,300
Bao Jiaguo is not a bad guy,

378
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,090
he just has a bit of a creepy vibe.

379
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,690
You've read too many novels.

380
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,870
This is reality,

381
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,940
there aren't that many drama queens.

382
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,400
Why are you trying on clothes in the middle of the night?

383
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:08,910
Tomorrow,

384
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,930
I have an interview at Heng Chang.

385
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,640
You're so outstanding. You'll nail it.

386
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,840
I'll do my best.

387
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,010
What do you think of this one?

388
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,720
I think this one is good.

389
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:29,520
Isn't this too fancy?

390
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,300
Surprising them

391
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,330
is the way to impress the interviewer.

392
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,570
I think it's better to be safe.

393
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,820
Not this one.

394
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,260
Look at this one. It's so beautiful.

395
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,130
This one.

396
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,990
This one looks good too.

397
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,460
It's beautiful.

398
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,290
Try it.

399
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,690
This looks expensive.

400
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,890
This is expensive.

401
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:59,190
[Heng Chang]

402
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:13,780
Take a look.

403
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,690
Ms. Chen Miren,

404
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,450
let's talk about your work.

405
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,940
Your design is unique,

406
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,300
well-rounded,

407
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,580
and your design skills

408
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,980
are outstanding

409
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,020
among the interviewees.

410
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,100
To be honest,

411
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,250
I haven't seen such vibrant work

412
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,680
in a long time.

413
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:39,350
OK, please intorduce yourself.

414
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,800
Hello, mentors.

415
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,890
My name is Chen Miren.

416
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,200
I'm 19 years old.

417
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,850
I'm a freshman in Hanhai University.

418
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,000
All this time,

419
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,150
getting into Hengchang

420
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:51,440
[Chen Miren, major: Business Administration.]

421
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,890
and becoming a figurine designer

422
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,960
has always been my dream.

423
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,420
Sorry to interupt you.

424
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,730
On your resume,

425
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,120
your major is listed as Business Administration, right?

426
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,450
Yes, is there a problem?

427
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,330
That might be an oversight on our HR department's part.

428
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,950
Actually, we have a strict requirement

429
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,140
for designers in our company.

430
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:10,030
We only consider candidates from design-related majors.

431
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,030
We don't consider other majors.

432
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:13,600
So I'm sorry.

433
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:17,750
Next.

434
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,550
Zhou Ziyu.

435
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:19,510
OK.

436
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,800
Thank you.

437
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,470
[Me and My Fairy Roommate]

438
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,510
Did you pass the interview?

439
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,520
What did you design?

440
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,940
The style is too conservative.

441
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,930
The incorporation of technological elements isn't thorough enough.

442
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,360
It doesn't look like a future era.

443
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,210
It looks more like a clown

444
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,080
in cheap costume.

445
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:08,740
If you don't understand

446
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:10,290
what 'future style' means,

447
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,970
I suggest you

448
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,710
take a look at a figurine series

449
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:14,900
our company released before.

450
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:18,430
It's called Chi Yu…

451
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,170
Chi Yu…

452
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,590
Chi Yu Yao Ling.

453
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,650
It was released in the spring of 2012.

454
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,910
Chi Yu Yao Ling.

455
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,550
Anyway,

456
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,300
if I see such ordinary and mediocre designs tomorrow,

457
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,430
you can be prepared

458
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,830
to receive a termination notice.

459
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,080
It seems you're quite familiar with the company's works.

460
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,500
You're an excellent employee.

461
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,390
I'm not an employee.

462
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,270
I'm here for an interview.

463
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:03,500
The interview didn't go well.

464
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,870
They only hire people with design majors.

465
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,220
But I'm majoring in Business Administration.

466
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,670
Is this your design?

467
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:18,880
Yes.

468
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,390
What is your inspiration?

469
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,650
I want to materialize the beauty in real life,

470
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,450
so that they can be touched, hugged,

471
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,870
and they can heal all unhappiness.

472
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:39,780
The second question:

473
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,320
why do you have to get into Heng Chang?

474
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,830
Heng Chang represents

475
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:46,530
the highest level in the domestic figurine design industry.

476
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,880
Only here

477
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,170
can I prove my capabilities.

478
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,950
So no matter what,

479
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,510
I must get in.

480
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:54,440
Last question:

481
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,080
Can you accept a bad boss

482
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,140
who rushes you for drafts every day?

483
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,950
Of course, definitly!

484
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,530
You've been accepted.

485
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,990
Come and report next Monday.

493
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:39,510
Sure.

497
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,460
Sir, have some water.

498
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,480
What water? Have some milk tea.

499
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:53,980
Are you treating?

500
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,870
My treat.

501
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,780
You won the lottery?

502
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,200

504
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,390
Excuse me.

505
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,370
One supreme luxury strawberry sundae, please.

506
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,550
Just get me a Matcha Bobo tea.

507
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,720
Then make it two.

508
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,560
You look so happy today.

509
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:24,940
Zhong Wei, I passed the interview at Heng Chang.

510
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,630
Really?

511
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:30,340
Boss, I'd like a supreme luxury strawberry sundae.

512
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,850
I knew

513
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:35,220
you would pass the interview.

514
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,760
I should thank you

515
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,710
for not sending the video

516
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,010
to Heng Chang HR.

517
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:43,700
Chen Miren, are you stupid?

518
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,900
How could I send the video

519
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,320
to Heng Chang HR?

520
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,250
You wouldn't do that?

521
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,850
I'm just trying to scare you.

522
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,550
I see.

523
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:55,700
You deliberately tried to get close to me at the beginning,

524
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,020
you wanted to be with me.

525
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,290
Hey, Chen Miren,

526
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,350
don't flatter yourself.

527
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,790
Your Matcha Bobo tea.

528
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,780
By the way, can I borrow your class notes?

529
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,680
Now you want to see my class notes?

530
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,670
My boyfriend is so excellent.

531
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:21,600
I can't waste it.

532
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,120
Of course.

533
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,250
Chen Miren.

534
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,470
You must pass the exam.

535
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,100
I don't want my girlfriend

536
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,010
to swim in front of the whole school.

537
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,650
So, let's date secretly before the exams.

538
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,780
I don't want to embarrass you.

539
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,130
Chen Miren, you dare to do this?

540
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,070
I don't dare, I don't dare.

541
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,270
How could I dare?

542
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,060
I can't go out with you during the holiday.

543
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,640
The shop needs renovation.

544
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,390
It's about to open.

545
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,270
What shop?

546
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,220
It's a secret. I'll tell you later.

547
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,390
Alright, I'll start cramming Advanced Calculus

548
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,410
so you won't be embarrassed.

549
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,100
Hello.

550
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,680
Again?

551
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,590
Just cooperate with me.

552
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:30,920
Your dad wants to eat Thai food today.

553
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,060
You and dad showing off your relationship,

554
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,100
