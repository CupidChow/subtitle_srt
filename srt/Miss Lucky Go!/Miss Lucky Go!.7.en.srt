Why aren't you talking?

379
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,140
Well,

00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:50,070
don't be late for the attendance check for Advanced Math tomorrow morning.

Where's Zhong Wei?

389
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,470

Is she also pursuing Zhong Wei?

Chen Miren is not that shallow.

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,510
What's wrong?

395
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,200
I've been preparing for interviews for a long time,

396
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,700
but I didn't pass any one of them.

397
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,770
Even a top postgraduate

398
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,170
of a key department of Hanhai University

399
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,560
can't find a job?

400
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,300
Domestic graduates are no match for those who have studied abroad.

401
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,450
They have already won

402
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,960
at the starting line.

403
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,060
After I started looking for a job, I found

404
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,480
that there are indeed many opportunities in first-tier cities.

405
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,890
But the competition is very fierce.

406
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,690
And the living cost is high.

407
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,510
The rent, utility bills, and traveling expenses.

408
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,320
And I need to eat and drink.

409
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,310
And there are classmate parties and social relations.

410
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,880
Even if I live frugally,

411
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,910
it will cost at least 4,000 yuan a month.

412
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,230
The average salary of the current graduates

413
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,320
is only 4,000 yuan.

414
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,310
That is to say,

415
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,060
I need to pay

416
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,180
in order to make myself

417
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,720

420
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,620
to find me a job in my hometown.

421
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,170
They asked me to go back after graduation.

422
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,560

423

00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:41,050
why would you always talk about postgraduate entrance exams even when we were on a date?

00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,000
No way.

00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,290

someone saw Zhong Wei and a girl driving a sports car

472
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,630
at the gate. They behaved intimately.

473
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,330
Zhong Wei has a girlfriend?

474
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,350
I think so.

475
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:15,620
She's very elegant.

476
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,080
But obviously, she looks older than Zhong Wei.

477
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,300

479
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,370
they are very close.

Are you with me

486
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:45,120

487
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,100
You even talked about postgraduate entrance exams

when we were on a date.

489
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,860
He had the guts to say that because Zhao Gu loves him.

490
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,010
He doesn't need to be a stepping stone anymore.

491

We've broken up.

492
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:03,550

You want to break up. I don't agree.

You want to break up.

499
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,130
I'm telling you, I don't agree.

Shi Hou is nice to you.

505
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,820
Being nice to me is his choice.

506
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,790
Breaking up with him is my choice.

507

There's no conflict between them.

508
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,180
Then why did you break up with him?

509
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,390
He wants to go back to his hometown. I want to go abroad.

510
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,140
You want to go abroad?

511
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,410
Don't you want to take the postgraduate entrance exams?

512
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,140
Taking postgraduate entrance exams won't give me too many advantages now.

513
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,090
Those who have studied abroad are a little competitive.

514
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,560
I still think

515
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,280
you are too cruel to Shi Hou.

516
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,190
Am I right, Chen Miren?

517
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,240
Love can't be forced.

518
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,340
It's meaningless to flatter oneself.

519
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,600
Does she like Zhong Wei?

520
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,660
I've asked her. No.

521
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:45,130
Xu Miaomiao, you are pretty.

522
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,900
But when it comes to love,

523
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,060
you know nothing.

524
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,770
She's obviously having a crush on Zhong Wei.

525
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,460
Otherwise, who would have moved

526
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,480

527
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:59,590
It seems you have a point.

528
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:03,160
Does she have masochistic inclinations?

529
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,920
When Zhong Wei treated her badly,

530
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:07,760
she gradually fell in love with him.

531
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,670
Xu Miaomiao,

532
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,870
you should find a boyfriend.

533
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:14,970
You said it like I've never been in a relationship.

534
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,320
I've been in too many relationships. I'm tired.

535
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,840
I... I want to take a break.

536
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,960
Did you miss me?

537
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:11,200
Chen Miren.

538
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,570
Why didn't you tell me the action figures have been delivered?

539
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,340
Let me take a look.

540
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,380
Don't open it.

541
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,040
What?

542
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,790
It's not convenient to carry it after you open it.

543
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,320
I helped you

544
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,880
get the action figures.

545
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,390
At least give me one as a souvenir.

546
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:25,370
No.

547
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,460
No?

548
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,320
I mean

549
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,940
they are very meaningful.

550
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,860
If I just give one to you,

551
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,280
there won't be a sense of ceremony.

552
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,420
A sense of ceremony?

553
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:43,700
Zhong Wei,

554
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,540

00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,330
needs a sense of ceremony.

562
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,250
Yes.

563
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,780
Let me do it.

564
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:05,580
No need.

565
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,270
Let me do it. It's okay.

566
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:06,700
No need.

567
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,330
Let me do it.

568
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:11,910
Come on.

569
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,780
Chen Miren,

570
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,730
is this your maiden work?

571
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,240
Not bad.

572
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,860
What's wrong? Are you unhappy?

573
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,810
I have an interview next week.

574
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:34,600
I'm so stressed.

575
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,760
Don't worry.

576
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,880
You're talented. You will succeed.

577
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:39,470
I mean it.

578
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:43,250
So beautiful.

579
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,150
Mr. Cao.

580
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,990
Okay, let's begin.

581
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,450
You don't even understand the basic knowledge points.

582
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,600
If this continues,

583
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,940
you'll definitely fail.

584
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,300
It's...

585
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,430
What?

586
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,050
Go back

587
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,850
and study the knowledge points you don't understand.

588
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:22,990
Okay.

589
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,900
I'll read the book after I go back tonight.

590
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,080
I won't sleep until I understand them.

591
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,650
Sir, goodbye.

592
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,860
Sir, thank you.

593
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,370
Chen Miren.

594
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,620
In Chapter 2 of differential coefficient and integral,

595
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,250
there are many knowledge points, and they are dispersed.

596
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,740
The content related to integral in Chapter 4 and 5

597
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,820
is also the key points of the exam.

598
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,240
And differential equation is also crucial to get points.

599
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,540
You also need to remember

600
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,510
common properties of functions.

601
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:15,130
Lastly, you must be very familiar

602
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,350
with the two important limit formulas.

603
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,360
Understand?

604
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:22,520
Then repeat what I said.

605
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,950
I have my own way.

606
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,390
It's different from yours.

607
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,520
Don't think everything you say is right

608
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,460
just because you are a straight-A student.

609
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,540
Chen Miren

610
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,250
has been really abnormal recently.

611
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,670
You also noticed that?

612
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,390
I brought snacks today,

613
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,410
but she didn't eat any.

614
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,760
It's indeed not normal.

615
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,740
That's just a superficial phenomenon.

616
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,470
Didn't you notice

617
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,030
that she seems to be avoiding someone?

618
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,690
Avoiding?

619
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,610
Avoiding whom?

620
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,750
If she's avoiding someone, it must be Mr. Cao.

621
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,150
If I get bad results

622
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,370
and frequently skip classes like her,

623
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,040
I'll avoid him too.

624
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,470
You two

625
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,590
are no better than each other.

626
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:08,239
Let me tell you, the Advanced Math exam will come in two days.

627
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,880
The results in regular exams will be included in the total score.

628
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,780
The result in the final exam will influence the comprehensive score.

629
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,010
If the comprehensive score doesn't meet the standard,

630
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,239
it will definitely affect graduation.

631
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:16,420
So, don't fail the exam.

632
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,110
Even if I fail, Chen Miren will be the bottom of the class,

633
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:20,900
not me.

634
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,580
Zhong Wei, can you concentrate?

635
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,340
The new chapter of A Caged Bird

636
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,739
is really interesting.

637
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,159
Listen.

638
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:41,290
The male lead wants to pursue the heroine, who is the class belle.

639
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,409
The heroine has bad grades.

640
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:46,170
So the male lead wants to lend his notes to her.

641
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:48,370
But he doesn't want to hurt her pride.

642
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,449
So the male lead gives the notes

643
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,510
to the heroine's best friend.

644
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,389
Chen Miren, is it sweet?

645
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,120
Chen Miren, no need to return it to me in a rush.

646
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,270
Is it sweet?

647
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,930
A little salty. I'm going to buy some water.

648
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,020
Chen Miren,

649
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,260
Zhong Wei was looking for you everywhere.

650
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:12,940
What does he want?

651
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:14,580
Help me give it back to Zhong Wei.

652
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,100
Zhong Wei's class notes.

653
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,170
Seeing this is like cheating.

654
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,880
♫I don't need to doubt that I've fallen completely♫
