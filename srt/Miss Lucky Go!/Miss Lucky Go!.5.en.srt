Zhong Wei? Why did he go to Linzhou?

11
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,020

How many marks did you get?

108
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,250
Sir, I have a question for you.

109
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,340
Set the origin X0 and Y0,

110
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,950
then the tangent equation passing through the origin is...

111
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,430
Y equals two times the square root of X0 minus one-half.

112
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,430
Then, I concluded that X0 equals 4Y0,

113
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,500
which equals the square root of 2.

114
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,660
I see.

115
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,270
The answer is three halves times the square root of two.

116
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:03,950
Thank you. Sir.

117
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,020
Okay, that's good.

118
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,600

Chen Miren, what about the new shade I bought?

124
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,930
Isn't it attractive?

125
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,460
Look at these symbols.

126
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,940
I recognize them by looking at them separately.

127
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,100
Why do they look like the Book of Heaven when put together?

128
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,220
You mean her, right?

129
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,500
How could she...

130
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,310
Can't you talk openly?

131
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,590
We didn't talk about you.

132
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:08,360
Right.

133
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,630
But you kept pointing and whispering.

134
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,910
I'm sure you didn't say anything good.

135
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,170
Don't you know?

136
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,650
There's a thief in your dorm.

137
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,120
Are you talking about me?

138
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
I didn't say that.

139
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,480
You said it yourself.

140
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,700
What did I steal?

141
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,080
As to what you stole,

142
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,120
you know better than we do.

143
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,730
Do you have any proof that she's a thief?

144
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:31,960
I didn’t say that.

145
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,670
Shi Hou from Grade 3 said it.

146
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,170
Who is he?

147
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,500
This is about our dormitory, and I don't know anything.

148
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,500
How could he know?

149
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,909
Shi Hou is Zhao Gu's boyfriend.

150
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,620
Zhao Gu has a boyfriend?

151
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,110
You don't even know that as her roommate.

152
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,060
It seems that

153
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,170
you really don't know

154
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,400
what happened in your dorm.

155
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,659
Zhao Gu.

156
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,200
You told others

157
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,390
that Chen Miren is a thief?

158
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,540
I said it.

159
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:58,770
What evidence do you have?

160
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,890
Luo Si lost something too.

161
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,340
Those are worthless, Zhao Gu.

162
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,260
This must be a misunderstanding.

163
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,810
Let's go back and talk.

164
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,760
Luo Si.

165
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,840
Let's make it clear.

166
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,480
Zhao Gu.

167
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,910
Chen Miren just

168
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,150
unwrapped your package by mistake.

169
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,200
Do you have to be so petty?

170
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,150
This has nothing to do with the package.

171
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,150
Chen Miren.

172
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,830
Don't regret if I tell them.

173
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,140
Tell us now. We're not afraid.

174
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,690
She's not that kind of person.

175
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,230
Chen Miren.

176
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,740
Do you dare to swear that you never took my stuff?

177
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,990
Zhao Gu, you've gone too far.

178
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:39,940
Just get to the point.

179
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,530
How can you make her swear?

180
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,510
And about what happened between you and Shi Hou,

181
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:45,020
if it wasn't Chen Miren who didn't let me say it,

182
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,370
the whole school would have known it.

183
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,060
Chen Miren, tell her

184
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,740
you never took her stuff, right?

185
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,960
I believe in Chen Miren.

186
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,020
She won't steal other people's things.

187
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,120
I'll borrow it.

188
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,190
Zhao Gu, can we go back first?

189
