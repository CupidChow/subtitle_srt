00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,260
Today's game had a huge gap in strength.

6
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,120
In less than a minute,

7
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,150
Bao Jiaguo made a spike

8
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,340
that left the opponents completely helpless.

9
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,940
Chen Miren, you're back.

10
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,240
Let me tell you.

11
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,630
Bao Jiaguo won the table tennis championship today.

12
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,350
What's wrong?

13
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,390
I just ran into Cao Jia'er.

14
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,090
You ran into Cao Jia'er?

15
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,340
And then?

16
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,990
She asked me to return Zhong Wei to her.

17
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,200
She talked like Zhong Wei belonged to her.

18
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:00,120

Chen Miren and Zhong Wei have broken up.

21
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,720
So what?

22
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,880
They can get back together.

23
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,539
Chen Miren transferred schools once

24
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,380
because of Cao Jia'er.

25
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,310
I think Zhong Wei and Chen Miren

26
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,820
lack trust in each other.

27
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,540
Zhong Wei is afraid that Chen Miren will be troubled

28
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,410
when she sees Cao Jia'er again,

29
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,800
so he wants to handle it himself.

30
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,600
But Chen Miren doesn't believe

31
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,500
that Zhong Wei just wants to resolve the issue.

32
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,520
I think Zhao Gu is right.

33
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,470
But

34
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,220
right now, we can't be sure

35
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,250
if Zhong Wei

36
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,040
wants to resolve things with Cao Jia'er

37
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,230
or just rekindle old feelings with her.

38
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,930
What are you talking about, Luo Si?

39
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,100
What old feelings did they have?

40
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,670
Zhong Wei just wants to make sure

41
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,050
that Chen Miren doesn't feel uncomfortable seeing Cao Jia'er

42
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,440
and he wants to minimize any potential issues.

43
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,500
That's right.

44
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,540

49

54

00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,330
that you did this

187
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,790
to be good to Chen Miren.

188
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,310
But Xu Miaomiao said

189
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,390
that you hated Chen Miren so much

190
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,510
that you wanted her to get destructively fat,

191
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,610
and end up lonely.

192
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,070
You can't blame me.

193
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,410
I told you

194
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,960
that your trick was so lame

195
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,270
that you would get exposed sooner or later.

196
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,440
What did Chen Miren say?

197
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,350
Chen Miren...

198
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,200
I don't want to

199
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,000
argue with him on such boring tricks.

200
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:40,500
Zhong Wei.

201
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,780
I finally found that

202
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,800
your enemy is not only Qin Mengxuan.

203
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,060
Who else?

204
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,460
Xu Miaomiao, Luo Si and Zhao Gu.

205
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,530
Then what should I do?

206
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,410
Turn enemies into friends

207
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,200
and clear the obstacles.

208
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,680
So you mean

209
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,380
there's nothing between you and Cao Jia'er,

210
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,650
and it's just a misunderstanding?

211
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,650
You went on a movie date with Cao Jia'er

212
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,470
because you were afraid that after she showed up,

213
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,180
Chen Miren would break up with you again.

214
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,480
So you wanted to meet her requirements

215
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,030
and send her back to America?

216
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,950
But unexpectedly,

217
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,550
Cao Jia'er transferred here.

218
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,580
Yes.

219
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,750
So do you believe in

220
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,350
what Zhong Wei said?

221
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,560
I believe Zhong Wei.

222
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,700
After all,

223
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,080
the more handsome a man is, the more devoted he is.

224
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,000
My Fang Mao is just an example.

225
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,030
I just simply think

226
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,410
that from the perspective of input and output ratio,

227
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,590
the only possibility for Zhong Wei

228
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,500
to win back Chen Miren

229
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,520
is true love.

230
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,910
Let's vote.

231
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,680
Raise your hand if you believe Zhong Wei.

232
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,160
We decided

233
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,540
to believe you.

234
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,700
We'll explain this to Chen Miren for you.

235
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,830
I've explained everything.

236
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,120
It's useless.

237
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,530
I originally thought

238
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,180
that over time,

239
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:23,890
Chen Miren would realize

240
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,420
that there's nothing between me and Cao Jia'er.

241
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,700
But I didn't expect

242
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,560
Qin Mengxuan to come out halfway.

243
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,720
What if before Chen Miren finds out about the truth,

244
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,660
she and Qin Mengxuan were together?

245
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,090
How could it be?

246
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,110
Why would she choose Qin Mengxuan instead of you?

247
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,600
Why not?

248
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,790
Now there's a Cao Jia'er standing between you.

249
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,500
Chen Miren has already misunderstood Zhong Wei.

250
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,470
At this moment, Qin Mengxuan

251
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,300
launched a fierce pursuit,

252
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,330
who can withstand it?

253
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,750
Let me be frank.

254
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,660
Qin Mengxuan's pursuit

255
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,310
is indeed hard to refuse.

256
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,620
Right?

257
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,590
You think so too, right?

258
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,120
Don't worry.

259
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,270
You have us.

260
00:12:59,290 --> 00:12:59,820
Yes.

261
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,800
We'll help you.

262
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,240
Thank you.

263
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,790
Let's watch a movie tomorrow.

264
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,510
The movies that are in cinema recently are so lame.

265
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,020
Whoever watches them will regret it.

266
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,060
I heard that

267
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,100
Qin Mengxuan

268
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,760
is dating Guo Haomei

269
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,950
from the broadcasting class.

270
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:39,980
Recently,

271
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,950
Huang Xiaoyue saw them

272
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,150
going to the woods together.

273
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,050
Chen Miren.

274
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,540
The exam is coming.

275
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,640
Are you prepared for it?

276
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,340
Look! Look!

277
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,760
He's so handsome!

00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,180
What're you doing?

281
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,300
Reading.

282
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,100
There are so many empty seats.

283
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,040
Why do you have to sit here?

284
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,470
The library is a public place.

285
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,990
I can sit wherever I want.

286
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,000
Excuse me.

Are you done?

Please keep your distance.

Who is he?

00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,570
We didn't break up.

Where are we going?

303
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,990
Go away.

304
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,030
Where are we going?

305
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,980
Aren't you childish?

306
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,490
I'm not as childish as you.

307
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,600
You asked someone to act with you

308
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,880
to persuade me to quit.

309
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,990
You should at least rehearse.

310
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,410
He's so bad at acting.

311
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,710
How can I get into the role?

312
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,900
Can't you be reasonable?

313
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,820
Be reasonable?

314
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,510
When two people in a relationship are arguing,

315
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,330
how can they can be reasonable?

316
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,640
We didn't just fight. We broke up.

317
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:13,770
Zhong Wei.

318
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,510
I'll tell you again.

319
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,890
We've broken up.

320
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,410
You announced it unilaterally.

321
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,220
Did I admit it?

322
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,370
I don't want to talk to you.

323
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,640
It's fine.

324
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,700
Let me talk to you.

325
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,830
You didn't study hard in class.

326
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,870
You read for leisure during class.

327
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,380
You looked up four times in ten minutes

328
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,320
and played with your phone eight times.

329
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,020
You even spent three minutes drawing on the textbook.

330
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,720
Don't think that just because the teacher praised you,

331
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,750
you can become careless and proud.

332
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,570
Listen.

333
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,510
Without me by your side,

334
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,830

335
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:44,710
and you fail,

336
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,050
you'll regret it too late.

337
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,880
It's none of your business.

338
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,740
Of course, it is.

339
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,790
Think about it.

340
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:52,560
If you fail the exam and get retained,

341
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,510

There's a limit to revenge.

345
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,240
You want me to gain weight, and I've endured it.

00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,700
you can go back.

757
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,900
It can't get wet.

758
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,580
Thank you, doctor.

759
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,480
Thank you, doctor.

760
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:26,300
I'm here to treat Xiaomeng.

761
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,680
What happened to Xiaomeng?

762
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,190
Nothing big deal.

763
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,940
Zhong Wei and I have taken it to the doctor.

764
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:36,250
Chen Miren.

765
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,490
Cao Jia'er called me

766
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,780
when she saw the kitten was injured.

767
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:43,590
Xiaomeng.

768
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,740
Xiaomeng is fine now.

769
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,250
It's just a scratch.

770
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,190
The doctor just took care of it.

771
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,800
I have to go.

772
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,720
I won't disturb you.

773
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:54,970
Chen Miren.

774
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:55,980
I want to take a walk alone.

775
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:56,870
Don't follow me.

776
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:57,940
Chen Miren.

777
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,500
Cao Jia'er.

778
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:10,360
You were indeed

779
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,590
a ray of hope in my grey childhood.

780
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:14,980
That's why I tolerated you.

781
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:17,980
But I was only grateful to you.

782
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,760
Even if I met you

783
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:22,030
in high school,

784
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:24,469
I wouldn't be with you.

785
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,699
What do you mean?

786
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,159
I like Chen Miren

787
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,989
just the way she is.

788
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,380
That's enough.

789
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,630
Zhong Wei.

790
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,150
Let me ask you one last question.

791
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,670
Is it that no matter what I do now,

792
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,380
you won't like me?

793
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:49,770
Yes. I won't.

794
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,250
Chen Miren.

795
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,310
I have something for you.

796
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,710
I saw you liked the action figure on Weibo last time.

797
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:52,930
I thought you would like it.

798
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,380
This is for you.

799
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,010
Thank you.

800
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,490
But this can only be given to the one you love.

801
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,310
I can't take it.

802
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,790
You are the one I love.

803
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,020
Qin Mengxuan.

804
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,510
I'm sorry.

805
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,430
I did it on purpose

806
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:08,880
to provoke Zhong Wei before,

807
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,600
so...

808
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,270
I know.

809
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,630
I don't mind.

810
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,550
So,

811
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,840
you still can't forget Zhong Wei.

812
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,100
I don't want to date now.

813
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,870
I just want to focus on my career.

814
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:34,060
Shouldn't you be

815
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,510
comforting me in times like this?

816
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,080
Qin Mengxuan,

817
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:39,910
you are a good person.

818
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,250
You're excellent, considerate,

819
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,610
sunny and handsome.

820
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:44,580
You'll find a better one.

821
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,590
I think so too.

822
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:49,880
Chen Miren.

823
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:57,820
Chen Miren!

824
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,050
You scared her away.

825
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,740
Qin Mengxuan,

826
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,300
can you stop hitting on her?

827
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:09,270
Okay.

828
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:10,850
Okay?

829
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,470
Anyway,

830
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:14,750
I'll find a better one.

831
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,010
Did she reject you?

832
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,860
You two are so boring.

833
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,900
♫I don't need to doubt that I've fallen completely♫
