For example, not knowing how to spend their money.

How is that possible?

35
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,610
For example,

58
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,960

You distributed it all the way to our dorm.

65
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,940
You must have given out at least half of it.

66
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,600
If I calculate it carefully, I should only give you 50 yuan.

67

00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,260
Must you act like this?

378
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:13,530
Zhao Gu.

379
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,839
Zhao Gu, what are you acting up for?

380
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:18,849
It's a misunderstanding.

381
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,040
It's cleared up now.

382
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:20,839
Don't be angry.

383
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,079
Turn off the lights.

384
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,350
I'm not delicate and weak.

385
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,500
Zhong Wei, are you going to be a muscular man?

386
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,690
No.

387
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,310
But you know,

388
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:51,890
your current style

389
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,390
is really rare and popular.

390
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:55,870
What style?

391
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,670
The type that looks cold as ice

392
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,250
but in fact, is mischievous, cute and gentle.

393
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:05,890
Is that popular?

394
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,780
Yes, very.

395
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:16,750

Vote for him.

408
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,560
Can we take a photo with Zhong Wei if we vote for him?

409
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,500
Zhong Wei hasn't arrived yet.

410
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,020
But you can take a photo with me.

411
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,830
That Zhong Wei.

412
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,590
How can he be late for his own campaign?

413
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:51,700
Chen Miren.

414
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:01,840
You're quite cute.

415
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,410
No, not cute.

416
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,500
It's very stylish.

417
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,340
It has a distinctive contrast

418
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,940
with your bright and manly image.

419
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,270
Chen Miren.

420
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,050
Zhong Wei, you look so cute.

421
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,370
Huang Xiaoyue, what are you doing here?

422
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,120
If Chen Miren didn't ask me to help,

423
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,090
I wouldn't have come.

424
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,130
I was supposed to be

425
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,430
the campus ambassador.

426
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,320
Huang Xiaoyue, wake up.

427
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,660
Do you have Wu Dabo's figure

428
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,650
or Zhong Wei's height?

429
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,100
Zhong Wei saved you

430
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,810
so that you won't lose face in front of the whole school.

431
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,100
This...

432
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,420
Come and have a look.

433
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,440
Come and have a look.

434
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,640
Vote for Zhong Wei.

435
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:56,840
Which student of our class is this?

436
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,190
You're contributing to the honor of our class,

437
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,210
I have to mark it down.

438
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,490
This is...

439
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:02,570
This is Luo Si.

440
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,290
Luo Si?

441
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,780
Okay, let me help you.

442
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,220
Luo Si.

443
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,190
I heard that Xu Miaomiao in your dorm

444
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,590
never lets anyone touch her hair

445
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,200
because she's actually bald.

446
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,620
She usually wears wigs.

447
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,140
Bao Jiaguo.

448
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,510
You are the one who's bald.

449
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:38,870
You're just

450
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,880
a sleazy man who fantasizes in front of a computer.

451
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,620
Xu Miaomiao?

452
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:45,820
Distribute it yourself.

453
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,060
It's none of my business.

454
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,160
Huang Xiaoyue said it.

455
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,390
So cute.

456
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,490
Can we take a photo with you?

457
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,250
No.

458
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,470
Of course.

459
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,600
When we reach fifty voters,

460
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,460
you can have a candlelight dinner with Zhong Wei too.

461
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:02,370
Give it to me.

462
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,770
Three, two, one. Cheese.

463
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,180
Done.

464
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,300
Thank you.

465
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,750
The quota for the candlelight dinner is limited.

466
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,830
Remember to get more voters.

467
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,440
Okay.

468
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:17,450
Zhong Wei, can't you just entertain your fans?

469
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,580
No.

470
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,200
If you don't play your part and dote on your fans,

471
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,070
who will vote for you?

472
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,080
I don't care.

473
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,970
If I can't be the campus ambassador,

474
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,100
I'll send your video

475
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,220
to Heng Chang's Human Resource Department.

476
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:27,740
You...

477
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,360
Forget it.

478
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,740
You are no match

479
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,460
for Wu Dabo.

480
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,890
You're also not as fit as him.

481
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,290
Your thighs are not as thick as his arms.

482
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,180
I'm sure you won't be elected

483
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,340
to be the campus ambassador.

484
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,990
You should pack your stuff

485
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,140
and go home and sleep.

486
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,110
It's just entertaining my fans.

487
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:49,780
Anyone can do it.

488
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,860
[Please vote for me.]

489
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,420
So cute. So cute.

[Bright handsome guy, Wu Dabo]

491
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,820
I haven’t shown my biceps yet.

492
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,300
So cute.

493
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,930
Rock, paper, scissors.

494
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,270
Rock, paper, scissors.

495
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,750
Rock, paper, scissors.

496
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,910
Truth or dare?

497
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,160
I choose Truth.

498
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:34,090
When did you start noticing me?

499
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,600
Guess.

500
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:40,450
Since... That time it rained,

501
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,750
we didn't bring umbrellas

502
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:44,290
so I carried the huge sunshield from the store

503
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,990
and escorted us to the classroom safely.

504
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,430
It was earlier than that.

505
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,320
Earlier?

506
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,700
Was it that time at the basketball court,

507
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:56,950
when I passed by drinking water,

508
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,280
you thought I was going to give it to you

509
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,840
and snatched it from me?

510
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,800
Even before that.

511
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:02,620
Before that?

512
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,970
Then did you

513
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,660
think that I was different from others since the beginning of school?

514
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,130
You're exaggerating.

515
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,510
Indeed.

516
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,500
I recognized you as soon as school started.

517
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:22,340
Recog...

518
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,480
Recognized?

519
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,140
What do you mean?

520
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:32,850
Chen Miren.

521
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:34,860
You really don't remember

522
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,430
what happened at Nanchizi Park 12 years ago?

523
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,370
Nanchizi Park?

524
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,080
12 years ago,

525
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,060
I was less than 1.1 meters tall.

526
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:47,510
I was thin and didn't talk much.

527
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,920
I didn't have many friends.

528
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:52,420
So I often went to Nanchizi Park to feed Cloudy.

529
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:57,630
Cloudy was a cat?

530
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,080
I knew you would remember.

531
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,050
Do you remember what happened to it in the end?

532
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,710
I will never forget it.

533
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,180
It's just a cat.

534
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,500
I really hate stray cats

535
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,890
roaming around in the park.

536
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,540
Don't bully him.

537
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,500
Its name is Cloudy.

538
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,320
It's my only friend.

539
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:30,480
It's okay.

540
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,430
Cloudy went to find its mother.

541
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:38,910
Chen Miren.

542
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,360
If you didn't

543
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,290
beat those kids away,

544
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,680
I would have been beaten up.

545
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,870
So I thought

546
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,920
you were a heroine that descended from the sky.

547
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,300
Are you still practicing taekwondo?

548
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,430
No.

549
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:53,770
I quit.

550
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,000
No wonder.

551
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,670
I haven't seen you in Nanchizi Park after that.

552
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:02,570
Zhong Wei.

553
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:06,290
If it weren't for what happened then,

554
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:08,940
would you have noticed me?

555
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,190
If it weren't for what happened then,

556
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,620
I wouldn't have known who you were.

557
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,450
So I'm not the Cinderella that Prince Charming fell in love with

558
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,310
but the replacement of another girl

559
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:25,890
whom he has mistaken to be me.

560
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,520
I can't repeat the same mistake.

561
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,630
So, Zhong Jianguo decided to confess his love to Lin Miaomiao.

562
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,240
