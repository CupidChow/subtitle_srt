It's rare to be adjusted to a higher-scoring one.

351

Let me tell you the reason.

My life goal

There's only one student recruited this year.

They have no choice

358
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,080
except to cancel the major.

359
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,230
The only candidate

360
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,050
had to adjust her major.

361
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,800
The school called

362
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,160
and asked if I would accept the adjustment

363
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,690
or transfer to another school.

364
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,920
My mom never supported me to design the action figures.

365
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,210
So she agreed immediately

366
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,560
when she was told I could be adjusted to Business Administration.

367
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,870

Then you will miss the opportunity

371
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,060

372
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,800
I won't be defeated

373
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,070
by these minor difficulties.

374
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,510
I've submitted my resume to Heng Chang.

375
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,330

being the chief designer of action figures

will be around the corner.

378
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,520
Is Heng Chang that extraordinary?

379
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,980
Of course.

380
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,440
Heng Chang is the best company of action figures.

381
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:09,910
It leads the trend in the entire Asia-Pacific area,

382
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,290
or even the global trend of design.

383
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,700
It will be the starting point of my dream.

384
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,569
Chen Miren, you're only a freshman.

385
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,760
So what?

386
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,690
If you want to succeed, you have to plan ahead.

387
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,859
Be ready for your ideal at all times.

388
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,460
Zhao Gu, what about your dream?

389
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,730
To pass the postgraduate entrance exam.

390
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,100
Come on.

391
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,640
Cheers to our different ideals.

392
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,210
Cheers!

393
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,480
This is very tasty.

394
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:46,980
So is this one.

395
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,010
Pass the ball.

396
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,660
Pass it to me.

397
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,360
Nice shot!

398

Run! Run!

399

Xu Miaomiao, you really got into Hanhai?

400
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,140
Yes.

401
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,480
Zheng Ze, long time no see.

402
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,370
Long time no see.

403
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,680
Zheng Ze.

404
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,580
Stop chatting.

405
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,530
I'll go play with them.

406
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,540
Go ahead.

407
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,820
Come and watch me play basketball some day.

408
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,530
Zheng Ze, who is that?

409
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:20,390
She's pretty.

410
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,960
My high school junior, Xu Miaomiao.

411
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,110
This year's campus belle is gorgeous.

412
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,490
When will you introduce her to me?

413
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,910
Just play basketball.

414
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,080
Serve!

415
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,340
Xu Miaomiao.

416
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,030
Xu Miaomiao?

417
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,340
Who are you?

418
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,740
I'm the monitor, Bao Jiaguo.

419
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,860
What's up?

420
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,150
Xu Miaomiao.

421
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,120
I signed you up for the campus ambassador election campaign.

422
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,950
It's very important.

423
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,620
This is our first activity in college.

424
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,080
It concerns the honor of our class.

425
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,140
So we must participate actively.

426
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,910
As far as I know,

427
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,170
the ratio of boys and girls in our school is 3:7.

428
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,630
Why don't you ask Zhong Wei?

429
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,740
Zhong Wei...

430
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,780
This is an legal violation of my portrait rights.

431
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,550
I'm not going.

432
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,690
You'll get a prize if you win.

433
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,010
It's a pair of ping pong paddles.

434
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,330
I'm not interested in ping pong paddles.

435
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,070

436
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,460
You like playing basketball, don't you?

437
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,480
I can apply for a basketball for you.

438
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,860
Save it, please.

439
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,810
Xu Miaomiao, are you in?

440
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,300
Let me make it clear.

441
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,610
if I don't win,

442
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,650
don't blame me for that.

443
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,290
Of course I won't.

444
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,850
With your appearance,

445
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:41,900
as long as you can stand on the stage,

446
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,660
even if you don't say anything,

447
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,810
our class will definitely win.

448
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,200
We will definitely win?

449
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:49,780
Definitely!

450
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,720
For what?

451
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,870
Your pretty face.

452
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:58,100
I hate people saying that I'm just another pretty face!

453
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,350
I'm not going!

454
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,370
What's wrong with that?

455
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,090
Isn't your pretty face a gift?

456
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,540
All good-looking people are weird.

457
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,560
Zhong Wei and Xu Miaomiao have gone too far.

458
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,530
When our class needed their contribution,

459
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,080
they both quit.

460
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:28,850
That's right.

461
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:30,870
So, Bao Jiaguo,

462
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,630
I've decided.

463
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,620
If they won't participate in the election campaign,

464
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,240
I'll!

465
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,170
Pardon me?

466
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,900
I've prepared the clothes

467
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,170
for the election campaign.

468
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,960
Look. The Japanese youth style.

469
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,210
The elegant gentleman style.

470
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,060
And the mature and stylish style.

471
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,690
If it doesn't work,

472
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,960
for our class,

473
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,850
I can sacrifice myself

474
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,480
and be sexy.

475
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,690

477
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,520
Are you really not going to run for the campus ambassador?

478
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,030
Why don't you reconsider it?

479
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:09,980
I'm not into it.

480
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:10,690
So I'm not going.

481
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,630
Bao Jiaguo, let's discuss

482
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,060
which style I should choose.

483
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,240
I think playing cute is not bad, too.

00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,140

00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:20,740

and there exists an original function Fx,

496
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,710
then fx is integrable on a subset of a to b.

594
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,430

It's too expensive to fix it  outside the school.

It costs 20 yuan.
