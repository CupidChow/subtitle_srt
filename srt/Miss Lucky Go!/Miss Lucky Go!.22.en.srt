Due to his attack on the teacher,

380
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,980
he was given a school warning, and placed under school observation,

381
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,050
with all scholarships canceled.

382
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:31,990
Since then,

383
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,650
he has been like a different person.

384
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,310
He didn't contact anyone.

385
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,540
But when he mentioned me,

386
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,680
he seemed different.

[Jinzhou]

388
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,610
Your dad cooked this braised pork.

389
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,010
It's your favorite.

390
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:46,910
Very mushy.

392
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,270
Is it good?

393
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,770
Fang Mao, this is...

394
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,780
I'm Fang Mao's mother.

395
00:19:58,790 --> 00:19:59,550
Hello, Auntie.

396
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,450
Hello.

397
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,290
The braised pork is really good.

398
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,180
Isn't it?

399
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,140
Not at all.

400
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,780
It's not half as good as that Luo Si made.

401
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,240
His mother had no choice

402
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,580
but to arrange a temporary leave of absence for him,

403
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,450
and brought him home to recuperate.

404
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,050
But his condition hasn't improved.

405
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,250
His mother also said

406
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,260
he wanted to see me.

407
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,130

00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,930
He was the one who moved in with Yao Weijing behind your back.

412
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,180
He was also with the one who was with someone else suddenly.

413

Now you're going to take care of him.

No.

We'll only be friends.

00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,300
is with Yao Weijing happily,

420
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:50,780
I would curse him every day.

421
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,950
But not he's like this.

422
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,250
After all,

423
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,920
we've been together for so long.

424
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,230
I still hope he can be fine.

425
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,800
At least I hope he can be healthy.

The treatment period of anxiety is long.

427
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,330
He needs long-term psychotherapy

428
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,440
and drug therapy.

429
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,820
This is a seesaw battle.

00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,100
At the same time,

569
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:01,980
the demand of the middle class is getting higher and higher.

570
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,240
No government

571
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:05,730
can meet them,

572
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,030
resulting in an expectation gap.

573
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,280
Harris.

574
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:08,900
It seems

575
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,220
you've found a girlfriend who is smarter than you.

576
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,160
This is a reason why I love her.

577
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:16,810
You said you study at Hanhai University, right?

578
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,040
Yes.

579
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:23,200
Why would such a smart person like yourself

580
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,210
choose to study

581
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,270
at such an ordinary school?

582
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,410
Hanhai University is one of the top universities in China.

583
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,370
No.

584
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:39,350
A top university should be like Oxford or Harvard.

585
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:40,810
As far as I know,

586
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:41,940
Hanhai University

587
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,190
is just a gathering place for a group of people

588
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:47,670
without a future.

589
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:53,780
I think your view is a little biased. Forgive me for disagreeing.

590
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,710
If you don't agree,

591
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,660
then why do you want to leave Hanhai

592
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,380
and go study in England?

593
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,110
Zhao Gu is a grateful person.

594
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,740
She loves her alma mater.

595
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,810
But baby,

596
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,960
why don't you

597
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,310
come with me to England?

598
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,230
Just leave all of your life here and come with me.

599
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,870
I can help you change your life.

600
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,730
I can be excellent on my own.

601
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:20,920
I believe being with Harris can help you

602
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:21,420
become

603
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,250
more excellent.

604
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:29,820
Congratulations on getting your exchange place in England.

605
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,340
Congratulations.

606
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,390
Congratulations.

607
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,360
Cheers.

608
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:39,800
Eat this.

609
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:41,400
This is delicious.

610
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:45,680
You too.

611
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,900
Eat more.

612
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,280
Auntie, here.

613
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:54,980
Have some soup.

614
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,370
You too.

615
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,070
Eat up.

619
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:25,170
Hello?

620
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,520
Zhao Gu, are you asleep?

621
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,700
[This is the taste]

622
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:28,700
What's up?

623
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,080
Ever since you were in middle school,

624
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:34,970
[This is the taste]

625
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,960
you have always lived alone outside.

626
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,450
Our family

627
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,590
has never

628
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,860
taken good care of you since you were young.

629
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,980
All of a sudden, you're going

630
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,960
to such a faraway place.

631
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:47,450
I don't know if you'll get used to it

632
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,510
and if you'll be safe.

633
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,140
I have friends there. I'll be fine.

634
00:30:52,980 --> 00:31:00,720
[This is the taste]

635
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,650
Your Dad and I

636
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,300
are not capable.

637
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,800
We can't help you much.

638
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,190
But when you are alone there,

639
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,940
remember,

640
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,900
don't fight with others.

641
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,730
You're not familiar with that place.

642
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,140
The less trouble,

643
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,280
the better.

644
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,240
Do you know?

645
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,550
Yes.

646
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,770
Okay, that's all.

647
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,800
Go to bed early.

648
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:31,810
Okay.

00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,290
Transfer the money to Zhao Gu

652
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:55,910
tomorrow.

653
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,610
Zhao Gu

654
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,340
has never worried us since childhood.

655
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,610
All of a sudden, she will

656
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:07,870
go to a faraway place.

657
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,280
If something happens,

658
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,940
we won't know.

659
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,620
Why don't you think about something good?

660
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:16,290
I'm just worried.

661
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,440
Where did you get the money?

662
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,030
Alright, don't worry.

663
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,700
Transfer it to her tomorrow.

[Miss Zhao Gu, you are invited to come to our school for an exchange student program in January 2023. ]

[Please choose to accept or decline.]

668
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,500
The third quarter is almost over.

669
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,850
Our team's sales have not increased enough at all.

670
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:09,400
Director,

671
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,180
we've already far exceeded other teams.

672
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,680
It's far less than I expected.

673
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,410
Tell Rad and the others to speed up the product launch immediately.

674
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,260
This week,

675
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,760
I want to see at least five

676
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,060
designs that can be launched.

677
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,640
Okay.

678
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,160
Hello, Ms. Du.

679
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,400
Hello.

680
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:39,250
Here's the thing.

681
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,220
I need your help.

682
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,810
In the third quarter,

683
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,830
our team hasn't received enough orders yet.

684
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,800
Do you have

685
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,880
any extra cash flow?

686
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,930
Please help me.

687
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,300
We've been friends for years.

688
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,620
Of course, I'll help you.

689
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,780
That's great, Ms. Du.

690
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,220
When the fourth season comes,

691
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,460
I will process the return for you.

692
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,050
Thank you, Ms. Du.

693
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,040
Bye.

Zhong Wei.

696
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,070
It's okay.

697
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,260
There's still the fourth season.

698
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,600
We can work harder.

699
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:17,889
We'll make it.

700
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,260
This Boxing Duck...

701
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,380
It's Yi's work that was eliminated.

702
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,090
It was launched by Liu's team.

703
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,900
The sales are good.

704
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,690
The ones of mine that got eliminated

705
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,030
are much better than the Boxing Duck.

706
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,280
Stop it.

707
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:34,460
Am I wrong?

708
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,719
He always goes his own way.

709
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,350
I quit.

Chao, I can’t do it anymore.

713
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,690
Chao, sorry.

714
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:48,540
