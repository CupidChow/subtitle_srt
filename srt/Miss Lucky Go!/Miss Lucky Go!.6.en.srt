the self-heating action figures.

378
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,640
And the self-heating materials

379
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,790
are expensive.

380
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:47,950
We have no advantage

381
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,380
in terms of price.

382
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,190
So I think

383
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,430
if we should give up the self-heating materials

384
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,070
and focus more one the design?

385
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,340
No.

00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,070
The biggest selling point of our companion cats

387
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,180
is their self-heating materials.

388
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:00,810
Once it's removed,

389

they'll be no different from other action figures.

390
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,450
But there's no other way now.

392
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,740
there's something wrong with our figure designing.

393

The design is absolutely right.

394
