On the first day we move in,

we should have

Yes, I did.

Let me ask you.

no matter what happens,

589
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:46,810
he will always be on her side,

590
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,760
protect her, and love her.

591
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,780
And he will never lie to her.

592
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:49,650
Is it true?

00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,270
Yes.

he will still be the princess's knight on a mule.
