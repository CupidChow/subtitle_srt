Cloudy.

191
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,350
It's her.

192
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,770
Since he's not here,

193
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,700
I'll come another day.

194
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,870
I have plenty of time anyway.

195
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,290
Right.

196
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,610
Please keep this a secret for me.

197
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,320
I want to give him a surprise.

198
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,240
Is she the Heroine Zhong Wei mentioned?

199
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,040
I heard a student will transfer to our class.

200
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,400
I heard about it too.

201
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,880
It seems she is rich and beautiful.

202
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,140
She'll be here in a few days.

203
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:28,650
She will come here.

204
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,830
Should I confess to Zhong Wei?

205
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:32,690
Zhong Wei,

206
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,840
someone is looking for you.

207
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,300
Okay.

208
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,020
I'd better tell him.

209
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,540
There will be a basketball game next Saturday.

210
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,500
Zhong Wei, you must come.

211
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,900
Sure, no problem.

212

Mom.

217
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,350
I want to transfer to another school.

218
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,340
Why do you suddenly want to transfer to another school?

219
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,260
I just do.

226

Chen Miren,

227
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,780
ask her to send you the link.

Miaomiao,

229
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,520
I want to ask you something.

230
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,060
If a person

231
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,470
has gained love using the identity of someone else,

232
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,670
and they really like each other,

233
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,570
but many years later,

234
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,900
the true owner of the identity came back,

235
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:12,650
what should that person do?

236
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,500
Chen Miren,

237
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,660
I didn't expect you to read romance novels too.

238
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,260
Stealing

239
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,570
other people's life

240
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,250
is exactly a plot in romance novels.

241
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,120
Then... how does it end

242
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,150
for the substitute?

243
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,480
Of course it doesn't end well.

244
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,960
No matter how proud and happy she is at the beginning,

245
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,510
as long as the true owner of the identity appears,

246
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:38,860
she'll become nobody immediately

247
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,050
and become a catalyst for the love between the hero and heroine.

248
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,310
Chen Miren,

249
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,380
if you like this kind of novel,

250
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,730
I'll recommend you more.

251
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,900
The heroine takes revenge on the evil substitute in the latter part.

252
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,930
It feels so good.

253
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,580
That villain

254
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,640
has a miserable ending.

255
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,560
Her family breaks up.

256
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,470
Everyone leaves her.

257
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:55,570
And she gets sick.

258
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,290
I don't like it.

259
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,530
You don't like it?

260
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,300
I think it's good.

261
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,850
Okay. The third one is

262
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,500
the radical expression and trigonometric substitution

263
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,740
are very obvious substitutions.

264
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,650
So we need a change of variable

265
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,460
to get upper and lower limits.

266
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,170
The fourth one is

267
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,460
functions with upper limits in integration.

268
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,280
The fifth one is

269
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,230
upper limit functions are antiderivatives.

271

The last one is

272
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,260
the reciprocal of upper limit functions.

273
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,040

361
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,110

00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,180
Xu Miaomiao,

568
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,360
I didn't do it on purpose

569
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,640
last time.

570
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,230
If I had known it, I should have

571
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,770
carried shredded cucumber.

572
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:01,100
Even stir-fried spicy chicken

573
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,420
would be better than pig's large intestines.

574
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,990
Anyway,

575
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,100
it was all my fault.

576
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,230
I have inescapable responsibility.

577
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,610
How about this?

578
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,080
I'll pay for your shampoo

579
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:11,830
over the next year.

580
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:14,900
Two years.

581
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,300
Four years.

582
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,830
If you don't agree,

583
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,060
how about paying for your shampoo

584
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:26,660
before you become bald?

585
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,090
Bao Jiaguo,

586
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,990
you'd better stop talking.

587
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,780
You're a language genius.

588
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,510
Don't be angry then.

589
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,180
Last time, in the cafe...

590
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,360
I was not following you.

591
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,980
I...

592
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,700
I found the dessert shop

593
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,140
on an app.

594
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,270
So I wanted to try it.

595
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,370
Meeting you was purely a coincidence.

596
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,380
Fine.

597
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,590
I went there because I saw your livestreaming announcement.

598
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,780
But don't worry.

599
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,310
I won't tell anyone

600
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,510
you cried and had snot bubbles.

601
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,800
Bao Jiaguo.

602
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,090
Thank you.

603
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,200
Thank you

604
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:18,810
for accompanying me when I was crying that day.

605
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:21,870
And

606
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,980
I said what I said at Shuangling Mountain

607
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,990
out of anger.

608
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,550
Don't...

609
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,710
take it to heart.

610
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:49,880
♫I don't need to doubt that I've fallen completely♫
