Our daughter is back.

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,700
You just came back like this

7
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,780
without bringing anything?

8
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:27,700
I have everything at home.

00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,100
Aren't you going to study?

10
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:31,500
Forget it.

11
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,810
She seems to be in a bad mood.

12
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,620
I have to go check on her.

13
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,979

00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,740
Your mother

41
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,780
personally called me this time

42
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,060
to invite me to attend her birthday party.

43
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,740
Do you think she doesn't object to us being together now,

44
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,100
and is going to accept me?

45
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,500
Well...

46
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,360
It's possible.

47

68

Although she doesn't talk much usually,

69
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,100
she's actually thoughtful,

70
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,540
and her hands are nimble.

71
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,630
She gives me chrysanthemum tea in summer.

when my arthritis relapsed and I was hospitalized,

75

Luo Si weaved ten pairs of woollen knee pads for me.

76
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,890
Besides, there were some words on each pair of knee pads.

77
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,500
It says...

78
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:44,110
Stay healthy forever.

79

84
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,900
so that we can have two good things to celebrate at the same time.

This is fate.

Yes, indeed.

If I had such a girl by my side,

93

I would take her as my goddaughter, too.

But don't worry.

00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,510
Didn't she say that she was going out to have a get-together?

192
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,690
But I saw that her eyes were red just now.

193
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,410
Did she cry?

194
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,510
I think so.

195
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:18,580
How about this?

196
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,300
You should send a message to her.

197
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,450
Tell her that we'll pick her up if she

198
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,490
comes back late from the get-together.

199
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:23,980
Okay.

200
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,580
I'll send the message now.

201
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:38,780
[Beer]

202
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,020
Today is my breaking-up party.

203
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,490
Happy breaking-up.

204
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,180
Today is my breaking-up party.

205
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,660
Let's have fun together.

206
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:54,810
Okay.

207
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:55,940
Dylan,

208
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,130
your Chinese girlfriend is really beautiful.

209
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,390
Ex-girlfriend.

210
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,390
Why did you break up?

211
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,690
I dated another girlfriend.

212
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,710
But she found out.

213
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,270
No!

214
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,040
I broke up with you

215
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,890
just because

216
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,260
it's boring to be with you.

217
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,520
She said you're boring.

218
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,490
Cheers.

219
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,270
Cheers.

220
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:21,820
Cheers.

221
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,490
Why?

222
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,270
Chen Miren, you're finally here.

223
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,850
Why did you drink so much?

224
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,400
This is juice.

225
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,140
I broke up with Fang Mao.

226
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,070
You broke up with him?

227
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,310
It's the 58th time.

228
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,840
It's not a big deal that you two broke up.

229
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,200
You'll be reconciled with each other in two days.

230
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,490
We won't be reconciled with each other this time.

231
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,280
Why?

232
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:52,990
Today is his mother's birthday.

233
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,170
I was invited to her party.

234
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,630
After all my efforts for so long,

235
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,190
their family finally accepted me.

236
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,620
Isn't that good?

237
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,370
Yes, it's good.

238
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,860
I've changed from her daughter-in-law-to-be to her goddaughter.

239
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,920
What kind of confusing operation is that?

240
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,410
His family is a scholar family.

241
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,280
His mother has always looked down on

242
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,710
a non-intellectual family like mine,

243
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,810
so she has been against it.

244
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,300
What about Fang Mao?

245
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,720
What's his attitude?

246
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:19,660
He...

247
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,820
I thought even though his mother was against it,

248
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,860
he would still be with me determinedly.

249
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,390
We agreed to get married after graduation.

250
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,950
But in the end,

251
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,900
he didn't say a word.

252
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,690
Actually, you thought too much.

253
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,270
Fang Mao is a mama's boy.

254
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:36,870
Miao!

255
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,350
Maybe Fang Mao is regretting it now,

256
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,780
and he's thinking about how to make you happy.

257
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:45,790
Really?

258
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,900
Right, Miao?

259
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,180
Yes, yes.

260
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,960
He'll come and make up with you later.

261
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,510
He's on his way now.

262
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,830
When he arrives,

263
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,990
he'll beg for your forgiveness,

264
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,800
and make up with you.

265
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,110
Xu Miaomiao.

266
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,500
Why do you sound as if you had broken up with your boyfriend?

267
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,670
Fang Mao is a scumbag.

268
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,820
At least, he has been a scumbag from the beginning to the end.

269
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,110
Unlike Bao Jiaguo.

270
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,090
As a scumbag, he's enthusiastic sometimes, and indifferent sometimes.

271
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,940
Bao Jiaguo is a scumbag?

272
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,490
No wonder you've kept mentioning Bao Jiaguo lately.

273
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,790
Can I not mention him?

274
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,530
Bao Jiaguo

275
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,380
shows up in front of me every day.

276
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,460
I met him when I was running.

277
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,190
I met him during the live stream, too.

278
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,800
Whenever I need help,

279
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,970
he'll show up around me.

280
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,820
But recently,

281
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,200
he suddenly ignored me.

282
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,100
Why?

283
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,500
How would I know?

284
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,380
He took the blame

285
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,610
for cheating in the exam last time.

286
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,880
Think about it.

287
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,390
He cares so much about reputation,

288
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,420
and he has been the class monitor for 13 years continually.

289
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,180
He failed the exam and had to retake the course.

290
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,060
It's probably the biggest stain in his life.

291
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:58,970
If he says that he doesn't have a crush on me,

292
00:13:59,300 --> 00:13:59,900
I don't believe it.

293
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:00,650
Neither do I.

294
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,310
Neither do I.

295
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,610
But why did he

296
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,940
suddenly ignore me?

297
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,430
Happy breaking-up.

298
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,730
Why aren't you sad at all?

299
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,630
We just broke up.

300
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,150
What's there to be sad about?

301
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,250
You hope that I would attempt suicide because of sadness?

302
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,060
I don't have the time.

303
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,920
I suddenly feel that I don't want to lose you.

304
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,370
You're really the most special Chinese girl I've ever seen.

305
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,030
You don't have to say that.

306
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,280
I'm sorry.

307
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,780
I broke up with Zhong Wei, too.

308
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,270
Why?

309
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,150
Because Cao Jiaer is back.

310
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,610
Cao Jia'er?

311
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,010
Who is Cao Jia'er?

312
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,940
Zhong Wei's childhood dream lover.

313
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,390
In high school,

314
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,980
he mistook me for Cao Jia'er.

315
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,920
That's why he dated me.

316
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,500
He could even mistake his dream lover for someone else?

317
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,200
What kind of dream lover is that?

318
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,090
Why don't you explain it clearly to Zhong Wei?

319
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,440
How can she explain it clearly for something like this?

320
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,450
Now Miren is just worried that

321
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,770
if she's not Zhong Wei's dream lover,

322
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,280
he'll break up with her.

323
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,390
After all,

324
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,870
between them,

325
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,090
there's at least the distance of two Xu Miaomiao,

326
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,640
plus another Xu Miaomiao.

327
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,300
Do you know how to comfort others?

328
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,490
I was thinking

329
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,040
if Zhong Wei knew that

330
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,470
I'm not Cao Jia'er,

331
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,810
and I even pretended to be Cao Jia'er just for being with him,

332
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,410
what he would think of me.

333
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,340
As expected,

334
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,780
he has been avoiding me since then.

335
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,510
Did you think too much?

336
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,940
No, I didn't!

337
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,120
He went to see the sunrise and watched movies

338
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,050
with Cao Jia'er.

339
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,660
They might have done some things

340
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,210
which I don't know.

341
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,070
Really?

342
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,820
Do you have evidence?

343
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,090
[Cao Jia'er]

344
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,380
I didn't expect Zhong Wei to be someone like this.

345
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,190
What kind of person Zhong Wei is now

346
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,470
doesn't matter to me anymore.

347
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,580
Even if he dates Cao Jia'er,

348
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,100
I don't care, either.

349
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,060
Really?

350
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:42,850
Yes.
