That's impossible.

186
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,430
See?

187
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,060
What?

188
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,050
Miss River Snail likes cats.

189
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,170
So all the girls in the world who like cats

190
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,520
are your hidden fans?

191
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,480
She doesn't need to hide herself.

192
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,360
It's very obvious.

193
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,350
You sound as if you knew who Miss River Nail is.

194
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,520
Of course I know.

195
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,670
Tell us who she is.

196
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,280
Come on.

197
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,370
It's a secret.

198
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,080
Chen Miren.

199
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,850
What did you do these days?

200
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,780
Why do you look so tired

201
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,300
like a donkey used for turning the grindstone?

202
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,640
It's fatigue in autumn.

203
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,190
This is a normal phenomenon.

204
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,470
How come Zhong Wei wears slippers to class?

205
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,260
Zhong Wei normally looks so cool, but I didn't expect him

206
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,510
to wear such cute slippers privately.

207
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,920
What do you know?

208
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,550
These were left by Miss River Snail.

209
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,080
Last night when the three of us returned to the dorm,

210
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,780
each of us had an extra pair of slippers.

211
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,140
However,

212
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,420
Zhong Wei's slippers are different from ours.

213
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,630
Don't you think this is strange?

214
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,980
Does someone have ulterior motives?

215
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,050
What Miss River Snail are you talking about?

216
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,310
What era is this?

217
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,040
Who would do such an old-fashioned thing?

218
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:02,590
Right, Chen Miren?

219
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,570
Yes.

220
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,610
So old-fashioned.

221
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,770
How could she do such a boring thing?

222
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,710
Zhong Wei, your leg is injured.

223
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,670
Alright. Today, let's start talking about

224
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,110
the theme of integral upper limit function.

225
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,730
Well, speaking of the differential coefficient of integral upper limit function...

226
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,140
So,

227
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,410
about the derivation of integral upper limit function,

228
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,040
we need to learn some formulas first.

229
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,600
You can go through these formulas first.

230
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,750
First of all, the first formula...

231
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,690
It's a gift from your girlfriend?

232
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,680
Zhong Wei.

233
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:57,960
I admit that

234
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,440
your new slippers are beautiful.

235
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,770
But you've been sitting here all night.

236
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,200
I'm off work, too.

237
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,600
Can you…

238
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,230
Chao.

239
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:07,950
I think something is wrong.

240
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,750
What's wrong?

241
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,010
It seems Chen Miren doesn't want to admit that

242
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,810
she's in a relationship with me.

243
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,560
How is that possible?

244
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,010
I've just found out that

245
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,920
no one in the school knows that

246
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:21,790
we're dating.

247
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,510
Are you too excellent?

248
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,620
So she's under a lot of pressure?

249
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,450
After all, Chen Miren

250
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,810
is quite ordinary.

251
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,590
Why do you think she's ordinary?

252
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,070
She's so cute

253
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,180
and so interesting.

254
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,350
She's also talented.

255
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,700
Where can you find another girl like this?

256
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,650
Fine.

257
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,600
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

258
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:43,690
This is not okay.

259
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,660
I have to find a chance

260
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,060
to make it public.

261
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,140
That's great.

262
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,780
I don't have to act with you anymore.

263
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,320
Chao.

264
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,050
Bring me the manuscript that has been sent to us today.

265
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,370
Let's discuss it.

266
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,490
My good buddy.

267
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,960
It's 1 a.m. now.

268
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,960
I'm not sleepy.

269
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,410
But I'm sleepy.

270
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,150
Fine.

271
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,190
Anyway, I'm just an 
unofficial clerk of Heng Chang.

272
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,070
I work so hard every day.

273
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,300
I don't know whom I'm doing this for.

274
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,460
I'm leaving.

275
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,000
I'll go fetch it, okay?

276
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,240
You talked as if you worked for me.

277
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,130
You're really irresistible by nature.

278
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,280
This is a sudden sanitary examination from school.

279
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,600
Those who refuse to be examined

280
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,040
will get dedecution of their points.

281
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,890
Open the door! Examination!

282
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,290
Open the door.

283
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,250
Not bad.

284
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,450
This is the model of a civilized dormitory.

285
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,270
Look.

286
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,640
There's someone on the wall!

287
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,060
It's true.

288
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,000
Why did she come to the boys' dorm?

289
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,590
That's so scary.

290
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,800
Why is this girl in the boys' dorm?

291
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,020
Isn't that Chen Miren?

292
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,620
It's too dangerous.

293
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,740
She's the one from Class 22 of the Business Administration Department.

294
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,740
It's too dangerous.

295
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,930
Have these people taken a telescope with them when they're out?

296
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,020
Yes, that's Chen Miren.

297
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,930
This is too dangerous.

298
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,510
Make way, please.

299
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,030
Excuse me.

300
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,849
Zhong Wei.

301
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,740
Isn't that your room?

302
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,599
Chen Miren!

303
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,609
What are you doing?

304
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,280
The director is checking the dorm inside.

305
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:23,210
Chen Miren is Miss River Snail?

306
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,250
I'll bet with 50 cents.

307
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,780
She must have come here because of Zhong Wei.

308
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:27,740
She's courting a guy to this extent.

309
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,180
It must be true love.

310
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,350
Hey!

311
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,420
The girl on the window,

312
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,630
which class are you in?

313
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,090
Why are you lying on the window of the boys' dorm?

314
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,050
She's Chen Miren from Class 22 of the Business Administration Department.

315
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,110
She's lying on the window of the boys' dorm.

316
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,760
She must have come here because of a boy.

317
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:46,940
Chen Miren?

318
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,680
Who are you here for?

319
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:56,490
Who are you here for? Who are you here for?

320
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,430
This is too embarrassing.

321
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,280
Chen Miren.

322
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,420
It's dangerous up there.

323
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,240
Come down first.

324
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,790
Who is she looking for here?

325
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,550
You have to tell the truth for getting a lighter punishment.

326
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,120
This behavior of a female student lying on the wall

327
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,480
of the boys' dorm should be published.

328
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,680
Director, who will you punish?

329
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,920
I'll punish them both.

330
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:23,580
Director,

331
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,300
actually,

332
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,950
Chen Miren is...

333
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,110
I'm sorry.

334
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,240
I'm here for Huang Xiaoyue!

335
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,030
Huang Xiaoyue.

336
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,210
Chen Miren.

337
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,080
You're talking nonsense!

338
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,900
Actually, you're...

339
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,090
Change yourself from a short man

340
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,190
to a tall man.

341
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,650
You're just too selfish.

342
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,930
Do you know

343
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,620
seeing you like this, how worried I am?

344
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,670
Huang Xiaoyue,

345
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:07,670
in this case, the love story between you two

346
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:08,930
is so impressive.

347
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,330
It can be recorded in school history.

348
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,930
Look. They're even wearing matching clothes for couples.

349
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,870
That's true.

350
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:22,080
Be together! Be together! Be together!

351
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:22,900
Huang Xiaoyue.

352
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,430
Ask Chen Miren to come down right now.

353
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,210
Chen Miren.

354
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,820
I know your affection.

355
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,920
Just go inside.

356
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,710
I beg you.

357
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,030
[Hanhai University]

358
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,550
The school doesn't object to your romantic relationship,

359
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,660
but you have to follow the school rules

360
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,870
and ensure your safety.

361
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,490
For this situation today,

362
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,000
I don't allow it to happen again.

363
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:52,220
Be together! Be together! Be together!

364
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,580
Huang Xiaoyue, slow down.

365
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,680
My legs are still weak.

366
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,530
I thought all the gossip news of the Hanhai University

367
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,720
was under my control.

368
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,050
But I didn't expect that I had left you out.

369
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,350
Tell me.

370

371
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,030
I didn't.

372

I advise you to think carefully before you talk.

373

The stinky socks on Zhong Wei's bed board

374
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,080

You really have a crush on Zhong Wei.

377
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,920
There are so many girls who like him anyway.

378
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,680
There won't be too many if I like him, too.

379
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,700
You sneaked into the boys' dorm to be Miss River Snail,

380
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,020
went outside the window on the fourth floor,

381
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,150
and confessed your love in front of the whole school.

382
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,430
In the end, you even asked me, your good friend,

383
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,680
to be the scapegoat.

384
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,590
Only you would do that, huh?

385
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,420
I had no choice but to ask you to be the scapegoat, didn't I?

386
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,310
I don't care.

387
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,000
I won't be the scapegoat.

388
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,020
I'm going to clarify it on the campus forum.

389
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,950
Change yourself from a short man to a tall man.

[Miss Lucky, namely Chen Miren, suddenly made a scene at the boys' dorm and confessed her love to Huang Xiaoyue. Is it true?]

At a place that is 20 meters away from the ground,

398
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:56,210
you confessed your love affectionately.

399
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,670
Were you going to commit suicide to show your love if you failed?

400
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,390
We thought that

401
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,150
you had a crush on Zhong Wei.

You even became Miss River Snail?

406
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,970
It's surprising that you thought of that.

407
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,530
I've been influenced by my excellent close friends.

They are the models of modern couples.

410

00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,900
Only my books are classified into different categories.

554
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,940
The floor tiles around my desk

555
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:52,100
are three times brighter than the other areas of the room.

556
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,100
For the legs of my chair,

557
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,620
she even put in a lot of effort

558
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:56,730
to hammer two more nails into each of them

559
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:58,710
and put an extra screw cap for reinforcement.

560
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,560
How come the more I think about it, the surer I am that

561
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,260
Chen Miren did that not because of you,

562
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,450
but me?

563
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,740
You are so narcissistic.

564
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,880
Do you think everyone likes you

565
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,130
just because you're the school hunk?

566
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,450
Let me tell you.

567
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,420
Chen Miren is not that vulgar.

568
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,820
Really?

569
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,490
But we were once in a romantic relationship in high school.

570
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,500
What do you mean?

571
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:20,970
Make it clear.

572
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:23,130
Chen Miren has been single for 18 years since she was born, hasn't she?

573
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,380
He just talked nonsense.

574
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,230
Chen Miren.

575
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,860
I still don't understand

576
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:37,010
why you have fallen in love Huang Xiaoyue.

577
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,570
What's so strange about that?

578
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:39,890
We grew up together,

579
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:40,950
and I fell in love with him as time went by.

580
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,250
Just like Fang Mao and me.

581
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,530
But Huang Xiaoyue

582
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,990
is stingy and narcissistic. He's also keen on getting petty advantages.

583
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,420
In class, he either dozes off

584
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,860
or watches female anchor dance.

585
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:51,470
You two are not a good match.

586
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,860
I also don't think that we're a good match.

587
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,120
That's also what you think? Then why did you confess your love to him?

588
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,020
I...

589
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,620
I was lonely.

590
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:08,040
Yes, I was too lonely.

591
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,560
I just wanted to be in a romantic relationship.

592
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,390
Anyone was fine for me.

593
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:13,850
I understand.

594
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,490
After all, dating

595
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:18,130
is the best thing in the world.

596
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:19,880
I can understand, too.

597
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,900
But what I don't understand is

598
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:23,410
why you chose Huang Xiaoyue.

599
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,010
I think Huang Xiaoyue is good.

600
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,140
Although he is not as good as Zhong Wei,

601
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:29,420
being simple can make the relationship last the longest.

602
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,590
Just imagine it.

603
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,040
After you two get married,

604
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,810
you'll cook dinner for him at home,

605
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,160
and wait for him to go home after work.

606
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,950
Then you'll give him a deep...

607
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:37,790
Wait.

608
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,740
How about I tell you the truth?

609
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:42,930
Actually,

610
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:46,060
Zhong Wei and I are dating each other.

611
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,050
I knew it.

612
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,810
The relationship between Chen Miren and Zhong Wei

613
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:56,430
is not simple.

614
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,840
Then why did you go to the boys' dorm

615
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:59,950
to confess your love to Huang Xiaoyue?

616
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,310
I was worried that Zhong Wei might be punished.

617
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,550
Under that urgent situation,

618
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,380
I asked Huang Xiaoyue to be the scapegoat.

619
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,040
So Huang Xiaoyue

620
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,670
did nothing wrong, but he had to take the blame.

621
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:09,950
He must be very angry.

622
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,530
Not only Huang Xiaoyue is angry,

623
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:12,950
but Zhong Wei is also angry.

624
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,540
He hasn't replied to my message till now.

625
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,570
When did you two get together?

626
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,510
After that day in the KTV room.

627
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,420
Good.

628
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,400
You did such a good job keeping it secret.

629
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:30,170
You've kept everything from us.

630
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,780
Actually,

631
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:36,450
I was once in a romantic relationship with Zhong Wei in high school.

632
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,330
What?

633
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,590
Hello? Hello?

634
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,880
Chen Miren from Class 22 of the Business Administration Department,

635
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,470
you have five minutes

636
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,110
to come to see me in the grove of the school.

637
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,260
I won't wait for you if you're late.

638
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,100
The countdown starts.

639
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,200
What does Zhong Wei want to do?

640
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,630
I don't know.

641
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,330
Go to see him at once.

642
00:33:58,810 --> 00:33:59,720
Be careful.

643
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,920
Isn't she having a fever?

644
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,300
Why is she running so fast?

645
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,440
This is the power of love.

646
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,780
Love can cure diseases?

647
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,409
Xu Miaomiao.

648
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,949
Hurry up and fall in love.

649
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,110
Then you'll understand everything.

650
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,219
I understand even if I'm not in love.

651
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,080
It's all written in my novel.

652
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,800
This boy is so romantic.

653
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:34,540
This girl must be very happy.

654
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,389
Chen Miren!

655
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,600
Zhong Wei, what are you doing?

656
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,179
I asked my girlfriend to come.

657
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:50,909
You could have called me and sent me a message.

658
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,929
At worst, you could have contacted me in the game.

659
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,860
That is more effective.

660
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:57,530
You'll be punished for the abuse of the school radio station.

661
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,410
Just let them punish me.

662
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,460
It'll be a good chance to

663
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,160
let the whole school know that we're in a relationship.

664
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,010
What?

665
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,370
Stop saying "what".

666
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,140
Chen Miren.

667
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,200
Do you have to keep it a secret when you're dating me?

668
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:14,420
I'm doing this for the sake of our relationship.

669
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,610
Just think about it.

670
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:16,710
In high school,

671
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:17,810
just because I was close to you,

672
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,280
I became the common enemy of all the girls at school.

673
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,540
It really affected our love experience.

674
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:22,850
Besides,

675
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,580
love is between two people.

676
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,530
Does it really matter whether others know it or not?

677
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,390
I still think that we should do it step by step.

678
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:36,590
Zhong Wei, what are you doing?

679
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,410
I'll give you two choices.

680
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,460
The first chocie is that

681
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,220
you wear my coat

682
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,460
and walk three laps with me at school.

683
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,600
What's the second choice?

684
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,540
Walk ten laps.

685
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,390
It's up to you.

686
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,990
♫I love your smile which is like a cherry♫

687
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:56,710
♫I like everything about you, from the tips of your hair to your feet♫

688

00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,830

695

Chen Miren!

702
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,150
Chen Miren, oh, Chen Miren.

703
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,510
There are so many girls in Hanhai University.

704
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,550
But I've still left you out.

705
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:06,090
I...

706
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,870
Zhong Wei and I actually knew each other

707
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:09,780
in high school.

708
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:10,700
I know.

709
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:12,650
You know?

710
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,050
Someone has told me about it.

711
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,640
I told him just now.

712
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,520
Chen Miren.

713
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,360
Don't show that indecent gaze.

714
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,790
I can't stand it.

715
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,110
You're the indecent one.

716
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,640
I'm your good friend,

717
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,100
but you kept such a big secret from me.

718
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,070
That's not okay.

719
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,810
I want you to make it up to me.

720
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,800
Then

721
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,200
Zhong Wei and I will treat you to dinner.

722
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:42,780
No.

723
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,560
I won't eat with you two.

724
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:45,400
As compensation,

725
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,690
the first photo used to announce your relationship officially

726
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,600
should be authorized to me.

727
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,200
No.

728
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,180
Okay.

729
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,180
Take the photo.

730
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,190
Take a good photo for us.

731
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,150
Zhong Wei.

732
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,030
You only look good when you appear cool.

733
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,860
♫I don't need to doubt that I've fallen completely♫
