Just go out this door, and we'll be there.

758
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:18,620
Let's go.

759
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:19,710
Let's go.

760
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,500
Wait.

761
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,300
Okay.

762
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:37,490
Let's go.

763
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,380
Chen Miren.

764
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,370
Where's the goose stewed in the iron pot?

765
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,390
Who knows that the restaurant suddenly moved?

766
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,020
The spicy hot pot is also good.

767
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:50,990
It's cheap.

768
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,260
[Spicy hot pot, 5 yuan each]

769
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,620
Why is it so expensive?

770
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:00,900
If you think it's expensive,

771
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,400
you can eat something else.

772
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,680
I didn't force you to eat.

773
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,290
Boss,

774
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,420
another skew of quail eggs.

775
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:08,469
Okay.

776
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:11,010
Thank you.

777
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,330
Five yuan for one skewer.

778
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,960
I'm starving.

779
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:18,920
Even if it costs 50 yuan, I'll have it.

780
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,730
Boss.

781
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,870
The bus is about to finish its service soon.

782
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:32,949
Do you know any other bus

783
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:34,570
to go back to the city?

784
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:35,750
Why don't we take a taxi?

785
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:36,909
It's expensive.

786
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,409
The bus is about the same.

787
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,620
It's spacious.

788
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,489
I'll send you there later.

789
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,949
You might catch the last bus.

790
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:44,790
Okay.

791
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:45,900
Okay, eat.

792
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:46,800
Hurry.

793
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:51,179
[Baiyun Pavilion] [Second Xinhe Village] [North Jiangdongmen Road]

794
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,389

Zhong Wei, what's wrong?

798
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,850
♫I don't need to doubt that I've fallen completely♫
