The reason why the Companion Cat is selling well in OHH

254
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,220
but the sales are poor on the distributors' side

255
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,560
is because OHH

256

provides a good shopping experience and atmosphere.

00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,970
8 years and 6 months.

380
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,610
Do you know

381
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,950
what Heng Chang relied on to establish itself in the industry?

382
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,160
Heng Chang has the greatest capital

383
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,820
and top designers in the country.

384
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,580
It has a broad sales network

385
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,380
throughout Asia and China,

386
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,920
which formed a competitive barrier.

387
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:53,800
What else?

388
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,810
Isn't that enough?

389
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,070
The company has come this far

390
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,230
and became the leading enterprise in this industry

391
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,840
due to its innovative spirit.

392
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,530
It relies on collective creativity.

393
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:05,940
Excuse me.

394
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,480
Is there any difference?

395
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:08,280
Dawei.

396
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,290
You’re stubborn

397
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,430
and rigid,

398
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,110
and also believe in the policy of elimination

399
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:19,430
which abolished our designers' imagination and creativity.

400
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,470
Even with the addition of Hirai,

401
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,720
he was unable to fulfill his role effectively.

402
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,250
You're not protecting the company,

403
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,620
but your personal authority.

404
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,710
Mr. Zhong,

405
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,290
you can't doubt my loyalty to the company.

406
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,390
I've never doubted that.

407
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,170
But now,

408
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,100
you are the one

409
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,440
who hurt the company.

410
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,620
At this point,

411
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,180
you don't have to be so grandiose.

412
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,120
You just wanted to protect Zhong Wei.

413
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,530
Have you ever thought

414
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,790
why you had the confidence to bet with Zhong Wei?

415
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,590
That's because you knew

416
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,380
even if you defeat Zhong Wei,

417
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,720
I won't target you because of that.

420
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,410
Because competition

421
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,980
is better for innovation.

422
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,670
I won't take legal action against you

423
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,590

424
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,320
You should leave.

00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,600
This is where our dream begins.

570
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:01,940
You like it?

571
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,470
Then let's renovate it.

572
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:05,180
Okay.

573
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,360
I'll call

574
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,340
the virtual reality engineer.

575
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,610
No, I mean

576
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:13,320
my dad gave us money.

577
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,370
This money

578
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,370
can not only help you renovate the store,

579
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,220
you can even use it to

580
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,780
open more stores.

581
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,350
Really?

582
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,480
If we can interact online and offline,

583
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,940
the effect will be better.

584
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:33,920
Hello?

585
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,160
What?

586
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,730
The woods of our high school are going to be renovated.

587
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,070
Let's go.

588
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:44,240
[OHH]

589
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,990
Let's celebrate every anniversary together, okay?

590
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:51,830
Okay.

591
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,660
What if they want to build a building over this forest?

592
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,320
Then

593
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,270
we can bury it in the woods downstairs of our company.

594
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,460
What if the company goes bankrupt?

595
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,790
Then we can bury it in the garden below the house.

596
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,950
Whose house?

597
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,850
Our house.

598
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,280
Who knows what will happen in the future?

599
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,720
Graduation season is breakup season.

600
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,750
Haven't you heard of that?

601
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:44,710
From now on,

602
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,620
I won't show you my notes.

603
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,930
I won't explain the questions to you.

604
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,750
I won't give you the key points before the exam

605
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,600
so that you can never graduate.

606
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,960
You're so cruel.

607
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,480
Chen Miren.

608
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,020
Remember,

609
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,630
no matter how many times you want to break up with me,

610
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:03,210
I will find you.

611
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,590
No exception.

612
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,100
Chen Miren.

613
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:22,460
♫The soil is fragrant in the countryside's road♫

614
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,240
Chen Miren.

615
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:22,750
If you want to break up with me this time,

616
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,180
I won't wait for you at the same place.

617
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:29,600
♫There's dew on the petals, and a rainbow has formed over it♫

618
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,940
I just left without saying goodbye. Calm down.

619
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,780
Chen Miren has broken up with you.

620
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,260
Please keep your distance.

621
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,580
We didn't break up.

622
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:36,860
♫We look at each other and smile♫

623
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,620
We're just having a cold war, right?

624
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,860
Can you be reasonable?

625
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,220
Who can be reasonable in a fight

626
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,100
between two lovers?

627
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:39,580
I hope we can go to the same university,

628
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:45,010
♫He said he would dance with me with the passage of time♫

629
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,980
be in the same major

630
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,460
and in the same class.

631
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,340
My wish was

632
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,790
that Zhong Wei's wish

633
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,140
would come true.

634
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:50,540
♫I felt uneasy at first♫

635
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,950
♫Then I gradually walked into your heart♫

636
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,820
It's all thanks to Lucky's blessing

637
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,020
that my relationship

638
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:57,970
♫Originally, I was used to avoiding you♫

639
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,980
can overcome obstacles everytime.

640
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,500
What Lucky?

641
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:00,920
♫Now I'm holding your hand tightly♫

642
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,460
It's all because you know I like you.

643
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,430
♫It's him♫

644
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:10,010
♫Who has accepted my unpolished willfulness and sorrow♫

645
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:11,870
♫It's him♫

646
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:17,590
♫Who has brought me sweet spring and flowers♫

647
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,370
♫He's still there when I turn around♫

648
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,620
Wait.

649
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,700
You think it's going to end like this?

650
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:28,100
I want to have a proper farewell with everyone.

651
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,650
Hello, I'm Chen Miren.

652
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,310

and very cute girl.

655
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,440
I'm girl who's a little petty,

656
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,350
likes to get angry

657
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,670
and who likes to run away.

658
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,220
A girl who persists her dream

659
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,950
with some talent

660
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,630
and never gives up.

661
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:57,130
I'm very grateful

662
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,950
for having a loving father

663
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,970
who secretly gave me money

664
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,290
and my mom with a sharp tongue and a soft heart.

665
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,270
I love you.

666
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,480
I was lucky

667
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:14,360
to meet all of you at Hanhai University.

668
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,390
Beautiful,

669
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:18,810

670
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,800

671
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,200
and honest love expert.

672
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,590
Extremely straight girl, Xu Miaomiao.

673
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,700
A girl who is good at everything

674
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,650
and is an expert in all types of life skills.

675
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:34,350
Someone who always cares about others, Luo Si.

676
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,340
Rooted in China, with a global perspective,

677
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,920
she may appear cold on the outside

678
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:44,790
but she's a top student with a passionate and fiery heart. That's Zhao Gu.

679
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,610
And let's not forget about our responsible table tennis expert,

680
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:50,990
who has a wealth of theoretical knowledge

681
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,820
about dating but limited practical experience.

682
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,490
Our class monitor, Bao Jiaguo.

683
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,630
My childhood friend Huang Xiaoyue.

684
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,470
Although you are not tall,

685
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,300
and bad at both studying and gossiping.

686
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,470
But you will realize your dream.

687
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:11,440
Because you are sincere, persistent, and has love in your heart.

688
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,830
I never had an official chance

689
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:19,090
to thank Zhong Wei.

690
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,420
Thank you for not giving up on me.

691
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,290
Thank you for always encouraging me.

692
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,560
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

693
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,520
I believe we will always be together.

694
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,240
Lastly, I wish that

695
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,430
all of you who witnessed our growth
