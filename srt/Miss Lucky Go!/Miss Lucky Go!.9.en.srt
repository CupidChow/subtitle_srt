You lent it to me?

Are you going to keep it without returning it to me?

385
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,980
It's okay.

[University Life Plan]

388
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,300
Pei's work this time is barely passable,

389
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,230
but the color scheme is a disaster.

390
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,540
Adjust it again for me.

And this is steampunk,

was able to continue and nurture life on another planet

through the use of giant ovum embryo machines,

413
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,580

Amazing.

More than that.

I heard she's not even majoring in this area.

433
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,460
You're not even a design major

434
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,840
but you still applied for a designer position.

435
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,450
You were eliminated in the preliminary round, right?

436
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,780
You were just lucky

the billionaire heir of a wealthy conglomerate

450
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,060
or a calculating boss who's cold and reserved?

451
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,180
No.

00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:14,060
But there was an irritating female supervisor

453
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:14,770
who made me run errands.

454
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,290
I knew it.

00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,100
only exists in my novels.

By the way, Miao,

that Zhong Jianguo is a fake rich heir.

460
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,130
Was there any follow-up?

461
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,280
Chen Xiaomi

462
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,710

463
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,660
Zhong Jianguo during his weakest moments

464
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,620
and never left him.

465
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,640
And their relationship

466
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,720
has even improved.

467
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,420
I think their feelings for each other

468
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,810
will have a happy ending.

do for Zhong Jianguo?

For example, she secretly introduced clients to him,

474
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,060

475

504

00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,690
I hope you won't let me down.

566
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:48,940
I'll try my best.

567
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,260
By the way,

568
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,700
are you close to Qi Chao?

569
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,480
No, we only met twice.

570
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,190
Okay.

571
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,640
Do you know Zhong Wei?

572
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,780
No.

573
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,800
Aren't you two in the same major?

574
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:06,650
You don't know him?

575
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,140
I mean...

576
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,960
We know each other, but we don't know each other well.

577
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,790
We are just classmates.

578
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:16,780
Yes, just classmates.

579
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,860
It's okay. You can go now.

580
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,200
That's true,

581
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:35,730
they can just be ordinary classmates.

582
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,060
[Open]

583
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,660
Zhong Wei, what can I do for you?

584
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,640
Nice.

585
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,400
Huang Xiaoyue.

586
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:28,840
Here, these are all your favourites.

587
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,470
Tell me. What is it?

588
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,670
I want to ask you something.

589
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,990
A basketball player like you

590
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,650
who are in their youth,

591
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,970
a talented student like you who majors in Business Administration

592
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,900
and resides in Dorm 405.

593
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,210
What challenges do you need to resolve?

594
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,810
It can only be height problems, I think?

595
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,010
There's no such thing.

596
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,160
Not having a girlfriend?

597
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,970
There's nothing I can do about that.

598
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:02,190
Unable to understand advanced maths?

599
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,280
I don't know that either.

600
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,610
Huang Xiaoyue, think again.

601
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:06,510
Think about it.

602
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,070
You sneezed. You caught a cold?

603
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:11,370
Is the quilt in the dorm too thin?

604
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,520
Or is the water heater broken?

605
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,810
Let me see.

606
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,320
Don't touch me.

607
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:16,700
It's all because

608
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,520
our dorm has poor sanitation conditions.

609
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,480
I'm allergic.

610
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:22,410
Look, my pimples are getting worse.

611
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,090
I see. Thanks.

612
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,010
What...

613
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:48,350
What did she understand? She even thanked me.

614
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,350
Hey, take a break.

615
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,570
Have some snacks.

616
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,140
Here.

617
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,100
One for everyone.

618
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:55,890
Thank you.

619
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,590
This is too high.

620
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:28,130
It seems I can only get in from here.

621
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,420
Chen Miren, what are you doing?

622
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,400
I'm just passing by.

623
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,010
Passing by?

624
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,490
We have a basketball game with the next class tomorrow.

625
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,460
Do you want come and cheer for me?

626
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,320
Zhong Wei is not participating.

627
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,740
I think this is the best chance

628
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,740
for me to win

629
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:45,860
the MVP.

630
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,390
Zhong Wei and you won't be here tomorrow.

631
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,430
Ask Bao Jiaguo to cheer for you.

632
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,840
He has a loud voice.

633
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:54,990
With his encouragement,

634
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,130
it'll be easy for you

635
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,520
to win the MVP.

636
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,020
Fine.

637
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:07,220
Now I'm free to do anything I want

638
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,050
with the entire room 405.

639
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,720
Zhong Wei, we'll open tomorrow.

640
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,460
I've figured out the whole activity procedure.

641
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,960
You can take photos with female fans,

642
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,910
play games with them

643
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:35,640
and...

644
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:36,310
I refuse.

645
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:38,150
Why?

646
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,780
I have a girlfriend.

647
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:44,190
It's for work, Chen Miren will understand.

648
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,800
She doesn't understand or need to understand.

649
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:50,370
By the way, when I went to the company today,

650
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,290
I met Chen Miren.

651
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,310
And then?

652
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,520
Of course I cooperated with your act.

653
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,910
I told her

654
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,670
you are a temporary staff I recruited.

655
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,330
What act did you cooperate with?

656
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:05,220
I think Chen Miren doesn't care

657
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,060
whether I'm rich or not.

658
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,020
I think

659
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,830
she's caring about me. That's cute.

660
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:15,330
Okay, I know.

661
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,840
Let nature take its course.

662
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,239
Yes, let it be.

663
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,730
Are you free tomorrow?

664
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:25,360
Was it because you planned to let Chen Miren

665
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,540
attend the opening tomorrow,

666
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:28,150
so you refused to take photos with your fans?

667
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,340
I'm busy. I'm not free tomorrow.

668
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,010
Is she not coming tomorrow?

669
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,100
Can you agree to take photos now?

670
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,060
I won't take any photos no matter if she comes or not.

671
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,040
Okay, I'm leaving.

672
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:45,400
Where are you going?

673
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:48,710
I'm going back to work overtime

674
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:50,489
and make another plan.

675
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,560
OHH is a mysterious code.

676
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,960
After translating it, it means "stay by my side."

677
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:28,500
OHH's purpose is to create

678
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:30,010
a brand new kingdom of figurines

679
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,600
with the theme of companionship and guardianship.

680
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,410
Our main product is this Companion Cat.

681
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,710
It's the first time we use self-heating material.

682
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,180
Once it comes into contact with the human body,

683
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:41,010
it will emit a little warmth.

684
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:42,910
So this figure is no longer

685
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,530
just a lifeless item in collections and decorations

686
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,350
but a friend

687
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:47,760
who brings people company and warmth.

688
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,390
Please line up.

689
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,220
The first ten to order

690
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,110
will be given an autographed photo of the handsome shop manager.

691
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,070

You're the manager,

705
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,110
of course it's yours.

706
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,380
You didn't want to take pictures with your fans.

707
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,740
I could only change to another strategy.

708
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,030
Not too bad.

709
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,730

00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,100
