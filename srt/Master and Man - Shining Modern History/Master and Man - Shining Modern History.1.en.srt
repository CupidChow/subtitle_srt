1
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:46,540
HYUN-DAE

2
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,800
‘Don’t marry,

3
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,920
you will also regret it.’

4
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,930
Kierkegaard.

5
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,360
How’s wedding prep going?

6
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,020
What’s there to do?

7
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,030
It’s just a ceremony.

8
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,570
How’s Soon-yi?

9
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,200
She thinks marrying me
is blessing enough.

10
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,950
She’s over the moon.

11
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,410
Don’t be cute.

12
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,250
Come in!

13
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,170
Hey, Min-joong!

14
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,550
Put them here.

15
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,050
You’re getting hotter.

16
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,550
Choon-bae must be
treating you well.

17
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,930
Stop your yapping
and be nice to her.

18
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,640
Don’t make weird jokes
in front of the juniors.

19
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,810
Min-joong!

20
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,150
I’ve never seen him
look after one of the juniors.

21
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,730
Congrats on your wedding.

22
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,950
Send my love to
Soon-yi too.

23
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,740
Not coming to the wedding?

24
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,490
Of course I’ll be there.

25
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,180
Don’t call me ‘Choon-bae’
in front of the kids.

26
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,680
You expect me to
call you ‘Prof. Kim’?

27
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,480
Maintain some semblance
of respect.

28
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,940
What happened to
my candidacy this time?

29
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,360
Joon-hyuk’s taking it.

30
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,450
Why him out of the blue?!

31
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,280
He’s more than qualified.

32
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,240
He had a great show
in New York last year,

33
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,909
and evaluation was good too.

34
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:49,620
You said getting married
will get me that!

35
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,500
I said ‘married’ would be
safer than ‘single’.

36
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,550
And you’re not even
officially married.

37
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,130
The wedding is in 2 days!

38
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,300
Soon-yi is a great gal.

39
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,890
Don’t hurt her and live well.

40
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,230
And in due time,
your turn will come.

41
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,400
Don’t start asking for dessert
before your meal.

42
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,070
Come on, man!

43
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,120
Honey, could you bring me
Prof. Kim’s painting?

44
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,640
How is it?
Is it crooked?

45
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,350
No, but why hang someone
else’s work in my work space?

46
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,940
He could come to
our house warming.

47
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,730
No way...

48
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:01,780
So this is his only wedding gift?

49
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,610
His paintings are all the rage lately.

50
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,780
I bet it’s worth quite a bit.

51
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,700
It’d be weird if they weren’t
after all that ass kissing.

52
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,080
Why are you always
so pessimistic?

53
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,170
It’s not me,
it’s the whole world.

54
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,130
Why do things the right way?

55
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,760
The results are already chosen.

56
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,800
The strong is the king.

57
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,800
And that’s Choon-bae Kim.

58
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,140
I don’t quite understand
your relationship with him.

59
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,810
You two seem incredibly close,

60
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,350
but deep inside
not that at all.

61
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,350
It’s simple, a crocodile
and a crocodile bird.

62
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,280
We just need each other,
nothing more, nothing less.

63
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,900
Are you still pissed
because of the candidacy?

64
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,900
Not still, I’ll continue to be.

65
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,409
I’m getting married for nothing...

66
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,630
You should call him
to thank him for it.

67
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,880
Whatever!

68
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,380
If you’re so thankful,
go do it yourself!

69
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,610
Honey, dinner’s ready.

70
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,780
Okay.

71
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,030
Did you get on Choon-bae’s
bad side by any chance?

72
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,280
Why?

73
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,290
Nothing, let’s eat.

74
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,760
I made reservation at
a famous sushi place.

75
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,100
This way, this way.

76
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,440
Why isn’t she answering?

77
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,530
Min-ju!

78
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,620
Min-ju! Hey!

79
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,330
Min-ju Jung!

80
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,090
Hey!

81
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,010
Where should we go?

82
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,680
We’re going to
our respective homes.

83
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,679
Don’t fool around.

84
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:35,600
I almost died wanting
to see you all day.

85
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,020
Are we like that now?

86
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,440
Hey!

87
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,230
My body is yours,
your body is mine.

88
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,110
My marriage doesn’t
suddenly change that.

89
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,940
I’m not into clingy men.

90
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,700
Wait!

91
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,080
We were never gonna get married,
so why are you like this?

92
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,750
I just needed no strings
sex partner, that’s all.

93
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,290
Now you got one.

94
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,170
I got none.

95
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,460
My marriage is like
a business deal.

96
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,300
No different than
military or a job.

97
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,550
A rite of passage
to become an adult.

98
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,090
You got a stable sex partner
out of it though.

99
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,510
Use that properly.

100
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,510
Can’t have sex with family.

101
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,600
Family is loyalty,
relationship is elsewhere.

102
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,730
I don’t want that kind of relationship.

103
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:23,480
Min-ju!

104
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,980
Then let’s stick to sex,
hot as ever.

105
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,900
Have a hot one at home,
with your wife.

106
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,910
Min-ju!

107
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,820
Min-ju Jung!

108
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,830
You’re hotter when angry.

109
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,160
Min-ju! Hey! Hey!

110
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,550
This wasn’t easy to come by.

111
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,890
Get some experience
for 2-3 years,

112
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,770
and let’s try the next round.

113
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,810
Continuing education?

114
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,310
You really don’t get it.

115
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,110
You gotta pay your dues,
and wipe some asses,

116
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,530
that’s how you become a prof.

117
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,910
You can’t do it in one shot.

118
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,740
It’s still a prof position

119
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,700
Are you kidding?

120
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,370
There aren’t any profs
at continuing ed!

121
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,670
If it’s on the business card,
then you really are one.

122
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:28,290
Community college or university,
what does it matter?

123
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,170
Whatever.

124
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,590
Let me think about it.

125
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,760
Say what?

126
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,970
There are plenty of
other eager candidates.

127
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,800
Forget it then.

128
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,010
Okay!

129
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,310
Fuck...

130
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,940
How could this world
treat a great artist like shit?

131
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,650
So sad...

132
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,070
You still got your pride.

133
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,700
Are you Da Vinci?
Michelangelo?

134
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,160
Get it together,
you’re a married man now.

135
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,580
Dude.

136
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,920
Who did I get married for?

137
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,760
The next piece symbolizes

138
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:19,220
modern lives that are forced
to live in confinement.

139
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,060
Paradoxically, you could feel
longing for freedom,

140
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,560
and some interpret in
a religious way.

141
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,150
This artist is all the rage
at the moment.

142
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,030
It means his paintings
are selling like hotcakes.

143
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,530
You’ll now learn to paint,

144
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:42,740
how long do you think
you’ll take to paint this?

145
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,410
- 5 months.
- 5 months?

146
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,410
- 1 year.
- 1 year?

147
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,620
One month is enough.

148
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:53,170
If you’re talented,
just learn how to mix the paint.

149
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,170
Come on.

150
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:57,380
Ma’am, you don’t believe me?

151
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,970
You can’t?

152
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,970
Then in a month, I’ll invite
the artist who painted this

153
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:08,100
and have him critique your work.

154
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,060
We’re really close.

155
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,860
Painting is not a difficult task.

156
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,660
‘What to paint,’
‘what to express,’

157
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:27,200
once you select your subject,
anyone can become a painter.

158
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,790
‘So don’t expect much from me,’

159
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,590
‘painting is shit
from my heart,’

160
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,840
it’s like that, understand?

161
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,630
Yes.

162
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,710
I can feel the scent
of a woman’s life from you.

163
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:25,260
That scent is contained
within your clothes.

164
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,470
So that it won’t easily escape.

165
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:37,940
Then one by one...

166
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,150
when the bound is released,

167
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,700
the scent is released.

168
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,890
Anxiety and thrill are
important aspects of art.

169
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,890
What if someone comes?

170
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,890
No one’ll come.

171
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:55,140
It looks good to see you
eat so well.

172
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,180
You should eat too.

173
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,180
Sure, I’m eating.

174
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,400
You’re married, right?

175
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,569
Yes, and you, professor?

176
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:08,780
Yes, me too.

177
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:14,530
And don’t be so formal,
I’m not even a professor.

178
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:16,079
I’m allowed?

179
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,040
Sure.

180
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,660
We’ve already demolished
teacher-and-pupil relationship.

181
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,170
Just call me Hyun-dae.

182
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:25,920
Okay, Hyun-dae!

183
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,320
I still got it.

184
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,700
Did you drink a lot?

185
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,620
A little.

186
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,290
Then sleep it off at home.

187
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,340
Min-ju!

188
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,510
As I got drunk,
I wanted to see you.

189
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,010
We should’ve had
coffee dates like this,

190
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,180
and go to restaurants too,
it’d have been great.

191
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,980
We were too busy having sex,
and then leaving.

192
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,610
Sorry, Min-ju.

193
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,070
Why is your hand so cold?

194
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:33,950
It always was.

195
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:37,450
No way, you’re a hot gal.

196
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,370
You’re so hot during sex.

197
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,540
That again?

198
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,540
Should I get a divorce?

199
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,000
Those who get divorced
don’t ask such a thing.

200
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,710
They just do it.

201
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,670
If your heart’s not in it,
just bare with it.

202
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,550
Don’t stress others around you.

203
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:59,510
My marriage is so dull
and boring,

204
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,060
I just really, really miss you.

205
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,480
So you’re just after sex.

206
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,570
I always want to do it with you.

207
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,150
But not today.

208
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,450
You’re on your period.

209
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,740
Nope.

210
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,450
Don’t joke around.

211
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,790
I’m still an artist.

212
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:28,500
I’m very detail-oriented
and super keen.

213
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,260
I bet I know your body
more than you do.

214
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,140
What are you doing?

215
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,270
Stop that, what if
someone sees you?

216
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,020
Let them.

217
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,810
How’s this?

218
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,820
Are you nuts?
What’s with you?!

219
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,160
It’s my wedding gift.

220
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,790
Let this be my replacement.

221
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,000
Min-ju! Min-ju!

222
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,890
Don’t move.

223
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,270
This really is the last time.

224
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,190
You’ll really quit?

225
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,150
Yes.

226
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,900
I’ll make you into an artist,

227
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,490
and find you a husband
as my protégé.

228
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,500
So why take the chance?

229
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,790
I’d like to try it on my own.

230
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,500
By yourself, how?

231
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,310
Do you lack ambition
or sense of reality?

232
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:11,810
Kids nowadays don’t know
how to be patient.

233
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,610
Hey.

234
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:21,820
If you make that face,
I can draw!

235
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,240
I don’t know what you want.

236
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:31,000
Joy that follows
extreme horror and pain!

237
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:36,380
That’s what I want to feel from you.

238
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,420
It’s too hard.

239
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,650
Could we not do it today?

240
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,980
Not do what?

241
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,280
Sex.

242
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:08,620
You think I want you
only for sex?

243
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,580
From your face,

244
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:20,630
I want to pull emotions
that your body feels after pain!

245
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:24,470
There’s nothing there,
I’m just tired.

246
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:29,390
You’re just a brat,
what made you like this?

247
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:36,440
You think I’m doing this because
I lust after this petty body?

248
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:45,660
I thought we were connected
spiritually and physically,

249
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:52,330
having some common ground
as my personal muse.

250
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,370
Was I wrong?

251
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,880
I’m sorry.

252
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,670
Then do it.

253
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,720
If you were me,
would you want to?

254
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,920
I’m really jealous.

255
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,260
You live with such a handsome man.

256
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,670
How’s this neck tie?

257
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:48,050
This is far trendier
and would look better on him.

258
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:52,390
So? Do I look okay?

259
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,020
Yes, you look stunning!

260
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,270
Then I’ll go with this.

261
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,940
Hyun-dae, one second.

262
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,860
Is Hyun-dae treating you well?

263
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,070
Yes, he’s nice to me.

264
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:11,120
Is he still out and about,
fooling around?

265
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,660
Of course not.

266
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,000
Why do you like him so much?

267
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
He’s so handsome.

268
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:25,970
All right, I’ll give you that,
but he’s got nothing else.

269
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,840
Why did you want to see me?

270
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,520
Min-joong wants to quit
being my assistant.

271
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,730
I’ll need you to come for a while.

272
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,650
I got a job!

273
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:43,190
Art class teacher isn’t a job.

274
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,110
I’ll talk to Hyun-dae about it.

275
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,530
I think...

276
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:52,830
he knows about us.

277
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,290
What about us?

278
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:59,960
The connection between
an artist and his muse

279
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,710
surpasses the physical world!

280
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:08,170
If you think it’s lewd,
then you’re being weird!

281
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,100
Have some fruit.

282
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,850
Okay, thank you.

283
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:21,850
Min-joong is quitting
and going home.

284
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:25,230
Really? That idiot.

285
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,230
I told her to stick with it.

286
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:32,740
The professor asked me
to fill in for a while.

287
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,620
So?

288
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,500
I told him I wouldn’t.

289
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,330
Okay.

290
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:45,380
It won’t cause you
any harm, right?

291
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,090
You know how he is...

292
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,050
Do what you want.

293
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,680
You’re not a kid,
I can’t force you to do anything.

294
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,730
Choon-bae, that son of a bitch.

295
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,740
Why is he making
my wife do shit?

296
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:17,410
Crocodile

297
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:23,540
They got no passion,
and devotional mindset.

298
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:28,590
So what will they paint with?

299
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:33,470
Talent? That’s in regards
to the results.

300
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:37,390
If same efforts are in a race,

301
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:43,140
the one who ends up with
more results has more talent.

302
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:47,690
They won’t put in the effort,
but paint only with talent?

303
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,700
That’s illogical,
that’s delusion.

304
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,990
Right.

305
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:58,990
Kids nowadays don’t know that.

306
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:02,250
They think if they set
their mind to it,

307
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:08,380
they’ll come up with masterpiece
and become a master!

308
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,050
So pitiful.

309
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:14,260
Even now, when I paint,

310
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:20,640
I must feel pain of ropes
burrowing into my skin.

311
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:26,270
How could one sublimate into
a piece without despair and pain?

312
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,440
Son of a...

313
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,730
Of course.

314
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,280
Aren’t there any chicks here?

315
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:44,710
- Baby.
- Jesus...

316
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,710
Wakey, wakey.

317
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,960
You should sleep at home.

318
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,090
- Where’s Choon-bae?
- He went home.

319
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,800
I’m off too...

320
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,010
You gotta pay the bill.

321
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:06,140
He invited me...

322
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,020
He should’ve paid the tab.

323
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,690
How much?

324
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,610
$1,400.

325
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:15,150
- What?
- For the 2nd round too.

326
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,700
What 2nd round?

327
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:19,320
The professor took a girl home.

328
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,580
Whatever!

329
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:25,620
Let him pay for the drinks
and the chick he’s fucking!

330
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:29,580
It doesn’t matter who drank what,
someone’s gotta pay for it.

331
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
No? Sit.

332
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,510
That son of a bitch...

333
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:37,220
How could you do this to me?

334
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,300
What did you say?

335
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,300
Not you.

336
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,890
You take Visa?

337
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:59,070
How am I supposed to
do stage design?

338
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,700
I don’t know anything.

339
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,200
No one starts out great.

340
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,450
You can give it a shot.

341
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,460
But this is all wrong.

342
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,630
So you won’t do it?

343
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:14,630
It pays a ton.

344
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,920
Just get a junior
to do all the work!

345
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,970
Okay, I’ll think about it.

346
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,640
Always thinking...

347
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:33,020
You think getting to know
someone like her is easy?

348
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:38,440
This is a great way to
make a permanent client.

349
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:41,070
She’s no ordinary woman.

350
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,080
Thank you.

351
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,210
Drink.

352
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,470
I’m told you have plenty of
stage design experience.

353
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,390
- Pardon?
- Yes.

354
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:08,560
He took on all theater
and stage designs in school,

355
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:12,350
and he did some work
for theater troupes too.

356
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,900
You can trust him
to do good work.

357
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,650
Then please do a great job.

358
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,410
He’ll do well.

359
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:36,540
MIN-JU

360
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,510
It was like a miracle.

361
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:49,310
To imagine Jesus’ pain
and love on the cross,

362
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:53,770
is horrific and beautiful
at the same time.

363
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:58,820
My ambition to capture
that moment,

364
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,820
that noble sacrifice on the canvas

365
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,150
is how I became who I am.

366
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:05,860
Is that so?

367
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:09,950
Even though every moment
in front of the canvas is painful,

368
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:12,500
I feel thankful instead.

369
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,750
- That’s incredible.
- Thank you.

370
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:16,580
- Professor.
- Yes?

371
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,380
I’m curious about your family.

372
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,710
Right.

373
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:27,510
A few years ago,
my wife passed on,

374
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,470
and I met my current wife.

375
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,510
Oh...

376
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:36,980
To me she was like a ray of hope
during my direst time.

377
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,730
She’s actually much younger than me,

378
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:45,400
and she suffered heartaches
because of me.

379
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,780
And when my father was
diagnosed with Alzheimer’s,

380
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:56,250
she went out of her way
to take care of him.

381
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,460
I see…

382
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,050
She’s an absolute angel to me.

383
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:06,510
She sounds incredible.

384
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:11,810
She must be watching this broadcast,
how about a video letter to her?

385
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,350
Here?

386
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:17,060
Sure, towards that camera.

387
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,310
This is embarrassing.

388
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:26,530
Sweetie, baby.

389
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:29,780
If it wasn’t for you,

390
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:35,000
I wouldn’t be alive right now.

391
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,460
I’ll do it today.

392
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,430
Wait.

393
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,970
You can cum inside.

394
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,060
Leaving already?

395
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:22,020
I better.

396
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,110
My mother-in-law came by today.

397
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:28,940
Who cares, you’ll get a divorce.

398
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:34,489
I can’t have any dirt on me
during the divorce proceedings.

399
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:37,159
You don’t want that either.

400
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,500
It doesn’t matter,
sleep here.

401
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:46,000
Why are you so needy today?

402
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:56,679
Hey! Min-ju!

403
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:59,180
Force it out of me.

404
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,940
Stop kidding around,
give it back.

405
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:06,860
You’ll get scent on it.

406
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,990
What scent?

407
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,530
A woman’s scent.

408
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:25,420
Madame, hello!

409
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,590
Thank you so much for coming.

410
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,550
Your daughter?

411
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:32,840
Thank you, feel free
to look around.

412
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,720
My sincere apologies.

413
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,390
You did a great job with the show.

414
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,060
The reaction is great.

415
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,600
It’s all thanks to you.

416
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,310
I’m truly thankful.

417
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,020
You haven’t met
my husband, right?

418
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,030
Oh!

419
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,570
I’m so honored to meet you.

420
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,570
Thank you for coming.

421
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,370
I heard you extended
your hospital.

422
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:05,160
As a painter, I only have
paintings to donate,

423
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,630
please let me know
if you like anything.

424
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,250
It’ll be my gift to you.

425
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,250
I don’t know much
about paintings.

426
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,920
I’ll let you pick one.

427
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,420
Certainly.

428
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,300
Professor!

429
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,590
Ms. Jung!

430
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:22,010
Thank you so much for coming.

431
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,850
I was on a TV show recently,

432
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:29,100
this is Min-ju Jung,
who hosted the show.

433
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:33,110
This is gallery owner
Mrs. Young-hee Suh,

434
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:36,990
and her husband,
Dr. Cheol-su Kim.

435
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,070
Good to meet you.

436
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,160
Pleasure, ma’am.

437
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,580
Ms. Jung, please put in
a good word for us.

438
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:48,580
Of course I will.

439
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,500
I’m sorry, I have to
run back to the hospital.

440
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,050
Yes, of course.

441
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,800
You’re a doctor?

442
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,420
Yes.

443
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,220
Which department?

444
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,140
I specialize in gynecology.

445
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:05,600
Not just a gynecologist,
but vice president of Taeil Clinic.

446
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,430
Is that so?

447
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:10,310
May I set up an appointment there?

448
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:13,690
It’s really difficult to
get a check up.

449
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:17,030
But it’s recommended
to get one periodically.

450
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,530
Yes, come any time.

451
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:24,240
My apologies, I have
appointments to attend to.

452
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,660
Of course.

453
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:28,120
I’m off, honey.

454
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:36,050
Professor, give me a tour.

455
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:37,760
Shall we, then?

456
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,930
Excuse me for a moment.

457
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,140
This way.

458
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,850
This one’s great.

459
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,230
What’s your first impression?

460
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:56,110
Salvation, that you mentioned
pops in my head.

461
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:58,070
You’re amazing.

462
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,300
Welcome.

463
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,640
What the hell was that?

464
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,690
I was invited to be there.

465
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:36,190
You know I like
looking at paintings.

466
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:39,610
Are you messing with me?
Why did you come?

467
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:42,110
I told you I’ll take care
of the divorce!

468
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,030
I wanted to see what your
master looked like.

469
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,920
Min-ju, you’ve been patient.

470
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,170
If you wait a little longer...

471
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:57,460
I’m not gonna wait around for you.

472
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,460
5 years is long enough.

473
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,550
I’m still penniless.

474
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:04,340
If I get divorced now,
I’ll get nothing.

475
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,100
Even after 50 years,
nothing will change.

476
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,640
You think you’ll get the hospital
with the divorce?

477
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,180
I have to get it.

478
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:17,900
You don’t want to
give up the lap of luxury.

479
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,820
But you’re still treated
like a servant.

480
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,070
How dare you,
it’s not what you think.

481
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:28,030
No, it’s exactly what I thought.

482
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:31,330
Your heart left me
when she approached you.

483
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:33,910
I told you that’s not true
so many times!

484
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:37,040
How could I leave you?
After all that you did for me.

485
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,590
I’m never leaving you.

486
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:41,090
No, it’s ‘can’t’, not ‘never’.

487
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,800
I’ll never let you go.

488
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:52,560
You had your fun,
now come back to me.

489
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:59,820
We should take some time
to think if this is the best way.

490
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,320
Have some.

491
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,390
Who hung this here?
Get rid of it at once!

492
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:40,980
The painting was sent
by your wife personally.

493
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:45,320
Then move it to somewhere
away from patients’ gazes.

494
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,030
I’m sorry.

495
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:55,290
So perverted...

496
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,380
Doctor.

497
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,590
Why are you here?

498
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,380
I made an appointment.

499
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,140
You said you’d give me
a check up.

500
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,680
My period is late,
and I feel nauseous too.

501
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:22,270
Is that a baby?

502
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,620
What will you do?

503
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,710
I’ll have to think about it.

504
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:52,090
You look like you got
the death sentence.

505
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:56,140
Do you have to make
that face in front of me?

506
00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:02,230
When you said it was okay,
you did that on purpose?

507
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:04,230
We’re on year 7.

508
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:07,070
You should’ve known better.

509
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,370
Why are you doing this to me?

510
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,630
I wanted to see you.

511
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,000
What’s there to life,

512
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:30,590
you see what you want,
eat what you want,

513
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:34,470
you do things
that you feel like doing.

514
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,850
Live that way then.

515
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:41,100
I’m gonna have what I want,
and do everything I want to.

516
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,190
What do you want to have?

517
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,770
Nothing you can offer me.

518
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,530
You’re quite the stuck up style.

519
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:53,160
All gals are stuck up by default.

520
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,450
It depends on how much
they let it out.

521
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:59,700
I’ve seen you for 6 months,
but you feel like a stranger.

522
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,460
Because we just had sex.

523
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,670
Do you think we met too late?

524
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:10,460
Had we met earlier,
we could’ve gotten married.

525
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:15,390
Even if we met 6 years ago,
that wouldn’t have happened.

526
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:18,760
That’s our limit,
just physically compatible.

527
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:23,390
Min-ju, I miss your body.

528
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:25,440
Only because you can’t
have it anymore.

529
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,020
Afterwards, it means nothing.

530
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,980
I still want to have it.

531
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,610
Being needy is a disorder.

532
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:34,110
I’m just going mad.

533
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:39,370
If you want something,
make an effort, whatever it takes.

534
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:42,080
Going mad isn’t a method.

535
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,870
It’s just utter madness.

536
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:55,130
I think you’ll do well.

537
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:56,720
Thank you.

538
00:43:58,890 --> 00:43:59,850
Here you go.

539
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:01,140
Take care.

540
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,140
Good bye, madame!

541
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,520
Who was that guy?

542
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:13,740
He’s the art director
for the new play.

543
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:19,280
You looked like a different person
when you smiled.

544
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,210
We better hurry
or we’ll be late.

545
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:30,290
He’ll think that I’m your driver.

546
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:32,670
Why do you always
sit in the back?

547
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:36,510
Well, I never thought about it.

548
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:40,970
I guess it’s a habit
from when I was a kid.

549
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:49,860
Why did your mother
suddenly called everyone in?

550
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,690
We’ll find out.

551
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,690
You didn’t hear anything?

552
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,910
Why are you so sensitive
to management rights?

553
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:01,830
That’ll be sorted out naturally
in due time.

554
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:05,750
Is there a reason
why you can’t wait?

555
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:14,510
What do you want me to do?

556
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:17,630
I want you to make the choice.

557
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:20,590
Whether to give birth
or kill it.

558
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:25,560
I’ll introduce you to
a good doctor.

559
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,350
Someone skilled
and with tight lips.

560
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,110
Don’t be a coward
and evade this.

561
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:38,150
You gotta have the balls
to take responsibility.

562
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:07,280
It’s divorce document.

563
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,750
It just requires your signature.

564
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:13,370
The negotiation with mother
must’ve displeased you.

565
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:18,880
She told me to pretend to be
your husband without greed.

566
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,800
She demanded the hardest thing.

567
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:50,240
You don’t think I have my own set?

568
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,920
Min-ju, I’m here!

569
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,590
I submitted my divorce paper.

570
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,680
Once it’s signed, it’s all over!

571
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,680
You were absolutely right.

572
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:14,230
They were never going to
treat me like a person.

573
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:16,810
I’m just a beggar
in doctor’s gown.

574
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,570
A beggar who doesn’t know his place.

575
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:24,530
I don’t need all that,
doesn’t matter if I’m a beggar.

576
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:28,410
I just need you,
you’re the only one.

577
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:30,490
We can just live happily.

578
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:33,080
Just the two of us.

579
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,460
Two of us?

580
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:38,130
And the baby?

581
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:43,340
What about the baby?

582
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:58,150
What have I done?
Huh, Min-ju?

583
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:07,400
It’s all fucked up...

584
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:18,920
MADNESS

585
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,530
Wait...

586
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:47,570
Wait, I’ll do it.
Wait...

587
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:51,160
Wait, I’ll do it.

588
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:00,270
Cute.

589
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,310
That’s really great.

590
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:44,310
Like an art school graduate.

591
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:47,520
Ma’am, try measuring
the proportions.

592
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,230
Painting is all about
creating harmony.

593
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:52,030
Very good.

594
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:03,160
Everyone’s improving so much.

595
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,210
Good, very good.

596
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,340
- Hyun-dae!
- Hey.

597
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:58,260
Why leave the office
to be out here in the sun?

598
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:01,350
It’s nice to get some
sun and the wind.

599
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:03,600
You’re photosynthetic?

600
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:06,190
It is nice.

601
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:11,520
What’s that bruise?

602
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:13,320
This?

603
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,650
It’s nothing.

604
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:17,570
Were you hurt?

605
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:22,080
I am heartbroken,
so I am hurt.

606
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:25,790
Like an inner aftereffect.

607
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,290
What do you mean?

608
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,500
I’m gonna quit.

609
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,380
Why? Something wrong?

610
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:38,260
It’s different than what I thought.

611
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:44,310
Yeah, Choon-bae isn’t
easy to deal with.

612
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:47,020
He’s selfish and a narcissist too.

613
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,100
An asshole.

614
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:51,060
Yeah?

615
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:56,190
Didn’t you become his protégé
to be an artist?

616
00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:59,410
How was Soon-yi?

617
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:04,200
She was already close to him,
so she became his TA.

618
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:07,370
I really liked her paintings.

619
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:10,830
They had innocent
and natural feel to them.

620
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:13,880
Does she still paint?

621
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:16,340
Of course not.

622
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:19,880
What a waste.

623
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:23,890
It’s not, I think you’re
the one being wasted.

624
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:28,980
You have to stick through it,
only the strongest survive.

625
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:12,690
Shit!

626
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,800
Honey?

627
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:30,140
Did something happen?

628
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,310
No.

629
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:41,650
It’s really late,
you should come to bed.

630
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,450
Sleep.

631
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:03,010
I was surprised to
get your call so late.

632
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:09,140
I suddenly had
the urge to draw.

633
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,520
Then I thought of you.

634
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:21,320
Draw as much as you want.

635
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,610
Can I tie you up?

636
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:27,610
What?

637
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,070
With a rope.

638
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,080
A rope?

639
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,210
No way.

640
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:40,880
Then without it.

641
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:37,700
Honey!

642
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,160
Holy cow!

643
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,910
Where did you go?

644
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:45,000
I went on a walk
to clear my head.

645
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,590
Why is it so hot outside?
I’m gonna take a shower.

646
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:11,440
Let’s do it with rope next time,
I’ll do whatever you want to try!

647
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,320
DELETE

648
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:21,540
Do you like it?

649
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:28,040
I hope I’m not bothering you
by my sudden visit.

650
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:31,960
I’m just thankful you’re
working so passionately.

651
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:36,510
I don’t really know about plays.

652
01:00:36,510 --> 01:00:39,600
I just support it
because I like it.

653
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,180
And produce it because it’s fun.

654
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,390
Madame, I applaud you.

655
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:49,400
Because of people like you,
us pure artists can make a living.

656
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:54,240
Renaissance only happened
because nobles

657
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:57,320
like the House of Medici
supported the artists.

658
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,530
I’m not like that.

659
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,910
These rough sketches look great.

660
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:03,910
Thank you.

661
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:07,920
Coming from a pure artist,
there’s certain level of class.

662
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:14,090
Don’t worry about budget,
make this modern and stylish.

663
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:15,300
Absolutely.

664
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:19,510
If I work hard, will you
buy me meals too?

665
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:22,560
Us artists are always hungry.

666
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:25,020
Thank you.

667
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:26,600
Do you drink at all?

668
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,150
I can’t have enough!

669
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:40,200
I told my husband everything.

670
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:44,200
What? Tell him what?

671
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:49,120
That I found someone I love.

672
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:50,670
What?!

673
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:54,130
I don’t want to hide
my feelings anymore.

674
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:56,130
I’m tired of keeping it inside.

675
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:58,720
What are you talking about?

676
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,390
We just had sex a couple of times.

677
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:02,720
It wasn’t just about sex!

678
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:07,140
I’m truly in love with you.

679
01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:11,520
Mi-sook, this isn’t some
trashy soap opera.

680
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,060
What?

681
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:16,070
It’s just a fling between
two married people,

682
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:18,450
don’t drag love into this.

683
01:02:18,450 --> 01:02:21,570
I hate complicated relationship.

684
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:24,240
I’m not a responsible type either.

685
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:27,410
I don’t expect anything
from you!

686
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,750
Even if you did,
I got nothing.

687
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:31,710
Could you!

688
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:36,960
Take a moment
to consider it seriously?

689
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:41,970
I’m sorry, I don’t have
time right now.

690
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:43,970
I’ll see you later.

691
01:02:57,990 --> 01:02:59,360
Excuse me!

692
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:10,710
Honey!

693
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,210
Honey?

694
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:05,240
I didn’t think you’d come.

695
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:08,570
I was surprised to get your call.

696
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:13,580
I didn’t want to drink alone,

697
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:15,460
and no one’s home...

698
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:19,250
You husband must be busy.

699
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:28,220
Busy fooling around
with other girls.

700
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:29,260
What?

701
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:32,260
I doubt that.

702
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:36,940
How could a man cheat on
a woman like you?

703
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,360
What kind of a woman am I?

704
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:42,940
Elegant and dignified,

705
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:44,820
with intelligence and wealth.

706
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:48,990
You’re beautiful and stylish.

707
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:53,490
You have all the conditions
a man desires.

708
01:05:57,580 --> 01:06:02,130
I only get to find that out
because of you.

709
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:06,470
If there wasn’t a single man
who told you that,

710
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:08,380
you wasted your life.

711
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:13,870
This is nothing...

712
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,870
Just a woman, just a woman...

713
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:39,100
It’s a studio provided to artists
who are prepping a show.

714
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,480
You can use it for a while.

715
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:47,440
The paintings will paint themselves
when I sit by this window.

716
01:07:49,610 --> 01:07:54,530
I’ve been asking you around
to critics and gallery people I know.

717
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:59,040
They said you’re talented,
but haven’t caught a chance yet.

718
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:01,210
Did they badmouth me?

719
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:05,580
I got a bad reputation
in the art world.

720
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:10,840
They said you like girls
quite a bit.

721
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:16,350
You must be out of
your goddamn mind!

722
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:19,470
You better crawl back home!

723
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:23,189
Are you so desperate
to see me drop dead?

724
01:08:23,189 --> 01:08:27,359
If I find you, I’ll kill you.

725
01:08:27,979 --> 01:08:30,149
So get back home
when I ask you nicely.

726
01:08:30,149 --> 01:08:31,279
Got it?!

727
01:08:32,569 --> 01:08:33,819
Fucking shit!

728
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,279
What’s going on?

729
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:43,290
It’s nothing...

730
01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:45,920
How’s the work going?

731
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:50,170
It’s going well.

732
01:08:50,670 --> 01:08:53,220
Young-hee gave me a studio.

733
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:55,380
Young-hee?

734
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,300
Mrs. Suh.

735
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:58,390
You fucked her?

736
01:08:58,390 --> 01:08:59,350
No.

737
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,229
Behave yourself.

738
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:08,439
If you mess with her,
she could ruin you forever.

739
01:09:08,439 --> 01:09:10,859
It’s nothing like that.

740
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:15,490
Why are you here?

741
01:09:17,490 --> 01:09:21,700
I’m quitting the continuing ed
after this semester.

742
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:27,420
I gotta start painting for real now.

743
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:29,590
Like hell you will.

744
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:35,010
Now that you’re married,
you gotta make a living.

745
01:09:35,010 --> 01:09:38,760
How long will you
leech off your wife?

746
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:41,260
I got a proper patron now.

747
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:46,850
I’ll paint for real
and put on a one-man show.

748
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:50,189
Why is Mrs. Suh your patron?

749
01:09:50,689 --> 01:09:53,859
Know your damn place!

750
01:09:53,859 --> 01:09:55,320
Jesus Christ!

751
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:58,280
You can’t talk that way to me!

752
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:02,660
Why are you trying to
ruin this for me?!

753
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:09,540
To those people,
you’re like shit.

754
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:13,130
They’ll use you and toss you.

755
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:19,680
But what happens when you
don’t know you’re shit?

756
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,970
You go around with stink.

757
01:10:21,970 --> 01:10:24,390
In that moment,
everything’s over.

758
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:27,600
Why? Because it’s dirty.

759
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,940
If I’m shit,
then so are you.

760
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:32,770
You think you’re above that?

761
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:35,030
To paint these shitty paintings,

762
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:38,570
you think I don’t know
what you did to the girls?

763
01:10:38,570 --> 01:10:40,490
You son of a bitch!

764
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:44,620
Let’s not do this.

765
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:49,040
I’m not a naïve
20-year old anymore.

766
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:50,830
Let go of my hand.

767
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:54,090
Don’t you know
who got you here?!

768
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:57,630
That’s why I’m pledging
my independence.

769
01:10:57,630 --> 01:10:59,840
I gotta soar high too.

770
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,550
Am I right, Choon-bae?

771
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:09,350
Hey! Wait!

772
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,820
Have you decided?

773
01:11:26,290 --> 01:11:30,000
Who do you think is that man?

774
01:11:36,670 --> 01:11:40,930
He’s eating with them,
so he could be family.

775
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:43,510
Or just a guest?

776
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:49,140
I’ll give you the hospital
management rights.

777
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:53,060
That’s quite sizable for alimony.

778
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:56,360
We’re not getting a divorce.

779
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:03,070
I’m pregnant.

780
01:12:03,070 --> 01:12:04,370
Pregnant?

781
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:06,620
But we...

782
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:10,370
I need you to become
the baby’s dad.

783
01:12:11,330 --> 01:12:14,750
I can’t let my child
be born without a dad.

784
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:23,430
I don’t know if that man
is family or a guest,

785
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:28,140
but he’s still at the table
and eating together.

786
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:30,680
That’s enough.

787
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:33,020
Why should I do that?

788
01:12:33,810 --> 01:12:37,440
I get to have a family
that I wanted,

789
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:40,400
and you get the hospital
that you wanted.

790
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:45,780
That’s not a bad business, no?

791
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:51,910
But before that,
I need to ask you a favor.

792
01:12:53,290 --> 01:12:55,580
Wrap up your messy past.

793
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:59,920
That’s not proper etiquette
for our family.

794
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:11,720
We’re pulling you off the show,
that’s all you need to know.

795
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:15,310
Chief, this is all wrong,
it’s a personal issue!

796
01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:18,270
Jung! Aren’t you a public figure?

797
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:21,320
You should’ve paid
more attention to personal matter!

798
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:24,400
Why must I hear about
your dirty rumors?

799
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,490
You’re not as healthy
as we thought.

800
01:13:27,490 --> 01:13:29,490
The blood pressure is low.

801
01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:31,540
Yeah?

802
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:35,410
Stay here for a few days
and receive some care.

803
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:39,340
For our baby,
the mother has to be healthy.

804
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:43,630
Sure, whatever my doctor orders.

805
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:46,130
Good.

806
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,430
Cheol-su!

807
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,890
Did you do this?!

808
01:13:50,890 --> 01:13:52,890
- You son of a bitch!
- Get out!

809
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:54,310
You asshole!

810
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:55,850
Be quiet!

811
01:13:55,850 --> 01:13:57,900
Leave before I call security!

812
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:02,150
We’ve met before.

813
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:07,200
I’ll leave you two alone
to talk things through.

814
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:12,240
Oh yeah.

815
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,370
I got the memo.

816
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,080
You should’ve received
my reply through your chief.

817
01:14:21,710 --> 01:14:23,750
Good to see you.

818
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:34,720
Min-ju, we’re already over.

819
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:38,390
This only makes you tragic.

820
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:44,320
I want to do right by you.

821
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:48,320
Tell me what you want.

822
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:50,450
I’ll make it happen.

823
01:14:56,200 --> 01:15:01,290
If you want to do right by me,
you shouldn’t have said that.

824
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:12,090
Don’t feel pressured,

825
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:16,810
do your own work,
and help with my show a little.

826
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:21,850
Thank you for the offer,
but I haven’t changed my mind.

827
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:26,690
Min-joong, I feel bad
about your potential.

828
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:28,690
I have no other reason.

829
01:15:29,610 --> 01:15:31,200
What potential?

830
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:35,700
Strip and get tied up
on command,

831
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:37,830
have sex when others want to?

832
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:41,750
Why are you overreacting?

833
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:45,630
You and Prof. Kim are the same.

834
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:51,180
Those who suffered become
even worst punisher.

835
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:54,550
How could you say that?!

836
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:58,720
At least Prof. Kim knew
what to give and what to take.

837
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:01,560
He’s not a scammer like you.

838
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,690
How dare you!

839
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,110
Welcome, Mrs. Suh!

840
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:11,820
Sorry for dropping by unannounced.

841
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:13,410
Am I interrupting something?

842
01:16:13,410 --> 01:16:14,700
Not at all.

843
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:18,910
She’ll be helping me
with my show.

844
01:16:18,910 --> 01:16:23,830
Her name is Min-joong Baek,
she was a TA for Prof. Kim.

845
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:25,460
Say hello.

846
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:27,460
Good afternoon.

847
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:30,840
I’ll be off then.

848
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:34,220
Think about it and call me.

849
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:36,680
Madame, over here.

850
01:16:48,230 --> 01:16:50,190
This is the design for act 1.

851
01:16:50,190 --> 01:16:54,780
And it’ll transform like this in act 2.

852
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:57,570
Very good.

853
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,450
It’s modern but warm too.

854
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:04,120
You did great.

855
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:06,130
Not at all.

856
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:09,750
I think we better stop
seeing each other.

857
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:10,880
Pardon?

858
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:15,430
I got to have precious memories
thanks to you.

859
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:19,510
But this kind of relationships
get hideous over time.

860
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:24,690
Right, we both have families.

861
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:32,530
I’ve been working really hard
to get ready for this.

862
01:17:32,530 --> 01:17:34,320
Thank you for your work.

863
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,950
You can take your time
moving out of the studio.

864
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:41,410
Madame, have I done
something wrong?

865
01:17:41,410 --> 01:17:44,580
Or did I disappoint you somehow?

866
01:17:45,330 --> 01:17:48,830
I only have positive
feelings for you.

867
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:53,960
Before mistakes happen,
and disappointments set in,

868
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:56,720
I want to remember you
as a good person.

869
01:17:56,720 --> 01:18:00,430
If you need anything,
feel free to call my assistant.

870
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:14,690
Fuck...

871
01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:18,240
I stepped on a shit mine...

872
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:44,770
- Mother asked...
- Yeah?

873
01:18:44,770 --> 01:18:47,560
why we haven’t applied
for marriage registration.

874
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:49,690
We haven’t got it yet?

875
01:18:49,690 --> 01:18:51,690
You can take care of it.

876
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,690
I told her we wouldn’t get one.

877
01:18:55,730 --> 01:18:56,570
What?

878
01:18:56,570 --> 01:18:58,780
We better not do it.

879
01:18:59,570 --> 01:19:02,660
I don’t think marriage suits you.

880
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:07,160
Knowing that, it’s my fault
for being greedy.

881
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:15,920
What’s with her?

882
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:57,130
You call me often lately.

883
01:19:59,210 --> 01:20:00,550
What’s this?

884
01:20:01,050 --> 01:20:03,010
Seaweed soup.

885
01:20:03,010 --> 01:20:05,350
You said you wanted some.

886
01:20:07,180 --> 01:20:09,020
I don’t need it now.

887
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:10,390
Why not?

888
01:20:12,810 --> 01:20:14,860
Was it your birthday that day?

889
01:20:14,860 --> 01:20:19,230
Min-ju, why didn’t you say so?

890
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:23,740
Then shall we have
a birthday party today?

891
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:26,240
What do you exactly
want from me?

892
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:28,040
I don’t know.

893
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:32,080
I usually don’t cling onto
girls who want to leave,

894
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:34,790
but it doesn’t work on you.

895
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:37,040
Hyun-dae.

896
01:20:38,090 --> 01:20:39,420
Holy cow!

897
01:20:44,470 --> 01:20:46,470
You can’t do this to me.

898
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:54,270
Mi-sook, how could you
follow me here?

899
01:20:54,270 --> 01:20:57,190
I left my home for you.

900
01:20:57,190 --> 01:21:01,820
You could deny me for your wife,
but this is wrong.

901
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:04,200
But we’re...

902
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:05,570
Min-ju, hey!

903
01:21:05,570 --> 01:21:06,950
She and I are nothing.

904
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:09,870
I always felt dirty
after meeting you.

905
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:12,910
Perhaps because you’re
trash like me.

906
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:17,170
Min-ju! Min-ju!

907
01:21:17,710 --> 01:21:19,550
She doesn’t like you.

908
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:21,800
Why is that your business?

909
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:24,010
I’m truly in love with you.

910
01:21:24,010 --> 01:21:26,760
We just had sex a few times.

911
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:28,970
If you fell in love after sex,

912
01:21:28,970 --> 01:21:31,810
you’d have been in love
hundreds of times!

913
01:22:21,610 --> 01:22:22,980
Min-ju!

914
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,820
Min-ju Jung!

915
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:27,200
Open this door.

916
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:31,160
Min-ju, come on!

917
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:34,660
I have something to tell you!

918
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:38,080
Min-ju! Please!

919
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:40,830
Let me just say one thing!

920
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:43,050
Could you open this door?

921
01:22:43,050 --> 01:22:44,840
Min-ju!

922
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:50,640
Please, I have to tell you something!

923
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:02,190
Min-ju!

924
01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:05,110
I got something to tell you.

925
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:07,320
Open this door!

926
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:09,780
Min-ju! Please!

927
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:12,070
Goddammit!

928
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:31,090
There are pedestrians
who saw your wife.

929
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:34,760
Her body has not been recovered,

930
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:38,520
so please go home
and wait for our call.

931
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,090
Dude!

932
01:24:11,510 --> 01:24:13,010
Choon-bae!

933
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:18,720
He asked me here
but he’s away?

934
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,310
Why is he ordering me around?

935
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:23,940
Hey.

936
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,860
Jesus!

937
01:24:33,030 --> 01:24:34,990
What’s wrong?

938
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:38,580
Was it because of last time?

939
01:24:40,370 --> 01:24:43,460
It was my fault, I’m sorry.

940
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:45,790
Get down, asshole.

941
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:50,170
What’s wrong, man,
I’m sorry.

942
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:55,430
Does it look like
I’m fooling around?

943
01:24:55,470 --> 01:24:58,760
Get down, you bastard!

944
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:06,690
I’m not a goddamn kid...

945
01:25:09,570 --> 01:25:12,570
You worthless piece of shit!

946
01:25:12,570 --> 01:25:17,030
How could you cajole my wife?!

947
01:25:17,030 --> 01:25:20,080
Say what? I don’t even know
who your wife is!

948
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:22,500
- Mi-sook Ko.
- Mi-sook?

949
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:24,290
Mi-sook!

950
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:29,170
The one you fooled around
and tossed,

951
01:25:30,090 --> 01:25:34,010
she’s dead, asshole!

952
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,470
What are you saying?

953
01:25:38,930 --> 01:25:41,020
Why’d she die?

954
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:42,770
What?

955
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:46,060
Why’d she die?!

956
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:48,230
You son of a bitch!

957
01:25:48,230 --> 01:25:52,860
Because you played with her
and threw her away!

958
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:57,240
You killed her, asshole!

959
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:58,570
Let go!

960
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:01,080
Why are you bitching at me?!

961
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:02,870
Why did she die
because of me?!

962
01:26:02,870 --> 01:26:03,700
What?

963
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:06,000
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

964
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:08,630
Hyun-dae!

965
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:11,380
Son of a bitch!

966
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:18,760
Get up, asshole!
Get the hell up!

967
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:23,350
Get up, asshole!

968
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:26,890
You deserve to die!

969
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,210
No...

970
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:49,710
Hyun-dae...

971
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:52,840
Hyun-dae!

972
01:26:53,210 --> 01:26:55,670
Hyun-dae!

973
01:26:56,220 --> 01:26:57,800
Hyun-dae!

974
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:17,590
Clear, shock!

975
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:20,550
Once more.

976
01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:23,550
Clear, shock!

977
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:25,680
Clear!

978
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:26,970
Shock!

979
01:28:49,370 --> 01:28:50,500
Hyun-dae!

980
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:57,540
Honey...

981
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:00,710
Honey!

982
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:07,760
Hyun-dae!

983
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:39,800
6 months ago

984
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:24,050
Why do you think
this woman was painted?

985
01:30:25,010 --> 01:30:26,180
Pardon?

986
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:30,850
I think the artist had
a relationship with her.

987
01:30:31,850 --> 01:30:36,980
It doesn’t feel like a relationship
between an artist and a model.

988
01:30:36,980 --> 01:30:40,730
Maybe a lover or a muse.

989
01:30:41,690 --> 01:30:45,690
Don’t male artists usually
paint someone they love?

990
01:30:46,030 --> 01:30:47,570
Certainly.

991
01:30:47,570 --> 01:30:53,240
Monet even painted
his lover’s moment of death.

992
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:54,790
Camille, you mean?

993
01:30:54,790 --> 01:30:56,540
How did you know?

994
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:59,460
Are you a painter?

995
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:01,290
No.

996
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:03,090
I’m a regular citizen.

997
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:08,010
Feels like I’ve seen you before.

998
01:31:08,010 --> 01:31:08,930
Did you…

999
01:31:08,930 --> 01:31:11,510
Are you the painter
of this piece?

1000
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:13,720
Yes.

1001
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:17,980
You have keen eyes
for people and paintings.

1002
01:31:17,980 --> 01:31:21,650
Yes, I’m the artist,
Hyun-dae Lee.

1003
01:31:21,650 --> 01:31:23,730
I’m Min-ju Jung.

1004
01:31:23,730 --> 01:31:25,820
Good to meet you, Ms. Jung.

1005
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:30,700
I actually painted a model.

1006
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:34,990
I want to eventually find
a muse like Camille…

1007
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:37,710
I haven’t had that luck yet.

1008
01:31:38,210 --> 01:31:39,920
You’re quite greedy.

1009
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:41,540
Am I?

1010
01:32:02,860 --> 01:32:04,360
You felt it?

1011
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:06,530
Not yet...

1012
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:12,990
You felt it, it’s hot!

1013
01:32:15,910 --> 01:32:18,040
I can’t hold it any longer.

1014
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:21,040
Just a bit longer...

1015
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:24,460
Now!

1016
01:32:52,530 --> 01:32:58,700
