1
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:07,174
Writer and university professor

2
00:00:07,258 --> 00:00:10,845
Mr. Okutaro Nada
was found dead in his home.

3
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:18,853
Defendant,

4
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:21,939
you took on Iteya Minamoto's case,
correct?

5
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:26,736
Even though he was suspected
of murdering Mr. Nada.

6
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,740
Please, help us!

7
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:32,450
Iteya was arrested by the police.

8
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:37,079
At that time,

9
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:39,707
did you believe he was innocent?

10
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:53,846
Objection.

11
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,891
The prosecutor’s question is
irrelevant to this case.

12
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,142
Objection sustained.

13
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:00,811
At that time…

14
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:06,150
I trusted him…

15
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:16,368
-Good morning.
-Morning.

16
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:17,453
-Good work.
-Thank you for your work.

17
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:18,537
Thank you for your work.

18
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:21,248
-Morning.
-Morning.

19
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:23,209
-Good morning, Kinbara.
-What’s the situation?

20
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:26,337
The deceased is Okutaro Nada, aged 60.

21
00:01:27,463 --> 00:01:29,924
Estimated time of death
was early this morning.

22
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:32,676
We’re waiting for the autopsy report,

23
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,513
but the cause of death
appears to be strangulation.

24
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:38,474
The belt from Mr. Nada's gown
was tied around his neck.

25
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,686
I can’t believe Okutaro Nada
would die like this…

26
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,438
He seemed to be a famous author.

27
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,816
You don't read books so…

28
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:48,776
I’m from the non-reading generation.

29
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:50,778
Was he that famous?

30
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:54,698
He hadn’t been in the media lately.

31
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:58,869
What surprised me more was
he was married to Yoko.

32
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:00,663
I'm a supporter of MY Queen.

33
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:04,291
So, who found him?

34
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,793
His wife, Yoko.

35
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:09,672
Apparently,
he usually woke up around 6:00 a.m.

36
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:10,881
to stroll around the garden.

37
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:15,719
Last night, he locked himself
in the study around 9:00 p.m.

38
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:18,222
He never came out,
even when it was morning,

39
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:19,723
so she checked and found him dead.

40
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,518
Any signs of forced entry?

41
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,020
The back door was unlocked,

42
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:26,647
but as you can see,

43
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,482
the house wasn’t ransacked.

44
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,657
Mr. Iteya Minamoto.

45
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:38,325
Once again,

46
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,412
I’m Ayame Kajin, your lawyer.

47
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:44,582
I will…

48
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,000
represent you.

49
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,302
Why you?

50
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,270
You’re free to refuse…

51
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:07,855
if you think

52
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:11,358
someone else can get you out of here.

53
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:17,865
I was hired by your wife.

54
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,619
But to be clear, you were arrested

55
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:24,538
not for the murder of Mr. Nada

56
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:26,332
but for obstructing official duties.

57
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,419
What happened?

58
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:45,643
Mr. Minamoto?

59
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,980
Suddenly, the police came.

60
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:53,108
They said they wanted to ask about Nada.

61
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:56,779
But they already treated me
like a suspect.

62
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,657
We argued a bit…

63
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:01,575
And you were arrested?

64
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:06,622
I left home early that morning.

65
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,832
I didn’t even know Nada was dead.

66
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,251
The police will pressure you

67
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:15,297
to confess to killing Nada.

68
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,472
For now,
they don’t have decisive evidence.

69
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:25,933
But apparently,

70
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,768
someone testified

71
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,854
saying they saw you leaving the house.

72
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,818
That woman testified…

73
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,113
That woman?

74
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:42,866
Yoko Mogami.

75
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,872
That family always used people.

76
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,503
Kajin, will you help us?

77
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,382
You don't fit in.

78
00:04:58,841 --> 00:04:59,842
See you.

79
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:07,683
She wants to pin it on me.

80
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:24,033
That story earlier… is it true?

81
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:32,916
That man killed him.

82
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,350
Such ingratitude.

83
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:02,446
Are you going to treat me
like a criminal too?

84
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:04,865
I am your defense attorney.

85
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:08,035
I don’t take cases
that are against my client’s interest.

86
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:09,870
And…

87
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,873
if you lie to me,

88
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:15,250
you’ll only be hurting yourself.

89
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,759
Last night, I did meet Nada.

90
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:26,762
Around what time?

91
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,890
After coming back from night practice,
around 10:00 p.m.

92
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,726
Why did you meet him?

93
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,648
I went to retrieve something
my wife forgot.

94
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:08,971
Don’t ever look at Kanon like that again
with those dirty eyes.

95
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:13,100
After that, I went straight home.

96
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:18,647
What was your relationship with the Nadas?

97
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,485
Let's go out and eat.

98
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,071
Hold on. You guys are too quick.

99
00:07:26,155 --> 00:07:27,573
What do you want to eat?

100
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:44,006
Hey!

101
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:45,883
Want to try?

102
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:51,263
Hold it like this.

103
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:58,937
Wow…

104
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:00,856
So big!

105
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,066
Careful.

106
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,485
Good work.

107
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:06,987
Thank you for your work.

108
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:09,865
I want to use luxurious ingredients,

109
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,492
but we need to keep costs down

110
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:14,786
so young people can afford it.

111
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,332
-Understood. I'll talk with the factory.
-Yeah.

112
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:20,751
-Let's do our best!
-I'll be leaving.

113
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,337
-Good work.
-Excuse us.

114
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,630
Good work.

115
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:30,469
Jun, welcome home.

116
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:34,973
Is this your friend?

117
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:38,560
Yeah. He’s my classmate, Iteya.

118
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,771
Hello, I’m Iteya Minamoto.

119
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:44,691
-Hello.
-This is surprising.

120
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,527
Jun actually brought a friend home.

121
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:50,530
By the way,

122
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:53,450
my fencing gear’s getting kind of old.

123
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,202
It’s throwing off my game.

124
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,162
I was thinking of replacing everything.

125
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,664
Ask your mother.

126
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,833
She’s the one who thinks
it's shameful to have a son

127
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,001
using worn-out gear.

128
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:12,511
That’s true. Good equipment matters.

129
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,012
Yeah.

130
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,991
If I really work hard at fencing,
maybe I can become good.

131
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:37,077
How stupid.
Who would expect anything from you?

132
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:38,704
What?

133
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,839
You're starting to look just like
the woman who abandoned you.

134
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,726
Sorry! It hurts!

135
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:05,063
Yeah.

136
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,192
Good.

137
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,071
You got it?

138
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,283
-You did it!
-I did it!

139
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:36,762
Iteya.

140
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,557
-Hey, nice catch!
-Nice catch!

141
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:45,520
Don't look…

142
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:58,909
Aren't you strong? That attack…

143
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,454
Yeah. As expected.

144
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,209
How about after the national tournament?

145
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:13,924
College. Maybe a study abroad program too.

146
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:18,303
But if I don’t win, I won’t have
enough credits for a recommendation.

147
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,931
What about you, Iteya?

148
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,017
If I win and get a scholarship,
maybe college.

149
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,103
But my father says
I should start working right away.

150
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,312
You're quitting fencing?

151
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,272
I don't want to quit…

152
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,108
Don’t quit.

153
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,945
If you win,
you’ll easily get a scholarship.

154
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:38,949
We're both top contenders, remember?

155
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,909
You’re both amazing.

156
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:43,662
You’re practically family, Iteya.

157
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:45,455
I’m rooting for you.

158
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:47,916
Thank you.

159
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:59,219
AWARD

160
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,055
University?

161
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:03,890
Yeah.

162
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:07,310
If I win the next tournament,
I might get a scholarship.

163
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:14,985
Don’t get any ideas!

164
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,864
No matter how nicely they treat you,

165
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,075
they’re only using you.

166
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:24,619
They’ll never accept you.

167
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:31,460
You trust no one but me. Okay?

168
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,723
It's not that expensive…

169
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,266
Minamoto.

170
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,228
Your father…

171
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:07,287
Apparently, he fell asleep
while doing deliveries,

172
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,331
so the insurance payout is small.

173
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,334
No relatives either, they say. Poor kid.

174
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,960
What’s he going to do now?

175
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:23,845
Iteya.

176
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:37,067
You’ve gotten taller.

177
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,820
Well, of course. It’s been over ten years.

178
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,496
I’m sorry.

179
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,500
Do you hate me?

180
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,548
Why did you abandon me

181
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:01,883
and leave?

182
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:03,843
I didn’t abandon you.

183
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,804
You know, don’t you?

184
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,473
If I had stayed, your father
would've killed me eventually.

185
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,226
Iteya.

186
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,397
I…

187
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:17,774
came to take you back.

188
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:21,695
Once I settle his debts

189
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,030
and get the insurance,

190
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,574
let’s live together.

191
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:40,297
FUNERAL ENVELOPE

192
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,760
I will fix it myself.

193
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,094
I will make sure to pay the rent.

194
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,974
It would actually help me
to have a practice partner nearby.

195
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:35,810
With the tournament coming up,
Iteya can move in, right?

196
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:37,687
Please.

197
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:51,993
And what about your last tournament?

198
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,454
Jun won.

199
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:55,747
I placed third.

200
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,917
He secured a university recommendation.

201
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,004
I had to lower my expectations,

202
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,923
but I still managed to get a scholarship.

203
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,677
I understand your background
with the Nada family.

204
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,847
Even after getting married,

205
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:14,683
you continued living in the guest house?

206
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,852
Money was tight.

207
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,231
We planned to move
once we had enough saved.

208
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,525
And your recent relationship
with Mr. Nada?

209
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:27,654
Honestly,

210
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,031
I avoided him.

211
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:32,951
He seemed obsessed with my wife.

212
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,957
But that doesn't mean I killed him.

213
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,095
I would never lie to you.

214
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,024
I will do…

215
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,445
what I can.

216
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,031
In the meantime,

217
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,160
please answer the police carefully.

218
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,707
Yes.

219
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,313
Kajin Sensei!

220
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:47,984
What about Iteya?

221
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:54,824
POLICE STATION

222
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,000
You

223
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:07,337
started living with your husband
in the guest house

224
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,755
after getting married, correct?

225
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:10,757
Yes.

226
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,718
We got married

227
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:15,178
on Iteya’s twentieth birthday.

228
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,432
Why the rush to marry?

229
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:22,393
I wanted to get married quickly.

230
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:26,189
After losing my parents young,

231
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,651
I was treated coldly by my aunt.

232
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,364
Iteya…

233
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:38,117
rescued me from that life.

234
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,963
Iteya and I were meant to be together.

235
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,808
Your husband

236
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:04,894
seemed to avoid Professor Nada.

237
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,188
Iteya

238
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:11,150
hated me being around other men.

239
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:16,281
That day,

240
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,325
he only went to get my ring.

241
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,411
He came straight back.

242
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:23,413
I can testify to that.

243
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,164
Spousal testimony

244
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:27,333
is generally seen as unreliable.

245
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:29,502
But…

246
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,673
In any case, if the police contact you,

247
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:34,799
say nothing.

248
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:39,095
I’ll drive you home.

249
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:54,027
I heard Mr. Minamoto
clashed with the officers

250
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,487
when they asked him
for a voluntary police interview.

251
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:57,947
Yeah…

252
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,949
But it was basically an accident.

253
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,034
What?

254
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,918
Are you doubting me?

255
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,965
Since there is a witness,

256
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,800
it’s impossible not to doubt.

257
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:22,305
Were you holding a grudge
against Mr. Nada?

258
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:25,058
Enough to want to kill him?

259
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,103
Don't touch me!

260
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:38,071
If someone did that to me,
I would've done the same.

261
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,531
I’ve known Minamoto Senpai for years.

262
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:42,241
He’s not the violent type.

263
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:45,411
You know both Iteya Minamoto

264
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:46,913
and Mr. Jun Nada?

265
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,373
They were kouhais when I joined the club.

266
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:51,542
Back then, they seemed close,

267
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,087
but now, I’m not so sure.

268
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,089
What?

269
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:07,266
You’re Mr. Minamoto’s lawyer?

270
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:11,813
I’m Kajin from Naganami Law Office.

271
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:15,817
Immediately stop questioning Mr. Minamoto

272
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,151
and release him.

273
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:19,028
He’s still a suspect.

274
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,571
The interrogation isn’t over yet.

275
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:23,658
It’s clear you arrested him
on a separate charge

276
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:26,035
just to question him
about Mr. Nada’s death.

277
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:29,038
And you

278
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,915
deliberately provoked him.

279
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,291
I have testimony confirming this.

280
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,220
Don't touch me.

281
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,141
The video was filmed by a student.

282
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:53,062
7:48 a.m.

283
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:54,355
Arrested for obstructing official duties.

284
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,650
Mr. Minamoto is a popular instructor.

285
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,361
Imagine if this footage
got out to the media.

286
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:05,074
He’s still a key person of interest.

287
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:06,951
There’s testimony of him leaving the house

288
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:09,370
around the estimated time of death.

289
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:11,748
But where’s the direct evidence?

290
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:12,832
Where’s the motive?

291
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,086
Arresting him separately

292
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,963
just to question him about murder

293
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,465
could be considered illegal.

294
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:27,638
POLICE STATION

295
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:20,483
Our plan to interrogate Iteya Minamoto

296
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,318
by arresting him separately didn’t work.

297
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:25,863
I got punched for nothing.

298
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:27,698
At least we learned something.

299
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:31,661
He can snap in an instant.

300
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,831
MARRIED

301
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:41,379
You really saved me.

302
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:44,715
It’s my job.

303
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:48,719
And…

304
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:51,722
maybe a little personal revenge too.

305
00:23:57,228 --> 00:24:00,189
I understand the frustration you felt

306
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,108
when you were used by that family.

307
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:09,031
Like when you deliberately forfeited

308
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:13,119
your last national tournament.

309
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:15,872
What?

310
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:27,425
Iteya!

311
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:30,720
I'm glad!

312
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:34,849
I didn’t know what would happen…

313
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,518
Thank you, Kajin Sensei.

314
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:40,771
It must have been awful. Are you okay?

315
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,817
You must attend

316
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,570
Mr. Nada’s funeral tomorrow.

317
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:50,072
But won’t Yoko be furious?

318
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:52,658
You need to prove
you have nothing to hide.

319
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,203
Make sure you go.

320
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,896
Hello, Kajin speaking.

321
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:27,151
Oh, Director. What’s wrong?

322
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:58,015
I heard you got pulled back

323
00:25:58,099 --> 00:25:59,892
onto the Choga Construction case.

324
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:02,812
Seems my previous work
was finally appreciated.

325
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:06,732
Most of the material I submitted
to the director was what you had prepared.

326
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:07,942
So…

327
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,737
why did you send the same ones to him?

328
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:12,905
Trying to show me up?

329
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:17,118
I just reclaimed the case
you stole from me.

330
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:18,869
Hey, now!

331
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,289
Let go!

332
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:23,124
Come on, it’s us.

333
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:26,294
We should help each other out.

334
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,462
I said, let go!

335
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,935
I told him to wait outside…

336
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:47,106
This is a private conversation.

337
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:48,941
Would you mind waiting?

338
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,535
We’ll talk later.

339
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:29,440
Does that happen often?

340
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,279
I’m used to it.

341
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:39,116
It’s nothing.

342
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:44,121
The one hurting you the most is yourself.

343
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:50,127
What?

344
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:53,130
You should value yourself more.

345
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:08,521
What is your business here?

346
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:19,240
What is this?

347
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,367
My legal fees.

348
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,620
Kanon told me she hadn’t paid in full yet.

349
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,291
It didn't have to be today.

350
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,960
How did you know?

351
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,839
That I deliberately forfeited
the national tournament.

352
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:41,762
I never even told Kanon.

353
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:45,015
Was it Yoko

354
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:46,851
who told you to forfeit?

355
00:28:52,273 --> 00:28:54,692
That woman never dirties her own hands.

356
00:28:58,863 --> 00:29:01,824
FENCING ARENA

357
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:04,827
Forfeit?

358
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,620
You started fencing

359
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:08,122
and made it this far

360
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:10,875
thanks to Nada, right?

361
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:20,509
Didn't anyone say anything?

362
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:25,890
They all turned a blind eye.

363
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,893
Jun’s parents donated a lot to the club.

364
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:30,644
I was…

365
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:32,980
just a boy living in the guest house.

366
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:36,692
Pathetic cowards.

367
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:44,867
What?

368
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:55,628
Why…

369
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:06,847
The 1:00 p.m. meeting

370
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:10,226
with Choga Construction
will start a little early.

371
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:12,144
The director is already on his way.

372
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:34,393
Lawyer.

373
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:01,837
What were you about to say back there?

374
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,965
Maybe it’s nothing important,
but if I don't ask,

375
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:06,842
I won't be able to stop thinking about it.

376
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,220
I’ll regret it later
if it was something serious--

377
00:32:10,304 --> 00:32:11,930
Why don’t you ask?

378
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:15,517
Ask what?

379
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,438
If I killed him.

380
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:26,403
Did you?

381
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:38,123
Can you…

382
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:42,211
really trust me?

383
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,278
I have to go.

384
00:34:54,468 --> 00:34:56,929
Where is Kajin? Geez…

385
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:12,277
Director, I've brought the guests.

386
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:13,445
Welcome.

387
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:15,531
-We've been expecting you.
-Nice to meet you.

388
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:16,990
Please, this way…

389
00:35:22,663 --> 00:35:25,833
You didn’t answer earlier
because you went to meet them, right?

390
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:31,839
Sensei, your stockings…

391
00:35:35,843 --> 00:35:37,845
Should I go buy you new stockings?

392
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:39,221
No need. Thank you.

393
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,254
The Nadas were having marital problems?

394
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,089
WIFE - YOKO MOGAMI, 55 YEARS OLD

395
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,924
VICTIM - OKUTARO NADA, 60 YEARS OLD

396
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:17,926
How far are you going to mock me?

397
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,012
I'm not mocking you!

398
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:23,140
"The husband who understands me
the most in the world?"

399
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:24,766
Yeah, that's right.

400
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:28,478
I certainly understand you
the most in this world.

401
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:31,732
Because you're acting out
your glorious life itself!

402
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,483
I never wanted that!

403
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:34,943
Do you want me to tell

404
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:38,488
those worthless reporters
how you're the most amazing spouse?

405
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:40,407
I will answer them with pleasure!

406
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:43,452
I have never ever wanted that!

407
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,454
Why are you taking it like that?

408
00:36:48,582 --> 00:36:51,752
Seems their marriage had been cold
for a long time.

409
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:58,842
It was Yoko Mogami's tactic to paint him
as a doting husband.

410
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,137
Classic Yoko PR.

411
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:07,643
Kinbara?

412
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:09,603
You're not surprised?

413
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:13,482
The more someone flaunts
a perfect marriage,

414
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:14,858
the worse it usually is.

415
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:16,526
Anyway, look at this.

416
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:23,033
A sleeping pill was detected

417
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:26,078
in Okutaro Nada's system.

418
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:27,537
That’s…

419
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:29,706
Right before his death,

420
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:32,000
Nada was likely unconscious.

421
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:34,336
UNCONSCIOUS

422
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,901
Didn’t Nada’s son, Jun,
seem a little strange too?

423
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:01,613
After arriving in Japan,

424
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:04,366
I went out drinking with friends.

425
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:06,034
Later, I talked briefly with my parents.

426
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,246
Dad went to his study.

427
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:13,750
I drank some more alone
then went to sleep.

428
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,711
When I woke up,

429
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:19,506
Mom was screaming.
That was when I found out.

430
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:23,343
Did Mr. Nada have any enemies?

431
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,262
Hmm…

432
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:27,472
I don't really know him that well.

433
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:30,308
He was… complicated.

434
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:32,144
I didn’t really keep in touch with him.

435
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:37,399
He was way too calm

436
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:38,859
for someone who just lost his dad.

437
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:41,862
Especially on the very night
he got back from abroad…

438
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:44,781
SON

439
00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:17,981
I used to envy kids
from families like that.

440
00:39:18,065 --> 00:39:19,733
Turns out they’re messed up too.

441
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:24,196
Sometimes, when you unwrap a pretty
package, the inside isn't so nice.

442
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:26,782
If the motive was revenge,

443
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,868
Iteya Minamoto isn’t the only suspect.

444
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,870
His family members are too.

445
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:33,747
MARRIED

446
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:37,626
By the way, is Mr. Nada’s smartphone

447
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:38,752
still missing?

448
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:40,921
Yes. It could be critical evidence,

449
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:42,506
but it’s nowhere to be found.

450
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:44,174
It was probably taken by whoever did it.

451
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,886
-Supplemental reports.
-Thanks.

452
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,443
-No way… Seriously?
-What?

453
00:40:04,528 --> 00:40:05,987
This was inside Mr. Nada's computer.

454
00:40:08,532 --> 00:40:11,284
If her husband, Iteya Minamoto,

455
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:12,577
knew about this photo…

456
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:53,285
Kajin Sensei, sorry to keep you waiting.

457
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:02,294
Good evening.

458
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:05,422
Good evening.

459
00:41:11,178 --> 00:41:13,138
With something so sudden like this,

460
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:18,268
thank you for coming today

461
00:41:18,894 --> 00:41:20,187
for Nada.

462
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:24,733
Please, have some… here…

463
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,414
What are you doing here?

464
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:45,962
We just came

465
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:49,257
to offer our final respects
to Professor Nada.

466
00:41:50,884 --> 00:41:53,720
As if he would have wanted you here.

467
00:41:55,889 --> 00:41:57,599
I said I wanted to come.

468
00:41:58,725 --> 00:41:59,809
Iteya.

469
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,102
Long time no see.

470
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:03,980
You disappointed me.

471
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:06,024
You're his lawyer, right?

472
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:09,152
I asked her.

473
00:42:09,236 --> 00:42:11,613
Nada cared about you.

474
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:14,199
How could you…

475
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:17,744
betray us so easily?

476
00:42:20,914 --> 00:42:22,916
Because…

477
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:25,585
we live in different worlds.

478
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:27,754
What?

479
00:42:32,092 --> 00:42:33,927
I’m sorry…

480
00:42:34,928 --> 00:42:36,179
for your loss.

481
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:39,224
But…

482
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:43,520
wasn’t it excessive to accuse him
of being the killer

483
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:45,146
just because of a sighting?

484
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:48,942
What?

485
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:51,778
Even if I said something,
that doesn’t make him a murderer.

486
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,030
That’s for the police to decide.

487
00:42:56,283 --> 00:42:58,118
You are being very rude.

488
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,078
Know your place.

489
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:03,748
Iteya's lawyer?

490
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:05,750
You're the one who killed Okutaro!

491
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:08,086
-No! He didn’t!
-Liar!

492
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:10,213
Why would you take
my good brother from me?

493
00:43:10,297 --> 00:43:12,757
-Ms. Suzue… relax!
-Now do you understand?

494
00:43:12,841 --> 00:43:14,843
You’re not welcome here!

495
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,599
You murderer!

496
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:29,482
Okutaro!

497
00:43:29,566 --> 00:43:30,608
Suzue.

498
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:40,952
Lawyer.

499
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:43,121
Over here.

500
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,093
It's me. I'm coming in.

501
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:02,223
Are you all right?

502
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:06,478
I like kimchi stew anyway.

503
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:11,024
My wife went to buy you
a change of clothes.

504
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:34,923
Use this.

505
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:39,427
Give me that one instead.

506
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:43,473
You should stay properly dressed.

507
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:22,595
There’s still some here.

508
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:17,025
Iteya Minamoto.

509
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,903
What kind of athlete was he?

510
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:24,574
He's an offensive fencer who skillfully
reads his opponent's psychology.

511
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:27,577
At first,
it looks like you're the one attacking,

512
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:30,580
but before you know it,
he's the one controlling the game.

513
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:41,818
That won't happen again.

514
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:43,653
Who do you think it is?

515
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:45,071
The one who killed Dad?

516
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:46,072
Attacked?

517
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:47,532
It seemed he was suddenly hit.

518
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:49,617
Don't tell Iteya…

519
00:47:49,993 --> 00:47:52,203
PREVIEW
