1
00:00:04,672 --> 00:00:05,840
Defendant.

2
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:10,386
You say Mr. Iteya Minamoto
abused you again?

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,306
Yes.

4
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,642
Do I mean nothing to you?

5
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:19,645
I love you… so much!

6
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:24,984
Yet…

7
00:00:25,568 --> 00:00:28,696
instead of leaving,
you took him back, didn’t you?

8
00:00:31,407 --> 00:00:32,491
Thanks.

9
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:39,415
I thought I was the only one…

10
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,252
who could understand him.

11
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:51,552
In my head…

12
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,388
I knew…

13
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:56,682
that I should leave him…

14
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,120
Ayame.

15
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,970
Everyone wanted something from me…

16
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:23,143
They wanted to be protected…

17
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,020
like that.

18
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:29,358
They wanted to be saved.

19
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:35,364
Kanon was the same.

20
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:47,084
But you were different.

21
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,424
What was different?

22
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,601
You wanted me.

23
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,438
He became…

24
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,524
even gentler…

25
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,700
as if that cruelty…

26
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,245
was just a bad dream.

27
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,924
I might get off early today.

28
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:54,860
I'm off.

29
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:56,153
Take care.

30
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:29,728
Jun.

31
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:33,941
Which status caused the stir?

32
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:36,986
A writer and wife
of a university professor

33
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:38,946
who died from a crazy sexual fetish?

34
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:42,449
Or the charismatic businesswoman

35
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,284
who lost her pervert husband?

36
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:47,830
Maybe both.

37
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:58,882
Did you love him?

38
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:07,725
I’m not a murderer.

39
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,309
Can’t I just pay a fine or something?

40
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:14,023
Anyway… please get me a good lawyer.

41
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:29,663
Finally had your visit?

42
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,337
After what happened to my husband,

43
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,089
and now that my son is causing trouble…

44
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,134
I was too afraid to go outside.

45
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,012
Is that so?

46
00:05:46,472 --> 00:05:47,514
Is something else the matter?

47
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,936
The press caught wind
and gathered out front.

48
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:56,065
-Please use the rear exit.
-I’ll show you the way.

49
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:58,442
Thank you for your concern.

50
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:02,529
However, I can’t just keep quiet forever.

51
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:10,537
So cool…

52
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,456
Classic Yoko!

53
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,166
No fault in the product!

54
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,210
I'll keep supporting MY Queen!

55
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,132
Oh, I should have gotten her autograph!

56
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,551
I was planning to get it…

57
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:43,946
SHADOWLESS BY OKUTARO NADA

58
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:56,208
Couples' counseling?

59
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,001
Yes.

60
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:01,213
It’s common abroad to attend as a pair.

61
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,675
I thought maybe we could too…

62
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,969
There’s nothing wrong…

63
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:09,304
with us.

64
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:46,925
Oh. Iteya.

65
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,052
Jun’s in his room.

66
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:39,978
You’re already sorting through things?

67
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,110
I thought I’d pass some things on

68
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,363
to those he knew…

69
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,531
Though…

70
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,575
who would want them now?

71
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,619
He has been branded a pervert.

72
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:01,959
I'm sorry.

73
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:05,921
It’s about Iteya…

74
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,382
I…

75
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,927
And yet you look at Iteya that way?

76
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,559
If you kick me out,

77
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,479
I’ve got nowhere to go…

78
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:25,232
I would have no reason

79
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,818
to be upset about that joke.

80
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:33,615
Besides, this big house…

81
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:37,077
Even I get lonely alone.

82
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,229
Has Kanon come here?

83
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:09,026
Why do you think she’s here?

84
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:11,278
She doesn’t have many places to turn to.

85
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,114
Still, why would she come here?

86
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,786
So you knew she hadn’t come home.

87
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,248
I saw the video of you hitting her.

88
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:27,544
Any wife would run
after something like that.

89
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:31,048
If you really want to find her,

90
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,925
why not file a missing person report?

91
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:47,105
You accused me but no apology?

92
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:10,295
Hello.

93
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:12,130
Hello.

94
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:16,385
Hello.

95
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:20,847
What’s this?

96
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:21,973
Huh?

97
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:25,519
This? Like chocolate…

98
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,687
-From your favorite shop.
-No, thanks.

99
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:30,482
I haven’t even said anything yet.

100
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:32,984
You’re about to ask for something.

101
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,655
-How’d you know?
-Your nostrils flared.

102
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:37,823
What?

103
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,033
You always do that when you want a favor.

104
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,704
It’s about the Choga Construction appeal.

105
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,542
I need your thoughts

106
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,669
to counter the prosecutor’s argument.

107
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:59,094
-Only for a bit.
-Thanks!

108
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,312
ITEYA MINAMOTO
I FINISHED WORK

109
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,106
ITEYA MINAMOTO
I WANT TO SEE YOU SOON

110
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:12,941
ITEYA MINAMOTO
IN ONE HOUR

111
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:14,818
ITEYA MINAMOTO
COME HOME

112
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:20,615
AYAME KAJIN
SORRY, GOT STUCK AT WORK

113
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:37,090
I see. That might actually work.

114
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:38,175
Right.

115
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,470
Instead of countering the prosecution,

116
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:44,764
you should emphasize errors in the ruling.

117
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,351
Criminal appeals

118
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,561
are post-trials, so…

119
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,690
INCOMING CALL
ITEYA MINAMOTO

120
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:07,662
Anyway, about the ruling error…

121
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,209
INCOMING CALL
ITEYA MINAMOTO

122
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,671
Sorry. I have to go.

123
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,131
Sorry for keeping you.

124
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,010
Thanks.

125
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,853
MISSED CALL
ITEYA MINAMOTO

126
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,952
I’m home.

127
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,167
Sorry I'm late.

128
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,294
Why didn’t you answer?

129
00:13:58,838 --> 00:13:59,923
I didn’t notice.

130
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:03,802
It looks great.

131
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:05,637
Let me freshen up.

132
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:33,290
What’s this?

133
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:40,463
A thank you gift from a client.

134
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:47,387
A guy?

135
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,183
It was a woman.

136
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,895
You’re hungry, right? Let’s eat.

137
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,745
The appeal hearing is next week.

138
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,830
Preparations are complete.

139
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:14,914
Let us take care of it.

140
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:18,627
We want the project restarted this year.

141
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,211
We’re counting on you.

142
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:22,255
We intend to stay focused and committed.

143
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,175
Well then.

144
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,150
Thank you.

145
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,214
What brings you here today?

146
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:54,639
I’ve decided to run for office.

147
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:58,601
I want you on my team.

148
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:02,856
Now, of all times?

149
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,025
I thought you despised me.

150
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,944
That’s all in the past.

151
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:13,199
But if I bring you in…

152
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:17,662
you know what that means.

153
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,586
You want me to break up with him?

154
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:30,091
Cleaning up your personal life
is Politics 101.

155
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,180
Is that your only reason?

156
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:43,980
You think I’m jealous

157
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:47,108
because I see Iteya Minamoto as a man?

158
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:51,571
Kanon misunderstood.

159
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:54,365
I’d never lust after my son’s classmate.

160
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,998
I once…

161
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:05,376
stole Nada from someone.

162
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:12,258
I met Nada during an interview
and wanted him no matter what.

163
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,303
I used every trick I could.

164
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,681
And I got him.

165
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:22,393
I had the career…

166
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,230
the man…

167
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,190
and everything in life.

168
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:30,443
It should have been the ideal life.

169
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:34,781
Never thought I’d end up

170
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,701
as "the pervert’s wife".

171
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,373
Why tell me this?

172
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,085
Right.

173
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:51,714
Maybe I thought…

174
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,634
you’d understand.

175
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,556
I'm sheltering Kanon,

176
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,643
but I'm asking you, who's sleeping
with her husband, for a favor.

177
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,523
What a twisted pair we make.

178
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,623
I hope you give me a good answer.

179
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:43,725
Um… I'm Imura, the director.

180
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:44,851
I'm Mogami.

181
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,938
What did Yoko Mogami want?

182
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:53,735
A good offer… but with conditions.

183
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:03,995
Iteya!

184
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,497
Were you worried about me?

185
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,044
Guess not.

186
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,299
What do you want?

187
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:21,888
Kanon disappeared.
Thought you might know where she’d go.

188
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:23,389
Oh, yeah?

189
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,142
She ran off somewhere?

190
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,563
That's because you cheated on her.

191
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,191
What are you trying to do?

192
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:37,028
Kanon and that lawyer?

193
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:40,782
You want to keep both?

194
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:46,079
That’s the worst kind of guy.

195
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:50,625
You wouldn’t understand.

196
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:51,542
Huh?

197
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:56,965
No one loves you.
And you’ve never loved anyone.

198
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:01,219
Everyone just wanted things from me.

199
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,888
Kanon, Ayame…

200
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,559
your mother too.

201
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:13,731
So, you knew?

202
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:15,942
I see.

203
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:20,113
Easier for you to pretend not to.

204
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,533
You pretended too.

205
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,164
You just watched…

206
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:33,668
as I was being accused.

207
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:41,426
It was a thrill.

208
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,845
Everyone thought it was murder,

209
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:46,931
but it was just suicide.

210
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:55,648
Was it really suicide?

211
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:00,778
Why do you ask?

212
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:06,951
You’d enjoy exposing your dad
as a pervert more than mourning him.

213
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,247
So you think I killed him?

214
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:29,682
Who are you protecting?

215
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,646
We’re done here!

216
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:06,469
FENCING CLASS

217
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:18,106
I DON'T NEED TO BE PICKED UP

218
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:19,899
Oh, Lawyer.

219
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:23,486
Here about Minamoto Senpai again?

220
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:25,905
No.

221
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:29,826
He’s been continuously taking days off.

222
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:30,910
Huh?

223
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:34,163
Some parents canceled his private lessons

224
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:38,459
after seeing that viral video of him
yelling at his wife.

225
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:44,048
-No!
-I couldn't believe

226
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:45,508
he would do something like that.

227
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,221
INCOMING CALL
ITEYA MINAMOTO

228
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:57,395
Hello?

229
00:23:58,354 --> 00:23:59,355
Where are you?

230
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,861
Out on client visits. You?

231
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:09,323
I’m done with work.
Heading to solo practice.

232
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:14,620
Got it.

233
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:18,040
I’ll head home first then.

234
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:22,003
I sensed it.

235
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:24,922
He’s still…

236
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:27,341
searching for his wife.

237
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:05,421
You again?

238
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:08,966
I told you Kanon’s not here.

239
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:11,510
Keep this up

240
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:14,889
and I might call the police.

241
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:17,975
Go ahead.

242
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:20,144
You’re the one who’ll be in trouble.

243
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:22,772
What?

244
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,443
Okutaro Nada didn't die by accident.
He was murdered.

245
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,951
It was you, wasn’t it?

246
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:40,206
What are you talking about?

247
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:54,470
Please stop making wild accusations.

248
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:58,516
Go home.

249
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:00,810
Jun’s lying.

250
00:26:02,979 --> 00:26:04,730
He’s protecting you.

251
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:12,363
He’s waiting to see
what his mother will do.

252
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,212
You’re too hard on Jun.

253
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:13,466
He’s our only son.

254
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,218
Don’t you want to help him?

255
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:20,389
You’ve always cleaned up
his messes with money.

256
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:24,310
It was for your pride…

257
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:26,687
and appearances.

258
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:28,564
That’s unfair…

259
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:30,900
I’ve done everything I could

260
00:27:31,776 --> 00:27:35,696
as his mother and your wife!

261
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,865
So that’s why that girl left.

262
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:40,993
She was ruthlessly kicked out.

263
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,498
I was deceived by you.

264
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:50,252
It’s over now.

265
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:55,216
-I’m leaving this house.
-What?

266
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:59,095
Until the election ends,

267
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,889
I’ll keep pretending
to be your supportive husband.

268
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,892
Are you divorcing me?

269
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:06,685
You can do as you please

270
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,480
without worrying about me…

271
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:11,982
even with that man.

272
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:17,696
Why not try to keep the man
you love like a pet?

273
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:22,159
I’ve never once betrayed you since we met!

274
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:23,619
It's about Iteya.

275
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:29,792
You’ve deliberately acted
like you despise him.

276
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:30,918
That’s not true!

277
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:33,712
Your expression, your tone of voice…

278
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:37,967
you’re drawn to that wild dog, right?

279
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:41,804
Love whoever you want.

280
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:44,682
I’m done being

281
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:49,645
"Yoko Mogami’s husband" and will be free.

282
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,566
Feels like

283
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:55,860
I’ve grown wings!

284
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,049
Darling?

285
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:11,268
Help me…

286
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:13,604
please!

287
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:15,976
SHADOWLESS BY OKUTARO NADA

288
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:45,756
Also…

289
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:50,594
I’ve always known…

290
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:54,264
you were…

291
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:56,266
attracted to me.

292
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:05,818
What an inflated ego.

293
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,282
So what?

294
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:16,370
Are you going to the police
with this story?

295
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,123
Of course not.

296
00:33:22,126 --> 00:33:24,753
You want money? How much?

297
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:36,390
You really don’t know anyone
who can’t be bought?

298
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:42,479
What do you want?

299
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:51,864
Forget that accident ever happened.

300
00:34:04,585 --> 00:34:06,962
You used that to control us.

301
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:12,134
But how about we play fair now?

302
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,985
Let’s keep each other’s secrets.

303
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,797
Do I mean nothing to you?

304
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:55,761
I love you… so much!

305
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,151
Kajin Sensei.

306
00:35:54,403 --> 00:35:55,404
Are you okay?

307
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,824
Thanks. I'm all right.

308
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,037
Kajin Sensei!

309
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,165
Are you okay?

310
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:31,356
Can’t sleep?

311
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:40,407
Are you okay?

312
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,038
Because of Iteya Minamoto?

313
00:37:02,346 --> 00:37:03,347
MISSED CALLS
ITEYA MINAMOTO

314
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,856
Kajin…

315
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,947
If something’s wrong, talk to us.

316
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:23,617
I’m fine.

317
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:34,503
Nagisa, sorry,
but could you take her home?

318
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:37,130
Sure, I’ll go get a taxi.

319
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:38,924
I'll take that.

320
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:41,843
Thanks.

321
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:53,438
You didn’t call back. I was worried.

322
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:02,114
She looks exhausted.

323
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,494
Any idea why?

324
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:19,923
Let's go.

325
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:49,327
See you.

326
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:22,819
Sorry about earlier.

327
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:26,573
I didn’t notice your calls…

328
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:32,496
Why were you with him?

329
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,043
He was just walking me home.

330
00:39:58,105 --> 00:39:59,606
I told you, didn’t I?

331
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:03,527
You’re all I have!

332
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:27,300
While you’re out looking for your wife?

333
00:40:34,516 --> 00:40:35,642
You're out…

334
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:40,147
You’re out looking for your wife?

335
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,011
I finally understand.

336
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:12,512
Everyone is like a frog,

337
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:14,723
already half-boiled

338
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:17,225
in a pot of hot water.

339
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,396
It wasn’t him clinging desperately,

340
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,027
trying not to be

341
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,031
thrown off by this love.

342
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:36,077
It was me.

343
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:16,993
INCOMING CALL
AYAME KAJIN

344
00:42:24,668 --> 00:42:26,336
Ayame!

345
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,298
Sorry about last night.

346
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:36,304
I stayed up all night waiting for you.

347
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:45,438
Don't leave me.

348
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:53,071
Come back!

349
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:59,703
I want to talk to you too.

350
00:43:04,124 --> 00:43:07,127
Okay. Where can we meet?

351
00:43:29,983 --> 00:43:31,234
Ayame.

352
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:36,614
Are you Iteya Minamoto?

353
00:43:52,172 --> 00:43:55,300
Thank you for coming.

354
00:44:02,182 --> 00:44:04,309
You're asking me for help?

355
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:07,562
You’ve got some nerve.

356
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,233
You slept with my husband

357
00:44:14,194 --> 00:44:16,071
then mocked me.

358
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:25,789
The first time…

359
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:30,210
you asked me for help…

360
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,714
we were supposed to meet here.

361
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:42,931
Life’s strange.

362
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:46,726
Now our roles…

363
00:44:48,812 --> 00:44:50,522
are reversed.

364
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:56,027
But…

365
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,367
I want this to end.

366
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,457
To do that…

367
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:14,337
I need your help.

368
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:20,260
Why me?

369
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:22,804
He hurt you…

370
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:27,142
far worse,

371
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:31,438
longer, deeper,

372
00:45:32,689 --> 00:45:35,400
more cruelly than he ever hurt me.

373
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:41,739
File a domestic violence report

374
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,200
against him to the police.

375
00:45:49,873 --> 00:45:52,041
I could never do that…

376
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:55,253
But deep down, you know.

377
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:59,757
You want… to help him.

378
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:01,342
You need to help him.

379
00:46:05,138 --> 00:46:06,264
That’s why…

380
00:46:07,474 --> 00:46:08,725
you came, right?

381
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:28,953
Why don't we do something…

382
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:33,500
only the two of us can do?

383
00:46:44,177 --> 00:46:45,887
Can you come to the station with us?

384
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:08,368
Why?

385
00:47:09,244 --> 00:47:10,662
-Hey!
-Hold him!

386
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:11,746
Hey!

387
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:16,000
Hey! What is this?

388
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:17,627
Let me go!

389
00:47:18,545 --> 00:47:20,630
What's going on?

390
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:23,591
Ayame!

391
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,351
I thought…

392
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:37,272
it was finally over.

393
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:42,360
It looks like Iteya Minamoto
is going to be released.

394
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:45,446
My life was ruined because of you people.

395
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:47,615
You're the one who made me this way.

396
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:50,785
-He's going to report you for stalking.
-Stalking?

397
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:54,038
-Goodbye.
-You don't love me anymore?
