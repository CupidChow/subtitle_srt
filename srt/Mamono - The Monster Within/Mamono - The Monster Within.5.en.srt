1
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:07,883
Kanon, wife of Iteya Minamoto,

2
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:11,345
harmed herself at your workplace.

3
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:13,055
This is my charm.

4
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:14,473
No! Don't!

5
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:20,271
He’s all…

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,191
I have…

7
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:29,238
And after she disappeared,

8
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:32,658
you invited Iteya Minamoto into your home.

9
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:36,495
Come…

10
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:38,539
be with me.

11
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:44,336
How many times
did Mr. Minamoto hit you during that time?

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,802
What do you count…

13
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,221
as "one time"?

14
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,183
Pardon?

15
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,353
If I was hit once by his fist

16
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:04,482
and once with his foot,

17
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:06,817
do you count every strike?

18
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:09,695
Or…

19
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:12,698
does the number of times
he hit me in a day

20
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:15,367
all count as "one time"?

21
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,688
-Morning.
-Morning.

22
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:48,609
What are you looking at?

23
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:53,531
A beautiful woman.

24
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:58,577
I need to get up now.

25
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,914
-Don't
-Hey, come on!

26
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:03,999
I won't let you go.

27
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,626
Hey!

28
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,432
-Thanks.
-Yeah. I’ll come pick you up later.

29
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,438
-Take care.
-I will.

30
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:03,684
We’ve all come together
to cheer you on for the appeals trial!

31
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,060
You’ve got this!

32
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:15,195
As you can see,
Naganami Law Office is fully committed

33
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:18,407
to giving our all for the upcoming appeal.

34
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,992
Very reassuring.

35
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:59,031
That was awesome! My attack just now!

36
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:02,826
Yeah, impressive.

37
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:08,165
Minamoto Senpai’s potential is insane.

38
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,126
He only started in high school,
but he’s neck and neck with Nada Senpai.

39
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,087
He’s a monster.

40
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,339
It's admirable.

41
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,842
All that money spent since you were a kid,

42
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:20,970
and yet there’s barely a difference.

43
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:25,641
He’s done incredibly well.

44
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:29,853
If he wins,
he’ll get a scholarship to college.

45
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:35,776
As long as he doesn’t lose to his pal
living in that doghouse out back, right?

46
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:44,201
Coach, thank you so much.

47
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:49,123
Thanks to you, Jun was able to win.

48
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:54,086
A match against Minamoto
would’ve been close,

49
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:57,506
but luckily, he agreed to forfeit.

50
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:02,011
I’ve already sent the payment.

51
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,596
Please don’t worry about it.

52
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,267
Thank you for your continued support.

53
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,309
AWARDS

54
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,589
It's looking good though…

55
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,592
It's so different
with and without the director.

56
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,471
I sincerely hope
to have your continued support.

57
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:46,597
Thank you. Same here.

58
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,401
ITEYA MINAMOTO
I CAN PROBABLY COME HOME EARLY TODAY.

59
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:03,614
Are you okay?

60
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:06,658
Okay.

61
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:09,870
One more time.

62
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,960
Not yet!

63
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,630
It's okay for now!

64
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,304
Who wants to go upstairs?

65
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,516
-Yes.
-Yes.

66
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,281
Hotpot?

67
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:50,077
Yeah, sounds good. Let's go there then…

68
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,954
-Probably…
-Yeah.

69
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:11,682
Knowing he was waiting at home…

70
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:16,979
that made it easier to bear everything.

71
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:21,733
Hey.

72
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,820
Are you really okay with this?

73
00:07:26,155 --> 00:07:28,740
This isn’t the Ayame Kajin
who’d put up with being treated like this.

74
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:32,035
Surprisingly, I kind of like it.

75
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,080
Maybe I was just working too hard before.

76
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:36,957
Come on…

77
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,713
Maybe this is the real me.

78
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:44,840
I’ll apologize to the director with you.

79
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:48,010
I’ll even bow to Mr. Choga if I have to.

80
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:52,639
-Don’t waste your time.
-Now’s not the time for pride.

81
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,727
Everything you’ve built
will all go to waste.

82
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,605
What about the trial prep?

83
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,441
The appeal’s coming up, right?

84
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,499
This is Salon MY Queen.

85
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:25,339
Unfortunately,
Kanon Minamoto is out today.

86
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:29,426
Oh, are you her regular customer?

87
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,971
If you would like, I can take care--

88
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,982
Kanon Minamoto harmed herself?

89
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:47,236
Iteya Minamoto started dating that lawyer.

90
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,821
When his wife found out,
she stormed into the office.

91
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:52,115
Total chaos…

92
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:57,079
If it were me,
I’d be worried about the age gap.

93
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:01,166
Still…

94
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:06,129
she is kinda hot…

95
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:12,678
Sorry.

96
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,391
Detective Kinbara, they’ve arrived.

97
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:25,107
So? What do you want to ask me?

98
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:27,567
The ¥5 million.

99
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,238
What was that money for?

100
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:38,620
It was transferred from Mr. Nada’s account
around the estimated time of death…

101
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,206
to your account.

102
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,624
APRIL 12, 2024
¥5 MILLION DEPOSIT TO JUN NADA

103
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:45,752
And?

104
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,593
One of your friends says
you asked him for a loan

105
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:57,014
right after coming back to Japan.

106
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:01,768
Ah… that.

107
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:05,022
You had money problems, at the very least.

108
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:10,652
Is it so strange to think
that this transfer

109
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:12,904
and Mr. Nada’s death are connected?

110
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,210
What’s that?

111
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,881
It’s my father’s.

112
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:35,844
I’ll tell you everything.

113
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,096
Who…

114
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,974
really killed my father.

115
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:51,401
As for your husband,
Okutaro Nada’s cause of death…

116
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:57,532
We believe it was accidental asphyxiation
during a bondage session.

117
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,078
An accident?

118
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:05,290
He tied his own neck and limbs
and slipped.

119
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:15,300
The autopsy also showed
that the neck compression

120
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:17,969
wasn’t caused by the robe belt
but by an electrical cord.

121
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:20,222
Is that so?

122
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:26,520
According to your son’s testimony,
after discovering the body,

123
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:30,190
he staged it
to make it look like a murder.

124
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:34,736
But why would he do that?

125
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:40,033
If people found out he died like that,
it’d be seriously embarrassing.

126
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:44,287
So I staged it for him.

127
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:54,840
This cellphone belonging to Mr. Nada
was found in your son’s possession.

128
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,301
After discovering the body…

129
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:01,388
your son transferred ¥5 million

130
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:04,724
from his account to his own…

131
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:07,310
I didn’t know about that.

132
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:10,772
Once people found out
about my father’s death,

133
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:13,358
I wouldn't have been able
to move the money anymore, right?

134
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,152
TRANSFER ¥5 MILLION
FROM OKUTARO NADA TO JUN NADA

135
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,319
TRANSFER COMPLETE

136
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:26,121
After transferring it, I saw the photos.

137
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,039
That’s when I realized…

138
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:34,212
that was my dad, after all!

139
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:39,676
I protected his legacy.

140
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:44,931
Dying from a failed BDSM session?
That’s just lame.

141
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:47,517
In that case…

142
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:53,523
being remembered as a literary figure
murdered in cold blood sounds better.

143
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,325
I hope he's grateful in the afterlife…

144
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,244
to me.

145
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,756
We also heard from your son.

146
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:22,177
What was the relationship like
between your husband and your son?

147
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:28,350
You want me to pay off your gambling debts
from your little playtime?

148
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,601
Don’t be ridiculous!

149
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,938
They just kept piling up from online bets…

150
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,649
Please, the deadline’s coming up--

151
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:38,193
Shut up! You failure!

152
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:43,031
This is what happens when you coddle him.

153
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,087
I’ll talk to him.

154
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,840
Why don’t you try to get some rest?

155
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,185
What kind of punishment will Jun face?

156
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,647
Obstruction of business through fraud.

157
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,857
It won’t carry a very heavy sentence.

158
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:28,201
I truly apologize for all this.

159
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:40,839
FAMOUS WRITER OKUTARO NADA'S DEATH
WAS ACCIDENTAL

160
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,757
SUICIDE BY A PERVERTED WRITER
LOL, ACCIDENTAL DEATH FROM SELF-BONDAGE

161
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:44,134
FAKING MURDER? WILD SUICIDE. CRAZY!

162
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,760
SON IS CRAZY TOO! DUMB SON!
YOKO = REAL DOMINATRIX?

163
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:47,012
SO MY QUEEN WAS FORESHADOWING? LOL.

164
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,305
I DON'T WANT TO SEE NADA EVER AGAIN

165
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,764
HIS EXISTENCE IS GROSS!
HERE COMES THE PERVERT!

166
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,182
BODY FOUND AT HOME - AUTHOR
OKUTARO NADA'S (60) ACCIDENTAL DEATH?

167
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:54,519
Last month on the 11th,

168
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:58,440
regarding the body of Okutaro Nada
found at his residence…

169
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:03,028
All that noise and no crime?

170
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,572
What was it all for?

171
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:09,451
Such an unremarkable end
for a famed writer.

172
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:15,290
His image as the "Midnight Madonna"
has been utterly destroyed.

173
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:19,210
The director of MY Queen…

174
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:21,296
Even so, Yoko's husband died…

175
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,758
…was strangled
with something like a cloth…

176
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,718
And the son staged the scene.

177
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,804
That family was seriously messed up.

178
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:46,821
So he tied himself up and died?

179
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,866
That’s so messed up, it’s almost funny.

180
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,831
That woman who tried to pin it on me…

181
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,668
she deserves to suffer more.

182
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:05,632
You agree, right?

183
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:10,970
I’m just glad…

184
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,892
your name was cleared.

185
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:22,357
Jeez…

186
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,652
too bad you’re not off today too…

187
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,906
I can’t take the day off.

188
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:35,662
Lame.

189
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,332
What’s a day off without Ayame?

190
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,964
Iteya and Kanon won't separate.

191
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:49,634
That's because they're special.

192
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:58,810
Forget it. I’m not going in.

193
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:03,314
-What?
-It’s not like I do anything important.

194
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,317
All right!

195
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:11,281
-Really?
-Yeah.

196
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,284
-We're together for today?
-Yeah.

197
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:18,621
I like this part.

198
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:25,754
I’m hungry.

199
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:28,339
Want to eat something?

200
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,759
Yeah. Should we order delivery?

201
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:37,223
Want me to cook?
To make up for making you skip work.

202
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,520
-Hey.
-Yeah?

203
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,523
About Kanon…

204
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,276
Any word from her?

205
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:04,667
Let’s not talk about Kanon.

206
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,549
You’re all I need…

207
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,811
INCOMING CALL
IMURA

208
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:24,604
No, I won't let you do that.

209
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,232
I have to at least answer the phone.

210
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,192
Though you "don’t do anything important"?

211
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:31,945
-Come on!
-No, I won't let you.

212
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:33,780
The call's going to end.

213
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:42,580
Hello, this is Kajin.

214
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:45,416
Where are you?

215
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,335
You haven’t come in yet.

216
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,505
Sorry, I’m out on calls.

217
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:54,008
When you get back to the office,
come see me.

218
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,513
There’s a case I’d like you to take on.

219
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:02,600
Understood.

220
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,276
Sorry! I’ve got to go to work.

221
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:12,944
Huh?

222
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,153
Right now?

223
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,616
I’ll be back as soon as I’m done.

224
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:35,800
Excuse me.

225
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:44,100
I trust your outside visits went smoothly?

226
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:49,647
Yes. About the case you’d like me
to take on?

227
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,784
Mr. Choga’s affair?

228
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:06,581
The woman has been close to him for years.

229
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:11,544
When he brought up ending things,
she threatened to tell his wife.

230
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,174
Even said she had photos.
She refuses to settle.

231
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:17,884
EVIDENCE OF PICTURES AND MESSAGES

232
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,094
I debated who to assign it to.

233
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:24,349
But given your personal experience,

234
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,601
you’re best suited to handle this.

235
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,646
I want you to settle it quietly,
woman to woman.

236
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,650
Can I count on you?

237
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,988
I’ll handle it.

238
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,211
Sorry to keep you waiting.

239
00:20:58,591 --> 00:20:59,717
Take care.

240
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:28,579
Iteya. How’ve you been?

241
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,085
I have a client.

242
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:37,171
I have to go back.
We can talk later, okay?

243
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:41,259
-Come wait inside if you want--
-The client matters more?

244
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:45,388
No, that’s not it. Sorry.

245
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,516
We could grab a coffee somewhere instead…

246
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,019
Where've you been all this time?

247
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,396
-At a woman’s place… a senpai’s…
-Who?

248
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:57,316
-You don’t know her.
-Don’t lie to me. Who were you with?

249
00:21:58,609 --> 00:21:59,485
Hey, um…

250
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:08,870
No!

251
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:15,543
-Let me go!
-Are you okay?

252
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:18,254
-Hey! What are you--
-This has nothing to do with you!

253
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:21,758
Wait!

254
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:25,845
-Wait!
-Quit it!

255
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:27,638
Move!

256
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,641
Please hurry and go!

257
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:00,004
That concludes the procedure.

258
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:05,176
I appreciate your willingness to settle.

259
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,056
As a fellow woman,

260
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,725
don’t you feel anything about this?

261
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:14,560
Huh?

262
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:26,864
Good work!

263
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:30,535
With the agreement signed
and the NDA in place,

264
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:33,704
I knew you were
the right person for the job.

265
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:36,999
Director…

266
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:43,923
Did Mr. Choga know
that I handled the case?

267
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:49,554
Since we weren’t able to have a meeting
before the negotiations…

268
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,222
You're concerned about that?

269
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:57,645
I want to return
to the Choga Construction appeal team.

270
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:03,442
No interviews. Turn them all down.

271
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,988
Yeah, please do.

272
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:08,823
Yeah.

273
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,994
We’ll call an executive meeting soon
and explain in detail.

274
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:23,296
THIS WAS THE STUPID SON

275
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:25,173
YOKO WAS THE DOMINATRIX!

276
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:02,877
Thank you for treating Kajin
to such a fine meal.

277
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,213
She had an impressive appetite
earlier today,

278
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:08,299
and her problem-solving skills
were just as remarkable.

279
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:11,969
You're unlike that perverted professor,
right?

280
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,892
-By the way, oh!
-Oh! It's here.

281
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:20,895
-Here.
-This item.

282
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:22,813
Wow!

283
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:24,273
-This is great!
-It's this!

284
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:29,820
-Ta-da!
-Wow, looks delicious!

285
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:34,325
He wants you to try this rice cake.

286
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:35,826
Take one.

287
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,080
I’ve had enough already.

288
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:44,669
If there’s nothing else,
may I excuse myself?

289
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:46,587
Not until you finish.

290
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:49,423
Mr. Choga went out of his way
to request them for you.

291
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:53,886
Hey. Come on.

292
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:57,640
This shop’s rice cakes are excellent.

293
00:25:57,723 --> 00:26:01,227
-Looks great! I want to eat it!
-Go ahead.

294
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:03,437
Thank you for the food.

295
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:25,042
We recently hired a new recruit in PR.

296
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:30,006
She said something halfway decent
in her first meeting,

297
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:33,467
so I told her to submit a proposal.

298
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:35,678
That afternoon,

299
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:41,892
the phone kept ringing
at the desk beside her.

300
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:44,103
When I asked her why she didn’t answer,

301
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,897
she said that
she was too focused on her proposal.

302
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:49,650
-Oh, no!
-So I told her,

303
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:53,362
"Anyone can write a proposal."

304
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:57,533
"But you’re the only one
who can pick up that call."

305
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:02,705
She was so confused.

306
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:05,791
Do you think she got the message?

307
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:08,002
Maybe not.

308
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:10,296
Or maybe she doesn’t know her place.

309
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:15,968
The smarter the woman,
the more likely she thinks she’s special.

310
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:21,015
That kind of talk’s "discrimination"
nowadays though.

311
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:27,146
It's good, isn't it?

312
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,822
-Yeah?
-Looks so good!

313
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,081
Hey.

314
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,125
So, are you back
on the Choga Construction team?

315
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:53,339
-That's not it…
-What?

316
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:58,219
I heard you had dinner with Mr. Choga.
Thought that meant you were forgiven…

317
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,222
Hey! What's wrong?

318
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:05,893
What? Really? Are you throwing up?

319
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:08,896
You're throwing up! Hold on!

320
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:13,234
Wait. I'll bring water, okay?

321
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:14,693
Are you okay?

322
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,739
Seriously…

323
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,127
I’m home.

324
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,253
Welcome back.

325
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:44,098
Sorry.

326
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:47,184
I don’t think I can eat tonight.

327
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,607
I’m just tired…

328
00:28:58,195 --> 00:28:59,363
I see.

329
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:02,324
Then go to bed early.

330
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,288
Thanks.

331
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:13,752
I thought just being together was enough.

332
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,548
At the time…

333
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,342
I still thought that…

334
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:25,014
This went up online yesterday.

335
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,098
A CRAZY GUY BEING VIOLENT
IN BROAD DAYLIGHT

336
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:28,184
-No!
-These two…

337
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:31,604
That’s Iteya Minamoto and his wife, right?

338
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:34,982
Hard to tell…

339
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,526
You can’t really see their faces.

340
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:42,823
But thanks. Please get back to work.

341
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:55,294
Oh, sorry!

342
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:01,800
How are you feeling?

343
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:06,680
Still sick?

344
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:13,020
I'm drinking with Mr. Sohara from
Choga Construction and thought you'd join.

345
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:14,855
Just us two.

346
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,816
But if you're still unwell then…

347
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:19,860
All right, take care.

348
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:26,408
I’ll go.

349
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:31,539
I’ll go.

350
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,920
-Good work.
-Yeah.

351
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:42,132
Minamoto Senpai? Want to grab a drink?

352
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:46,470
I’ll pass tonight.

353
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:49,098
-I want to get home and apologize.
-What?

354
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:52,893
-You guys have a fight?
-Something like that.

355
00:30:52,977 --> 00:30:54,645
-Good work.
-Thank you for your hard work.

356
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:58,357
"The great Okutaro Nada was a pervert!"

357
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:00,651
That’s all anyone’s talking about.

358
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:02,820
-No kidding.
-Right.

359
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:08,158
The marriage and family ties
of a celebrity family was a lie.

360
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:12,496
Even the way he died.
It's a story the tabloids would feast on.

361
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,664
Right.

362
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:19,795
Compared to that, your mistake was minor.

363
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:26,635
Pulled from the team over something
personal. Tough decision by the director.

364
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,055
By the way…

365
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,183
Mr. Choga’s

366
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:37,396
a handful too, right?
At least that’s the word on the street.

367
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,607
Hey. Confidentiality?

368
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:42,192
Come on, it stays here.

369
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:46,238
I’m ashamed to say it,

370
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:50,200
but his issues with women are a nightmare.

371
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:55,122
Thanks to Kajin Sensei,
we avoided a full-blown scandal this time.

372
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:13,974
Sohara, Mr. Sohara…

373
00:32:18,062 --> 00:32:20,397
Quit Choga Construction

374
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:23,817
-and come to our firm…
-No…

375
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:25,653
What do you mean "no, no"?

376
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:26,797
Is that meal…

377
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:29,007
some kind of celebration?

378
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,804
Why were you so late?

379
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:40,310
-I was out drinking.
-With whom?

380
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:42,980
People from work.

381
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:49,278
Was it that lawyer?

382
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,074
Yes. Mr. Konno was there too.

383
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:55,534
Until this late?

384
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:02,082
What’s your point?

385
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,060
I need time to think alone.

386
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:25,481
Go to sleep.

387
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:40,496
Do I mean nothing to you?

388
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:43,457
I love you… so much!

389
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:38,387
You want me to defend your son?

390
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:42,641
Nada's death wasn't
just a regular accidental death.

391
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:47,354
Because of that,
weird rumors have been spreading around…

392
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:51,233
Now they’re calling me a pervert too…

393
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,323
Please give me time to think.

394
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:01,243
I’m not feeling well.

395
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,204
Really?

396
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,458
I was hoping it would be you…

397
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:13,672
If you're okay with someone from our firm,
I can recommend a colleague.

398
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:15,966
That would help.

399
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:20,345
Also, this…

400
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:24,016
Wait!

401
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:28,395
No!

402
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:29,855
It hurts!

403
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,065
Isn’t this awful?

404
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:36,069
This can't be allowed.

405
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:41,950
Can’t you talk to him too?

406
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:04,348
We were just discussing about you.

407
00:37:04,765 --> 00:37:06,975
Let's talk about it during the meal.

408
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:24,201
You need to leave him.

409
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:28,747
Hiding like this is not normal.

410
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:35,545
What do you think, Lawyer?

411
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:43,428
When you can’t trust your partner,

412
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:48,892
when you feel anxious,
unloved, and always in doubt…

413
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:53,855
That’s who he is.

414
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:58,485
Still, I won’t divorce him.

415
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,697
The real Iteya is kind.

416
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,491
I make him lose control. It’s my fault.

417
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,327
No.

418
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,330
Violence is never okay.

419
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:15,502
People have hurt me before…

420
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:21,174
but only Iteya makes me feel happy.

421
00:38:23,844 --> 00:38:25,762
It'd be much better to be with him

422
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:29,808
than alone.

423
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:34,521
So I’m happier than you.

424
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:54,458
It’s all your fault.

425
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,461
He only had eyes for me.

426
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:02,799
Because you seduced him, he suffered.

427
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:05,677
Seduced?

428
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:09,014
Huh? What are you saying?

429
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:42,798
I just…

430
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,259
wanted to be with you.

431
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:50,889
But you didn’t come home…

432
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:55,852
Mom left me…

433
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:00,899
Kanon left me…

434
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,532
If you leave too…

435
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:10,492
I…

436
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,383
I’m sorry…

437
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:32,514
I’m sorry.

438
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:38,061
You did it for me, didn’t you?

439
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:48,989
Thank you.

440
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:21,771
You're that kind of a person?

441
00:41:24,024 --> 00:41:25,317
With all due respect,

442
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:30,697
didn’t you frame him
as your husband's killer?

443
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,328
Is what I did really worse than that?

444
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:39,122
We’re talking about you.

445
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:43,293
Maybe you knew about
Professor Nada's fetish from the start?

446
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:47,339
You were trying to buy some time

447
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,676
to prevent rumors about your husband.

448
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:59,100
This person says such terrible things,
doesn't she?

449
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:02,854
You're using Kanon too, aren't you?

450
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:07,484
You say you're taking care
of her like family,

451
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,611
but you're treating her like a servant.

452
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:14,616
How dare you.

453
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:20,705
You should apologize to Kanon first.

454
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:24,167
-Apologize?
-Yes.

455
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:31,591
Apologize for being loved so intensely
by your husband that I was beaten?

456
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:37,931
Does Iteya love you?

457
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:43,645
Why are you so confident?

458
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:49,359
It seems okay with him.

459
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:52,529
Because I'm different from his wife.

460
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,617
I thought so from the beginning.

461
00:42:58,368 --> 00:43:00,787
I'm not like you.

462
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:02,622
Something is wrong here.

463
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:07,210
Would it have been better if I had
lived alone like you and died alone?

464
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:13,508
Why is it better to live alone
than to live together with Iteya?

465
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:22,100
Was I the first woman he cheated with?

466
00:43:23,143 --> 00:43:26,479
Maybe there were others like me before.

467
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,525
Both of you stop.

468
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:34,988
Even if there are no perfect people,
there are lines that shouldn't be crossed.

469
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,408
Violence is out of the question.
You should treat each other properly

470
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:41,661
as human beings.

471
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:43,997
Even you, Yoko.

472
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:47,167
Didn't you endure
being scolded by Professor Nada

473
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:50,295
and have to live while enduring that?

474
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:53,548
Wasn't it because you loved him?

475
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:59,262
That person never laid a hand on me.

476
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:03,641
For the first month or two
after we got married,

477
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:06,811
Iteya and I were always having sex.

478
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:11,358
Wherever we went, he was with me,
so much that

479
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:14,486
we didn't even have time to sleep.

480
00:44:15,028 --> 00:44:17,155
So during the day,
I was always dozing off,

481
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,532
and I lost a lot of weight.

482
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,746
But when did it start?

483
00:44:26,456 --> 00:44:29,209
Just coming here, Iteya started asking

484
00:44:29,626 --> 00:44:32,212
what I was doing with Professor Nada.

485
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,799
Actually, there was nothing,

486
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:39,469
just that one time
when I was photographed.

487
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:40,804
That story--

488
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:45,600
I will never forgive violence.

489
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:48,144
Even if I'm thought of
as the wife whose husband

490
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:51,940
committed suicide or as a perverted wife,
I live with pride!

491
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,067
Like you?

492
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,529
And yet you look at Iteya that way?

493
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:18,758
You’re going too far with your words.

494
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:31,146
When did I cross over to this side?

495
00:45:33,106 --> 00:45:34,441
Sorry.

496
00:45:37,152 --> 00:45:38,736
I want to be reborn…

497
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:43,700
I want to be reborn…

498
00:45:47,162 --> 00:45:49,831
I used to live in a different world…

499
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:58,006
I swore I’d never be like that woman…

500
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,926
like the women I despised the most.

501
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:06,306
But now…

502
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,350
we’ve all fallen into the same hole.

503
00:47:25,635 --> 00:47:29,973
So… what do we do from here?

504
00:47:39,816 --> 00:47:41,901
-Did he really commit suicide?
-Why?

505
00:47:41,985 --> 00:47:44,362
Okutaro Nada wasn't killed
in an accident but was murdered?

506
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:48,491
I felt like I was the only one
who truly understood him.

507
00:47:48,575 --> 00:47:51,119
-Was it because of Iteya Minamoto?
-Why were you with him?

508
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:54,080
Even now,
he’s still searching for his wife.
