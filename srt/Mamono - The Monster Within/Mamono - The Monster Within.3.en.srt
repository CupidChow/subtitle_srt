1
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:08,926
The defendant engaged in
a sexual relationship with Iteya Minamoto,

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,971
who was suspected
of murdering Okutaro Nada.

3
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:18,728
Also at that time, you were acting
as his defense attorney,

4
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:21,647
making this a highly disgraceful
and unethical act.

5
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:36,579
Still, knowing the man was married,

6
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:39,665
the defendant engaged

7
00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:41,459
in an inappropriate relationship

8
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:44,003
to fulfill her own desires.

9
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:50,259
What were your thoughts
on his wife at that time,

10
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:52,011
Kanon Minamoto?

11
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:54,513
Are you married?

12
00:00:55,765 --> 00:00:57,016
I thought so.

13
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:02,938
I despised her.

14
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:09,069
I swore to myself

15
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:13,032
that I didn't want
to become like that woman.

16
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,464
Mom, are you done yet?

17
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,843
Just a little longer, okay?

18
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:49,401
-Is this Shiro-chan?
-Shiro-chan.

19
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:51,904
-Then this one is Toto-chan!
-Yeah.

20
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:55,741
Toto-chan! So cute!
Let's put some lipstick on!

21
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,493
Yeah, let's do lipstick!

22
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:58,953
Yeah!

23
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,081
Hey! I bought cake!

24
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:03,457
Wow!

25
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:04,750
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

26
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:06,585
It’s full of strawberries.
Your guys' favorite!

27
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:09,463
-Many strawberries?
-Yeah!

28
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:48,669
Excuse me.

29
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:50,838
Sorry to intrude.

30
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:09,481
These were found
on Okutaro Nada’s computer.

31
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:11,567
Was he the one who took these?

32
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:16,655
Yes…

33
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,326
Why would he take photos like these?

34
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,580
Yoko…

35
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:27,666
often asked me to help around the house…

36
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,231
I thought I was dreaming.

37
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:17,109
Professor…

38
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:25,075
That’s the photo he took that day.

39
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:46,055
You couldn’t refuse?

40
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:52,061
So…

41
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:54,938
you held a grudge against him?

42
00:05:56,023 --> 00:06:00,027
Even if I did, I would never kill him!

43
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,363
As I asked before…

44
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:05,783
when did you last see him?

45
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:09,286
The day of Kajin Sensei’s lecture.

46
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,998
Two weeks ago.

47
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,669
The day he died,

48
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:19,463
your husband went to his home

49
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:22,257
to retrieve your wedding ring.

50
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:23,675
Is it possible

51
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,220
he saw this photo?

52
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,266
If he saw it,
he wouldn’t have stayed silent.

53
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,896
Please!

54
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:40,150
Don’t tell Iteya…

55
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,598
That night…

56
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,728
was a one-time mistake…

57
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,441
But…

58
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:26,655
It’d be a lie to say

59
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:29,116
I never want to see him again.

60
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:04,693
Excuse me.

61
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:05,819
Oh…

62
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,254
It might be unfair to say this

63
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,423
after he's dead, but…

64
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:31,678
Professor Nada was
really popular at school.

65
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,935
And yet, you accused him on social media.

66
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,939
It then became an issue.

67
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,610
Honestly, I never planned

68
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,570
to go that far.

69
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:51,531
Then why?

70
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,535
I spoke to Coach Minamoto.

71
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:56,745
What?

72
00:08:56,828 --> 00:09:00,916
He said staying silent out of deference
to Professor Nada wasn’t right,

73
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,710
that I should speak out
instead of keeping it inside.

74
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:08,423
Ms. Eto.

75
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,018
You'd better get ready.
Practice is about to start.

76
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:22,729
Yes.

77
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,024
Excuse me.

78
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:33,490
Lawyer…

79
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,160
did I do something again?

80
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:48,797
This is for you.

81
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:55,971
You came all this way for this?

82
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,435
You could’ve thrown it away.
I gave it to you anyway.

83
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,317
I wasn’t thinking straight.

84
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,324
That kind of thing…

85
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,287
it won’t ever happen again.

86
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,168
That’s all I wanted to say.

87
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,256
If anything comes up again,

88
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:34,384
ask another lawyer.

89
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,358
I still can't…

90
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,694
accept his death.

91
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:59,951
While he was alive,
Nada often used to say…

92
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:12,881
"No matter what happens,

93
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:16,718
I want you to keep shining."

94
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,227
You want wealth and fame too?

95
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,646
What a greedy woman.

96
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:43,078
I must now honor

97
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,497
my late husband’s wishes

98
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:49,292
-and move forward alone.
-She’s incredible, huh?

99
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,711
Her husband just died.

100
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:56,341
Who do you think did it, Kanon?

101
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:58,385
Who do you think…

102
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,430
did us a favor and killed Dad?

103
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,473
What?

104
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,143
Kidding.

105
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,647
Maybe it was me…

106
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,413
Can we make this quick?

107
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,999
I’ve booked individual practice time.

108
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:35,547
You visited Mr. Nada’s house that day

109
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:39,050
to retrieve your wife’s wedding ring,

110
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:40,177
correct?

111
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:43,972
-Yes.
-Was there anything else

112
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,892
among his belongings involving your wife

113
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,311
that could’ve caused trouble?

114
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:52,314
Something that could've caused trouble?

115
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:54,900
Anything so damaging that

116
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,277
you’d want it erased

117
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,070
from existence.

118
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:04,701
Even if there was…

119
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,788
that man no longer exists.

120
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,711
Let’s overhaul our strategy

121
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,672
for the appeal.

122
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,801
We'll argue the accusations

123
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:24,221
are simply false.

124
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,015
Argue them as false?

125
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,937
We'll claim the trucks
were not transporting soil

126
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,772
but rock debris instead

127
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:37,108
that was excavated during construction.

128
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,277
Under the current soil contamination law,

129
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:41,488
"soil" has no legal definition.

130
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:45,575
If this backfires,

131
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,662
the company will be accused of deception.

132
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,248
This is something that can be settled
with a ¥200,000 fine.

133
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,792
We shouldn't adopt a strategy
that could also destroy

134
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,085
the company’s reputation.

135
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,589
At this rate,
we can only settle for a reduced sentence.

136
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:04,844
True, this strategy exploits
a legal loophole.

137
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:07,931
This is a strategy worth trying

138
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,183
if we want to overturn the verdict.

139
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:20,819
Yes!

140
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:29,661
Yes?

141
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,458
That strategy…

142
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,711
it wasn’t in the materials

143
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,213
you sent to me or the director.

144
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:41,756
Was it not?

145
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,925
So you had it planned from the start?

146
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:46,636
This case was mine from the beginning.

147
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:52,225
You played your cards well.
You even convinced Mr. Choga.

148
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:55,478
To honor my brilliant kouhai,

149
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:58,356
let me buy you a drink tonight.

150
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,526
-No, thank you.
-Come on!

151
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:05,780
We’ll be working as a team now.

152
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:08,700
Let’s try to meet…

153
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:11,077
halfway, okay?

154
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,706
Hit on me and I'll leave.

155
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,875
No objection. See you later.

156
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,767
KANON
CALL

157
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:47,781
LAWYER

158
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,637
Let’s be off, shall we?

159
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,597
Hey.

160
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:14,432
Sorry, I didn’t mean to.

161
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,188
It’s been a while since I came here.

162
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:26,277
I've decided to only come here with you.

163
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,907
Didn’t I say that was off-limits?

164
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,701
You’re engaged.

165
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,746
It’s a marriage to gain social trust.

166
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:40,917
You and I, we’re the same.

167
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:47,173
Are you serious?

168
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:51,094
All we want is a physical connection.

169
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:54,472
If we expect nothing, no one gets hurt.

170
00:16:57,142 --> 00:17:00,395
That argument sounded rehearsed.

171
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:03,273
I wrote and rewrote it.

172
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,195
Okay, let's do this.

173
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:13,408
Let’s make tonight the last time.
What do you say?

174
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,327
What do you mean?

175
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:19,497
I guess no…

176
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,422
-Okay, let's do this.
-What?

177
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:29,716
At a later date…

178
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,177
Then you…

179
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,388
-Is it okay?
-Yeah…

180
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,891
Staying over?

181
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,976
-Go home alone…
-Oh?

182
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,895
Aren't you a little cold?

183
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:44,939
-Good work.
-Good work.

184
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,692
-Get home safe.
-Okay.

185
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,067
YURI
SIS, MOM'S BIRTHDAY IS THIS SATURDAY

186
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,860
Saturday…

187
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,158
I totally forgot.

188
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,954
I HAVE WORK. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN GO

189
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:44,624
I MADE RESERVATIONS AT 12:00 P.M.
YOU MUST COME

190
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,881
Seeing my family

191
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:56,094
weighs heavier on me
than any courtroom battle

192
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,012
I have to win.

193
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,643
INCOMING CALL

194
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,113
Hello?

195
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:17,448
Lawyer?

196
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,202
It’s me.

197
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,875
How did you get my number?

198
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:30,879
It was on the card you gave me.

199
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,053
If this is about legal help,

200
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:41,014
-I told you to find--
-I wanted to see you.

201
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:49,355
I don’t think I can pretend
nothing ever happened.

202
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,328
Me either…

203
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:05,788
What?

204
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:34,359
RESTAURANT LOCATION

205
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,586
Why are you here?

206
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,801
I had a feeling I might find you here.

207
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,546
Once I hear the reason, I’ll go home.

208
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,800
You looked lonely.

209
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:47,265
Did something happen?

210
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,481
Did you wash your hands? You sure?

211
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:57,859
Wipe your hands with the wet towel.

212
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,360
Sis!

213
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,031
Who's this?

214
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:06,993
Nice to meet you. I'm Iteya Minamoto.

215
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,830
Oh, sit down.

216
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,249
Excuse me!

217
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:17,670
Shuhei said

218
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:20,339
he's sorry he couldn't join
the celebration today.

219
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,467
Shuhei's been promoted

220
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,385
again recently.

221
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:25,470
Don't worry about it.

222
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:27,555
Shuhei said
he’s really grateful to you, Yuri,

223
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:30,433
for handling everything at home
and taking good care of Shu.

224
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,143
That's what Shuhei said.

225
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:35,396
Yuri not only married someone
from a top firm

226
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,565
but endured fertility treatments

227
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:41,611
and gave us an adorable grandchild.

228
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:48,242
It’s from the club.

229
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,579
Excuse me. Hello?

230
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:56,000
I thought Mr. Minamoto was your boyfriend.

231
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:57,835
With someone that young,

232
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,046
Ayame will just look older.

233
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,676
Still dead weight, huh?

234
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:08,846
Can we drop it already?

235
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,807
Right? I’m sure

236
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,143
Sis makes more than Shuhei.

237
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:16,354
It’s nothing to brag about.

238
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:20,066
Some women work,

239
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:23,277
marry, and raise kids.

240
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:28,658
You’ve always been so capable alone.

241
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,160
But marriage can’t be done solo.

242
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:36,666
If you’ve never married,

243
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:39,710
it just means no one picked you.

244
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:41,170
Right, honey?

245
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:46,050
Ayame’s too strong-willed.

246
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:47,885
If she were sweeter,

247
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,680
someone would’ve snatched her up.

248
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:03,025
This is bullshit.

249
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:12,869
Let’s go.

250
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:28,551
Where are you going?

251
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,595
Somewhere you guys aren’t.

252
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:57,622
Does it look good on me?

253
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:06,255
I'll buy them, okay?

254
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:08,674
What? It’s fine.

255
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:10,301
What…

256
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,012
As a memento.

257
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:26,150
How far are we going?

258
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:27,485
Just a bit more.

259
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,111
Just a bit more?

260
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:31,197
Oh, that’s cold!

261
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:35,910
I got wet!

262
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:36,994
-Am I wet?
-You're wet!

263
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,923
Hold it here.

264
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:51,425
Like this?

265
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:53,678
Recover and lunge.

266
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:56,222
Advance, advance…

267
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,558
-Advance.
-Right.

268
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:01,560
Lunge.

269
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:06,857
Aren’t you embarrassed

270
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:09,068
to be seen with me?

271
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:10,987
Why would I be?

272
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:14,156
I’m older than you.

273
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,411
And still this cute?

274
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:21,914
Don’t tease me.

275
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:28,879
When a kouhai fencer

276
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,465
won’t listen,

277
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:33,092
you know what I do?

278
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:36,929
What?

279
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:46,230
I love you.

280
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,279
That usually gets them to behave.

281
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:57,992
What the heck?

282
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:22,892
Thanks…

283
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:25,853
for hanging out today.

284
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,106
I'd be happy to help anytime.

285
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,528
Well…

286
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:38,157
Good night.

287
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:44,663
Good night.

288
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:24,430
Are you seeing anyone?

289
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:30,227
I’m not good at relationships.
They don’t last.

290
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:33,314
Why not?

291
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:38,110
I guess I just don’t have the talent.

292
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:45,409
Things start off well.

293
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,870
But…

294
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:50,956
I lose my way

295
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,250
and don't know what to do.

296
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:55,920
Then, it just fizzles out.

297
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,089
They end them?

298
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:05,262
It’s vague from the start
and ends just as vaguely.

299
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,808
Sometimes, we even meet up again.

300
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,813
To sleep together?

301
00:30:18,943 --> 00:30:21,028
It’s just easier that way.

302
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:29,286
You have someone like that
at your firm too?

303
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:37,795
It’s someone you don’t know.

304
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:53,644
You're so cute!

305
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:07,825
Care to join me, if you don’t mind?

306
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:10,578
Is it okay?

307
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,205
Please.

308
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:20,921
Sorry for what my aunt did the other day.

309
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:22,548
It’s all right.

310
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,635
I couldn’t help but notice.

311
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,098
Are you seeing Iteya?

312
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:40,190
I wonder what Kanon would think
if she found out.

313
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:44,028
Is that a threat?

314
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:45,613
Seriously?

315
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:47,990
I'm not stupid enough
to threaten a lawyer.

316
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:49,992
But…

317
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:53,704
Iteya and Kanon won't split up.

318
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,292
That's because they're special.

319
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:02,755
Mom was probably jealous.

320
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,716
You mean Yoko?

321
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,888
You’ve figured it out, haven’t you?

322
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:12,765
What my parents…

323
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,141
are really like.

324
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:19,355
Dad was in love with someone else.

325
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,815
Mom wept over him

326
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:25,110
because she pities herself
for not being loved by him.

327
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:27,780
Still…

328
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,657
she twisted their past

329
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,117
into some fairy-tale romance
and showed it to the world.

330
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:35,162
It’s beyond creepy.

331
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:36,705
It’s hilarious.

332
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,210
Um…

333
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,629
But maybe the biggest freak…

334
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:47,966
is me…

335
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,677
the one who was raised by them.

336
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,730
Sorry to trouble you to come in.

337
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:04,191
Have you identified the culprit?

338
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:12,366
Do you know

339
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:14,034
who took these photos?

340
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:15,828
No…

341
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:18,580
They were taken by Mr. Nada, the deceased.

342
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:21,834
What?

343
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:25,796
Let me ask again.

344
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:29,508
Someone saw you and Mr. Nada fighting.

345
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:32,344
Was there some trouble between you?

346
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:37,516
Are you suggesting I harmed my husband?

347
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,976
We’re simply…

348
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,478
confirming the facts.

349
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:49,445
As a writer,
I’ve already reached my pinnacle.

350
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:52,281
I must be a disgrace to you.

351
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,284
Unless I’m dressed up

352
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,703
as a "supportive husband",

353
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,414
I’ll ruin your campaign.

354
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:02,666
That’s not true!

355
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:06,879
You could have married anyone.

356
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:08,797
It didn't have to be me,

357
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:11,383
as long as he could have
granted you the title

358
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:13,635
"wife of a prominent man".

359
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:20,392
As a married couple,

360
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:22,394
we argued at times.

361
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,565
But it was always
to better understand each other.

362
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:28,609
Isn’t that only natural?

363
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:34,698
Attacked?

364
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:37,534
It seemed Konno Sensei
was suddenly attacked.

365
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:39,995
A passerby

366
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,330
called an ambulance,

367
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,207
and he got treated at the hospital.

368
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,083
Does he know who did it?

369
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:47,961
He doesn't know.
Even the police and his lawyer asked

370
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:50,631
if he had any idea, but he didn’t.

371
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:10,776
Are you okay?

372
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,444
It hurts.

373
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:18,033
Do you think you know who attacked you?

374
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:21,245
I know too many who’d want to.

375
00:35:22,246 --> 00:35:23,914
Any clues?

376
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:25,040
Like any distinct features?

377
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,336
It was a man.

378
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:31,463
Oh, and…

379
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,675
he had a snowman keychain

380
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:36,969
I see.

381
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:40,264
Water…

382
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:42,724
-I hope they catch him soon.
-Yeah.

383
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:50,774
ITEYA MINAMOTO
CAN WE MEET TODAY?

384
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,403
What's wrong?

385
00:35:56,572 --> 00:35:57,614
Take care.

386
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:22,264
Welcome back.

387
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,141
I’m home.

388
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:43,493
-Are you snacking?
-Yeah.

389
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:45,120
It's delicious!

390
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,847
-Not yet?
-What?

391
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:10,312
-Let's take a break.
-I still have to do…

392
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:15,108
Aren't your eyes tired? Tired?

393
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:21,823
Geez…

394
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:29,206
INCOMING CALL
KANON

395
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:33,126
For the Statement of Reasons for Appeal,
we’ll proceed under Kajin’s guidance.

396
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:36,129
-Understood.
-For the materials, Kajin will…

397
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:38,715
Kajin?

398
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:40,300
The materials?

399
00:37:47,975 --> 00:37:49,726
My apologies.

400
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:53,438
I’ll be sure to submit them next time.

401
00:37:55,816 --> 00:37:57,150
I'm sorry.

402
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,917
I only brought you back to the team

403
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:17,337
because I believed
you were worth the gamble.

404
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:19,840
I’m sorry.

405
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:22,676
I’ll make sure everything is ready
for the next meeting.

406
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:26,555
Mr. Choga let the mistake slide this time.

407
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,432
Not only that,

408
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:30,767
he’s even invited both of you to dinner.

409
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:34,813
-Of course, you’ll be attending, right?
-Yes.

410
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:36,815
Tonight?

411
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:39,234
You’re the one who made the mistake.

412
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:42,487
It’s only polite that you go
and apologize properly.

413
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:44,948
Konno, a word?

414
00:38:45,032 --> 00:38:46,116
Yes, sir.

415
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,793
ITEYA MINAMOTO
BACK FROM NAGANO

416
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:09,931
I THOUGHT TRAINING CAMP
LASTED THROUGH TOMORROW?

417
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:12,184
I WANTED TO SEE YOU SOONER

418
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:21,860
SORRY. I'VE GOT A DINNER MEETING TONIGHT

419
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:24,780
EVEN THOUGH I CAME BACK EARLY?

420
00:39:30,494 --> 00:39:33,413
PLEASE WAIT AT HOME.
I'LL BE BACK BY 10:00 P.M.

421
00:39:33,497 --> 00:39:35,665
I'LL BE WAITING

422
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:08,365
Is this place really okay?

423
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,117
Yeah, it's fine.

424
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,368
Thank you.

425
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,915
We’ve heard the Choga Group’s rapid growth

426
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:19,459
is due not only to your father’s legacy

427
00:40:19,543 --> 00:40:23,880
but also to your remarkable leadership.

428
00:40:23,964 --> 00:40:27,717
We’d love to learn more
from you tonight, right?

429
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,471
I also admire
and learned from your generosity

430
00:40:31,555 --> 00:40:35,225
in forgiving my recent mistake.

431
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:38,603
No need to be so formal.
Let’s just enjoy ourselves tonight.

432
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:40,105
Come on!

433
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:41,815
Thank you very much.

434
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:42,751
Hey, it’s not unusual for men to take care
of their nails these days, right?

435
00:41:46,922 --> 00:41:49,883
Right.
I’ve had full-body laser hair removal,

436
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:52,552
my teeth whitened, and I have
a lash lift booked for next week.

437
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,014
What about you, Ms. Kinbara?

438
00:41:57,766 --> 00:41:59,267
What about you, Ms. Kinbara?

439
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:03,104
-Ms. Kinbara?
-Okutaro Nada's nail.

440
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:05,565
Only this nail was unkempt.

441
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:08,860
Would that be a fashion choice?

442
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:12,989
The other nine were perfectly done?

443
00:42:13,073 --> 00:42:15,158
Never seen that trend around me.

444
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,495
You should do it.

445
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:23,667
Thank you for waiting.

446
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,152
When you touch me like this…

447
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:54,114
it brings back memories.

448
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:58,994
What kind of memories…

449
00:42:59,703 --> 00:43:00,954
Professor?

450
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:13,967
So alike…

451
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:16,511
it's almost annoying.

452
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:45,457
Even when there's trouble,

453
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,917
the capable ones just get it done.

454
00:43:48,001 --> 00:43:49,586
Mr. Choga, we wouldn’t want this

455
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:52,881
to affect tomorrow’s work,
so perhaps we should…

456
00:43:53,465 --> 00:43:55,550
Don’t worry about me.

457
00:43:56,343 --> 00:43:58,845
I heard you can hold your liquor.

458
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:00,680
Come on! No need to hesitate!

459
00:44:00,764 --> 00:44:03,433
-May I have some then?
-Yeah.

460
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,145
By the way…

461
00:44:19,074 --> 00:44:20,992
Sorry I'm late.

462
00:44:21,076 --> 00:44:23,453
I wanted to come back earlier,

463
00:44:24,037 --> 00:44:26,331
but the dinner just wouldn't end…

464
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:33,713
Were you being a good boy?

465
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:14,712
Answer me!

466
00:45:54,544 --> 00:45:56,671
He had a snowman keychain.

467
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,930
LAWYER

468
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:12,270
Hey.

469
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:55,146
I wanted to see you.

470
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:42,735
Hey, Sensei, do you think I'm an idiot?

471
00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:46,030
PREVIEW

472
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:50,451
-I love you.
-Why, Iteya?

473
00:47:51,995 --> 00:47:54,205
You're treating me like an idiot again!
