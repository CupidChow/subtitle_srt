1
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,293
All rise.

2
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:42,144
We now begin trial no. 604
of the year 2025.

3
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:46,232
This is a homicide case.

4
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:49,860
Defense counsel.

5
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:59,203
The defendant, Ayame Kajin,
pleads not guilty to murder.

6
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:11,048
Why did I commit…

7
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,928
that crime in the first place?

8
00:03:00,306 --> 00:03:03,684
Many people suffering from spousal abuse

9
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,394
have come forward.

10
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:11,775
It affects both the victim's health
and all aspects of their daily life.

11
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,528
According to the National Police Agency,

12
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:17,615
88,619 requests were made

13
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,326
for domestic violence counseling
last year.

14
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,537
Of those requests,

15
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,540
about 72% came from women.

16
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,168
If a wife feels her life is in danger

17
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:33,756
and kills her husband, is it self-defense?

18
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:36,759
Sorry, I know it's
a rather alarming question.

19
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,429
As lawyers,

20
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,098
we usually argue self-defense.

21
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,727
However, in most cases,

22
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,939
the action taken as self-defense
is deemed excessive,

23
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,275
and the charge of murder is upheld.

24
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,655
If it can be proven
there was no intent to kill,

25
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:00,491
it might be treated
as bodily injury resulting in death.

26
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,078
Still, unfortunately,

27
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:07,206
it's believed that
acquittals are extremely rare.

28
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,883
All it takes is one person.

29
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:22,638
Find someone besides your husband
to be your ally and ask for help.

30
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:29,812
You're like a frog, already half-boiled
in a pot of hot water.

31
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:32,898
Jump out

32
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,526
before you're fully cooked.

33
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:53,002
It's best to leave an abusive husband
as soon as possible.

34
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:04,054
So that’s what you believe, Sensei?

35
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,017
Yes. Is there a problem?

36
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,520
Are you married?

37
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,735
-No.
-I thought so.

38
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,157
No matter how good
you think your husband is,

39
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:27,619
once he hits you,
the marriage begins to fall apart.

40
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:31,165
I’ve seen countless cases like that
as a lawyer.

41
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:32,791
Because I love him.

42
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,127
Huh?

43
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:43,552
You wouldn’t understand, Sensei.

44
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:51,602
No one can understand it unless
they’ve experienced it for themself.

45
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,447
Kajin Sensei,
thank you for your hard work.

46
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:07,951
Nagisa, you didn’t have
to come all the way here.

47
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,912
I didn’t come to hear the frog story.

48
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:13,165
I came to see Yoko Mogami.

49
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:14,917
You know,

50
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:18,629
she’s been gathering people,
aiming for political office.

51
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,757
You might even be recruited yourself.

52
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,426
She might ask you to join the team.

53
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,886
No…

54
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:31,016
Thank you again today, Kajin.
I think it was very insightful.

55
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,561
It’s my pleasure.
It was an honor to be invited by you.

56
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:37,356
Do you still have time?

57
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,274
Of course.

58
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,820
NADA
MOGAMI

59
00:06:56,333 --> 00:07:00,170
Yoko Mogami,
head of a major cosmetics brand

60
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,340
and entrepreneur who launched MY Queen.

61
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,390
The last time you saw Nada
was when you were a student?

62
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:12,808
Yes.

63
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,936
I'm honored that he remembered me,

64
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,856
even though I only attended a few classes.

65
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,696
That person…

66
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,200
Kanon.

67
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,412
How do you know her?

68
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,754
Her partner was
in the same class as my son, Jun.

69
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,799
He had no family in high school,

70
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,595
so I invited him to stay
in our guest house.

71
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,515
Now they’re married
and still live there together.

72
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:56,935
As a married couple?

73
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,939
She's a manicurist.

74
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,483
She even works at my salon.

75
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:08,572
Are you interested in her, Kajin?

76
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,325
No, not like that…

77
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,455
Honey, Kajin is here.

78
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:19,791
Huh?

79
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,046
Director, may I have a word?

80
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,050
-I'll be right back. Please wait.
-Yes.

81
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:17,766
Who's there?

82
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,022
Long time no see. It’s Kajin.

83
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:26,942
Kajin-kun?

84
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,113
I’ve heard about you from my wife.

85
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,535
Sounds like
you were dragged out here today.

86
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:43,083
Professor Nada, you seem well.

87
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,335
I spend my time
at the university and here.

88
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,213
The rest is freedom.

89
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,094
Okutaro Nada.

90
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,682
His debut book written in his 20s
became a bestseller,

91
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,643
marking his brilliant literary debut.

92
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:07,190
But he rarely appears
in public these days.

93
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,070
Professor.

94
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,742
Oh, Kanon, you’re here too, huh?

95
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:20,746
Iteya's students have an away game today,

96
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,748
so I snuck over.

97
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,292
I bet Iteya doesn’t want to see us.

98
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:30,047
He might worry
we’d show his wife the "real" world.

99
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:33,300
Oh, Professor…

100
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,388
Here you go, Sensei.

101
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,390
Thank you.

102
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,143
-Professor?
-Yeah?

103
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:47,147
Isn’t she beautiful?

104
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:51,318
But I don’t get why she’s still single.

105
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:56,323
There probably isn’t a man
who couldn't satisfy Kajin-kun.

106
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:03,038
I guess I’m not good at respecting men.

107
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:07,167
Or maybe you’re just honest
about your desires.

108
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,002
Sorry?

109
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:13,256
Desire often means wanting
what belongs to others.

110
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:19,471
Once someone becomes your spouse,
they lose their charm.

111
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:23,767
-It’s understandable.
-So, you feel the same?

112
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,354
Oops. Was that too far?

113
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,273
Age makes me say whatever I think!

114
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,860
That's not good, Professor!

115
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,706
Professor Nada
was actually married once before.

116
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,211
What? No way.

117
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:56,133
His ex-wife went abroad by herself
after the divorce.

118
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,009
She passed away.

119
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,555
How do you know that?

120
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,017
The professor told me. Just me, in secret.

121
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:12,566
You're bound by confidentiality, right?

122
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:15,986
Keep it secret, Kajin Sensei.

123
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:28,707
If I get reborn someday,
I’d love to be someone like you.

124
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,461
You want to be a lawyer?

125
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:34,838
Not that.

126
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:39,384
Your style and the way you live…

127
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,803
It’s cool.

128
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,695
If you ever need anything, contact me.

129
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:03,783
ATTORNEY AYAME KAJIN

130
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:08,830
Excuse me, Sensei!

131
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,167
Hold on.

132
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:17,380
These are from our garden.
Please take them.

133
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:21,176
-I don’t really cook.
-Just wash them and make a salad.

134
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:28,558
I'll be going.

135
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,980
AWARD

136
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:49,663
-I didn’t say you could come in.
-Oh, don’t be like that.

137
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:54,000
I was hoping to see Ayame Kajin Sensei.

138
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,252
You’re drunk.

139
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:59,214
Just a bit. I drank at a social gathering.

140
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:03,468
Hey, I wanted to ask.

141
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,013
Want to go grab a drink?

142
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:10,392
Also…

143
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,478
What happened to your very young fiancée?

144
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,858
She went to study abroad in London
but hasn’t come back yet.

145
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:21,152
You think she really wants to marry me?

146
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:23,488
How would I know?

147
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,370
Come on… One more time…

148
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:36,543
That’s all in the past.
A dark past, in fact.

149
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:41,423
-Leave before I sue you.
-Dark past?

150
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,925
Huh?

151
00:14:58,148 --> 00:14:59,274
Yes?

152
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,486
Thanks for your hard work.

153
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:08,283
Was today's request from Yoko Mogami?

154
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:11,703
Yes. I think I did well.

155
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,790
Director? Is something wrong?

156
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:19,336
It’s about the lawsuit
against Choga Construction.

157
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,338
I was just preparing
for next week’s meeting.

158
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,299
Actually, Konno will be joining
that meeting too.

159
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,259
What?

160
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:30,055
Mr. Choga dropped in
with an urgent matter.

161
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:35,101
Konno gave him
a great proposal in your place.

162
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,980
Apparently, he felt more at ease
with a male lawyer.

163
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,859
But I was entrusted

164
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,403
-with that case alone--
-But you weren’t here.

165
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,531
You took on another job
without permission.

166
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,037
So just the next meeting then?

167
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,334
No. Konno will handle the lawsuit
from here on. You’ll assist him.

168
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:03,672
-What?
-Sorry, but I’d like you to step aside.

169
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,174
I'm thinking of giving you another case.

170
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,803
Didn’t mean to interrupt. Later.

171
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:16,893
Right?

172
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,355
-Good thing he didn't see me.
-How did all of this happen?

173
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:25,151
Well, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

174
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,946
You wanted to apologize
for stealing my case?

175
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:32,617
Hey, you weren’t at your desk all day
because of a personal errand.

176
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:35,078
I was covering for you.

177
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,039
It wasn’t personal.

178
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,962
Firms like ours value

179
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:47,215
corporate clients over private ones.

180
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:52,554
So you stole my case
and figured you’d get lucky too?

181
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,974
Come on, I was just joking. That’s harsh.

182
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,186
Get out.

183
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,613
Put the Choga Construction case files

184
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,366
in the shared folder.

185
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,804
HIRING ATTORNEYS

186
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,558
Should I go independent?

187
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,437
INCOMING CALL

188
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,241
Hello?

189
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,118
Sensei… help me…

190
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:45,041
It’s Kanon… from today…

191
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:48,628
What’s wrong?

192
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,338
ATTORNEY AYAME KAJIN

193
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:52,674
It’s him…

194
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:59,681
Kanon?! Hello?! Can you hear me?!

195
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,767
Get out of there!

196
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,020
Go to the Minato Season Terrace!

197
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:38,845
Are you the lawyer?

198
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:48,855
You're… Kanon's husband?

199
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:51,774
Yes.

200
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:56,279
-Where is she?
-My wife is not coming.

201
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,872
She asked me for help.

202
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,167
Oh.

203
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:14,088
She was drunk and overreacted,

204
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,424
so I’m here to apologize.

205
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:26,601
You’re bleeding.

206
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:32,649
I get hurt a lot.

207
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:38,071
Well then…

208
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:42,742
Wait.

209
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:45,328
Move!

210
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:13,856
Are you okay?

211
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,508
Don’t worry about Kanon.

212
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,553
I’m sorry.

213
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:49,642
Shall I escort you home?

214
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:56,816
No, thank you.

215
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:01,696
Well then…

216
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:28,598
I’m home.

217
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,535
Iteya…

218
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,163
I’m sorry…

219
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:08,096
It’s okay now.

220
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:12,683
No one can understand us

221
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,313
except ourselves.

222
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:30,201
Yeah. Only us.

223
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:35,873
Even in death…

224
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,711
I won’t betray you.

225
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:19,876
ATTORNEY AYAME KAJIN

226
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:46,777
Hello?

227
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:47,904
Kajin Sensei.

228
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:50,615
It's Kanon.

229
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,202
Kanon? Why did you call earlier?

230
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:57,496
I was drunk. I’m sorry…

231
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:01,209
-So… you’re really okay now?
-Yes…

232
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,753
Sorry to bother you.

233
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:08,174
If something happens again…

234
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:28,611
Are you okay?

235
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:54,011
What a disaster…

236
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:58,266
-Damn it!
-Please, calm down.

237
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,518
Easy for you to say!

238
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:07,984
You're attracting attention from the media
and putting me in the spotlight too!

239
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:11,237
I’m going to die because of your ambition!

240
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:17,076
It’s over for me…

241
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:31,173
Professor Nada was accused
of sexual harassment?

242
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:34,176
Some students said

243
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:38,431
they felt sexually shamed
during his classes and posted that online.

244
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:41,392
Their posts were twisted out of context.

245
00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:44,478
The school has to take it seriously.

246
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,190
What action has been taken
against the professor?

247
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:53,446
The disciplinary board will decide that.

248
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:59,160
If he’s punished,
it’ll be all over the news.

249
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:01,912
We must act quickly.

250
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:09,962
You’re the only one he can ask for help,
since you're his former student.

251
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:13,049
We’ll reward you properly.

252
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,678
Kajin, will you help us?

253
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:25,519
Understood.

254
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:30,107
I’ll ask the school
for a meeting with the students.

255
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:32,276
Thank you.

256
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:35,863
It's good to have a talented student,
isn't it?

257
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:19,740
See something interesting?

258
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:25,996
Why are you here?

259
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:29,667
I don't have work till later today.

260
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:39,260
Strange question though.

261
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:41,846
I live here.

262
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:51,230
Is your wife… okay?

263
00:28:55,693 --> 00:28:57,570
I was worried about the call
from the other day.

264
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:02,408
If it's about that, she did apologize…

265
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:07,997
-Yes, she said she was drunk.
-But you're still worried?

266
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:22,970
I understand the feeling
of wanting to talk to you.

267
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:27,308
Don’t tease someone older than you.

268
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,482
Are you always angry like that?

269
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:41,947
Smile more.

270
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:54,460
You said you liked this place?

271
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:59,840
After my father passed,

272
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:04,887
it was trashed.
I told Yoko I’d fix it myself.

273
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:07,640
She wasn’t thrilled with that idea.

274
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:15,856
What? Sunny, I told you not to come here!

275
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,777
You’ll get scolded again.

276
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:22,947
Sunny! Sunny!

277
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,742
He really likes you.

278
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:32,748
Dogs love me. People don’t.

279
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,502
I said no!

280
00:30:38,212 --> 00:30:39,421
Same here.

281
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:55,396
I want to see…

282
00:30:57,398 --> 00:30:59,066
a different side of you.

283
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:01,485
Huh?

284
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:13,557
Look. Does this make you feel better?

285
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:22,316
Not really.
Not with something so childish.

286
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:55,140
-Oh, I’m fine…
-You'll catch a cold.

287
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:00,729
Thank you.

288
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:07,403
Kajin? What are you doing here?

289
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:10,739
Oh, I… uh…

290
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:16,620
Excuse me.

291
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,376
Do you need something from me?

292
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,338
Where’s Sunny?

293
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:30,259
He was just here. Didn’t he go back?

294
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:35,055
-Please don’t let him get too attached.
-He came to me on his own.

295
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:38,976
I guess it’s too stifling on your side.

296
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:52,573
"She ran toward me, gasping for breath,

297
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:55,659
her large, barrel-like breasts
bouncing heavily…"

298
00:33:57,244 --> 00:34:01,749
This passage is from Shadowless
by Professor Nada,

299
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:06,545
a groundbreaking voice
in modern Japanese literature.

300
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:14,261
You claim that during class, he said,

301
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:19,600
"There may even be a barrel-breasted girl
like her among you",

302
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,395
and you're stating that it constitutes
sexual harassment, correct?

303
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:25,272
Just because he’s a famous author,

304
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:29,109
do we have to tolerate being called
"barrel-breasted" during a lecture?

305
00:34:29,193 --> 00:34:34,448
Girls with bigger chests
felt singled out. It was upsetting…

306
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:37,159
Honestly, I hated it.

307
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,747
Regardless of fame,

308
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,417
such remarks are unacceptable
if directed at a specific student.

309
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:50,589
But did he actually single anyone out?

310
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:54,510
No… not exactly…

311
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:00,349
Even as a literary expression,

312
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:04,853
I understand how those words

313
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:08,315
can be jarring

314
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:10,192
by today’s standards.

315
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:15,531
But exposing something

316
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:19,785
that out of context could be
misinterpreted by countless people,

317
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,621
is that truly fair?

318
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:30,462
If you truly want to fight,

319
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:33,298
bring your concerns to the school first.

320
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:37,177
As a graduate of this school,

321
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,932
I want to help you do that.

322
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:49,857
So your strategy was to portray me
as an outdated, sleazy old man?

323
00:35:50,858 --> 00:35:54,486
"Barrel-breasted" was an offhand remark

324
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,822
during a discussion on art.

325
00:35:58,115 --> 00:36:01,660
But they're from a newer generation
and live by today’s values,

326
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:04,288
different from yours.

327
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:10,419
To win, we needed to admit fault first
and show our weakness.

328
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,339
Thanks to my perfect and wonderful wife,

329
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,593
I’ve always lived under public scrutiny.

330
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:21,388
Isn’t this a bit much, even for me?

331
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:26,351
You understand their concerns, don’t you?

332
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:30,772
Then you should explain yourself
and apologize.

333
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,443
You’re right.

334
00:36:35,903 --> 00:36:38,238
We avoided the disciplinary board.

335
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:40,449
Starting with this issue at hand,

336
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:43,535
they’ll arrange an opportunity
for an open dialogue

337
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:45,746
between the professor and the students.

338
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:50,292
Then things may head toward a resolution.

339
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:54,630
Thank you, Kajin.
Send the invoice to my office.

340
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,173
We’ll transfer the payment immediately.

341
00:36:56,256 --> 00:37:00,010
-Let’s go.
-Yoko, may I have a word with you?

342
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:05,265
You saved me. Thank you, Kajin-kun.

343
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:14,066
I heard you plan to enter politics.

344
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:18,987
Could I join your team?

345
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:21,448
You?

346
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:25,077
-Why?
-I can

347
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,371
deliver results beyond the expectations.

348
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:31,041
Please, let me work with you.

349
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:40,258
I thought you had more common sense.

350
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,641
You wouldn’t fit in

351
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:52,729
because you and I live
in completely different worlds.

352
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:55,482
Well then, goodbye.

353
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:22,944
-Welcome home!
-I’m back.

354
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,614
I’m so happy you’re back, Jun.

355
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:32,996
-Where’s Iteya?
-He’s fine. He’s teaching a night class.

356
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:42,672
Measure your distance.

357
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:44,257
Yes. Step forward smoothly.

358
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,218
Feint… that’s it.

359
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:50,472
Step forward!

360
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,812
-Thank you so much!
-Thank you so much!

361
00:39:56,895 --> 00:40:00,607
Don’t let your opponent predict
your actions. Read their thoughts.

362
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,943
-Yes.
-Okay, one more time.

363
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:06,905
Ayame Kajin…

364
00:40:07,948 --> 00:40:10,325
She delivered, didn’t she?

365
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:15,080
Yeah. Just as you said, she’s useful.

366
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:18,250
You must be relieved.

367
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:23,046
You handled things
before your deadweight husband

368
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:26,049
-humiliated you and dragged you down.
-What?

369
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:30,178
I did it to protect your name,
Okutaro Nada.

370
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:33,014
-What about Jun?
-Huh?

371
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,936
I saw his luggage, so I think he's back.

372
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,814
I think he’s meeting friends.

373
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:46,278
Why the sudden return, I wonder?

374
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:50,448
-What's that smell?
-What?

375
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:55,453
It’s the scent you used to praise me…

376
00:40:58,415 --> 00:41:02,169
You remember the dumbest things.

377
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:00,894
You don't fit in

378
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:05,857
because you and I live
in completely different worlds.

379
00:42:37,806 --> 00:42:41,351
I want to see… a different side of you.

Help us!

392
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:34,190
If I hadn’t

393
00:45:35,525 --> 00:45:37,444
taken that hand back then…

394
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,058
Mr. Iteya Minamoto…

395
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:11,478
I’m Ayame Kajin,

396
00:46:12,729 --> 00:46:14,731
your lawyer.

397
00:46:18,485 --> 00:46:20,028
I will…

398
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:24,199
represent you.

399
00:46:27,911 --> 00:46:33,833
Defendant. Why did you commit
such a brutal crime?

400
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:50,433
Because…

401
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,691
I loved him.

402
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:42,944
-Did you kill him?
-Do you really believe me?

403
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:44,696
You killed that man.

404
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:46,447
Are you also treating me as a criminal?

405
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:48,866
There is a witness, so there is no doubt.

406
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:50,994
You killed Okutaro!

407
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:52,328
-No!
-You…

408
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:53,746
fool!
