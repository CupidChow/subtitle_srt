1
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:05,698
On the day of the incident,

2
00:00:05,698 --> 00:00:05,798
On the day of the incident,

3
00:00:06,424 --> 00:00:10,010
you met the victim at the crime scene.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,471
Is that correct?

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,016
Yes.

6
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:19,520
Why were you there together?

7
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,190
He…

8
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:26,902
came to see me.

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,904
For what reason?

10
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,460
Defendant?

11
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:44,253
Defendant, is something wrong?

12
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:49,592
Judge.

13
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:53,846
The defendant is still suffering
from trauma due to the incident.

14
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:56,182
We request a recess until she recovers.

15
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:18,954
<i>Why did it turn out like that?</i>

16
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:22,166
INCOMING CALL
AYAME KAJIN

17
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,133
<i>Ayame!</i>

18
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,094
<i>Sorry about last night.</i>

19
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:37,723
<i>I stayed up all night waiting for you.</i>

20
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:41,393
<i>Don't leave me.</i>

21
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:45,689
Come back!

22
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:51,695
I…

23
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,074
want to talk to you too.

24
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:58,577
<i>Okay. Where can we meet?</i>

25
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,377
Kitaminato Park at 1:00 p.m.

26
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:09,797
<i>Thanks.</i>

27
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:12,716
<i>I’ll be waiting.</i>

28
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:20,766
We’ll have officers standing by
at the location.

29
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:24,103
STATEMENT- THE STATEMENT BELOW
HAS BEEN SUBMITTED BY KANON MINAMOTO

30
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:28,440
I HAVE BEEN ASSAULTED
BY MY HUSBAND SINCE 2025

31
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:30,943
Thank you for your cooperation.

32
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,991
Filing a report took a lot of courage.

33
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:42,913
Thank you.

34
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,166
I’m not doing this for you.

35
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,463
Will you both accompany us to the site?

36
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:53,507
Yes, I’ll go with you.

37
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:55,926
I’ll stay here.

38
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:32,338
Ayame.

39
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,883
Are you Iteya Minamoto?

40
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:40,262
-Hey!
-Hold him!

41
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,765
Hey!

42
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,559
Let me go!

43
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:57,696
Never…

44
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,658
trust anyone but me.

45
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,870
<i>My father was right all along.</i>

46
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:08,332
Arrested for assault?

47
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,918
I think he’s also the one

48
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:12,711
who attacked you.

49
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,094
Why didn’t you tell me?

50
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,180
Sorry.

51
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:25,182
I should’ve said something sooner.

52
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,600
That’s not the point.

53
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:29,937
You’re a victim too.

54
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,073
I should’ve realized it. I'm sorry.

55
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:54,920
How’s the appeal going?

56
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,383
Right now…

57
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,387
it’s 50-50.

58
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,472
So it’s tough?

59
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:08,267
The prosecution’s digging in.

60
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:14,064
It could go either way.
We won’t know until the verdict.

61
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:28,871
What are you going to do now?

62
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,332
You’re starting divorce proceedings,
right?

63
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,213
If you’re worried about money, don’t be.

64
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:40,424
You can manage on your own.

65
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:43,385
You’re a talented manicurist.

66
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,597
Work hard and your income will grow.

67
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:55,939
People who use violence
don’t change so easily.

68
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,235
Get rid of the foolish idea

69
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,072
of getting back together with him.

70
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,495
I’ll try…

71
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:54,641
<i>No regrets</i>

72
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,476
<i>about having him arrested…</i>

73
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:00,606
<i>But…</i>

74
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,276
<i>it still…</i>

75
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:07,196
<i>hurts a little.</i>

76
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,568
Iteya Minamoto
is still refusing to talk, huh?

77
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,904
Tough guy, isn’t he?

78
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,699
Think he’s never gonna admit to the abuse?

79
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:56,411
It’s rare for anyone to admit
to domestic violence so easily.

80
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:57,829
I see…

81
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:00,916
Still… the wife filed the report,

82
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,668
and the mistress convinced her?

83
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,295
What the heck is going on?

84
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:07,631
Ms. Kinbara?

85
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,301
Do you have a moment?

86
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,726
Kajin Sensei.

87
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,148
The other party’s name is incorrect.

88
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:30,237
Sorry. I’ll redo it.

89
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,909
You’re under a lot of stress, aren’t you?

90
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,954
You think so?

91
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,293
You’re really bad at asking for help,
you know?

92
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,462
You bottle everything up.

93
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,341
I feel like I just can’t leave you alone.

94
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,264
You seem to not have friends either…

95
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:01,143
Why don't we go out for a drink sometime?

96
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,647
I'll listen to whatever you need
to get off your chest!

97
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:11,862
Thanks.

98
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:16,033
As for not having friends…

99
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,618
no objection.

100
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:31,673
Hello, this is Kajin.

101
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,468
This is Kinbara
from the Ome Minami Police Department.

102
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,847
It looks like Iteya Minamoto

103
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,475
is going to be released.

104
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,019
What?

105
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,773
Kajin?

106
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:49,941
Where is Iteya Minamoto?

107
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,235
His wife came to pick him up just now.

108
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,530
I assumed

109
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:58,408
you discussed
withdrawing the report with her?

110
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:02,454
Why did Kanon withdraw it?

111
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:07,584
She said
her husband truly regrets what he did.

112
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,838
We tried to talk her out of it,

113
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:15,217
but if the family insists,
we can’t stop them.

114
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,512
Iteya Minamoto will enter

115
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,431
the Domestic Violence
Intervention Program.

116
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:23,642
Hopefully,

117
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,853
it’ll stop him from hurting anyone again.

118
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:33,819
Kanon…

119
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:36,988
Thanks.

120
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,623
How…

121
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,419
did we end up like this?

122
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:04,641
Hey, Kanon, listen.

123
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:12,065
It’s been rough lately,

124
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,235
and I don't know what to do…

125
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,155
I leaned too much on that lawyer.

126
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,907
Please forgive me.

127
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,794
Even married couples

128
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,173
might fall…

129
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,137
for someone else.

130
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,268
But I thought we were special enough

131
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:53,064
to talk…

132
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,443
about those things.

133
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,835
Do you want to divorce me?

134
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,135
I…

135
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:27,724
don’t want to be hit anymore.

136
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:31,978
I swear that I’ll never do it again.

137
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,360
And Kajin Sensei?

138
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,071
What about her?

139
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,789
I lost my mind…

140
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,459
You were the only one for me
from the very beginning…

141
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,549
We had no money or family.

142
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,718
But we survived, just the two of us.

143
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,648
No matter what people say about us,

144
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:20,443
only we know what we’ve been through.

145
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,742
If you’re not with me…

146
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,873
my life has no meaning.

147
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,476
I…

148
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:01,026
don’t want anyone else either.

149
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:26,468
Welcome. Do you have a reservation?

150
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:27,552
No.

151
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,520
<i>Did he threaten you</i>

152
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,398
to withdraw the report?

153
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,194
No.

154
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,613
I made that decision myself.

155
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,240
Why?

156
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:53,328
We agreed to do what we could together.

157
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,171
Kanon?

158
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:09,552
I…

159
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,641
killed someone.

160
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,186
What?

161
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,358
That day,

162
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,861
my aunt was being mean to me.

163
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:32,117
<i>I didn’t want to go straight back</i>
<i>to the house I was staying at.</i>

164
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:55,724
Hey, you.

165
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,268
Wait!

166
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,062
Wait!

167
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,368
<i>Iteya and I went to the same school,</i>

168
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,538
<i>but we’d never spoken before…</i>

169
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,210
<i>Still,</i>
<i>he told the police I wasn’t involved.</i>

170
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:09,547
Iteya was the only one

171
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,885
who reached out to me…

172
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:19,641
He pulled me out

173
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:23,686
of a lonely and miserable life.

174
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,027
So I know…

175
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,031
he’s not truly a bad person.

176
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:42,038
The person who physically hurt you?

177
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,500
It’s because I made him angry--

178
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,626
No…

179
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,379
it’s not your fault.

180
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:56,261
Kanon…

181
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:00,557
what do you really want?

182
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,311
For Iteya to change.

183
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:09,065
He won’t change.

184
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,860
Then I don’t care.

185
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,114
If he goes to Hell…

186
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,075
then I’m going with him,

187
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,578
together with him.

188
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,970
<i>They’re special.</i>

189
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:51,149
She withdrew the report?

190
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,987
So? Did you convince her?

191
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:58,781
Of course I tried.

192
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,701
But she was firm…

193
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,247
Unbelievable…

194
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,210
I think she still treasures…

195
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,464
the love

196
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,258
he once gave her.

197
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,429
Don’t tell me you too?

198
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,772
I had a dream.

199
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:34,567
We were just talking,

200
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,696
like we used to.

201
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,410
It felt like a happiness

202
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:50,124
I’ll never have again.

203
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:54,921
Even though in real life,

204
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,757
I live in fear of him.

205
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,801
Why would I dream of something like that?

206
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,020
You’re the one who ended it, right?

207
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,314
I don’t want to hear you complaining.

208
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,037
What about your son?

209
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,833
I heard he was released without charges.

210
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,335
He’s apparently living at a hotel.

211
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:39,298
He won’t answer my calls.
I have no idea what he’s doing.

212
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:43,678
Maybe what he did

213
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:45,680
was his way

214
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,558
of trying to tell you something.

215
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,023
As his mother,

216
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:58,192
I know Jun better than anyone.

217
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:30,308
We all know that communication

218
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:32,560
with one another is important.

219
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:36,647
However, when communication breaks down,

220
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:39,400
violence can become a coping mechanism.

221
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:42,445
To break this negative cycle,

222
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:46,282
you must learn to control your emotions.

223
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,744
If you feel yourself about to lash out,

224
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:52,622
try saying this next process out loud.

225
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:55,666
Step one.

226
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,544
Recognize your emotional state.

227
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:02,215
Say, "I’m angry."

228
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:05,009
Be aware of your feelings.

229
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,501
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

230
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:55,351
Kajin Sensei?

231
00:23:57,979 --> 00:24:00,231
These flowers…who sent them?

232
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:04,318
It was an online order.
The delivery person didn’t know either.

233
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:08,865
I assumed they were from a fan of yours.

234
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,010

INCOMING CALL
AYAME KAJIN

238
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:34,909
Another call?

239
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:38,704
It's from my <i>kouhai</i>.
I'll call him back later.

240
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:44,335
It’s been a while since you cooked for me.

241
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:48,631
-Is it good?
-Yeah.

242
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:53,844
How was today’s session?

243
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:53,988
Nothing special. Just the usual.

244
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:56,073
<i>Step two.</i>

245
00:26:56,741 --> 00:26:58,993
<i>Ask yourself, "Why am I angry?"</i>

246
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:03,456
<i>Steady your breath and calm down.</i>

247
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:05,833
This is delicious.

248
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:08,336
Thanks.

249
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:12,048
He sent you flowers?

250
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,008
Yes.

251
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,635
From Iteya Minamoto?

252
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:21,057
He entered my home without permission
while I was away

253
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:23,267
and ransacked my room.

254
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:25,061
Did he force his way in?

255
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:27,772
No…

256
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:31,734
he still has a spare key.

257
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:37,031
Aside from the mess,

258
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,575
was anything stolen?

259
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:43,621
He left…

260
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,498
flowers.

261
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:47,666
Another bouquet?

262
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:49,960
Yes.

263
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:59,136
Kajin, are you the one obsessed

264
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,473
with Iteya Minamoto?

265
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,145
What do you mean?

266
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:10,981
He reported that

267
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:13,818
you’ve been repeatedly calling him.

268
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,320
Is that true?

269
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:23,077
I did call him
but only to warn him directly.

270
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,871
He was going to report you for stalking.

271
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:27,790
We managed to stop him.

272
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:31,127
Stalking?

273
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:33,379
Me?

274
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:37,716
I understand it may be hard to accept

275
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,844
that he’s gone back to his wife.

276
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:41,554
But…

277
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:44,098
maybe it’s time to let him go?

278
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:11,542
Hey!

279
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,794
What?

280
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:16,839
What?

281
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:19,300
What do you want?

282
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,220
The verdict’s in.

283
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,390
-Huh?
-What?

284
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:29,852
The appeal.

285
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:33,856
I emailed you. Choga Construction. We won.

286
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:36,859
You didn't read it, did you?

287
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:41,780
Thought we could toast to the victory.

288
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:46,160
I see…

289
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,456
congratulations…

290
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,423
You okay?

291
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:05,095
I…

292
00:30:07,348 --> 00:30:09,475
didn’t used to be this timid.

293
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:13,854
I used to be more confident.

294
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:20,486
I feel pathetic.

295
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:22,863
I hate it!

296
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:39,213
Women are so selfish, right?

297
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:42,800
They shared that video of you
arguing with your wife,

298
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:45,052
then banded together
to file complaints with the club.

299
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:48,681
Even your fans were causing a huge stir.

300
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,894
The report was withdrawn,

301
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:56,313
and things with your wife are settled.

302
00:30:56,397 --> 00:30:58,482
So why quit?

303
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:02,903
<i>Step three.</i>

304
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:07,992
<i>Hold your tongue and regain composure.</i>

305
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:12,830
Later.

306
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:18,127
Thanks so much!

307
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,545
No, thank you for coming.

308
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:22,047
-My nails are so shiny!
-That's great.

309
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:24,216
-You're great!
-Thank you.

310
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,468
I pretty much came to visit you, Kanon.

311
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:28,512
I'm happy. Please come again.

312
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:31,599
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

313
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,027
Iteya, what are you doing here?

314
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,822
Let’s go.

315
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,074
-Huh? But I still have work--
-We’re going home.

316
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,346
Did something happen?

317
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,770
I’ll start making dinner.

318
00:32:29,073 --> 00:32:30,157
You’re not answering it?

319
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:35,496
Pick it up.

320
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:52,596
Who is it?

321
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:54,598
Jun.

322
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,643
Jun? Why is he messaging you?

323
00:32:59,353 --> 00:33:01,105
He messages me sometimes.

324
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,525
<i>Step four.</i>

325
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:05,609
<i>Make an effort</i>

326
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,404
<i>to understand the other person</i>
<i>through discussion.</i>

327
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:18,163
What’d he say?

328
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:20,958
Nothing special.

329
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,215
See?

330
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:30,551
It’s not a big deal.

331
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:32,219
HOW’S ITEYA DOING? I’M LEAVING JAPAN SOON.
I WANT TO SEE YOU ONE LAST TIME.

332
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:34,680
Give it back.

333
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:46,150
NAGANAMI LAW OFFICE

INCOMING CALL
YOKO MOGAMI

335
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:54,908
Kajin speaking.

336
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,161
<i>This is Mogami.</i>

337
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:00,456
Will Tatsuhiko Choga
from Choga Construction

338
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,000
be attending tonight’s party?

339
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,210
He’s a client, right?

340
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:06,879
Yes.

341
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:11,467
Are you planning to ask
for campaign support?

342
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:15,095
Something like that.

343
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:19,558
Thanks. See you later.

344
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:28,817
Who the hell took this photo?

345
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:31,695
That perverted old man?

346
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:34,907
What the hell happened between you two?

347
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:37,868
Nothing.

348
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:41,038
Nothing? Don’t lie to me!

349
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:42,998
It’s true.

350
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:45,542
Are you mocking me?

351
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:49,046
Who got me arrested?

352
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,382
Yoko Mogami? Or…

353
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:54,843
that lawyer?

354
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:59,056
You were all in on it, weren’t you?
Setting me up!

355
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,227
Say something!

356
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:06,772
I was forced to sit
in that place for hours,

357
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,858
listening to nonsense…

358
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:18,534
<i>When you find it impossible</i>
<i>to understand the other person calmly,</i>

359
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:20,911
<i>walk away from the situation.</i>

360
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:26,083
<i>Don’t blame others.</i>
<i>Express your own feelings appropriately.</i>

361
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:35,467
I’m the only one who lost everything.

362
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,470
Because of you…

363
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:57,781
Thank you all

364
00:35:58,532 --> 00:36:01,994
for gathering here today

365
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,371
despite your busy schedules.

366
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,333
We are pleased to announce

367
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:12,129
that in the coastal development project
by Choga Construction,

368
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:15,966
the court ruling in the final appeal
was successfully overturned.

369
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:17,926
A not-guilty verdict was secured,

370
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:21,722
and it looks like construction
will soon resume without issue.

371
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,898
If we’d lost the appeal,

372
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:33,650
this party would’ve felt
like a punishment game.

373
00:36:33,734 --> 00:36:35,152
Agreed.

374
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:36,945
It’s thanks to you, Konno Sensei.

375
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:39,865
As a result of meeting
everyone’s expectations…

376
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,950
-Can you commend me more?
-We take pride in it…

377
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:50,542
Now, everyone, please raise your glasses.

378
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:53,629
To the continued success

379
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:58,216
of Choga Construction
and Naganami Law Office.

380
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,551
Cheers!

381
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:01,261
Cheers!

382
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:04,556
Thanks.

383
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:09,645
-Congratulations!
-Thanks.

384
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,730
Thank you very much.

385
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:13,899
During that time…

386
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,329
Hello.

387
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,374
Quite a lively event, isn't it?

388
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:32,834
Yes.

389
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:38,256
Ms. Mogami!
Welcome, and thank you for coming!

390
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,758
Imura Sensei.

391
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:42,010
Thank you for inviting me today.

392
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:45,347
We have some excellent champagne
I’d love to recommend.

393
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,391
-It's--
-Imura Sensei.

394
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:52,270
Where is Tatsuhiko Choga
from Choga Construction?

395
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:55,983
Oh, over here.

396
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,569
Mr. Choga,

397
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:03,949
Yoko Mogami would like to greet you.

398
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,079
Hello, I'm Choga.

399
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:12,082
I watch your show every night.

400
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:16,628
Even my wife’s a loyal MY Queen user now.

401
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:19,047
I’m not here to celebrate tonight.

402
00:38:19,131 --> 00:38:21,633
I came to see you.

403
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:23,593
Me?

404
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:29,850
You’ll likely hear from the police soon.

405
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:33,311
I wanted to tell you directly.

406
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,191
The police?

407
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:41,236
That’s not a very funny joke.

408
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,948
A woman who reported
sexual harassment by you

409
00:38:45,032 --> 00:38:47,325
came to our foundation.

410
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:51,288
Her report has just been officially filed.

411
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:54,207
We’ll be holding a press conference

412
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:56,793
tomorrow morning.

413
00:38:57,544 --> 00:39:00,714
Since you’re surrounded
by brilliant lawyers here,

414
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:03,300
why not start discussing your options?

415
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:04,426
Director.

416
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,687
Congratulations

417
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:19,566
on your 40th anniversary!
Wishing you continued success!

418
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:20,776
Excuse me.

419
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:24,696
Kohara! What is going on?

420
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:27,240
Legal hasn’t heard a word about this.

421
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:32,662
First, we have to stop
tomorrow’s press conference.

422
00:39:32,746 --> 00:39:35,791
We’ll need to negotiate with her side
to even begin that.

423
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:42,964
Kajin, please persuade Yoko Mogami for us!

424
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:45,050
What?

425
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,261
I was taken off
the Choga Construction team.

426
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:53,642
I was wrong.

427
00:39:54,351 --> 00:39:56,186
I sincerely apologize

428
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:59,189
-for how I treated you.
-Please!

429
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:00,607
Kajin.

430
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,651
Please do something.

431
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:09,491
I’m leaving.

432
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:13,286
-No.
-Wait. Don't go…

433
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,101
What are you doing here?

434
00:40:41,148 --> 00:40:42,399
I had to see you.

435
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:46,945
You came to apologize?

436
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:56,121
Me? Apologize to you?

437
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:00,000
My life…

438
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:05,130
got wrecked because of you people.

439
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,302
And I’m supposed to apologize? Why?

440
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:16,016
You're the one who did this to me!

441
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:22,230
Think back…

442
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:25,483
to what you did to me.

443
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,667
I was wrong.

444
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,213
You were right about everything, Ayame.

445
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,344
Anything else you want to say to me?

446
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:02,020
There’s nothing more to say.

447
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:04,898
Don’t come near me again.

448
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:23,124
You don’t love me anymore?

449
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:37,055
Take your rehabilitation seriously.

450
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:42,227
Goodbye.

451
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:55,031
<i>The final step is emotional control.</i>

452
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,367
<i>It is to find</i>

453
00:42:57,993 --> 00:43:00,036
<i>appropriate self-expression</i>

454
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:02,497
<i>and release the anger.</i>

455
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:23,101
INCOMING CALL
YOKO MOGAMI

456
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:30,150
Hello? Yoko?

457
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:32,610
What you did today was--

458
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:48,126
<i>I cannot answer the phone.</i>

459
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:49,377
<i>Please leave…</i>

460
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:55,216
<i>My life…</i>

461
00:43:56,593 --> 00:43:58,845
<i>got wrecked because of you people.</i>

462
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:45,892
Yoko?

463
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:48,186
Yoko?

464
00:44:58,446 --> 00:44:59,531
Yoko?

465
00:45:01,783 --> 00:45:02,867
It's Kajin.

466
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,333
Yoko?

467
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:16,381
Yoko?

468
00:45:19,259 --> 00:45:20,510
That man…

469
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:23,680
he pushed me…

470
00:46:03,553 --> 00:46:04,721
Why are you here?

471
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,893
I was waiting for you.

472
00:46:29,913 --> 00:46:31,456
It's ready over there…

473
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:32,624
Thank you.

474
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:27,512
I didn’t kill anyone.

475
00:47:27,971 --> 00:47:29,973
<i>I thought I had finally met</i>
<i>the perfect woman.</i>

476
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:33,059
<i>You don't believe me?</i>

477
00:47:33,142 --> 00:47:34,936
<i>Stop it!</i>

478
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:38,106
<i>Verdict. The defendant, Ayame Kajin…</i>

479
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:39,023
THE ENTIRE TRUTH COMES TO LIGHT
