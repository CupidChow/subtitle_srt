1
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,849
From this moment,

2
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:13,949
From this moment,

3
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:15,868
we will begin the murder trial,

4
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:19,747
Case No. 604 of 2025.

5
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:21,874
Defense counsel.

6
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:28,130
The defendant, Ayame Kajin,

7
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:31,050
pleads not guilty to murder.

8
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,386
What was the point…

9
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:39,433
of committing that crime?

10
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:57,660
Defendant's name?

11
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:03,207
Ayame Kajin.

12
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,045
Occupation?

13
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:11,799
A lawyer.

14
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:23,185
Charge is murder,

15
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:25,980
pursuant to
Penal Code Article 199 and above.

16
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:28,941
Defendant,

17
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:32,152
is there any error in the facts

18
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:34,071
stated in the indictment

19
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:35,739
just read aloud by the prosecutor?

20
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:39,869
I…

21
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,541
did not kill…

22
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,013
Iteya Minamoto.

23
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,698
<i>Today, a jury trial begins</i>

24
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:21,368
<i>at Tokyo District Court</i>

25
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:23,787
<i>for a female lawyer charged with murder</i>

26
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,789
<i>for allegedly assaulting and strangling</i>

27
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,417
<i>former fencing coach Iteya Minamoto</i>

28
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,294
<i>last June in Ome City, Tokyo.</i>

29
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,378
FORMER FENCING COACH MURDER CASE
FIRST JURY TRIAL FOR LAWYER AYAME KAJIN

30
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,173
<i>From the time of her arrest,</i>

31
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,675
<i>Defendant Kajin</i>
<i>has consistently denied the murder.</i>

32
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:41,263
<i>She claims she was repeatedly abused</i>
<i>by Mr. Minamoto.</i>

33
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,390
The autopsy revealed

34
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:45,768
binding marks

35
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,311
on the wrists and ankles of the victim,

36
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,063
Iteya Minamoto.

37
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,398
The victim,

38
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:53,776
who was incapable
of resisting the defendant,

39
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,153
was repeatedly and relentlessly assaulted

40
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,739
and ultimately was strangled to death.

41
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:02,576
The nature of the crime
is extremely cruel and heinous.

42
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:05,162
The defendant lured

43
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,624
Mr. Minamoto

44
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,126
to Yoko Mogami’s home

45
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,586
and deliberately killed him.

46
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:15,255
The crime was premeditated.

47
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,978
You don’t love me anymore?

48
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:30,938
Goodbye.

49
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:00,134
Did you enjoy the party?

50
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,430
Why are you here?

51
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,349
By the way,

52
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,519
I’ve heard recently
that mistakes can be corrected.

53
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:14,481
But you never once apologized to me.

54
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:20,112
Not even when you made me withdraw
from the national tournament for Jun.

55
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,116
Or when you treated me like a killer

56
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,828
after Nada died.

57
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,248
So I need you to apologize.

58
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,596
INCOMING CALL
YOKO MOGAMI

59
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:51,685
Hello? Yoko?

60
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,645
<i>What you did today was--</i>

61
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,610
That woman will come here.

62
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,701
<i>I cannot answer the phone.</i>

63
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:30,974
Was it that match
that ruined your life?

64
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,063
So what? You're not a kid.

65
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:39,108
How long will you keep blaming me?

66
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,903
You still have time to be happy.

67
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:44,530
Even today.

68
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:47,616
You didn't come here or do anything to me.

69
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:51,578
-Let me help you.
-You always…

70
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,041
You always treated me like this.

71
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,838
With that kind smile…

72
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,842
you always looked down on me.

73
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:07,678
But…

74
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:13,725
those eyes weren’t looking at me

75
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,854
like I was your son’s friend.

76
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:25,362
They were hungry eyes,
screaming to be filled.

77
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:29,700
Don’t flatter yourself.

78
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,081
You’ve wanted me that much?

79
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,587
You were sloppy and lazy,

80
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,548
drooling as you longed for me, right?

81
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,097
The man…

82
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,725
I truly loved was…

83
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,897
Help… me!

84
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,653
Sa… yuri…

85
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:54,785
MY BELOVED SAYURI

86
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,872
It’s sickening.

87
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:01,083
She looks exactly like her.

88
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:15,973
<i>The man…</i>

89
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,184
<i>I truly loved was…</i>

90
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:25,399
not you!

91
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,318
The only man I ever truly loved

92
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,905
was Okutaro Nada! Only him!

93
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,535
The same man who looked at Kanon
with filthy eyes?

94
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,875
What a pitiful woman.

95
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,549
The pitiful one…

96
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,093
is you.

97
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,682
Even those girls will abandon you!

98
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,309
No one will ever love you!

99
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:03,186
You're not loved--

100
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:27,419
Yoko?

101
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,671
Yoko?

102
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:36,136
Yoko?

103
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:39,473
It's Kajin.

104
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:46,688
Yoko?

105
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,986
Yoko?

106
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,281
That man…

107
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,242
He pushed me…

108
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:28,688
Why are you here?

109
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:31,942
I was waiting for you.

110
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,869
During that stupid rehab program,
I kept thinking…

111
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:48,041
Why am I so angry?

112
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,626
Why do I feel this way?

113
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,965
The answer was always you, Ayame.

114
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,805
At first, it was Kanon who got involved.

115
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,350
She tried to control Yoko Mogami.

116
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:08,728
But in the end,

117
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,275
the worst one was you, right?

118
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,824
Calm down.

119
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,660
Don’t do anything stupid!

120
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,269
I thought I’d finally found
the perfect woman,

121
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,188
the one who’d truly love me…

122
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,823
But you betrayed me.

123
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,119
You’re just like all the others.

124
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:10,040
You left me too!

125
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,341
Apologize.

126
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,513
I’ve got nothing to apologize for.

127
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:27,057
You wronged me! Didn't you?

128
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,188
I meant it.

129
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:36,608
I really loved you.

130
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,445
You made me do foolish things

131
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:42,697
I never thought I would've done.

132
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,249
For the first time in my life,

133
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,336
I believed in the words "I love you."

134
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:00,423
But then you used violence

135
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,926
to keep me under your control!

136
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,928
No! It’s your fault!

137
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,602
You know exactly

138
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:14,688
what you did to me!

139
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,356
Shut up!

140
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,004
Don't move!

141
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,258
I…

142
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,680
never wanted to hurt you…

143
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:54,603
No!

144
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,856
You did whatever you wanted!

145
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,525
<i>You hit me…</i>

146
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:02,694
<i>choked me…</i>

147
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:06,031
just to make me obey!

148
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:12,621
But…

149
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,251
I loved you…

150
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:23,632
You’ve…

151
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,719
never loved anyone!

152
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,221
Not even yourself!

153
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:37,479
And yet…

154
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,150
I loved you!

155
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,676
Get away from Iteya!

156
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:01,855
What was Kanon Minamoto’s
state at the time?

157
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,401
She was agitated,

158
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,111
so I tried to calm her down.

159
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,072
Why was she agitated?

160
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:16,327
Iteya Minamoto and Yoko Mogami

161
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,956
were unconscious.

162
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,542
She panicked.

163
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,169
Her husband’s lover was assaulting him,

164
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:27,714
nearly to death.

165
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:32,552
Would Kanon simply obey you, then?

166
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:47,776
Did he hurt you again?

167
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,576
Don’t move!

168
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:09,214
Stop!

169
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,674
Don’t touch Iteya!

170
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,057
We’re…

171
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:22,769
going home!

172
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:27,857
He…

173
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:31,319
tried to kill Yoko.

174
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,447
He nearly killed you

175
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:36,991
and me.

176
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:39,202
We…

177
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:41,120
need to stop him now.

178
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,918
I…

179
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,213
can’t betray him!

180
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,550
Because he covered for you
in that accident?

181
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:56,803
He only used it to control you.

182
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,183
Why did you come here?

183
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,021
You didn’t think he’d be here.

184
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:09,274
You were trying to escape again, right?

185
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,537
If he wakes up,

186
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:24,747
he’ll kill us.

187
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,141
I’ll call the police and an ambulance.

188
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,684
Then…

189
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:47,770
this all ends.

190
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,192
It’ll be okay now.

191
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:19,218
Yes, we need an ambulance.

192
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:22,639
One man in his 30s,

193
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,682
one woman in her 50s.

194
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:26,434
Both are unconscious.

195
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:30,104
It’s been some time since they collapsed.

196
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,068
Thank you.

197
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,472
As soon as he took off his tie,

198
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:30,850
he suddenly attacked you out of nowhere.

199
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,441
You were acting in self-defense.

200
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,568
You got it?

201
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,669
The jury’s impression isn’t good.

202
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,509
If this continues…

203
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:17,855
What about Kanon?

204
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,150
<i>Same as always.</i>

205
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,237
<i>She won’t say a word.</i>

206
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:39,585
The weapon used to strangle Minamoto
was a necktie.

207
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:43,339
DNA was found from Mogami,

208
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:45,508
<i>Iteya Minamoto,</i>

209
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:47,260
<i>Kanon,</i>

210
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:48,803
<i>and you.</i>

211
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:53,015
All four of your DNA was at the scene.

212
00:23:54,684 --> 00:23:56,644
The prosecution needs a killer.

213
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:00,857
One defendant says she didn’t do it.

214
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,901
<i>The other hasn’t said anything.</i>

215
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:07,321
Yoko Mogami has no memory.

216
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,158
She can’t testify.

217
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:13,870
Unless Kanon Minamoto

218
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:19,876
testifies tomorrow
that she killed her husband

219
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:24,380
and didn’t conspire with you,

220
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,051
you'll…

221
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:33,723
Do you…

222
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:36,475
not believe me?

223
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,563
What?

224
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:48,571
When…

225
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:52,742
my clients used to ask me,

226
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,535
"Can you believe my story?"

227
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,538
I never cared.

228
00:24:58,122 --> 00:24:59,582
I thought it didn’t matter.

229
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:02,960
But…

230
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:06,297
now…

231
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:08,424
I’m doing the same thing.

232
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:20,311
Aren’t you scared?

233
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,734
I’m scared out of my mind.

234
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:31,989
But…

235
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:38,663
maybe I want to believe too.

236
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:55,513
You have a visitor.

237
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:04,939
Kajin Sensei has been worried

238
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,401
about your condition.

239
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:13,364
She’s got enough to deal with

240
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,325
but still worries about others.

241
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:22,498
She wasn’t like that before.

242
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,876
Maybe she changed…

243
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:29,005
because of you.

244
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,721
That’s what she said in court.

245
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:40,141
<i>As the defendant claims,</i>

246
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,184
let's say Kanon Minamoto

247
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:44,186
is dependent on others

248
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:48,065
and unable to act on her own.

249
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:50,026
If that's the case,

250
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:52,236
wouldn’t that mean

251
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,656
she couldn’t have killed
her husband on her own?

252
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,707
True…

253
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,085
You’re right.

254
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:24,101
That was the Kanon Minamoto I knew.

255
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:29,899
But…

256
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:34,820
she was trying to change.

257
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:39,867
Afraid of being alone

258
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,995
and desperate to avoid it,

259
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:46,415
she mistook his violence…

260
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:49,835
for love.

261
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,173
But…

262
00:27:56,634 --> 00:28:00,221
when she finally realized
it was anything but love,

263
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:04,475
<i>she fought, suffered,</i>

264
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:06,936
<i>and struggled</i>

265
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:09,230
<i>to climb out of that deep hole.</i>

266
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:13,734
She was searching for a way to live.

267
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:20,866
That’s…

268
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:23,828
how I saw her.

269
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:30,501
She’s not the same Kajin Sensei I knew.

270
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:32,878
But still…

271
00:28:34,422 --> 00:28:36,507
I kind of like who she is now.

272
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:50,771
We will now…

273
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,858
begin closing arguments.

274
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:58,112
I killed him.

275
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:09,915
I…

276
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:17,298
killed…

277
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,386
Iteya.

278
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,148
It’ll be okay now.

279
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:10,309
Please…

280
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:24,657
I'm sorry…

281
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,340
It hurts…

282
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:45,970
Can you untie me?

283
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:54,645
Did you…

284
00:30:58,107 --> 00:30:59,483
push Yoko?

285
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:16,000
It wasn’t me.

286
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,004
Why…

287
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:27,678
Why…

288
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,854
Why are you here?

289
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:42,443
Why…

290
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:45,946
Why were you with her?

291
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,879
That woman tricked me.

292
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:16,769
Let’s go home.

293
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,607
Just the two of us.

294
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:21,750
Help me!

295
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:23,001
-No!
-What did you do with him?

296
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:24,586
No!

297
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:49,278
Hey…

298
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,158
Kanon?

299
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:45,435
<i>If Iteya…</i>

300
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,606
hadn’t died…

301
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:53,318
that day…

302
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:59,783
I probably would have died.

303
00:36:04,705 --> 00:36:06,582
You remained silent…

304
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,293
until now.

305
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:16,341
Why tell the truth now?

306
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,308
Not sure.

307
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:33,025
I…

308
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:38,906
don’t really know myself.

309
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:51,460
<i>The court’s ruling.</i>

310
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:55,631
<i>Kanon Minamoto…</i>

311
00:36:58,425 --> 00:37:00,218
<i>is sentenced to seven years in prison.</i>

312
00:37:22,783 --> 00:37:26,536
Kinbara! That woman wants to turn herself
in regarding her husband's case.

313
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,288
Huh?

314
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:42,177
Would you show me the way?

315
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:48,058
The defendant, Ayame Kajin…

316
00:37:54,982 --> 00:37:56,358
is not guilty.

317
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:28,515
You're currently unemployed

318
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:30,726
-and have no income?
-Yes.

319
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:34,980
Is it possible for you to temporarily stay
at your parents’ home?

320
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:36,732
Yes.

321
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,442
That’s good to hear.

322
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:42,029
Even if you're a homemaker,

323
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:46,575
you’re still entitled to half the assets
in a divorce.

324
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:48,035
FUTURE STEP
DIRECTOR AYAME KAJIN

325
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:49,870
Your husband’s just trying to scare you.

326
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:53,457
He can’t keep everything for himself.

327
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,750
Really?

328
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,046
Life may be hard now

329
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:02,924
and after the divorce too,

330
00:39:03,592 --> 00:39:06,720
but you can prepare wisely

331
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:09,347
by obtaining qualifications
that help you at work

332
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:12,184
and by saving money.

333
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:16,563
Instead of worrying, first take action.

334
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,067
I'm so glad I could talk to you.

335
00:39:20,484 --> 00:39:22,444
I had no one else to talk to.

336
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:27,115
If you ever need a lawyer,

337
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:29,826
try this place.

338
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,579
I think they’ll be able to help you.

339
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:35,123
Thank you very much.

340
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:38,293
Thank you very much.

341
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,170
Thank you very much.

342
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:43,632
You’re welcome.

343
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:48,804
YOKO MOGAMI
A HOUSE BATHED IN SUNLIGHT

344
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,097
<i>To achieve my dream</i>

345
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:51,973
and succeed…

346
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:56,520
I’ve done everything I had to,

347
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:01,316
even if it meant bending the rules…

348
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:18,792
Yoko?

349
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:42,107
Yoko?

350
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:46,319
That man…

351
00:40:47,154 --> 00:40:49,322
He pushed me…

352
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:10,886
You shouldn't be nervous about the speech.

353
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:12,929
We’re late for the signing.

354
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:18,059
What’s Dad thinking from the other side?

355
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:20,520
You candidly wrote

356
00:41:20,604 --> 00:41:22,689
about your marriage back then,
and that one book

357
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:24,733
became a bestseller that

358
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:27,777
even surpassed all of Dad’s works.

359
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:31,448
That must be unbearable
for him as a writer.

360
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:34,826
He never forgot that one woman.

361
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:40,248
He’d probably pity me and say,
"What a vulgar, greedy woman."

362
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,296
Or maybe not…

363
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:50,508
You know…

364
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,760
what his phone password was?

365
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:54,179
A birthday?

366
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:55,472
Right.

367
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:56,848
Your birthday.

368
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:01,353
Just like you,

369
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:04,981
maybe Dad just wanted to be loved too.

370
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:15,742
A tragic wife who was never loved.

371
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:18,870
That’s why the public pays attention.

372
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:20,747
At this point,
it's just hurting my business.

373
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:30,882
Come on.

374
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:34,552
Please handle the management today too.

375
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:35,720
Sorry.

376
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:50,944
Thank you for the food.

377
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,534
I'm back.

378
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:02,831
Are you eating that again, Kajin Sensei?

379
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:04,708
Can’t help it. I love it.

380
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,503
Oh, another request came in.

381
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,131
A commentator for a news program.

382
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:12,340
You turned them down, right?

383
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:15,385
I told them,
"Thank you, but Kajin isn’t interested."

384
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,929
You’ve got the fame,

385
00:43:18,013 --> 00:43:20,056
and you can use your experience.

386
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:23,768
You should get out there
more aggressively.

387
00:43:25,437 --> 00:43:26,646
Looks good!

388
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,148
I'll have ramen too.

389
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:51,921
What?

390
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,008
<i>Another person came</i>
<i>saying she was referred here.</i>

391
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:57,385
You know…

392
00:43:57,469 --> 00:44:00,263
Look, I’m not free, okay?
Haven’t I told you that?

393
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:01,848
Huh?

394
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:06,770
And this? Violation of portrait rights.

395
00:44:07,187 --> 00:44:10,440
Where did you find
this black-and-white photo?

396
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:11,858
Hey!

397
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:13,860
What are you eating?

398
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:16,029
Noodles? It's noodles.

399
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:18,031
You’re making money.

400
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:22,202
But all you’ll do is waste it on women.

401
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:24,287
You're so persistent, aren't you?

402
00:44:24,371 --> 00:44:27,499
That wasn’t wasting.

403
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:29,209
I raised her

404
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:31,336
-<i>with love--</i>
-I'm eating ramen, so I'll hang up.

405
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:32,670
<i>Wait--</i>

406
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:34,547
Kajin?

407
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:38,301
Tell her to drop by sometime.

408
00:44:38,385 --> 00:44:40,387
She’s pretty busy.

409
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:41,638
Still…

410
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:43,515
-Invite her.
-Yes.

411
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:44,766
And this flyer…

412
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:46,768
Aside from the picture,

413
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:50,188
could you at least put my name on it?

414
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:52,690
-I'm co-director too, you know.
-Yes.

415
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:54,692
I didn’t make this,

416
00:44:54,776 --> 00:44:56,945
so please ask Kajin about it. Thanks.

417
00:44:57,779 --> 00:45:00,698
But Co-Director…

418
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:24,973
<i>I’ll never feel love…</i>

419
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:28,685
<i>like that again.</i>

420
00:46:05,597 --> 00:46:06,681
Um…

421
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:09,642
are you okay?

422
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:24,092
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION
