1
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:09,844
On April 28th, the defendant

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,306
was first assaulted
by Iteya Minamoto, correct?

3
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:29,697
But you didn’t report it to the police.

4
00:00:30,573 --> 00:00:33,159
-Was that because--
-I felt angry.

5
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:34,702
What?

6
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:40,708
I felt angry…

7
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,337
at myself for not leaving him
even after he hit me.

8
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:05,274
Did you sleep with that lawyer?

9
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,114
Did you sleep with that lawyer? Answer me!

10
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,367
Answer me! Where did you do it?

11
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:18,037
Answer me!

12
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:27,982
Iteya?

13
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:30,526
Wasn’t the training camp
running until tomorrow?

14
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,028
It ended early…

15
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:40,930
He saw me as a woman
who could be subdued with violence.

16
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:46,185
That thought made me feel humiliated…

17
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:49,855
and furious.

18
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:35,526
Sorry. Morning.

19
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,277
Morning.

20
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:45,244
Were you okay last night?

21
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:47,913
What?

22
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,874
The guy.
He was waiting for you, wasn’t he?

23
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,591
The man who attacked you…

24
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,802
Are you sure you didn’t see his face?

25
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:05,264
If I did, I’d have caught him by now.

26
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,266
Damn bastard chose a spot

27
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:10,644
with no security cameras.

28
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,653
Why bring that up now?

29
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:28,579
Here.

30
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:34,793
Understood. I’ll revise it right away.

31
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:35,961
Thanks.

32
00:05:39,465 --> 00:05:40,883
Kajin Sensei…

33
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,011
your face…

34
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:49,141
Did you switch foundation?

35
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,394
No…

36
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:54,354
Is it heavier than usual?

37
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,982
Not at all!
You look more beautiful than ever.

38
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:58,567
I just wanted to know the brand!

39
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,653
Excuse me.

40
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,551
INCOMING CALL
ITEYA MINAMOTO

41
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,436
BLOCK CALLER

42
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,773
BLOCK ITEYA MINAMOTO?
YES - NO

43
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,278
YES

44
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,072
ITEYA MINAMOTO HAS BEEN BLOCKED

45
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,861
Hello?

46
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:27,114
I’m sorry about last night.

47
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:31,243
I didn’t mean for it to happen.

48
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,874
I'm in front of your apartment.

49
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:41,545
I want to see you.

50
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,135
Let’s forget it ever happened.

51
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:50,345
I don’t want to see you.

52
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:56,768
I’m really sorry…

53
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,608
Why…

54
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,235
did you do that?

55
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,947
Because you were with that guy…

56
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,158
the lawyer.

57
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:13,785
Mr. Konno?

58
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,080
Where were you with him?
What were you doing?

59
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,336
I told you. I was meeting a client.

60
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,795
He was there too, wasn’t he?

61
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,256
Was he the one you slept with?

62
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,719
Why does it matter who I sleep with?

63
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,555
I’m not your wife!

64
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:45,859
You made me this way.

65
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,029
I did?

66
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:51,865
When I wake up…

67
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,910
I think of you first.

68
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,370
When I sleep…

69
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,539
I dream of you.

70
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:03,627
You’re…

71
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:15,973
all I think about all day long!

72
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:22,229
I love you so much…

73
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:27,651
So why won’t you love me the same?

74
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,531
Who’s really to blame?

75
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:35,158
Don’t you…

76
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:37,661
have a home to return to?

77
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:56,680
You don’t get it, do you?

78
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:02,394
How it feels to leave youand go home.

79
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:07,232
All you want is a physical relationship.

80
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:15,907
Do you even try to imagine…

81
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,496
how much I’m suffering?

82
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,083
Don’t yell!

83
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:15,884
Did you…

84
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,553
attack Mr. Konno?

85
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,183
It was you, wasn't it?

86
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,358
It wasn’t me.

87
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,197
Ayame.

88
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:46,665
Did it hurt?

89
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,178
It’s over…

90
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:04,516
between us.

91
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:09,104
If you come again…

92
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,566
I’ll call the police.

93
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,626
You'd like to speak with us again?

94
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,002
Yes.

95
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,339
I’m Kajin from Naganami Law Office.

96
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,011
Please make three copies of this document

97
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:07,597
-before this afternoon's meeting.
-Got it.

98
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:12,561
No. Five copies please.

99
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:13,979
Understood.

100
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:04,195
Turning him down…

101
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:08,325
feels like I'm punishing myself.

102
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,603
Iteya?

103
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:40,357
Will you be home late again tomorrow?

104
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,859
Why?

105
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:46,571
I will finish work early.

106
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:49,991
I thought we could eat out.

107
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,745
We haven’t gone out together lately…

108
00:15:57,082 --> 00:16:00,377
I’ll be late for a while.
The new students have night practice.

109
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:05,882
Oh… okay.

110
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:35,889
Yes?

111
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:42,145
POLICE DEPARTMENT

112
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:52,655
You said you wanted to
confirm something again?

113
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:57,827
You last saw the deceased, Okutaro Nada,

114
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,205
four weeks ago, correct?

115
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,123
Yes.

116
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:04,375
Are you sure that’s not a mistake?

117
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:05,835
What?

118
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:11,257
Is there any chance you met him
on the night he died?

119
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,052
Why would you ask that?

120
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:18,056
We haven’t found his phone yet,

121
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:22,685
but your number was in his call log.

122
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:30,527
It says you spoke
at 8:52 p.m. that night.

123
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,242
That night…

124
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:41,579
INCOMING CALL
OKUTARO NADA

125
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:48,503
Hello, Professor?

126
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:54,717
You were trimming his nails?

127
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:59,597
I did that sometimes at his office.

128
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:03,476
Why is this one nail left undone?

129
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:07,814
I was just about to finish that one when…

130
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:14,654
My husband came home
earlier than expected.

131
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,158
So that explains…

132
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,787
Did Yoko Mogami know about your visits?

133
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,707
The professor wanted it kept secret.

134
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:30,587
Why didn’t you tell us from the start?

135
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:35,216
It could put you at a disadvantage.

136
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,930
Even if I had told the truth,

137
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,976
I thought I’d still be a suspect.

138
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,315
It’s always been that way,
since I was little…

139
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:57,780
But I didn’t…

140
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:02,452
kill Professor Nada!

141
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,847
Do you believe Kanon Minamoto’s story?

142
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,184
She and her husband

143
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:29,771
provided alibis for each other
during the estimated time of death.

144
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,985
Could they be accomplices?

145
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,781
It’s possible.

146
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:45,370
Man, I’d totally fall
for a woman like that…

147
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:49,916
She’s not the only liar here.

148
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,293
Yoko.

149
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,712
No work today?

150
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:59,884
If you take too many days off,
it puts me in a tough spot.

151
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:01,219
I recommended you, after all.

152
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,931
The police called me in.

153
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,975
About Professor Nada.

154
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:10,895
You’re the one who…

155
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,898
If I was, I wouldn’t be standing here.

156
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:16,609
By the way,

157
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:20,613
the detectives said
they haven’t found his phone.

158
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,866
You wouldn’t know anything?

159
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:26,077
Why would I?

160
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:30,456
Maybe ask your husband first?

161
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:35,545
Still obsessed with him, huh?

162
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:43,761
There's something about you two
that would make the police suspicious,

163
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:45,555
right?

164
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:51,519
Are you two… really in the clear?

165
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,814
Excuse me.

166
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:21,174
You look down, Kajin Sensei.
Everything okay?

167
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,772
So what’s the guy like? The new one?

168
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:39,942
Not that you care.

169
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,736
Of course, I care.

170
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:43,362
Wait.

171
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:45,406
Is he hotter than me?

172
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:49,827
-Maybe.
-Really?

173
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,001
Is it someone I know?

174
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:06,552
Nah, can’t be.

175
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,723
But watch out.

176
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:14,936
I get fired up when there’s competition.

177
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:22,110
Kajin Sensei.

178
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:23,903
You have a visitor.

179
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:40,044
You were trimming Professor Nada’s nails
that night?

180
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:44,048
I told the police everything honestly,

181
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:47,218
and I think they understood the situation.

182
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:51,973
But I still wanted to consult you first.

183
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:58,437
That’s up to the police to determine.

184
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,439
Sorry.

185
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:04,485
I’ve been blamed for things my whole life.

186
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:05,820
I'm worried…

187
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:11,576
You’re… the only one I can turn to…

188
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:19,417
The autopsy results should be out soon.

189
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:29,468
Do you like orange carnations too?

190
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:34,056
Yes.

191
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,933
I love them too.

192
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:41,147
They're gentle and strong.

193
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:44,192
Just like you.

194
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:54,118
I’d love to thank you somehow.

195
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,912
How about a manicure?

196
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,207
That’s really not necessary…

197
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,418
You must be tired.

198
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:04,962
At least let me massage you.

199
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:06,923
Yeah?

200
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:21,312
It’s not much,
but it’s the only way I can repay you.

201
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:26,567
I’ve already received the lawyer fee.

202
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:36,244
How are things… with your husband?

203
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,163
No issues?

204
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:43,167
Sensei,

205
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,964
do you think I’m an idiot?

206
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:49,966
Huh?

207
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:53,928
I love you.

208
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,892
That’s what orange carnations mean.

209
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:26,335
You want last week’s schedule
for Mr. Minamoto?

210
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,087
Yes.

211
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,340
He said he had night lessons for a while…

212
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,844
No, he went home early.

213
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:38,597
I see.

214
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:29,732
It's over…

215
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,028
between us.

216
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:15,111
INCOMING CALL
YOKO MOGAMI

217
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:24,370
Yes. This is Kajin.

218
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:39,260
Thank you for…

219
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:40,219
Really…

220
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:48,477
Kajin!

221
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:53,399
-I’m so glad you came.
-Likewise.

222
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:55,734
Thank you for inviting me.

223
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:59,447
I'm always treating you terribly.

224
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,490
Please accept my apology.

225
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:03,492
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

226
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,829
Is this… okay?

227
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:08,747
Professor Nada’s case is still…

228
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:13,544
There’ve been strange rumors
and speculation about Nada, right?

229
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:17,298
That’s exactly why I thought
we should have a setting like this.

230
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:19,508
It’s a lot less formal
than a press conference, right?

231
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:21,177
-Director.
-Yes?

232
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,682
Let me introduce you to everyone.

233
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,529
Tough place to be, huh?

234
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,408
I respect Yoko.

235
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:48,245
That’s not what I meant.

236
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:51,624
See?

237
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:54,335
I invited him to apologize
for treating him like a suspect.

238
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:57,963
Mom… reluctantly agreed.

239
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:01,717
You came…

240
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,802
So that means you’ve forgiven me
for suspecting you?

241
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:08,015
If you believe in us… right, Iteya?

242
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:09,475
Yeah.

243
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:14,772
Thanks, my precious friends!

244
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:36,252
Let’s grab a drink over there.

245
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:38,128
Yeah.

246
00:30:46,804 --> 00:30:49,557
Even if he killed Dad…

247
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,351
could you still love him?

248
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:54,770
What?

249
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:13,455
So, all the strange rumors

250
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,958
about my husband’s death

251
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:19,628
are all completely false.

252
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:24,717
With the truth behind my husband's death
still unknown,

253
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,886
I find myself in the midst
of a most difficult situation.

254
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:32,725
For the women enduring hardship

255
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:33,934
and for this country,

256
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:37,187
I am committed to doing everything I can,

257
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:38,981
with sincerity and an unwavering resolve.

258
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:44,612
Let me introduce
a highly dependable individual

259
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:46,280
who will walk this path with me.

260
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:50,367
Attorney Ayame Kajin.

261
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,746
Kajin, please come up.

262
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:05,049
She was my husband’s most trusted student

263
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:07,343
and a powerful ally to women like us,

264
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:10,679
who face many challenges.

265
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,520
Yeah! Go, women’s ally!

266
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,483
Kajin, would you say a few words?

267
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,364
I’m Ayame Kajin.

268
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:33,619
I’ll do my best to live up
to Ms. Mogami’s expectations.

269
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:48,175
Oh, is it raining?

270
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:49,968
It's raining! Please go inside!

271
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:52,638
Please come in! Hurry!

272
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:56,058
Jeez…

273
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:43,647
Let go of me.

274
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:11,091
You want some?

275
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:23,437
Sitting here like this…
brings back memories.

276
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:35,991
That side of you… suits you better.

277
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:38,994
I saw it,

278
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,287
that photo of you.

279
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,169
You looked beautiful.

280
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,657
ITEYA MINAMOTO

281
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:21,119
BLOCK ITEYA MINAMOTO?

282
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:27,918
NO

283
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:21,889
What are you going to do…

284
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,267
about your wife?

285
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:35,694
Just…

286
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:39,615
give me a little time.

287
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:52,628
I love you.

288
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:33,103
The people from Choga Construction
should be arriving soon.

289
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:35,689
-I’ll go check the conference room.
-Please do.

290
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:49,202
Wait. Excuse me.

291
00:38:50,037 --> 00:38:52,372
Excuse me. Don't walk in uninvited.

292
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,712
I told her to wait…

293
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:02,632
Could you give us a moment?

294
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,061
What is it today?

295
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:18,774
I have an important meeting.

296
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,942
I can’t talk for long.

297
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:23,278
This office smells lovely.

298
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:27,074
But… for some reason,
it makes me want to vomit.

299
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,829
Did you know

300
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:37,542
some fruit seeds contain cyanide?

301
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,338
You’d have to eat a lot
to die from them, apparently.

302
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:43,548
Have you ever heard of that?

303
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,136
What are you trying to say?

304
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,558
Why Iteya?

305
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:00,315
You’re beautiful…

306
00:40:02,526 --> 00:40:04,402
stylish…

307
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:06,113
successful…

308
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:10,200
So why?

309
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:25,090
He’ll…

310
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:27,968
probably never change.

311
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:33,598
If you truly care about him,

312
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,017
you should think…

313
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:39,354
long and hard.

314
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,317
So you’re saying
divorce is the best option?

315
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:55,954
There it is. Calling me an idiot again!

316
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,005
What's that?

317
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:06,923
It’s my charm.

318
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:12,137
No! Don't!

319
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:13,722
Hey!

320
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:17,976
Wait!

321
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:20,270
What's going on?

322
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:24,399
Wait!

323
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:33,575
Give me that!

324
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:36,244
Stop it! Let me go!

325
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:04,272
Lawyer.

326
00:42:05,315 --> 00:42:09,069
It doesn’t… have to be Iteya, right?

327
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:14,115
He’s all…

328
00:42:16,326 --> 00:42:18,203
I have…

329
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:39,474
You’re off the Choga Construction case.

330
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,811
We're almost in the second half…

331
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:46,606
Please let me complete it.

332
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,947
I’m truly sorry.

333
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:57,701
You really think I can trust you?

334
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:59,786
A reckless lawyer

335
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:01,746
who fools around with clients?

336
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:05,417
I don’t want to see your face
for a long time!

337
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:33,486
About you, Kajin Sensei…

338
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:36,323
I’m disappointed in you.

339
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:58,053
Yes, understood.

340
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,352
Mr. Nada’s phone still hasn’t turned up.

341
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:08,104
He used it just before he died.

342
00:44:08,188 --> 00:44:10,273
Someone definitely took it.

343
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:13,818
Maybe the killer.

344
00:44:14,486 --> 00:44:16,404
Must’ve had
something seriously incriminating on it…

345
00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:18,323
The autopsy report is here.

346
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:20,033
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

347
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:27,248
What is it?

348
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,505
What is it?

349
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:37,300
What is it? Come on!

350
00:44:38,635 --> 00:44:41,137
Okutaro Nada died of neck compression.

351
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:44,432
But the murder weapon
wasn’t the belt of the robe.

352
00:44:44,516 --> 00:44:47,268
It was the same electrical cord

353
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:49,396
used to bind his wrists and ankles.

354
00:44:50,814 --> 00:44:53,858
So they strangled him with the cord

355
00:44:53,942 --> 00:44:56,111
then wrapped the belt of the robe
around his neck after?

356
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:57,404
Why stage it like that?

357
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:03,284
Maybe there were two culprits?

358
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:08,915
One who strangled him with the cord
and another…

359
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:10,458
who wrapped the belt.

360
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:13,169
Two murderers?

361
00:45:15,505 --> 00:45:17,173
This is Nikawa.

362
00:45:17,257 --> 00:45:19,759
Yes. Yes.

363
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:21,803
Yes.

364
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:23,638
Yes.

365
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:24,764
Yes.

366
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:27,767
Understood!

367
00:45:27,851 --> 00:45:30,979
Looks like money was wired from
Nada’s account to an overseas account

368
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:33,064
around the estimated time of death.

369
00:45:33,148 --> 00:45:36,776
And it was ¥5 million!

370
00:45:38,278 --> 00:45:40,572
Five million? To whom?

371
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:50,331
TRANSFER ¥5 MILLION
FROM OKUTARO NADA TO JUN NADA

372
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:51,875
PROCEED WITH TRANSFER?
YES - NO

373
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:53,334
TRANSFER COMPLETE

374
00:46:16,191 --> 00:46:17,817
Kanon is gone.

375
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:18,943
What?

376
00:46:20,612 --> 00:46:22,363
She’s not here.

377
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:53,061
Come…

378
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:56,773
be with me.

379
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:06,658
I love you.

380
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:33,851
And so…

381
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:37,939
I lost everything.

382
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:40,608
I decided not to go.

383
00:47:40,692 --> 00:47:42,735
He's waiting at home.

384
00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:45,071
I was able to endure
the unpleasant things.

385
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:46,114
Where were you?

386
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:47,574
Who were you with?

387
00:47:47,657 --> 00:47:48,616
So,

388
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,535
that's the kind of person you are.

389
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:54,080
You're sorry that
I'm so into your husband?
