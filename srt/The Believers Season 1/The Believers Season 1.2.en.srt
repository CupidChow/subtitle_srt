1
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:19,458
TWO YEARS AGO

2
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:22,291
Here's to our company's
first day of opening.

3
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,833
Damn, you're going full-on.

4
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:25,875
I wanted some booze,
not fucking champagne.

5
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:28,416
Look, man. You can get booze whenever.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,791
But today's our company's opening,
so it's champagne only.

7
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:36,666
Because it's all about making our way
towards profit from here on out.

8
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,666
How much profit?

9
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,250
- A thousand percent.
- A thousand percent.

10
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,083
Are we seriously going to get rich? Wow.

11
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:46,041
So, everyone, go all out.

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,208
Hey.

13
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:50,666
What are you doing
sitting here alone, Golf?

14
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,500
Just give it a go, come on.

15
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:54,333
- Come on.
- I don't drink.

16
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:55,958
Come on, just this once.

17
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,458
Just a little bit.

18
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:00,708
Hey. Let's take a photo.

19
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,625
Hey, were you guys seriously

20
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:20,125
taking a co-founder selfie
without me, you bastard?

21
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:22,083
Cheers, man. Yeah.

22
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:23,833
Okay, we had our damn drinks.

23
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:27,500
We're 25, but…

24
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:31,458
we're running a 30 million baht business

25
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:35,250
to generate 300 million baht profit.

26
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:38,500
Damn right.
We took out a 25 million loan for this.

27
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:42,333
Who said anything about a loan?
We're talking about profit here. Alright?

28
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,833
But honestly, for me,

29
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:46,583
it feels like…

30
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,375
when we're together,

31
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:52,291
I can be fucking fearless, man.

32
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:56,375
Let me ask you this.

33
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:59,500
Why did you ask me join you?

34
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:04,333
- Tell me.
- You sure you wanna hear this now?

35
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:09,291
Okay. Fine.

36
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,916
I don't know why.

37
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,583
I just knew it had to be you.

38
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:25,083
Alright. Let me ask you back.

39
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,250
Why would a valedictorian like you

40
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,000
quit school to take this risk with me?

41
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:36,625
Running any business is risky.

42
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:44,833
- It's about who you run it with.
- Holy shit, that was smooth as hell.

43
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,791
Oh.

44
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,791
- Yuck.
- So, on this occasion…

45
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,333
Hey. Hey.

46
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:52,375
What?

47
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:53,875
I just wanted to say

48
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,250
that we

49
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:57,166
will

50
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,375
destroy

51
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,458
Metaverse.

52
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,583
But just writing on paper
isn't enough, alright?

53
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,000
You know what blood oath is?

54
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:11,416
Real blood is a bit much.
Let's use ketchup instead.

55
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,083
Done.

56
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,041
We've made a pact.

57
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,458
- We're in this together no matter what.
- Hey. Of course, you dawg.

58
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,041
- Look at that!
- Ay!

59
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,166
- Come on, let's drink.
- You drink.

60
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:42,625
THE BELIEVERS

61
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,958
So? Go straight and then what?

62
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,875
Keep going straight
and turn left in three kilometers.

63
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,625
- Okay.
- I'll keep navigating.

64
00:03:57,083 --> 00:04:00,583
So, which temple? There are tens
of thousands of them in Thailand.

65
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,208
How about you do a search?

66
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:05,791
Wow, that's a shitload.

67
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,208
Let's start with Bangkok.

68
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,833
- What about this temple?
- No, too big.

69
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,916
How does big equal bad?

70
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,541
A temple this big
must have a big committee.

71
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:20,375
They already have their own people
to share profit with. No room for us.

72
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:21,791
Look.

73
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,791
TEMPLE COMMITTEE
PRESIDENT, MEMBERS

74
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,041
Um.

75
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,791
TOO MANY PEOPLE IN CHARGE

76
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,875
<i>Bangkok won't work.</i>
<i>Let's do countryside.</i>

77
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,500
<i>Not too far, though.</i>
<i>No customer base.</i>

78
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:33,958
<i>The outskirts, then.</i>

79
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,708
<i>Seems good.</i>
<i>It's at the center of a neighborhood.</i>

80
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:40,500
See? There're four or five
more temples around here.

81
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,583
Think you can compete
against existing rivals?

82
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,791
TOO MUCH COMPETITION

83
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:51,000
- <i>How is it?</i>
- I think it's a no-go. Look.

84
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:53,875
Too old.

85
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,625
We might as well build a new temple.

86
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,625
TOO OLD

87
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,083
Probably will cost a few millions.
Let's drop it.

88
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:04,958
<i>This temple looks good.</i>

89
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,375
<i>Let's just talk to the abbot.</i>

90
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,166
What are you talking about?

91
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,166
But we have good intentions
for what we're trying to do, Father.

92
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,541
It's a grave sin.

93
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:18,375
It can also

94
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,208
be a way to support the religion.

95
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,791
You religious charlatans.

96
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,875
OOPS, HE KNOWS WHAT'S UP

97
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:31,250
- What is this?
- Got it from the last temple.

98
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:34,708
He said it might help
cleanse your minds a little.

99
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,583
Win. Seriously, though.

100
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:45,083
If this project doesn't work out,
then what's next?

101
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:49,583
Well… We'd earn merit, I guess.

102
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,833
Merit, my ass.

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,958
Dude.

104
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,000
I need to pee.

105
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,541
Can you look for a gas station?

106
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:03,791
Not sure about a gas station,
but you can go behind the bushes.

107
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,500
No fucking way.
I can't have people seeing my butt.

108
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:09,000
- I'll find a gas station for you.
- Okay.

109
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,500
Hold it for a bit.

110
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,625
- Hey, pull over.
- What?

111
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:14,916
Pull over.

112
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,125
And back up the car.

113
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,500
What? Pull over here? This temple?

114
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,375
Yeah, this temple. Back up.

115
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:27,458
Fucking dangerous, making me
pull over in the middle of the road.

116
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,000
PHUMMARAM TEMPLE

117
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,625
My body is sore.

118
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:01,750
How about getting a massage when we're
back in Bangkok? I know this one place.

119
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,208
The masseuses are fucking amazing, but…

120
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:07,833
there's this one masseuse at the place.
Her name is Jeab. She's a bit off.

121
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,583
She always offers dick massage.

122
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:12,333
Hmm?

123
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,083
Hey.

124
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,125
Hey. Where's Win?

125
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:09,708
Not in the car?

126
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,916
If he was, he'd be here with me.

127
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,875
Let's go. It's getting dark soon.

128
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,916
I think this temple is a good size.

129
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,916
Huh?

130
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,708
There's a ton of space.
We could renovate it.

131
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,208
This temple?

132
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,875
It looks abandoned.

133
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,583
Not a single person around.

134
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,500
Even there's only one dog.

135
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,125
But I'm with Dear on this.

136
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,000
What are you saying?

137
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,000
Huh?

138
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,291
Let's go with this temple.

139
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:52,500
Um.

140
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:57,083
It looks fucking abandoned.
Sure you can renovate it?

141
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,583
I think this temple
should be easy to talk to.

142
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,458
The abbot seems kind.

143
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,291
How'd you even know that?

144
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,750
PHUMMARAM 70 YEARS
MONK VEERA ITSAVARO, FATHER KIW

145
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,000
Oh.

146
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,583
OFFERINGS STATION:
FLOWERS, INCENSE, CANDLES

147
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,833
Hey, Kid. Where's the abbot?

148
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:28,208
There. You can try asking
that old man up at the pavilion.

149
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,583
Excuse me.

150
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,000
Hey. What's up, young man?

151
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:05,125
We came across this temple
and decided to stop by to make merit.

152
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,833
- I see.
- Can you show me where I can do that?

153
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,125
- You're here to make merit?
- Yes, brother.

154
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,500
You don't have to call me "brother."

155
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,416
- Just call me "Uncle."
- Okay.

156
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:19,125
To see young people at the temple, wow!
That makes me so happy.

157
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,916
Hey, to make it even better,
go to the ordination hall

158
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,958
and pay respects to the Buddha statue.

159
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,416
It might seem old,
but it's incredibly sacred.

160
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,000
Is the abbot here today?

161
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,916
He's not feeling well.
It's best not to disturb him.

162
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,750
He's very old.

163
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,750
When you're here,
just come and find me.

164
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,500
I'm Tang, the lay leader at this temple.

165
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,458
Well, we're looking to meet the abbot.

166
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,333
We'd like him to bless our car.

167
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,875
Oh, I see. Come back another day, okay?

168
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,166
He's not going anywhere, lad.

169
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,875
I'm going downstairs.

170
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:03,708
Huh.

171
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,375
Hey. Your face seems a bit somber.

172
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,000
Maybe try a ritual to ward off bad luck?

173
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,916
You've got bad luck. Your face looks grim.

174
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,083
He seems a bit wacky.

175
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,250
I think he has the key to
the donation boxes.

176
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:34,500
He might even handle the money too.
We should try approaching him.

177
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,125
Me again, huh?

178
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,125
Shit.

179
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,208
Excuse me.

180
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,000
I…

181
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,083
- Haven't you left?
- No, I haven't.

182
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,541
I'd like leave this donation
to the abbot with you.

183
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,625
We don't see many people at this temple,

184
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,541
so we'd like him
to have some funds on hand.

185
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,375
May you prosper, young man.

186
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,958
I'll get you the donation form.

187
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,833
That's okay. We're leaving now. Just…

188
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,750
give it to the abbot for us.

189
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:07,875
Oh, okay.

190
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:11,166
Here's what we'll do.
Hold on, just sign it right here.

191
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,208
I'll take it to the abbot.

192
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:14,791
SOMDECH

193
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:16,666
Here you go.

194
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:19,625
Bye, uncle.

195
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,875
May you prosper, young man!

196
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:25,458
Let's go.

197
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,916
We can all confirm this is the temple?

198
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,958
Um.

199
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:37,666
Wait longer and we won't get things done.
At least pick a temple to rebrand.

200
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,333
CONTRACT WORK & GENERAL SERVICES
PHUMMARAM TEMPLE

201
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:56,958
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

202
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,375
Here.

203
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,791
So? Let's just go talk to him
and get it over with.

204
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,625
- Let's wait a bit longer.
- Okay.

205
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,125
What?

206
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,041
Oh, shit.

207
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,083
He just shed his skin.

208
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,083
- Hey.
- Just a sec.

209
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,083
- Can't you go faster?
- It's an electric seat.

210
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:01,041
Hey, man, slow down a bit.
It's too close.

211
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,625
Left.

212
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,875
Left, dude!

213
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,041
Fuck, that was too late.

214
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,166
- I'll go around.
- Speed the hell up.

215
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,375
How would I know he'd take the exit?

216
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,583
Should we call it quits?

217
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:41,166
It's obvious he knew we were tailing him.

218
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,583
Even if he didn't, we don't even know
if he'd be on board with our plan.

219
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:45,666
Hold on a sec.

220
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,625
I might remember his number.

221
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,958

Thank you, table three.
Next up, our guests from table seven.

00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,250
I need to pee. Be right back.

232
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,333
Hey!

233
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,625
You little shits!

234
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,041
Why the fuck did you follow me here?

235
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,250
Quiet?

236
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,083
Quiet, huh?

237
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:50,666
Fine.

238
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,333
So?

239
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,416
Why did you follow me?

240
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,166
Actually,

241
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,000
we didn't follow you.

242
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,166
We're just here for some drinks.

243
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,583
This place seemed like a nice
hang out spot, so we stopped by,

244
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:53,625
since there aren't
many good drinking spots around.

245
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,291
You suck at lying.

246
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,083
I saw you tailing me from my house.

247
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,833
Did you wanna rob me?

248
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,666
Are you sure?

249
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,833
- Huh?
- I'm sorry, but…

250
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,583
we're really not planning on
doing anything like that…

251
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,583
We're here to discuss business.

252
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:26,666
What business?

253
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,625
I asked, what business?

254
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:37,625
Temple business.

255
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,000
You mean temple services?

256
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,166
Morning and evening chanting?

257
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,791
We want to hire you as a consultant.

258
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:00,541
What's a "con-sultan?"

259
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:05,958
Well…

260
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,375
Like an advisor.

261
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,666
We want you to advise us on our project

262
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,125
to develop and rebrand Phummaram Temple.

263
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,875
With tens of thousands
of temples in the Thai market,

264
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,333
getting one percent market share
for Phummaram Temple

265
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,166
will be enough to make us rich.

266
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,500
I think we can get five percent.

267
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,250
An all-inclusive Buddhist commerce,
aiming for a 1,000% short-term profit.

268
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:32,625
In simpler terms, it means…
we're looking to benefit from the temple,

269
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:35,000
like what you're doing.

270
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,250
Hey.

271
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,958
Here's how it goes. Simply put,

272
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,166
we'll run the temple to make it famous.

273
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,041
Then, people will start flocking in.

274
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,416
You know what that brings?

275
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,416
Money.

276
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:51,833
There's a million ways of doing business.
We just saw an opportunity here.

277
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:57,833
We're willing to offer you 40,000 baht
per month, excluding bonuses.

278
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:01,750
Your role would be giving us advice
and to take action on things we can't do.

279
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:05,500
Oh.

280
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,791
It's an advance payment.

281
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,500
I didn't think you guys
would be this much fucked up.

282
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,958
You guys are real pieces of shit.

283
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:26,708
I never thought in my life I'd hear
something so seriously fucked up.

284
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:31,500
Then…

285
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,166
just pretend you never heard it.

286
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:39,125
You guys think
you can just leave like that?

287
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:40,541
Look, uncle.

288
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,666
We came to discuss business.

289
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,250
If you're not on board, then we're done.

290
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:50,750
What you guys said,
you think it will be that easy?

291
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,750
You mentioned bonuses. How much?

292
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:11,666
When the temple hits the break-even point,
we'll give you five percent.

293
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:17,250
That means if the temple makes, say…

294
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:20,041
ten million baht, then you'll take

295
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:21,666
five hundred thousand.

296
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,291
- Five hundred thousand?
- Um.

297
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,625
Alright? If you're in,
you can sign the contract.

298
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:31,291
Ten percent.

299
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:33,625
How about seven?

300
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:35,541
Fifteen.

301
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:40,041
Fine, ten percent. But we'll handle
all the temple's accounts.

302
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,125
Deal.

303
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:44,125
But I need to be in the loop
about everything.

304
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:47,916
If I ever catch you guys being sneaky…

305
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,750
Then the first job you need to do is
getting us into the temple.

306
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:59,083
Sure.
I'll take you to the abbot.

307
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:03,166
But tell this white bitch to dye her hair.

308
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,833
It's hurting my eyes.

309
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:08,166
NARUETHIP WATER COMPANY'S
DONATION TO PHUMMARAM TEMPLE

310
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:15,333
Sure you wanna use
my family's name?

311
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:16,250
Yeah.

312
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,125
It seems most credible.

313
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:20,583
People will see it
as a big company doing CSR.

314
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,666
Or we could use my dad's name.

315
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:26,666
"Roger Kennethsmith the Third."

316
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,875
Huh.

317
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:29,958
Hey.

318
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:32,041
Chitchatting? Are you ready?

319
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,291
The abbot is ready.

320
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,083
Okay.

321
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,250
We've got water, Father.

322
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,708
It's the water from the company
of these young folks.

323
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:47,375
It's clean and refreshing, Father.

324
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:54,916
Is it cool, Father?

325
00:23:57,375 --> 00:24:01,083
These young folks proposed
a development project for our temple.

326
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:05,708
I can see their good intentions,
so I'd like to help promote their water.

327
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:12,833
It's rare to see young people
taking an interest in Buddhism.

328
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:16,875
They're putting in a lot of effort,
so I'm supporting them.

329
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:19,333
Who says young peepee… bah!

330
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,291
Who says young people don't go to temple?

331
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:24,500
Here they are.
These three kids right here.

332
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:32,625
They're determined
to preserve Buddhism,

333
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:34,291
and support our temple.

334
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:37,000
What are you guys planning to do?

335
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:44,875
Well, we have prepared slides
to present to you our project.

336
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:46,541
Here it is.

337
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:51,083
PHUMMARAM TEMPLE,
CHACHOENGSAO

338
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:53,000
The way we see it,

339
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:58,083
the beauty of the location
is the first thing that attracts people.

340
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:02,541
So, we'd like to renovate the temple.
We'll do it in three phases.

341
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:06,458
In the first phase, we'll begin by
restoring what's already there and…

342
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:07,750
Hold on.

343
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,833
I actually don't have any issues.

344
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:16,625
In fact, I want to thank you

345
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:19,625
for donating
all these things to the temple.

346
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:21,875
But…

347
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:30,625
I'm quite old.

348
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:34,041
I might not be able to offer much help.

349
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:39,750
But based on what you've told me,
it seems pretty interesting.

350
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:44,291
Let's just say that, from now on,

351
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:47,583
I'll entrust Tang to supervise you guys.

352
00:25:47,666 --> 00:25:48,500
Of course.

353
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:50,875
Let's help each other out.

354
00:25:54,541 --> 00:25:56,291
Damn it.

355
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:59,333
I worked on these slides all night<i>.</i>

356
00:25:59,416 --> 00:26:00,958
Asshole, that was me.

357
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:03,583
- It's the same thing.
- How is it the same?

358
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:08,666
Do you see now
how much the abbot trusts me?

359
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:17,000
The bill
for the microphone.

360
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,833
So, what's your plan?

361
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,458
First thing,

362
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:34,791
start with renovation.

363
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:37,375
We'll give life back
to the temple that looks abandoned.

364
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:38,750
Alright, back up.

365
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:42,583
Straight back, slowly, back up.

366
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:45,416
Careful. Back up. Okay, stop.

367
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,083
Watch out, a sidecar's coming.
Go, sidecar.

368
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:51,125
You can go. Thanks. Put them down gently.

369
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:54,958
Here, I bought you guys new paint.
Paint it nicely and get the job done.

370
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:56,166
Okay.

371
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,333
Oh, it's good you're here.
Pay me back 20,000 for the paint.

372
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:02,166
Get closer, Note.

373
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,833
Get closer.

374
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:05,916
Get a little closer.

375
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,791
Keep smoking them out.

376
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:09,916
Damn it, closer.

377
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,583
Come on, they're just bees.
What are you afraid of?

378
00:27:12,666 --> 00:27:14,333
I think top right, eye-level.

380
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:19,916
The previous spot was good.
People can see it easily.

381
00:27:24,791 --> 00:27:26,833
No, that spot's better.
Easier to put money.

382
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:28,125
Move it back.

383
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:30,416
Fuck that.
You know what user experience is?

384
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,375
Arrive, pray, put in money. Easy.

385
00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:33,875
This way's better. Trust me.

386
00:27:36,791 --> 00:27:38,708
Hey. Move it back.

387
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:43,583
Okay, bro?

388
00:27:44,416 --> 00:27:45,250
Okay.

389
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:47,916
Wait a minute.

390
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,333
Everything you've mentioned needs money.

391
00:27:52,375 --> 00:27:53,708
Are you rich or something?

392
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:56,083
I'm going all in on this.

393
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:59,291
Is there any chance
you could lower the price?

394
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:03,375
This is the lowest I can give you.
I've done a lot of interior work on it.

395
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:05,000
Alright, okay.

396
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,458
Send me your account details.

397
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:08,041
I'll transfer you the money.

I'm going digital with the temple's

403
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:43,750
One, two, three. Okay,

404
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:44,750
Turn to your left.

405
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,916
One, two, okay. Look straight ahead.

406
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:51,166

407
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,666

414
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,250
<i>Right. We'll move money</i>
<i>and accounts over to handle on DeFi.</i>

415
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:19,458
<i>And pay off some debts with it.</i>

416
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:22,333
<i>Candles, incense, and gold leaves</i>

Note, just get closer.
What are you afraid of?

427
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:51,208
- Come on.
- Wait. Let's hold it.

428
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:52,208
Those are bees.

429
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,000
- Hurry up.
- What bees?

430
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,875
Those bees.

431
00:29:57,666 --> 00:29:59,583
- I said hold it.
- What?

432
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:02,416
So, what do you want me to do?
It's hot, you know?

433
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:04,708
- Leave it there for now.
- Huh?

434
00:30:05,916 --> 00:30:06,791
What the hell?

Boo!

437
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:32,041
You're doing this in the temple?

438
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:35,708
- Oh.
- Umm.

439
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:37,000
Cheers.

440
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:39,625
Um.

441
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:44,916
That sounds good, but…

442
00:30:46,208 --> 00:30:47,625
But fucking what now?

443
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:53,291
Did you guys take Buddhism classes
when you were kids?

444
00:30:54,458 --> 00:30:55,541
I got an A.

445
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:56,500
I got a C.

446
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,375
Okay, then.

447
00:30:58,458 --> 00:31:00,625
What are some Buddhist Holy Days?

448
00:31:02,916 --> 00:31:05,041
Magha Puja, Visakha Puja,

449
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:07,541
Buddhist Lent, End of Buddhist Lent,
Asalha Puja.

450
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:09,583
Not bad.

451
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:13,791
You know, temples can survive
because people come to make merit.

452
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:17,666
But people don't come
to make merit every day. You see?

453
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:21,916
That's why we have to make
the most of those Holy Days.

454
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:26,541
The first one,

455
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:30,125
Magha Puja.

456
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:31,375
THE MAGHA PUJA OF 1976…

457
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:34,291
<i>It was the day</i>
<i>when monks gathered together.</i>

458
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:35,916
All 1,250 of them.

459
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:37,541
Right.

460
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:39,916
It's a very boring day.

461
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,791
Visakha Puja

462
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,375
is the day of Buddha's birth,

463
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:52,583
enlightenment, and death.

464
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:56,166
And we walk around the temple building
three times.

465
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,250
But this day,

466
00:32:01,791 --> 00:32:04,041
Buddhist Lent, is a big deal.

467
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,666
Both the start and end of it

468
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:17,500
are when we have major events.

469
00:32:18,666 --> 00:32:20,583
A big crowd will show up.

470
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:25,916
During these times, you'll get hundreds,
thousands of envelopes.

471
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,125
Countless temples rally people to donate.

472
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:33,208
Kathina events
just keep on going one after another.

473
00:32:33,291 --> 00:32:35,875
That's all you need to focus on.

474
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,916
Can we get things done in time?

475
00:32:42,625 --> 00:32:43,625
In time for what?

476
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:48,125
Oh, I mean, we have to…

477
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,833
do…

478
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:51,541
the soft opening.

479
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:54,708
What? "Oh, Penny?"

480
00:32:54,791 --> 00:32:56,750
Okay, let's keep this simple.

481
00:32:56,833 --> 00:32:58,833
What days are coming up soon?

482
00:32:59,916 --> 00:33:03,750
Coming up soon, in April, there's…

483
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:24,541
Hey, Auntie. Why has no one shown up?

484
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:29,458
Hey, can I request a song?
I'm bored out of my mind.

485
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:32,083
Sure.

486
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:44,500
Many people are here to make merit.

487
00:33:45,208 --> 00:33:47,958
- Merit, my ass. They came for free water.
- Oh.

488
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:52,791
Yeah!

489
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:54,833
Oh, god!

490
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:56,125
Shit, stop it!

491
00:33:58,291 --> 00:34:00,583
Hey! Stop right there!

492
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:08,208
The bills.

493
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,250
For decorations, supplies, labor,

494
00:34:11,791 --> 00:34:12,791
gasoline.

495
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,791
Game will transfer the money.

496
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:20,250
Opening a temple

497
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:24,666
isn't as exciting
as opening an amusement park, you know?

498
00:34:26,708 --> 00:34:29,333
With temple, you need to take it slow.

499
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:31,625
If everything is complete,

500
00:34:31,708 --> 00:34:33,833
what can people donate for to make merit?

501
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:37,958
My face is tight.

502
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:52,958
I feel like
we might have messed something up,

503
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:57,000
Nobody's showing up for this damn event
even though it's a big one.

504
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:02,958
Based on what I've seen,
famous temples often come with legends

505
00:35:03,041 --> 00:35:08,458
Like drifting Buddha statues,
or a temple that didn't burn down.

506
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:12,958
That'd take too long. We've just bought
the principle Buddha near the Giant Swing.

507
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:14,791
We can create something new.

508
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:19,500
What should we do, then?

509
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:22,333
How about this?

510
00:35:23,291 --> 00:35:24,666
Let's just go with ghosts.

511
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:28,166
We can get… what are their names?
Mor Pla and Pong to come.

512
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:30,333
Let's go all out on this.

513
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:33,416
Then people would show up here
looking for ghosts.

514
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,208
No one would come to donate money.

515
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:43,250
If we wait for the major
Buddhist holidays, it might be too risky.

516
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:48,791
Or I'll hire fake supporters for now
but I think it's just a waste of money.

517
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:52,333
- That's true.
- Yeah.

518
00:35:58,541 --> 00:35:59,583
Let me think.

519
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,041
Do you miss him?

520
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:10,500
Hmm?

521
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:13,375
What?

522
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:15,458
Oh, hell no.

523
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:18,500
Why the hell would I miss him?
I ditched him long ago.

524
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:21,708
- It's her ex.
- What? That's crazy. He's your ex?

525
00:36:21,791 --> 00:36:22,791
PAWI
GREEN TEA

526
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:25,083
No shit. Are you serious?

527
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:28,083
He's fucking famous. My mom loves him.

528
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,416
He's got lots of presenter gigs.

529
00:36:30,916 --> 00:36:34,291
- Um.
- Dang, that's really something.

530
00:36:37,458 --> 00:36:38,291
Hey!

531
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:41,291
