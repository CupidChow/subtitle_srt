1
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:21,083
Not okay. Next.

2
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:24,000
<i>- Please repeat after me.</i>
- Let me see.

3
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:26,666
Hey, this one seems promising.

4
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,916
<i>Ten, twenty, thirty, forty</i>

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,583
<i>Monks love riding a car.</i>
<i>Monks love riding a boat.</i>

6
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,833
<i>Anicca vata sankhara.</i>
<i>Conditioned things are impermanent</i>…

7
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:36,750
Pass.

8
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:39,166
<i>Forced love is like</i>
<i>a pair of shoes that are</i>

9
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,125
<i>too tight and uncomfortable for your feet</i>.

10
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:46,041
<i>But good love is like</i>
<i>a comfortable pair of shoes,</i>

11
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:47,125
<i>which are…</i>

12
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:51,416
<i>Carlos shoes.</i>

13
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,833
Hold on. What the fuck is this?

14
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:55,375
An IG model?

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,625
Let's stop for now.

16
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:05,208
Let's start with eliminating
some of these choices.

17
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:08,666
Let's eliminate the ones
who don't seem okay first.

18
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:12,708
PAWI GREEN TEA

19
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:13,833
<i>This one, out.</i>

20
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:18,291
But the rest shouldn't be too old.
We should target younger people.

21
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:23,625
But we can't choose someone too young
because they aren't admirable.

22
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:27,750
- Hey, we've got one.
- Hmm?

23
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:31,500
Monk Dong-Won, half Thai and Korean.
This type is trendy now.

24
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:32,791
This one?

25
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:36,291
- Do we have any clips of him?
- Here.

26
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:38,041
I'll find one.

27
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:39,125
<i>Annyeonghaseyo.</i>

28
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:43,458
<i>Greetings. I'm a foreign monk.</i>

29
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:44,375
Hey.

30
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:47,666
- <i>I was born in Korea.</i>
- <i>Oppa.</i>

31
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:52,625
<i>In a city where there is no Buddhism.</i>

32
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:54,416
<i>But the truth is</i>

33
00:01:54,916 --> 00:02:01,791
<i>regardless of where we were born,</i>
<i>we can all be a Dharma successor.</i>

34
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,958
Which temple does he reside in? And…

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,375
What's his price?

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,208
Umm…

37
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,333
Dharma Niwet Sawat Forest Temple.

38
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:17,625
If we're going for a monk this famous,
we need to prepare a good deal.

39
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,500
We have no time left.

40
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:24,166
It's almost time we pay our debt.
We should get him for now.

41
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,708
I'm fine with him. You?

42
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,666
You're coming with me, Game.

43
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,875
- Dear, you take care of the flea market.
- Okay.

44
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:33,166
Will we make it back
before my sister's delivery?

45
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:35,541
Of course. Just for a few days.

46
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:36,625
Okay.

47
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,666
Hey. We're here.

48
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,166
- Take this one.
- Okay.

49
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,000
- How much is it?
- It's 120.

50
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:12,791
So, there's going to be
a flea market at Phummaram Temple.

51
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,541
If you want to sell pomelos there,
call this number.

52
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,250
- This number?
- That's right.

53
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,416
Holy smokes.

54
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:27,666
So many people.

55
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,791
If you're interested,
you can call the number down there.

56
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:31,750
Sure.

57
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,375
Hello?

58
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,625
<i>Hello, Dear. It's me, Pui.</i>

59
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,625
<i>- Do you remember me?</i>
<i>- </i>Oh, Pui. What's up?

60
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,125
<i>Hey, so…</i>

61
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,208
- Dear?
- I<i>'m getting married.</i>

62
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:51,708
You are Buddhists.
You must know

63
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,625
what the Four Noble Truths are, right?

64
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:57,333
Suffering, the cause of suffering,
the end of suffering, and the path.

65
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,416
Good. You're good at memorizing.

66
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:03,250
<i>The teachings</i>
<i>of Lord Buddha…</i>

67
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,208
Fuck, we can't get in.

68
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,583
ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT

69
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,125
Wait. Be right back.

70
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:20,750
Excuse me.

71
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,791
- Hello.
- Hello.

72
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:28,083
What do I have to do
if I want to meet Monk Dong-Won?

73
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,291
You can't make a booking now, dear.

74
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:33,333
People made their bookings
months in advance.

75
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,958
Is there any way to squeeze me in?

76
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:42,916
The thing is,
I'd like to make donations to the temple.

77
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,208
- There.
- Yes?

78
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:51,708
That group over there
has booked us for the whole week.

79
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,041
Why did it take so long?

80
00:04:56,916 --> 00:05:01,000
I found a way for us
to meet Monk Dong-Won.

81
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:04,791
Over there.

82
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,083
Sadhu.

83
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,791
By the way, Dear,
have you talked to Win at all?

84
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:28,750
Yes, sometimes.

85
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,625
What has he been doing lately?
Do you know?

86
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,583
He doesn't tell me
about things.

87
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:35,541
I see.

88
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,750
You get prettier the more you grow up.

89
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,833
Has Win ever hit on you?

90
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,291
- Win doesn't know how to flirt.
- Is that so?

91
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:53,333
<i>The votes are unanimous.</i>
<i>Two hundred-time champion.</i>

92
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:54,916
See? I knew it.

93
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,291
No one has been able
to take him down.

94
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,583
He's tough. Do you know
he's signing a contract with a label?

95
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,916
He's my new favorite one.

96
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,416
- Shit. I'm leaving.
- Just go.

97
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,708
<i>…200 times in Thailand</i>

98
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,000
<i>in this competition of...</i>

99
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:14,125
<i>Incredible. Tell us how you feel.</i>

100
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,541
<i>I feel pretty excited…</i>

101
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,333
- I'll get braised fish maw.
- I'll get Nam Phrik Long Ruea.

102
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,291
- Hello, sisters.
- Hi there.

103
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,916
I bought you some drinks.

104
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,208
I saw you sitting up there for so long,
thought you might be thirsty.

105
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,291
- You're so sweet.
- Thank you.

106
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,250
My name is Game. It's my first time here.

107
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,083
How did you know about this place?

108
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,583
My sister recommended this place to me.

109
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:40,375
She wanted me to come
and listen to his sermon,

110
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,958
so I came and I was very impressed.

111
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,666
- He preaches so well.
- Yes.

112
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,750
He's kind and good at preaching.

113
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:48,791
He's very good.

114
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,458
<i>I don't want to show you.</i>
<i>You didn't come.</i>

115
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,875
Sis, I'm sorry.

116
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,541
I'm really caught up with work. Please…

117
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:02,291
I'm begging you.
Let me see my niece's face. Please?

118
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,291
<i>Fine.</i>

119
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,000
<i>Well? Is she cute?</i>

120
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,375
Wow!

121
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,500
So how was the labor?

122
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,458
<i>It was okay, nothing out of ordinary.</i>

123
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:16,416
<i>But my belly still hurts</i>
<i>and I felt a bit dizzy.</i>

124
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,625
Then you should get some rest.

125
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,625
And don't force yourself to work. Got it?

126
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,208
All right. Okay.

127
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,250
I've got work in the morning. Bye.

128
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,375
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

129
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,291
Bye, niece. Bye.

130
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,541
HI, I'M GAME. NICE TO MEET YOU.

131
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,458
MONK DONG-WON WILL GIVE SERMON AT 7AM

132
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:52,708
- Hey.
- Hmm?

133
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,333
- Got toothpaste?
- In my bag.

134
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:58,708
- Oh.
- Um.

135
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,583
Why are you smiling?

136
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,666
Because I got into the temple's VIP group.

137
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:08,083
The aunties said we could meet
Monk Dong-Won after his sermon.

138
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,125
What time's the alarm?

139
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,041
Well, they said to be there at eight, so…

140
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,458
What would be good? Seven?

141
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,875
So freaking early.

142
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,541
- I'm not taking a shower tomorrow.
- Okay.

143
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:25,291
<i>The Dhamma is</i>
<i>well elaborated by the Exalted One</i>.

144
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:28,041
<i>I pay homage to the Dhamma.</i>

145
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,291
<i>The Sangha, the Blessed One's disciples…</i>

146
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,875
Did we get here on time?

147
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,291
<i>I pay homage to the Sangha</i>

148
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:43,291
<i>Venerable Sir,</i>
<i>we request the Three Refuges</i>

149
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:46,583
<i>and the Five Precepts</i>

150
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:50,291
<i>For the second time,</i>
<i>May we, O Venerable Sir…</i>

151
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,000
Where'd the oppa go?

152
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,625
Check the group chat.

153
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,000
Shit, I forgot to turn off
<i>airplane mode. </i>Fuck.

154
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:04,916
You idiot.

155
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:09,750
Fuck.

156
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,500
Monk Dong-Won went to Bangkok
for a TV show.

157
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:19,000
Let's go. I told them
we'd meet them in Bangkok.

158
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,250
- Hold on.
- What?

159
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,000
So who are these people here for?

160
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:25,791
How am I supposed to know?

161
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,666
Let's go.

162
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,083
All right.

163
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:34,875
Rest your mind. Stay conscious.

164
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,666
Someone once asked the Lord Buddha,

165
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,750
"If you were to make your teachings
as short as possible, what would you say?"

166
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,333
He said only one sentence,

167
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,208
"The heart of all the teachings is…

168
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,958
we shouldn't hold on to Dharma."

169
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,833
When our minds want to hear a sermon,

170
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,750
do they suffer?

171
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:15,000
The minds that want to make merit,
make alms offerings,

172
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:18,750
and make robe offerings to monks,
do they suffer?

173
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:23,750
If those are burdens to the mind,
then it will suffer.

174
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,166
When it's lost, it will suffer.

175
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,625
The soul will relax.

176
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:36,916
It's hard to recognize the attachment
to goodness. Are moral precepts good?

177
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,208
<i>What about meditation? Is it good?</i>

178
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,083
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

179
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,583
<i>What about wisdom? Is it good?</i>

180
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:47,541
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

181
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,458
<i>They are all good.</i>

182
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,416
<i>It's easy to put down bad things,</i>

183
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:59,250
<i>but it's hard to put down good things.</i>

184
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,583
<i>We have moral precepts</i>

185
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,375
<i>as our tools to get into meditation.</i>

186
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,541
We have meditation to enhance our wisdom.

187
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,083
So, we won't hold on
to the moral precepts,

188
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,750
we won't hold on to the meditation,

189
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,666
or even wisdom.

190
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,416
If we pray
and focus on adhering to the wisdom,

191
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,708
our minds will be distracted

192
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,583
and not peaceful.

193
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,875
But we need morals, meditation, and wisdom

194
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,291
to attain the path to nirvana.

195
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:42,083
And if our meditation, wisdom,
and morals are complete,

196
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,083
the path to nirvana will appear by itself.

197
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,750
Holy shit. He got me good.

198
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,208
ASMR.

199
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:53,625
What's that?

200
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:57,708
Let's go with him.

201
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,666
THE BELIEVERS

202
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:10,500
Hey.

203
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:15,708
Do you agree that he preaches
much better than Monk Dong-Won?

204
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:17,708
Make a deal.

205
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,791
Okay.

206
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,125
After I take a dump.

207
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,291
Grandma.

208
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,791
Let me help you carry that.

209
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,291
Do you walk here every day?

210
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:10,208
Not every day.
There are too many people these days.

211
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,250
I can't fight with the crowd.

212
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,708
I only come on some days
Monk Dol gives his sermon.

213
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:21,125
- Is he the one who gave a sermon just now?
- Right.

214
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,416
Were you listening?

215
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:27,791
It's good that a youngster like you
visits the temple.

216
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,916
But his sermons are really good.

217
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,916
Why do you like Monk Dol?

218
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,750
Well, how should I put it?

219
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:45,291
His teachings are both easy

220
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:46,958
and difficult.

221
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:50,583
He focuses on letting people
practice it themselves.

222
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:56,250
He once thought of building
a Dharma retreat pavilion,

223
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:00,458
but the construction
has been halted for many years.

224
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,541
I guess the temple
doesn't have enough budget.

225
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:09,916
What kind of pavilion?

226
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,333
WIN IS INVITING YOU TO THE MEETING

227
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,000
Hey. You guys've been gone for a while.

228
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,500
<i>We have changed the monk.</i>

229
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,416
How come?

230
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,625
This one works better,
but we need something.

231
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,041
<i>The monk</i>
<i>we're inviting is into practices.</i>

232
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,458
Remember Tang said
temples must be built slowly

233
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,541
so people can take their time
making merit?

234
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:45,375
I think this project will be the
start of our fundraising

235
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,583
and convince this monk
to come to our temple.

236
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:54,000
Look at this space. I think
a Dharma retreat pavilion would fit here.

237
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:57,625
<i>The temple's mood and tone fit the idea</i>
<i>of minimal pavilion you wanted to do.</i>

238
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:03,416
It's a nice idea.
There are a lot of trees too.

239
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:05,958
Here.

240
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,083
We are going to

241
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,250
<i>trade a pavilion for Monk Dol.</i>

242
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:15,458
<i>We'll build duo pavilions,</i>
<i>make it parallel to the one at our temple,</i>

243
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,458
make it a coordinated project.

244
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:21,791
This'll help us win over temples that are
trying to encourage people to practice.

245
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:26,333
If everyone's on board, I'll ask
the aunties for the abbot's contact.

246
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:31,875
<i>Can you draw a rough plan of the pavilion?</i>
<i>I need it to talk to the abbot.</i>

247
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,500
- Okay, give me the location.
<i>- Send it tomorrow.</i>

248
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,083
Okay, I guess?

249
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:40,750
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

250
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,166
Dear.

251
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,916
Here are my design samples
of your wedding card. Have a look

252
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,125
and tell me which one you like.

253
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,041
Which one do you like?

254
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:08,708
Umm…

255
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,208
I'll go with the design you like.

256
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,208
Can you oversee the setup of my wedding?

257
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:21,041
The one the hotel sent me sucks.

258
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:24,458
But I've never worked on
a wedding setup before.

259
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:28,166
It's okay. You can have your first tryout
with my wedding.

260
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,541
I trust you.

261
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,833
- Really?
- Just do it.

262
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,333
Excuse me, sir.
Could you please come this way?

263
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,250
Sure.

264
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:37,875
This way.

265
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,875
You said you'd never
fall in love again after Toh.

266
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:50,583
Hey, we don't have to
always stay true to our word.

267
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,041
What an asshole.

268
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,250
So, what do you do now?

269
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,708
I'm working with a friend.

270
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,125
Who?

271
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:00,625
Win.

272
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:02,666
Win?

273
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,416
Which Win?

274
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,791
Win Peerapat.

275
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,791
Win Peerapat from Class Five?

276
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,250
What? Are you still with him?

277
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,833
Holy shit. What an eternal love.

278
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,208
Love, my ass.

279
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,625
Come on. Everyone at school knew.

280
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,875
We're just friends, bitch.

281
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,875
If you say so.

282
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:27,125
So, will you help me with the setup?

283
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,166
Fine, I'll do it.

284
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm so relieved to have you work it.

285
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,666
Let's continue looking.

286
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,333
I heard from Waew.

287
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,083
Are you guys here to ordain?

288
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:47,708
Oh, no, Father. We're not going to ordain.

289
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:49,750
Umm.

290
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,625
What do you want?

291
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:57,833
You see, we have been entrusted
by the abbot of Phummaram Temple

292
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:01,916
to renovate it in order to
attract the younger generation,

293
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,416
so they can get better access to Dharma.

294
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,125
Right.

295
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:10,583
But I have to be honest with you.

296
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:14,208
No matter what we do,
the youngsters can't get into Dharma,

297
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:18,625
but then we found this temple
and Monk Dol.

298
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,416
What? Monk Dol?

299
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,000
Well, I'd never thought
that a monk like Monk Dol

300
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:28,416
would be able to strike
Dharma into my heart like that.

301
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:33,916
That's why we want to build this.

302
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,041
It's a Dharma retreat pavilion

303
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:40,583
with teachings aligning
with the ones of Phummaram Temple.

304
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:43,625
In other words,
we want to build a twin pavilion.

305
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,166
I'm going to call this project
"Merit Baskets."

306
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:52,625
We need a representative
from this temple to spread the teachings

307
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,458
and set up the project
in the initial phase.

308
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,583
What do you think?

309
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,041
Um…

310
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,583
This project seems interesting,

311
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,958
but it's a matter of forest
versus city temples.

312
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:11,541
It's not appropriate
for a forest temple monk

313
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,041
to stay at a city temple

314
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:19,875
because each temple has its own practices.

315
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:26,375
Well, you don't need to worry about that.
We'll take good care of Monk Dol.

316
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:30,250
And we'll escort him back here before…

317
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,583
Buddhist Lent Day.

318
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:36,375
Are you guys really determined to do this?

319
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,666
Yes.

320
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,000
Then you should go and ask him.

321
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,500
Let him make his own decision.

322
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,333
Okay, Father.

323
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,208
Well then, we'll get going.

324
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,583
I'm sorry,
but I have to decline your offer.

325
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:18,875
I just think it would be inappropriate
to abandon this temple.

326
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,291
But I can see you have good intentions.

327
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:29,416
What you're planning to do
is a very good thing.

328
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,041
What do you have issue with?

329
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,916
If people really want to practice,

330
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:42,708
coming here may help them gain
more knowledge and understanding.

331
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:46,541
What about those
who can't afford to do so?

332
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,666
I've been ordained here
since I was a novice.

333
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,000
I've never been to any other temples.

334
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:01,625
I've always been here.

335
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,083
And most importantly,

336
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,416
the practices of each temple
are different.

337
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:12,958
Well, you can practice
whichever way you're comfortable with.

338
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:17,041
And if you need anything,
we'll prepare it for you.

339
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,166
Then I would be bothering you.

340
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:23,250
I shouldn't bother or trouble anyone.

341
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,958
No, we wouldn't be troubled at all.

342
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:29,916
Venerable Brother,

343
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:35,333
anything we do to promote Buddhism
is considered a good thing, isn't it?

344
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:42,166
I want the elders at Phummaram Temple
to have a chance to listen to your sermon.

345
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,291
We've talked to the abbot.
He has no problem with this.

346
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,791
And personally, I think that…

347
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,125
whether you're a forest or a city monk,

348
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:57,416
you're all under
the refuge of Lord Buddha.

349
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,250
There's no need for segregation.

350
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:06,291
There are many people
who want to access the teachings,

351
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:09,500
but they don't have a chance to
because they don't live here.

352
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,458
When we listened to your sermon that day,

353
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:16,666
we thought our Dharma retreat pavilion
project would fill this gap.

354
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:24,625
I want the teachings of Lord Buddha
to be spread even further.

355
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:33,708
Wouldn't you agree?

356
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:42,541
Let's just say that

357
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,416
I understand your purpose now.

358
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,041
What's that supposed to mean?

359
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:01,875
Do I look like a monk to you?

360
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,500
<i>Welcome all</i>
<i>to our temple.</i>

361
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:17,541
<i>Welcome.</i>

362
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:21,916
MERIT-MAKING BOOTH
PHUMMARAM TEMPLE

363
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,291
<i>Offer the land yes.</i>

364
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:30,333
<i>Offer the building is considered</i>
<i>offering properties.</i>

365
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:34,166
Let's go and meet
the abbot at the pavilion.

366
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Hey.

367
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:50,458
PHUMMARAM TEMPLE

368
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:54,916
FLOWERS INCENSE CANDLES

369
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,208
Hey, White Girl.

370
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:01,666
Let's greet the abbot.

371
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,000
Hi there.

372
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:09,958
It's "namaskar" when greeting a monk.

373
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,083
- Sorry.
- Please come this way.

374
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,208
Namaskar, Venerable Father.

375
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:38,666
Bless you.

376
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:43,000
I would like to stay
at this temple for three months.

377
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,291
Please consider approving my request.

378
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:47,458
Um.

379
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:52,291
But you must adjust yourself
in many ways if you stay here.

380
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:54,666
Are you up for that?

381
00:24:57,875 --> 00:24:58,791
Yes.

382
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:01,458
Um.

383
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:06,000
From now on,
I'll leave this temple to you.

384
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:10,500
If many people come here
to make merit and do good deeds,

385
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:12,250
then that's a good thing.

386
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:14,666
Yes, Venerable Father.

387
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:30,958
Excuse me.

388
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:35,666
May I have you check out
the retreat pavilion's construction site?

389
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:45,041
MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO THE CONSTRUCTION
OF A DHARMA RETREAT PAVILION

390
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:47,791
PHUMARAM TEMPLE
AND DHARMA NIWET SAWAT TEMPLE

391
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:52,333
So, this is where
the retreat pavilion will be built.

392
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:55,541
And this is where the gable will be.

393
00:25:55,625 --> 00:26:00,291
It will be facing
the Dharma Niwet Sawat Forest Temple,

394
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:02,875
which fits our concept of "Merit Baskets".

395
00:26:05,791 --> 00:26:07,166
Do as you see fit.

396
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:13,333
Alright. As for the
entire list of materials,

397
00:26:13,416 --> 00:26:15,916
I'll show you the specifications later.

398
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:19,250
Now, let me take you…

399
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,208
Let me invite you to come this way.

400
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:31,083
MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO THE CONSTRUCTION
OF A DHARMA RETREAT PAVILION

401
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,500
Please welcome our next contestant
for the folk song singing contest.

402
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:38,833
Dome!

403
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:40,583
PHUMMARAM TEMPLE INVITES YOU

404
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:43,625
TO VISIT, TASTE, WATCH AND SHOP
AT THE FESTIVAL FROM 9-15 OF JULY

405
00:26:43,708 --> 00:26:45,750
JOIN IN THE BIG MERIT-MAKING EVENT

406
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:59,583
Hot damn. That dude is so sick.

407
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:07,375
Seriously though,
Dear's ideas are freaking good.

408
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:09,708
So many people came. Look around.

409
00:27:09,791 --> 00:27:12,583
Would you like to ask me anything?

410
00:27:12,666 --> 00:27:13,666
No, I'm good.

411
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:15,166
Alright, then.

412
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:19,000
There's a flea market
and a singing contest today.

413
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:21,458
Do you want to try out?

414
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,375
I can't. It's against the sila.

415
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:25,958
I see.

416
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:27,916
Sorry.

417
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:31,583
This is Note.

418
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:34,041
- He'll escort you to your residence.
- Namaskar.

419
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:08,416
<i>The Blessed One</i>
<i>who fully attained enlightenment.</i>

420
00:28:08,916 --> 00:28:12,458
<i>The teaching that has been expounded well.</i>

421
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:16,583
<i>The disciples</i>
<i>who have been practicing diligently.</i>

422
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:21,000
<i>The Buddha, The Dhamma, The Sangha.</i>

423
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:27,958
You're leaving so early.
Aren't you going with us later?

424
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,875
I want to explore other routes.

425
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:33,166
I see. Please go ahead.

426
00:28:43,666 --> 00:28:46,041
Okay. Please turn left this time.

427
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:47,958
Left, please. Looking good.

428
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:50,083
Look at the camera. Yes.

429
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:53,041
A bit to the left. Just a little. Yes.

430
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:56,541
Alright. Please look back at the camera.

431
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:59,166
Please smile a little. Just relax.

432
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,083
Alright.

433
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:03,083
Smile and relax. Smile.

434
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:09,666
Well?

435
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,833
These look great.

436
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,333
No more Monk Dong-Won?

437
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:13,833
No, not anymore.

438
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:18,291
Hey, but this one does look admirable.

439
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:19,708
I know, right?

440
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:22,375
I thought it was just me.

441
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:25,000
Let's say I'm not charging you
for this set.

442
00:29:25,541 --> 00:29:27,833
- What? Seriously?
- Take it as my contribution.

443
00:29:27,916 --> 00:29:29,916
Wow, I rejoice in your merit. Sadhu.

444
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:31,958
Thank you.

445
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:35,416
- I'll get back to work.
- Sure. Thank you.

446
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:46,750
COME AND LISTEN TO A SERMON

447
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:50,333

A SERMON BY MONK DOL SANTAJITTO

454
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:19,708
Greetings,
ladies and gentlemen.

455
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:21,583
You're invited to a sermon

456
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,708
by a monk from Hat Yai.

457
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:27,625
Monk Dol, a new monk
with a great face and voice.

458
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:30,208
He can resonate with people of all ages.

459
00:30:30,291 --> 00:30:34,625
The sermon is at 5 p.m. I repeat, 5 p.m.

460
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,708
Those who come to practice Dharma…

461
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:41,625
<i>Homage to the Blessed One,</i>
<i>the Worthy One, the Self-Awakened One.</i>

462
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:45,958
<i>Homage to the Blessed One,</i>
<i>the Worthy One, the Self-Awakened One.</i>

463
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:49,250
Hey, when he's finished chanting.
Let's start shooting.

464
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,291
<i>…the Self-Awakened One.</i>

465
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:58,208
<i>I've come here today</i>
<i>to give a Dharma talk.</i>

466
00:30:58,291 --> 00:31:02,000
<i>Please put your hands down.</i>

467
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:04,166
<i>Sit in a comfortable position and relax.</i>

468
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:06,875
<i>Buddhism</i>

469
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,458
is a complex religion.

470
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:13,208
You must practice it by yourself.

472
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,458
<i>But most people</i>

473
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,458
<i>only focus on making wishes</i>

474
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:23,166
and rely on holy things,

475
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
never think of relying on themselves.

476
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:31,500
However, Buddhism teaches us
to rely on ourselves

477
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:34,708
<i>- train ourselves….</i>
<i>- </i>Excuse me.

478
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:37,708
What do you think about his sermon?

479
00:31:37,791 --> 00:31:38,791
It's pretty good.

480
00:31:40,541 --> 00:31:42,041
Honestly,

481
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:45,000
I don't understand everything,

482
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:49,708
but his voice is vibrant and pleasing.

483
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,500
Listening to him makes me feel relaxed.

484
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:53,583
Also…

485
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:57,375
He's pretty handsome. I like him.

486
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:00,916
Since you've heard the teachings,

487
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:05,333
I want you to spend
five minutes with yourselves.

488
00:32:07,666 --> 00:32:09,416
<i>Contemplate your breaths.</i>

489
00:32:11,291 --> 00:32:13,333
<i>See your body exhales.</i>

490
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:16,083
See your body inhales.

491
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,083
This is called
the mindfulness of breathing.

493
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:52,458
MONK DOL GIVING SERMON…

494
00:32:52,541 --> 00:32:56,208
Looking at the trend, I think
people are spreading the word about him.

495
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,875
Then we have to increase
the social media channels, right?

496
00:33:01,541 --> 00:33:05,125
If possible,
we'll have to launch more ads. Right?

497
00:33:05,833 --> 00:33:08,833
Shall we do the podcast now,
so I can seriously start?

498
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:11,750
- Ask Monk Dol.
- Okay.

499
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:17,208
I think the singing contest idea
works out really well.

500
00:33:17,291 --> 00:33:19,250
More and more people are coming.

501
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:23,541
From what I counted today,
it was probably around 300 people.

502
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:26,500
What's the total income for today?

503
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:30,333
It's 75,720 baht and 25 satang.

504
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:33,333
By the end of the month, it should be…

505
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:35,625
around two million?

506
00:33:35,708 --> 00:33:39,666
If we run it well, we should be able to
increase it by ten percent per day.

507
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,458
If we're lucky, it'll be more.

508
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,958
But it would be even better

509
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:48,500
if we could skyrocket
so we can pay off the first installment.

510
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:53,958
Will we make it to five million?

511
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,916
Oh.

512
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:03,625
Are you guys having a meeting?

513
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:06,583
Can I join?

514
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:09,083
- We're done.
- What?

515
00:34:09,583 --> 00:34:10,416
We're done.

516
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:12,625
Oh. What the hell?

517
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:15,500
I'm going to measure the area.
It's getting dark.

518
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,875
Um.

519
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:19,125
Where are you going, girl?

520
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,125
Oh. Uh.

521
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:24,833
Um.

522
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:28,833
Well.

523
00:34:28,916 --> 00:34:32,250
The thing is, our flea market
uses so much electricity,

524
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:34,541
and there's also a singing contest.

525
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:40,583
So?

526
00:34:41,375 --> 00:34:45,333
So, you guys are not
charging enough parking fees.

527
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:48,250
Honestly, it's such a waste.

528
00:34:48,916 --> 00:34:52,416
Listen, we need to cater
to the people who visit the temple.

529
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,666
I understand.

530
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:57,750
But we can charge a bit higher.
Tell them it goes to temple maintenance.

531
00:34:57,833 --> 00:34:58,666
Done.

532
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:01,083
Alright, Uncle.

533
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:03,708
What exactly

534
00:35:04,791 --> 00:35:05,875
do you want?

535
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,166
If you don't want it, I'll take it.

536
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,083
Okay.

537
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,750
Who knows how hard I've worked?

538
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:18,083
I'm only asking for scraps.

539
00:35:19,416 --> 00:35:23,083
Do you know how much profit
the market vendors make per day?

540
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:27,416
Those meatball stalls
make a couple of thousands per day.

541
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,333
Okay, okay.

542
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:33,250
- You can have the parking fees.
- Okay.

543
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:37,041
But the thing about the flea market,
we need to take it slowly.

544
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:41,750
You know the locals and you know
we want no problems with them.

545
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:46,208
And about the parking fees,
you must let us set the price

546
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:49,708
so it won't affect
the overall business here.

547
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:54,250
Fine.

548
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:57,333
But don't forget my ten percent cut.

549
00:35:59,166 --> 00:36:00,041
Um.

550
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:12,041
Greedy bastard.

551
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:44,791
Namaskar.

552
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:47,083
What are you doing here?

553
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:49,958
To do a walking meditation.

554
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:54,083
Why've you come so far to do it?

555
00:36:58,041 --> 00:36:59,166
It's peaceful here.

556
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:02,333
Oh, I see.

557
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:10,916
Um.

558
00:37:11,916 --> 00:37:12,958
Would you mind…

559
00:37:13,916 --> 00:37:16,250
holding that end of the measuring tape?

560
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,333
Thank you.

561
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,916
Why are you measuring this?

562
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:49,833
I'm going to expand the cemetery area.

563
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:55,791
You're at a cemetery. Aren't you afraid?

564
00:37:57,958 --> 00:37:58,958
Afraid of what?

565
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:03,166
Oh.

566
00:38:03,708 --> 00:38:04,833
Ghosts?

567
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,458
I don't really believe in ghosts.

568
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,125
I believe that once we die, it's over.

569
00:38:21,458 --> 00:38:23,916
What about you? Are you afraid of ghosts?

570
00:38:28,458 --> 00:38:31,416
Do you think a person who's seen one
would believe they exist?

571
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:34,250
Oh.

572
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,916
So pretty.

573
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:55,291
When we

574
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:58,333
can't create our own light,

575
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:03,208
we get fascinated by other lights.

576
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:06,583
Oh.

577
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:08,541
Are you giving a sermon?

578
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:12,125
Will it be long?
There are lots of mosquitoes here.

579
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,958
Here. Look at this.

580
00:39:47,041 --> 00:39:49,500
This is for you, sweetie.

581
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:52,083
Oh, no, you can't.

582
00:39:52,166 --> 00:39:55,875
Not yet.
This is just my first day working here.

583
00:39:56,458 --> 00:39:59,125
Since it's your first day at work,

584
00:39:59,208 --> 00:40:01,291
I should give you the maximum.

585
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:05,416
Here. Here you go. All for you.

586
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:10,041
- Alright, then.
- Wow, look at how you pull my hand.

587
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:13,125
She says this to all her customers.
She'll go to other bars later.

588
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:14,375
Is that true?

589
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:16,666
No. It's not true.

590
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,083
Hey, don't slander her.

591
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,083
Sure. You're so cute.

592
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:22,166
- You're nosy.
- Just a bit.

593
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:25,291
Shall we buy all the drinks?
For Kraisorn too.

594
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:28,166
Order all you want. Go ahead.

595
00:40:28,916 --> 00:40:31,166
Hey, Tod, take care of it.

596
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:34,333
I don't have any money.
I've been short lately.

597
00:40:34,416 --> 00:40:36,958
What did you say? An electric shock?

598
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:41,666
I'm short, I have no money.
What kind of a stupid joke was that?

599
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,750
Oh.

600
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:46,875
Someone like you is short on money?
I don't buy it.

601
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:50,041
Come on, Tang.
It's hard to wiggle around these days.

602
00:40:50,125 --> 00:40:52,916
The cops are annoying.
Ask Pong if you don't believe me.

603
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,041
How are we supposed to do it?
That bastard Sam got caught yesterday.

604
00:40:57,125 --> 00:40:58,916
What? Again?

605
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,333
Heck yeah.

606
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:04,500
Hey, you all seem like
a bunch of nincompoops.

607
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:16,208
I have a way

608
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:19,500
to make you guys stop leeching of me.

609
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,166
And no one will bother you.

610
00:41:26,833 --> 00:41:27,708
Cheers.

611
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:31,000
- Let's drink.
- What the hell are you waiting for?

612
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:32,833
- <i>Have you eaten?</i>
- Yeah.

613
00:41:38,083 --> 00:41:40,000
- <i>Has work been tiring?</i>
- Um…

614
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:42,500
No. It's fine.

615
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,958
<i>I see.</i>

616
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:47,750
<i>- Are you coming home today?</i>
<i>- </i>I'm going back soon.

617
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:51,375
<i>At dawn again?</i>

618
00:41:53,708 --> 00:41:55,625
<i>I forgot to tell you,</i>

619
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,833
<i>I met Dear the other day.</i>

620
00:41:57,916 --> 00:42:00,416
<i>We had noodles</i>
<i>where I used to take you to.</i>

621
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,250
<i>Should we order it to eat at home</i>
<i>and invite Dear next time?</i>

622
00:42:07,916 --> 00:42:09,083
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

623
00:42:09,166 --> 00:42:11,041
Yeah, mom. Let's talk later.

624
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,250
Hey, Win. What are you doing here?

625
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:28,583
Well…

626
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:32,375
I'm going into the city,
so I came to ask if you need anything.

627
00:42:32,458 --> 00:42:33,458
No, I'm good.

628
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,916
This is Monk Ekachai.

629
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,666
He just graduated from Bangkok.

630
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:41,208
He wanted to return
to the temple to help out.

631
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:43,416
This is Win.

632
00:42:43,958 --> 00:42:47,166
He and his friends volunteer
to help out at the temple.

633
00:42:48,041 --> 00:42:53,083
From now on, if you need to contact me,
you can do it through Monk Ekachai.

634
00:42:59,041 --> 00:42:59,958
Sure.

635
00:43:10,625 --> 00:43:11,875
<i>Greetings.</i>
