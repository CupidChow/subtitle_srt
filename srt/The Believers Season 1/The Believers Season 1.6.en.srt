1
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,250
I have a brief idea.

2
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,500
We need to make a one-of-a-kind amulet.

3
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,916
There you go, Father Peung.

4
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,000
Father Peung, that's not bad.

5
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,458
- Peung rhymes with--
- "Newly built?"

6
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:47,875
- "Rely on," asshole.
- What's next?

7
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,541
Do we need to find someone to bless it?

8
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:55,125
Well, how about Monk Ekachai?

9
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:01,041
Not famous and not <i>mass </i>enough.
Most people don't know who he is.

10
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,041
Okay, then…

11
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:06,000
how about a famous monk?

12
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,625
ABBOT'S RESIDENCE
MONK VEERA ITSAVARO

13
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:29,166
Note. Why did Monk Dol come back?

14
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:33,458
I don't know.
Look, he brought a ton of stuff.

15
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,833
What about Monk Dol?

16
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:52,666
Namaskar, Father.

17
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,500
Today, I've come to request your guidance

18
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:00,208
on the motion to change the sect.

19
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,916
I'm planning on staying here
during Buddhist Lent.

20
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,416
Have you thought about it carefully?

21
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,666
I have considered it carefully.

22
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:17,125
My decision to stay here

23
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:22,500
might be of some help to the temple,
more or less.

24
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,458
Uh...

25
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:29,666
That's interesting.

26
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:36,250
But shouldn't we try
one of the more famous monks?

27
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:39,333
Monk Dol has a pretty big fan base
on social media.

28
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:44,166
This could help with going viral,
giving a boost to our sales.

29
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,583
Is he gonna stay here long?

30
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:53,416
I don't know about that.
But let's just ask him first.

31
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:11,125
Is this what they call
prayers getting answered?

32
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:14,916
- Dear.
- Hmm?

33
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:17,833
Ask Monk Dol for us.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,416
<i>May your</i>
<i>moral virtue continuously grow…</i>

35
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,791
THE BELIEVERS

36
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,250
SUBSTANCES

37
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:48,583
Brother,

38
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:53,583
the amulets should be ready for release
after the end of Buddhist Lent.

39
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,333
Win and Dear will handle the videos,

40
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,875
and I'll stay here
to prepare everything.

41
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:01,833
Um.

42
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:06,500
This book lists temples with sacred
substances around the country.

43
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,625
You should look into it.

44
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,375
I stuck some Post-its in it.

45
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:12,875
Thank you.

46
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,958
If you're planning to ask them,

47
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:19,083
having a monk with you
might make things easier.

48
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,833
I can't go with you, though.

49
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:25,500
But I can contact the temples I know
ahead of time.

50
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,250
Please do that. Thank you.

51
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,791
What would you think
if we chose Monk Dol?

52
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,708
- Hey.
- Hm?

53
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:48,041
I saw your brother's clip the other day.
It looked pretty good.

54
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,541
Fuck that, you enjoy watching that stuff?

55
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:51,875
What stuff?

56
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,041
You know, life coach shit.

57
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:57,083
Why? Is your life lacking inspiration?

58
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,291
What the fuck should I watch then?

59
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,208
Well, general stuff, like…

60
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,250
for content, like a variety show.

61
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,333
You can watch sports or something.

62
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:12,916
Watch porn or whatever.
Don't you have porn on your computer?

63
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:14,416
No, I don't.

64
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,375
The internet here is too slow.

65
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:19,833
You jerk.

66
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:23,583
So? Who do you think of
when you do it? Dear?

67
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,041
Fuck you, you're a real pain in the ass.

68
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:29,625
Damn.

69
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,500
- Hey, Win.
- Huh?

70
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,125
That night, you didn't do anything
to Father Kiw, right?

71
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,583
He was on the floor when I came in.

72
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:47,875
Why did you go there?

73
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,833
To negotiate with him.

74
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,166
Why? You don't believe me?

75
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,333
It's not like that. I do.

76
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,750
I don't think anything like that.

77
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,958
I'm just asking.

78
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,666
Okay?

79
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,208
- Okay.
- Yeah.

80
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,250
Venerable Brother.

81
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:40,791
Oh.

82
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,333
Namaskar, Brother.

83
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:44,541
What is it, Dear?

84
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,125
Why did you come back?

85
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,541
The temple seems to be
facing some issues, right?

86
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,333
I saw it on the news.

87
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,541
So I just thought

88
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,583
I might be able to help the temple
in some way.

89
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:15,500
So…

90
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,625
how long do you plan to stay this time?

91
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:27,000
As long as my merit dictates, I suppose.

92
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:29,875
How have you been?

93
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:31,416
Uh.

94
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,958
I've been quite busy lately.

95
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,125
We've been preparing for a new project.

96
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,208
What project?

97
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,375
We're going to make sacred objects.

98
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,791
Sacred objects?

99
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,750
These things are based on superstition.

100
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,875
They can only work on weak people.

101
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,875
But some people are different.

102
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:05,208
Some people really need
to rely on these things.

103
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,791
As a monk from a forest temple,

104
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:13,000
you might not see the necessity
of these things, but for most people,

105
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,958
if we put superstition aside,

106
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:18,791
it can help them connect more
with the temple and Buddhism.

107
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,208
Actually, I'm not well-versed
in these things.

108
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:26,708
Well,

109
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,750
we want to create something
that can provide solace for people.

110
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,875
And if it can also help make
Phummaram Temple more lively,

111
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,000
I think it might be good.

112
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,166
I have nothing against what you are doing,
if it's something you have to do.

113
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,041
Umm…

114
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,125
So…

115
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,541
would it be possible to…

116
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,166
ask you to come and help us
collect the substances

117
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:08,458
to make the sacred objects?

118
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,625
Not even asking me to come along?

119
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,875
What? Just stay here and get things ready.

120
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,375
How did you get Monk Dol to come?

121
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,416
I let Dear talk to him.

122
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:50,541
Here you go.

123
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,333
Brother,
I'll leave these two with you.

124
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,208
MONK CAVE

125
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,875
Namaskar, Father.

126
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,291
May you be blessed. Come, let's go inside.

127
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,833
What you need to get is
leklai in Kanchanaburi.

128
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:27,958
What do you plan for the temple to do
with the income from sacred objects?

129
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:32,208
Provide scholarships for orphans
or enhance job skills for the disabled.

130
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,500
There's no need for a construction
in the temple.

131
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:35,625
I rejoice in the plan.

132
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:38,208
Number 12, Sorapong.

133
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,083
It's for three years.

134
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,833
Number 13, Jiraphat Kongphairat.

135
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,000
Next, 108 wan plants in Phrae.

136
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,625
Please get in.

137
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,625
INSTANT KARMA

138
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,291
Let me see.

139
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,416
How is it?

140
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,833
Relic powder in Khon Kaen.

141
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:20,833
WELCOME TO KHON KAEN

142
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,166
May you be well.

143
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:16,000
We won't be staying the night
at a temple here.

144
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,750
We need to ask you to stay
in outside accommodation

145
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,458
because our next destination
is in a different direction.

146
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,125
Is that alright?

147
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,791
We're going out. Do you need anything?

148
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,875
That's all right. I've taken care of it.

149
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:43,708
Please excuse us.

150
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,708
Let's take the stairs.
Only one floor.

151
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:00,791
Oh, here you go.

152
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,416
Thank you. Goodbye.

153
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:07,916
- Can you do it?
- Sure.

154
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,791
Okay. Give it a good clean over there.

155
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:11,791
Yeah.

156
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,250
- Game.
- Yes?

157
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,333
Sign this for me.

158
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,041
APPOINTMENT OF MONK'S ASSISTANT

159
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:38,333
Are you appointing me as an assistant?

160
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:41,625
Yes, this should make it easier
to do things moving forward.

161
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:44,583
Absolutely.

162
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,291
Here you go.

163
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,791
Have you talked to Win?

164
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:04,333
Yes. He just mentioned that

165
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:08,458
after Khon Kaen, they're heading to
Nakhon, and will come back here.

166
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,041
What about creating the mold
at the factory?

167
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:16,083
They said the 3D model is finished,
and they'll send it to us.

168
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,750
If we're good with it,
they can create the mold tomorrow.

169
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,083
- That's good.
- Okay.

170
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,958
Please excuse me.

171
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,666
You should answer the call.

172
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,000
Dear.

173
00:14:56,791 --> 00:15:00,041
- I'll drive. Let's take turns.
- It's okay.

174
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,416
I have a driver's license.

175
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,375
You couldn't even make it
out of your alley.

176
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:12,625
Hey.

177
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,875
Remember our talk
about the retreat pavilion?

178
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:19,916
I just feel like

179
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:26,000
we've been using him this much.
Shouldn't we at least do this for him?

180
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:30,875
Um.

181
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,416
But now's not the time.

182
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,291
We can do multiple things at once.

183
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:44,875
Why?

184
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,375
Why what?

185
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:53,958
Forget it.

186
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,708
What's up with you?

187
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:48,750
Please come out.

188
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,458
Two rooms under Win.

189
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,875
Two rooms without breakfast.

190
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,583
I'll give this room to Monk Dol.

191
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,416
This is your room.

192
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:28,958
Oh.

193
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,208
Is there something?

194
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:32,833
Nothing.

195
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,416
I just wanted to watch the sea.

196
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:42,541
Because since I was ordained,
I haven't been here again.

197
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,208
When were you ordained?

198
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,083
Since I was a novice monk.

199
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,958
My family was poor.

200
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:04,583
My parents passed away when I was young.

201
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,833
So, my grandmother made me
become a novice monk.

202
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,791
So, you never got to live a teenage life?

203
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,041
You could say that.

204
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,083
Don't you have any regrets?

205
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,916
It happened a long time ago.

206
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,750
Whether I regret it or not,

207
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,791
what good would it do now?

208
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,416
Have you ever felt lonely?

209
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,958
Why do you think I'd feel lonely?

210
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,583
Umm…

211
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:59,875
Because you're a monk
who was ordained since a young age.

212
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,500
Actually, my life is quite
similar to yours.

213
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:05,541
My mom passed away,

214
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,291
and my dad got remarried.

215
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,041
Sometimes, I feel like
I'm alone in this world.

216
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,000
If you learn to live with yourself,

217
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,583
you can live with loneliness.

218
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,333
People

219
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,125
say they love themselves,

220
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,541
but can't stand being with themselves.

221
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,291
They constantly look to someone else,

222
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,875
or something to give them fulfillment.

223
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,625
I guess that's true.

224
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,500
So, you've never felt lonely, have you?

225
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,125
I…

226
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,416
Dear. Let's get something to eat.

227
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,958
I have to go now.

228
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,750
Can you get my shoes for me? Over there.

229
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:58,250
"NARUETHIP VITAMIN WATER"
HOTTEST DRINK OF THE YEAR

230
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:21,541
POL. MAJ. KRITSANAPHOL ATCHARIYAPHON
INVESTIGATION INSPECTOR

231
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:39,250
What's going on outside?

232
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:41,541
Oh.

233
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:43,541
The chief just secured
his golden ticket,

234
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,500
he's getting transferred to Bangkok.

235
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:47,583
Oh, fuck.

236
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,375
Where do these guys get all this money?

237
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:52,541
Why don't you try it?

238
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:53,541
Oh.

239
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:57,875
Where would I find the money?
My child is still young.

240
00:22:57,958 --> 00:23:02,375
Hey, try going through the superintendent.
Aren't you guys buddies?

241
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,458
Let me know when you're ready
to bring in the team. See you.

242
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:20,291
PHUMMARAM TEMPLE

243
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:25,500
Wait, let me capture this.

244
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,833
- What?
- You're drying your hair with a bath mat.

245
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:32,833
Shit, who put them
so damn close together?

246
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:34,416
They weren't, though.

247
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:38,625
How would you survive without me?

248
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:41,416
I just used the wrong towel.

249
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:46,541
Do it again. Go there and start over.
I'll take it from the start.

250
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:48,208
You're a pain in the ass.

251
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:50,333
- Here.
- Ouch!

252
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:54,166
You jerk.
I already wiped my feet with this one.

253
00:24:57,708 --> 00:25:00,000
Hey, ask Game where he's at now.

254
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,833
He said there's just packing left.
It's almost done.

255
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:16,416
Are you going to bed?

256
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,583
No.

257
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:20,291
It was too bright.

258
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:30,541
- Win.
- Huh?

259
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,291
About the pavilion,

260
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:39,666
I just feel for him, you know?

261
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:43,666
He's done so much for us.
Shouldn't we return the favor?

262
00:25:57,041 --> 00:26:00,291
Just wait a little longer.
Let's clear this stuff first.

263
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,291
How long are we gonna
keep doing this?

264
00:26:18,666 --> 00:26:20,208
Until we pay off the debt.

265
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:28,250
What if it doesn't work this time?

266
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:31,208
We'll find other ways.

267
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:35,500
Aren't we going to try
something else?

268
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:43,166
It will work. Trust me.

269
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:06,583
<i>Our mind is frustrated,</i>

270
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,458
<i>or sad and solemn,</i>

271
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:12,541
<i>or heavily burdened.</i>

272
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:19,250
<i>If we practice breathing</i>
<i>in and out regularly,</i>

273
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:25,208
<i>our mind will be conscious</i>
<i>and focused only on the breathing.</i>

274
00:27:25,916 --> 00:27:29,250
<i>Take notes of your body and your feeling.</i>

275
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:33,583
<i>That is called Bhavana.</i>

276
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:38,666
<i>Setting your mind is difficult...</i>

277
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:40,250
Mom?

278
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:43,291
Mom.

279
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,166
Mom.

280
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:05,541
<i>Breathe in, breathe out…</i>

281
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:09,166
Dear.

282
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:27,083
Why didn't you lock the door?
Someone could break in.

283
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:35,000
My mom asked me to bring you
chicken coconut soup.

284
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:48,541
She's gone.

285
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:10,000
Uh… Hello,
there's been a death in the house.

286
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,625
The address is 48/3 Moo 5,
Soi Chanwinij 3.

287
00:29:15,958 --> 00:29:17,458
Yes, the Public Health Center.

288
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:21,166
She had lymphoma.

289
00:29:22,791 --> 00:29:23,666
Yes.

290
00:29:24,583 --> 00:29:25,666
Yes, okay.

291
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:37,916
The hospital staff are on their way.

292
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,250
How long have you been sitting this way?

293
00:29:58,166 --> 00:30:00,916
Is it a bad karma
if I feel relieved that my mom's died?

294
00:30:05,583 --> 00:30:08,833
I don't think it is.
Who knows what you've been through?

295
00:30:08,916 --> 00:30:10,000
Only you do.

296
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:18,291
Why didn't she tell me before she died
where she wanted her funeral to be held?

297
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,666
My mom was a Buddhist. But when she met
my dad, she followed him to the church.

298
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:30,291
If I decide for her,
will she go to her eternal resting place?

299
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,708
There might not even be such a place.

300
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,333
Who knows where one goes after death?

301
00:30:37,416 --> 00:30:41,083
Do good, go to heaven,
do bad, go to hell, or some other realm?

302
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:44,583
Haven't you read Stephen Hawking?
He said, "There is no God."

303
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,708
As for me,
I don't believe in life after death.

304
00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:53,500
If I die, pay the undertaker to handle it.
Don't trouble yourself.

305
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:03,000
Shouldn't you comfort me a little?

306
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:05,666
My mom just died.

307
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:23,541
Sorry for your loss.

308
00:32:54,791 --> 00:32:56,791
"WISH COMES TRUE" BUDDHA

309
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:10,000
If you're looking to make merit,
please head outside.

310
00:33:10,083 --> 00:33:11,625
The main hall is closing soon.

311
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:15,541
- Thank you.
- Sure thing.

312
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:22,333
I heard that the liaison here
was dealing drugs?

313
00:33:25,041 --> 00:33:26,291
Has he been caught?

314
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,166
Oh.

315
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:33,708
I have no idea, but I heard
the police were chasing after him.

316
00:33:33,791 --> 00:33:35,875
I think they might have caught him.

317
00:33:36,708 --> 00:33:40,625
But please don't worry.
He has nothing to do with the temple.

318
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:44,625
- Is that so?
- Yes, we're clean.

319
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:54,958
Feel free to make merit outside.

320
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:15,166
Is the temple closed now?

321
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:18,333
Mr. Akkarachai.

322
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:31,875
Isn't it strange

323
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:38,583
for someone from a well-known family
to be sitting at a temple, counting money?

324
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:52,500
Nothing strange about it.
