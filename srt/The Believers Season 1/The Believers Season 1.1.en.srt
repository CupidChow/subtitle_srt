1
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:36,333
It's your right. Have a look.

2
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:40,291
We still have no idea
why you brought us here.

3
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,041
You dare to defy me like this,

4
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:48,875
you must be confident
you've moved money without a trace.

5
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:51,958
Let me contact my lawyer.

6
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,041
Do you think your lawyer can help you?
Huh?

7
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,750
You can think and say however you like,

8
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:04,000
but as a police officer, you should know

9
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,333
that imagination alone won't do the trick.

10
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:10,166
You devil scumbag.

11
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,583
Leeching off religion.

12
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:15,416
Isn't it normal?

13
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:19,000
If this were illegal,
would you be able to arrest us all?

14
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:22,291
You're good at provoking people.

15
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,083
I like you.

16
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:27,416
It's fun talking to you.

17
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:31,333
Don't you know
how much Thai people crave merit?

18
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:40,416
THE BELIEVERS

19
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:42,666
SIX MONTHS AGO

20
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,125
This is our office.

21
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:46,416
NARUETHI… WATER

22
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,333
WE'LL DESTROY METAVERSE

23
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:51,416
We run a business on an NFT game
called Pirate's Hell.

24
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,166
The trends and popularity
are looking great.

25
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,458
My dream of being rich at young age
is now in front of me.

26
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,208
After we launched the game,
the graph has skyrocketed.

27
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,416
Let's see how they'll react to this.

28
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,916
You can install the chandelier
as per design now. I've bought it.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,750
Dear, is your phone ringing?

30
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:20,416
What' up?

31
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,083
- Did you see it?
- See what?

32
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,541
What about you, Game?

33
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:25,750
Let's see.

34
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:28,291
Fuck.

35
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,416
HELL PRICE (HELL)

36
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,708
- Is this for real?
- Hell, yeah.

37
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,416
Around what I've estimated.

38
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:38,750
Yes!

39
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:43,291
I estimated it to go up to 300%.
But it could reach 800.

40
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,958
And if the growth is steady,

41
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,416
we should be able to
pay off our debt as promised.

42
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,750
<i>Let it continue.</i>
Can't it go on to second and third phases?

43
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:54,541
Okay, good. That's it.
One more time. One, two, three.

44
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,666
Good. All done. Thank you.

45
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,166
- Your brother is back, isn't he?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

46
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,583
Game, come and take a photo with us.

47
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,041
- Press run now.
- Press run now?

48
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,041
Congratulations.

49
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:11,125
Fuck you.

50
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:14,125
Win, I've made some new guides.
Which one?

51
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:19,916
HELL PRICE (HELL)

52
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:23,541
Can we talk now?

53
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,125
Yeah. Go ahead.

54
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:28,625
<i>Let's hold off on selling the tokens.</i>
We can get the funds back later.

55
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,458
<i>The feedback is looking good now.</i>
<i>Our users can use it if we keep it.</i>

56
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,250
I guess it's time I get a Lambo.

57
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,791
I'd rather invest in my shop.

58
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:36,708
Go ahead.

59
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,333
That's it for today, I guess.

60
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,375
- Bye.
- Bye.

61
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,833
Game, when'd you get here?

62
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,458
I've just got here.

63
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,250
Where've you been, Dad?

64
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,291
I went out to do some business. I…

65
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,208
I'll be right back. All right?

66
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,833
- Hey.
- So, how did it go?

67
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,875
The garage said
the rubber engine mount had worn out,

68
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:05,166
so it made a lot of noise.
But you have to order the spare parts.

69
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,083
I'll get it changed some other day.

70
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,166
Alright.

71
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:18,250
NARUETHIP WATER

72
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,125
- Hmm.
- Oh, hey.

73
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:35,166
Why didn't you eat?
You'll starve to death.

74
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,541
My work is not done.

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,166
NARUETHIP WATER

76
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,208
Why are you sitting?

77
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:49,416
Do you want to help me?
So it'll be faster. Come on.

78
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:53,041
Hey, if this is too much for you, then…

79
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,291
go and call Dad over.

80
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,916
- What's he got to do with this?
- Well,

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,750
he's always helping other people
even it's not his business.

82
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:05,416
Just now,
he went to get Uncle's car fixed.

83
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,083
Why'd he have to do it for him?

84
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:12,708
Do you still get upset over this?
Just let it go.

85
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,541
And what about you, sis?

86
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,375
You should think of your baby.

87
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:28,625
What are you achieving
from working like this?

88
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,958
They'll see it some day.
Don't worry. I can still do this.

89
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,666
Sis, I'm going to say this one more time.

90
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,333
Even though you do all this…

91
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,833
they still won't care about you.

92
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,250
'Cause they'll leave everything
to the grandsons.

93
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:52,958
Thanks for your concern.
You should worry about yourself.

94
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,750
So? Aren't you continuing your studies?

95
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,750
Oat graduated from Harvard<i>, </i>you know?

96
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,416
So what?

97
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,291
Hmm?

98
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:04,916
Are you going back inside?

99
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,291
- Yes.
<i>- </i>Get me some Hoi Jo<i>. </i>I want to eat it.

100
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:13,666
You got some?

101
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,666
- No need to wait.
- What a good chap.

102
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,708
Duh.

103
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:52,416
I BOUGHT AN 18-INCH PIZZA TO CELEBRATE
BUT CAN'T FINISH IT BY MYSELF LOL

104
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:30,208
<i>Speaking of the hottest new game</i>
<i>at the moment,</i>

105
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:33,833
<i>it has got to be Pirate's Hell.</i>

106
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:38,416
<i>It's now very popular among players.</i>
<i>It's a play-to-earn type of game.</i>

107
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,250
- Salt.
- <i>The number of players…</i>

108
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,916
<i>is gradually increasing.</i>

109
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,541
<i>An interesting point, Chat, is that</i>
<i>it was created by Thai developers.</i>

110
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,583
<i>They're a group of youngsters</i>
<i>coming together to develop a game.</i>

111
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:53,166
<i>- A new team emerged on a watch list.</i>
- Hey.

112
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:59,208
<i>Now, we'll have to see</i>
<i>how long this game will stay in trend.</i>

113
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,250
<i>Please root for them.</i>

114
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,458
- You didn't eat it when I gave you.
- <i>Trust me.</i>

115
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:07,250
<i>If you call yourself a gamer,</i>
<i>you must've downloaded and played it.</i>

116
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,458
<i>Or you'd be considered very out of trend.</i>

117
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,791
<i>As for those of you</i>
<i>who haven't downloaded it,</i>

118
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,083
<i>you should hurry.</i>

119
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,333
<i>Anyway, press…</i>

120
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:16,000
Win. How are you doing over there?

121
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,458
Here, the glue has dried. Burst it,

122
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:21,958
so we can go eat.

123
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,541
Let me see.

124
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,833
One day when you've grown older,

125
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,708
many things you see

126
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:48,250
may turn out to be nothing
on the inside. Here, take a look.

127
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,875
<i>Don't believe in</i>
<i>everything you see, son.</i>

128
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Fuck!

129
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,958
How is the situation right now?

130
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,500
People have been sending
shit ton of report.

131
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,208
Have we suspended the token?

132
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,916
So how did they hack us?

133
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,375
Didn't we already run the security test?

134
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,125
Huh?

135
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:06,291
Do you know
which wallet they hacked us from?

136
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,875
Bro, we'll need Golf's help
if it's the Eco Wallet.

137
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,083
Hey…

138
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,791
And where is Golf? Huh?

139
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,083
Win.

140
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Move.

141
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,791
Hey, White Girl. Have you called Golf?

142
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,625
- I'm calling. He doesn't answer.
- Okay, keep calling.

143
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,791
- What shall we do? Open this.
- Open it.

144
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,208
Fuck, even if we restore the system,
it's no use.

145
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:38,708
What?

146
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,500
The price has dropped by over 50%.

147
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,541
There must be a way.

148
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,916
Okay? Think, all right?
Just keep thinking.

149
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,416
I'm thinking, bastard!

150
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,500
Okay.

151
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:01,125
- Try calling Golf's home.
- I've tried everyone!

152
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,833
The fuck, everyone!

153
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,166
<i>It's tough, Ms. Dear.</i>

154
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,125
<i>I'll get back to you about it soon.</i>

155
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,875
Thank you. Please make it urgent.

156
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:43,833
What did he say?

157
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,041
He said it'd take time.

158
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,208
How's the situation right now?

159
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,625
The wallet getting hacked
was nothing.

160
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,791
The problem was people panicked
and withdrew all their tokens.

161
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:02,083
But, luckily,
we froze the transfer of tokens in time.

162
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,000
So it only costed us six million.

163
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:09,666
"Only"? All of our money combined
isn't even six million.

164
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,500
When we run it again,
the price will drop even more.

165
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,541
Let's go with what we have for now.

166
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:21,250
As for the rest,
I can borrow from my family.

167
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,041
All right?

168
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:29,458
I'll post a statement on the website
explaining what went wrong.

169
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,208
Let's go with this. Okay?

170
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:35,250
I'll talk to my family
and give you guys an update.

171
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,791
- We need to repay the creditor.
- What?

172
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:43,916
When do we…

173
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,458
have to pay them back?

174
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,708
After launching the game.
Fifty million in 30 days.

175
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,625
Fuck, that means
we have less than a month.

176
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:08,750
Shit.

177
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:18,458
I'll pick it up.

178
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,041
- Hello?
- <i>Hello.</i>

179
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:23,666
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

180
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:28,833
<i>I'm Yossaphat, a legal representative</i>
<i>of SU88 TECH Company,</i>

181
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,750
<i>from which Mr. Akkarachai took a loan.</i>

182
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,541
<i>Hello?</i>

183
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,416
<i>- Mr. Akkarachai, are you still there?</i>
- Yes, sir.

184
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:42,875
<i>I saw the news on Twitter.</i>
<i>Regarding what's happening right now,</i>

185
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,625
<i>should I be concerned?</i>

186
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,000
We're dealing with it.

187
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,125
I think we'll be able to fix it.

188
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:55,875
<i>That's great.</i>
<i>Allow me to repeat the agreement to you.</i>

189
00:14:55,958 --> 00:15:01,166
<i>You borrowed 25 million baht from us</i>
<i>and must pay us back with a 200% interest.</i>

190
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,000
Yes. I remember that.

191
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,166
<i>I'm relieved to hear that.</i>

192
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,416
<i>I heard many people</i>
<i>have withdrawn their tokens.</i>

193
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,958
<i>I hope you will pay off your debt in time.</i>

194
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:15,666
<i>Otherwise, we'll have to charge you</i>
<i>an additional 20% interest rate</i>

195
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,375
- <i>as per the agreement we signed.</i>
- Hey, bro.

196
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:20,916
Can't you just chill?

197
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,166
It's just happened today.

198
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,333
I think…

199
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,708
there should be something

200
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,666
we can talk over or negotiate on.

201
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,625
What if we can prove that you hacked us?

202
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,916
I don't think
the evidence is hard to find.

203
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,375
Wait.

204
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,625
Did you bastards to this?

205
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,291
<i>When you understand</i>
<i>the situation better,</i>

206
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:55,708
<i>- I'll call you again.</i>
- Hey, hold on, you bastard!

207
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,541
That motherfucker.

208
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:04,916
So, what do we do?

209
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,458
I've been thinking,
those bastards gain the most from this.

210
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:15,416
One of us must've helped him
or it wouldn't have been so easy.

211
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,291
It was Golf, wasn't it?

212
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:26,541
- If not, we'd be able to reach him by now.
- It's possible. We need to investigate.

213
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:27,958
Fuck that bastard Golf.

214
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,333
Fuck Lamborghini.

215
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:32,625
Fuck that lawyer.

216
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,833
Hey.

00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,416
- <i>Hi, sweetie.</i>
- Hi, Dad.

223
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,666
<i>Did you just call?</i>
<i>I left my phone upstairs.</i>

224
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,875
<i>How are you doing, honey?</i>

225
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,875
<i>Hey, Jamie. What are doing over there?</i>

226
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,958
- Are you free to talk?
- <i>Hold on. Hold on a second.</i>

227
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,416
<i>Jamie, why did you throw that at me?</i>

228
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,500
<i>Just finish your food.</i>
<i>You can go outside and play.</i>

229
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,333
<i>Anyway, go on. What were you saying?</i>

230
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,291
It's okay, Dad.

231
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,458
I just wanted to say hi
and check up on you.

232
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,791
You should probably take care of Jamie.

233
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,375
We can talk later.

234
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,833
- <i>Sorry. Let's talk later.</i>
- Bye.

236
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,000
Ouch!

237
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:11,333
<i>Sorry, the number</i>
<i>you've dialed cannot be connected.</i>

238
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,500
<i>Please try again later.</i>

239
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,500
<i>Sorry, the number</i>
<i>you've dialed cannot be connected.</i>

240
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:19,916
<i>Please try…</i>

241
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:29,916
Huh!

242
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,083
Hey.

243
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,166
Where is Win?

244
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:36,625
Huh?

245
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,666
Is he in his room?

246
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,916
Calm down, okay? Alright?

247
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,000
- Are you calling the police?
- Yeah.

248
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,541
Hello?

249
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:05,875
Game.

250
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,125
Just hang up.

251
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,041
They can't do shit.

252
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,583
I'm okay.

253
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,125
Here.

254
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:27,250
Help me clean up.

255
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:32,958
Here.

256
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,041
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,916
WE'LL DESTROY METAVERSE

258
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:40,500
Dad, I…

259
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,708
Hey, Game.

260
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:45,875
- What's up?
- Hello.

261
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:02,958
Hey. Where've you been?

262
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:06,916
Why are you still up?

263
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,708
I got a cramp and couldn't sleep.
So I came out to take a walk.

264
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:12,333
Is something wrong?

265
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:15,916
No, it's nothing.

266
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:20,666
I'm going to bed.

267
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,666
Okay. Good night.

268
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:30,708
WE'LL DESTROY METAVERSE

269
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:44,958
About the lawyer,

270
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:47,583
we can't sue them.

271
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,333
The law can't touch them.

272
00:23:56,166 --> 00:24:00,416
They're charging us a 20% interest.
That's almost eight million.

273
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,583
And they're giving us
two months to pay everything off.

274
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,791
Who the fuck can pull that shit off?

275
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:11,625
What about a bank loan?

276
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:18,166
If the bank had let us take out a loan,
would I have gone to the loan shark?

277
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,416
Use your brain.

278
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:24,083
Should we run away?

279
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,791
Do you think we can fucking run?

280
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
But there's one thing I don't get.

281
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:48,500
If they really did it, why wouldn't they
wait for the price to go up?

282
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:50,666
What do they get for hacking it now?

283
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,750
They never wanted the tokens.

284
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:54,166
If they were to hack us,

285
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:57,125
if we could shut down the system,
they'd get the same amount.

286
00:24:57,208 --> 00:24:59,583
- What they really wanted--
- The interest?

287
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:08,875
Can you try to call Win again?

288
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:37,416
WIN, WHERE ARE YOU? CALL ME BACK.

289
00:26:08,041 --> 00:26:09,041
Hey, Win.

290
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:14,000
What brings you here?
What happened to your face?

291
00:26:14,791 --> 00:26:17,791
- I came off my motorcycle.
- Does it hurt a lot?

292
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:19,000
Did you see a doctor?

293
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:31,583
- It's still bruised.
- Um.

294
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:40,208
What are you doing?

295
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:42,291
I'm counting the donations.

296
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:45,041
The public health center is hosting
a robe offering event.

297
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:55,916
Do you want to pitch in? 100 baht is fine.

298
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,833
Hmm.

299
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:11,666
You should use the money I gave you
to fix the house or just buy a new one.

300
00:27:12,958 --> 00:27:15,000
You don't have to live
in this shabby house.

301
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:21,833
You helped pay off my cooperatives debt
early last year. I want nothing more.

302
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:25,583
Mom.

303
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:30,291
Would you come with me if I moved abroad?

304
00:27:33,291 --> 00:27:34,291
Where are you going?

305
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:41,416
What about dad?

306
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:02,250
A person is missing.

307
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:06,583
What are the police doing?

308
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:10,791
It's been over a month.

309
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:21,583
I don't know what to do anymore.

310
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:25,791
<i>The Dharma is</i>
<i>well elaborated by the Exalted One.</i>

311
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:28,500
<i>I pay homage to the Dharma.</i>

312
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:35,416
<i>The Sangha, the Blessed One's disciples,</i>
<i>has practiced it well.</i>

313
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:38,541
<i>I pay homage to the Sangha.</i>

314
00:28:54,708 --> 00:28:58,500
<i>This is a way to get rich fast.</i>
<i>Create a million random crypto tokens.</i>

315
00:28:58,583 --> 00:29:01,833
<i>Then, you go on and rip people off</i>
<i>by selling them for 3,000 baht each.</i>

316
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:04,041
<i>If someone bought a token for 3,000 baht,</i>

317
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:09,125
<i>it means a million tokens you're holding</i>
<i>can be worth three billion baht.</i>

318
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:11,708
<i>Now, you can bluff about</i>
<i>how good your token is.</i>

319
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:17,041
<i>Build an image, hire celebrities,</i>
<i>and sponsor e-sport teams</i>

320
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:19,208
<i>to make your token seem credible.</i>

321
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:22,125
<i>Act like a philanthropist,</i>
<i>promoting the crypto society</i>

322
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:23,916
<i>and helping underprivileged people.</i>

323
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,250
<i>Once you get there,</i>
<i>it'll be easy to raise funds.</i>

324
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:30,916
<i>Making ten million, a hundred million,</i>
<i>or a billion will be just a piece of cake.</i>

325
00:29:31,416 --> 00:29:33,541
Fuck you. Easy, my ass.

326
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:09,708
You got up so early.
Did you get any sleep?

327
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:18,833
Did someone move into that house?

328
00:30:19,416 --> 00:30:21,208
Oh, you mean Dear's old house?

329
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:23,750
Someone moved in last year.

330
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:25,666
I bought some honeycomb waffles.

331
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,916
If it's not enough,
heat up food in the fridge.

332
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,541
Alright? I'll get going.

333
00:30:36,916 --> 00:30:39,166
Hey, Mom. I'm coming with you.
Wait for a bit.

334
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,791
Let me go wash up.
There's nothing to do at home.

335
00:30:50,791 --> 00:30:53,125
It was like this
when I arrived this morning.

336
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:54,916
Fuck. Who did this?

337
00:30:57,791 --> 00:31:00,500
- I'll check the glass wall on that side.
- Okay.

338
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:06,750
Are you alright?

339
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:09,916
I'm fine. I can handle this.

340
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:12,583
<i>Security sent the results.</i>

341
00:31:12,666 --> 00:31:16,208
They said the code they tested
and the latest one didn't match.

342
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:20,208
This means an insider changed it,
exposing a loophole to hack us.

343
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:23,875
Does this mean Golf conspired
with the creditor and did this?

344
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:26,916
Motherfucker.

345
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:31,041
He wants to check again to be sure
and will send us proof later.

346
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:33,250
No need to check again.

347
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:37,625
It's obvious. He's disappeared
and turned off his damn phone.

348
00:31:37,708 --> 00:31:39,583
<i>He even borrowed money from me.</i>

349
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:44,000
Wait for the evidence and report
to the police. I'll keep you updated.

350
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:46,333
<i>You still couldn't contact Win?</i>

351
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:48,125
No.

352
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:50,625
Alright.

353
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:52,375

- More than the donation of our district.
- Don't think of it that way.

361
00:33:00,541 --> 00:33:01,666

<i>Making ten million,</i>

369
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:34,333
<i>a hundred million, or a billion,</i>

370
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,458

Hey, guys.

00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:53,958
I think I've found a way out.

385
00:34:58,166 --> 00:34:59,083
Hey.

386
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:05,000
If I may ask, why the fuck am I here?

387
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:06,458
Follow me.

388
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,708
- What the fuck?
- What?

389
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:13,500
Hey, what's going on?

390
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:22,750
I'm going to show you a business model
that's been operating over 2,000 years.

391
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:27,500
Huh?

392
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,125
We're going to run a temple.

393
00:35:38,166 --> 00:35:41,833
This country has over 40,000 temples,
probably making several billion yearly.

394
00:35:41,916 --> 00:35:43,250
I did extensive research

395
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:45,791
but couldn't find data
on how much each temple makes.

396
00:35:48,541 --> 00:35:52,125
How much do you think famous temples
tens of thousands people visit daily make?

397
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:53,916
There's no information on this.

398
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:58,958
Everyone knows
that temples make a lot of money. So?

399
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:02,791
Everyone knows this fact,
but no one seriously looks into

400
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:04,250
how those temples make money,

401
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:07,166
how much they make,
and how they spend it.

402
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,250
There're regulations require
an inspection,

403
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,708
but how many "legit" inspections
are being done?

404
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:13,791
As long as they don't stand out too much.

405
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:18,791
I said several billion baht
are circulating yearly, right? Hear this.

406
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,958
I read a viral news about a famous temple.

407
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:23,041
After a scandal, they got exposed

408
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:26,375
that they had three billion baht
circulating in their account yearly.

409
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:27,541
Shit!

410
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:29,125
Three billion?

411
00:36:29,625 --> 00:36:30,791
That's bullshit.

412
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:33,416
Three billion. And that's just one temple.

413
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,166
Think about it. How much do you think
the oil bottle you just saw costs.

414
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,791
Around ten baht.
If you put 100, that's ten times.

415
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:43,416
I think it's more than that.

416
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,708
Faith-based donations,
can't put a price on that.

417
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:50,083
May all of you be happy and prosperous.

418
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:53,375
May you all live long.

419
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:57,500
When stressed out or having problems,
you think people go to a shrink or temple?

420
00:36:57,583 --> 00:37:01,666
That's a leading question,
what do you want me to say? A shrink?

421
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,416
It's temple, you bastard.

422
00:37:03,916 --> 00:37:06,875
For Thai people,
going to a temple is cheaper,

423
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:10,166
easier to access and have a much
wider range of target groups.

424
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:13,833
- Want some flowers to make offerings?
- No, I'm good.

425
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:19,541
We have to conduct research to see
how many people visit a temple per day

426
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:23,500
on weekdays, weekends, observance days
to calculate average income per person.

427
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:26,791
Besides donation boxes,
temples have many other sources of income.

428
00:37:27,666 --> 00:37:31,000
Belief and faith
make people want to make donations.

429
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:36,625
Not the entire donations go to the temple.

430
00:37:38,416 --> 00:37:42,125
Excuse me. Could you give me a blank one?

431
00:37:42,708 --> 00:37:44,541
The majority of the donations are cash

432
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:46,500
collected and managed by people.

433
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:49,708
And this is the loophole that gives us
a channel to handle the money.

434
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:53,791
Amen.

435
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:55,250
The temple activities,

436
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:57,458
are like theme parks.
with all kinds of events.

437
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:59,750
Relax.

438
00:38:00,541 --> 00:38:02,125
Breathe in.

439
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:04,875
Temples offer services
for all stages of life.

440
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:06,500
Birth, old age, sickness, death.

441
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:10,083
We have four <i>packages </i>to offer<i>.</i>
S costs 30,000 baht.

442
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:11,583
M costs 60,000 baht.

443
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:13,416
L costs 90,000 baht.

444
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,833
Or would you like
the VIP package for 230,000 baht?

445
00:38:17,916 --> 00:38:21,083
We must make these activities
relatable to those temple goers

446
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:24,708
to stimulate them to visit temples
and make donations to help them often.

447
00:38:24,791 --> 00:38:27,333
May you be happy and prosperous.

448
00:38:27,416 --> 00:38:29,208
What do I get for the VIP package?

449
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:30,708
It's just more luxurious.

450
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:34,208
Why don't we take a shower
since we're soaked?

451
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,916
Why don't we just ordain?

452
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:40,375
Big income gap
between monks and temples.

453
00:38:40,458 --> 00:38:43,291
How many years do we have to be monks
to save up that much?

454
00:38:44,208 --> 00:38:45,916
Or you must be a famous monk,

455
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,333
which will still take a lot of time.
The possibility is also very low.

456
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:51,333
Isn't this illegal?

457
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:54,333
We're not forcing or scamming anyone.

458
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:56,958
This is a product
consumers are willing to pay for

459
00:38:57,041 --> 00:38:58,708
at the prices they can pay.

460
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:09,708
Are you two dating or something?

461
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:13,041
Fuck.

462
00:39:13,958 --> 00:39:15,958
It's impossible,
no matter how I think.

463
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:19,708
Building a new temple
needs both money and time,

464
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:23,083
plus the regulations
of the National Office of Buddhism.

465
00:39:23,791 --> 00:39:25,333
How can lay people pull it off?

466
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:27,250
We're not building a temple.

467
00:39:28,541 --> 00:39:29,958
We're gonna takeover one.

468
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:34,583
What the fuck are you talking about?
Be more articulate.

469
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:39,875
We have to find a temple that's interested
in merging and offer to run it.

470
00:39:39,958 --> 00:39:42,791
After that, we make the brand stronger
by rebranding it.

471
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:46,291
Use modern marketing principles
to attract new targets,

472
00:39:46,916 --> 00:39:48,458
create more income channels,

473
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:49,875
and set an accounting system.

474
00:39:50,583 --> 00:39:53,041
Once we reach target income,
we share the profits.

475
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:56,125
We get money to pay off debt,
the temple prospers,

476
00:39:56,208 --> 00:39:58,708
and then we run.
It's a win-win situation.

477
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:06,125
I know it's risky,

478
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:09,833
but it will be even risker
if we don't try.

479
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:26,166
Fine, let's do it. Since you went
all that way to talk us into this.

480
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:30,875
What about you, Dear?

481
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:36,458
Let's do it.

482
00:40:38,666 --> 00:40:39,666
Come on.

483
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:43,541
- You too, bitch.
- Oh, okay.

484
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:45,041
That's it.

485
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:54,708
I hope Win's plan
will save us from this hell.

486
00:40:54,791 --> 00:40:55,708
Amen.
