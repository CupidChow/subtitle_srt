1
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:37,250
Mr. Pairach. Are you in there?

2
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,875
Mr. Pairach, are you alright?

3
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:41,833
Mr. Pairach?

4
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,250
Pairach?

5
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:47,916
Mr. Pairach.

6
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:50,916
Mr. Pairach, are you alright?

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,291
<i>Mr. Pairach, aged 46,</i>

8
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:59,500
<i>miraculously survived a collision between</i>
<i>a vegetable pickup truck and a coach.</i>

9
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:02,416
<i>In this accident,</i>
<i>the casualty toll so far is…</i>

10
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,166
<i>Seventeen deaths so far.</i>

11
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,583
<i>Look at the vehicles, Nite.</i>
<i>We could describe them as totaled.</i>

12
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:13,125
<i>Pairach said that at the scene of the</i>
<i>accident, he didn't think he'd survive.</i>

13
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:17,875
<i>As for the injury to his legs, the doctors</i>
<i>said he might never walk again.</i>

14
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:20,708
<i>In fact, amputation was anticipated.</i>

15
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:22,958
<i>But look at him this morning, Nite.</i>

16
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,333
<i>He's walking without any trouble.</i>
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

17
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:27,375
<i>That's what we call a miracle.</i>

18
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:29,333
<i>Definitely, it's a miracle.</i>

19
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:34,083
<i>Hey, do you believe</i>
<i>that miracles really exist?</i>

20
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:36,875
<i>I really don't know</i>
<i>how the pickup truck driver survived.</i>

21
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:40,375
<i>I saw him yell and walk out.</i>
<i>I thought he went to get the doctor,</i>

22
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,833
<i>but to my surprise, he started running.</i>

23
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:45,166
<i>Does that mean</i>
<i>your diagnosis was incorrect?</i>

24
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,125
<i>Was it?</i>

25
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:48,916
<i>As I mentioned,</i>
<i>we need to run the tests again.</i>

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,833
<i>When will you ask him</i>
<i>to come in? And regarding this…</i>

27
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:56,541
<i>Pairach himself said that</i>
<i>the thing that saved his life was…</i>

28
00:01:56,625 --> 00:02:00,833
<i>Here it is. The reason I can walk</i>
<i>is because of this amulet.</i>

29
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:03,875
<i>"Pra Peung Luang."</i>

30
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:06,666
<i>Father Peung Luang, Phummaram Temple.</i>

31
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,125
<i>It's this one, right?</i>
<i>This amulet?</i>

32
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,833
<i>Wow, that was fast, Nite.</i>

33
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:15,458
<i>They said they're in</i>
<i>the process of developing a second model</i>

34
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:19,333
<i>because they were inundated</i>
<i>with requests to reserve the first-model.</i>

35
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:22,625
<i>Here it is,</i>
<i>safe and free from danger.</i>

36
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:25,375
Want one? It's a big hit on the internet.

37
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:27,208
Game.

38
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:28,916
<i>It's about beliefs, folks.</i>

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,166
<i>It's time for a short break</i>
<i>with some interesting ads.</i>

40
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:41,083
THE BELIEVERS

41
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,208
The incident caused many deaths,

42
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,916
but Mr. Pairach
was among those who survived.

43
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,625
Honestly, we didn't need to come.

44
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:53,875
Excuse me.

45
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:55,791
Excuse me.

46
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,833
What channel are you guys from?

47
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:03,208
We're not here for an interview.
We just need to talk with Pairach.

48
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:08,375
- You two get inside.
- Okay. Come on.

49
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,791
We brought the money as we agreed.

50
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:21,291
I don't want it.
I just picked up the amulet.

51
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,958
I didn't make any agreement
with you guys.

52
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:30,041
But you can use this money
to buy a new truck.

53
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:37,791
The reason I can walk again
is because of this amulet.

54
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,708
It has nothing to do with you guys.

55
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:45,416
Then we'll leave you to it.
We should go. Bye.

56
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,083
Hey, guys.

57
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:50,708
Have you got more?

58
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,166
My wife wants one too.

These two men traveled a long way

67
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,666
- Hello.
- Been waiting long?

68
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,958
So long my legs are stiff.

69
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:09,458
I came to pray for a new job.
I wanted to get a job, and I got it.

70
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,583
This is fucking amazing, man.

71
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:12,625

<i>If it includes a box and a card,</i>

It's your PR plan, isn't it?

87
00:07:56,625 --> 00:08:00,041
The orders, help me with these.
I need to check the stock.

88
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,916
With only the two of us,
things are damn busy.

89
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,375
Do you need help? Should we find someone?

90
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:17,333
No.

91
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:21,416
When are we buying the coins?
It's almost time to pay debt.

92
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:23,708
Soon.

93
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,125
Ask Game for the contact.

94
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:30,750
Um.

95
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,958
I wanna try a different one.

96
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:49,916
What now?

97
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,083
What the fuck is wrong with you guys?

98
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,875
- Game.
- Hmm?

99
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,750
Take a look at this for me.
How do I raise the bed?

100
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,250
I couldn't find it.

101
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:29,750
How do you want it?

102
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,416
Adjust it to sitting position

103
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:33,875
so Grandpa can eat.

104
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,083
- A bit more
- Okay.

105
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,000
Okay.

106
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,458
How's your business?

107
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,583
It's alright.

108
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,500
Did you manage to get the money?

109
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,750
Yeah, I got it. No problem.

110
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,416
That's good.
Feel free to ask me if there's anything.

111
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,791
Get Grandpa the water.

112
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:08,875
SAFE, FREE FROM DANGER

113
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,166
This…

114
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,250
Did you

115
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:14,458
buy this amulet?

116
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:15,541
Yeah.

117
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,291
Mom asked me to buy it.
So I bought a set,

118
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,583
for everyone in the family.

119
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:25,166
- I haven't given you one.
- There's no need.

120
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,833
Game, look at Grandpa.
After I bought the amulet,

121
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,333
he's been doing better.

122
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:35,875
Dad.

123
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,583
The doctor comes to treat him.

124
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:42,666
He treats his symptoms.
Of course, he's doing better.

125
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,166
You should give credit to the doctor.

126
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,833
This kind of thing treats
both the body and the mind.

127
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:51,333
Dad, what are you even talking about? Huh?

128
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,875
Okay, let's keep it simple.
We've got Guanyin sitting here,

129
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,458
Ji Gong over there,
and Buddha statues all around.

130
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,166
- If they work…
- Hey, stop it, Game.

131
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,666
How could you say that?

132
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,458
It's not the same.

133
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,333
- This is fucking dumb.
- Game, where are you taking the amulet?

134
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,000
- It's nonsense.
- Give it back.

135
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:38,958
What the hell?

136
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,000
Namaskar, Brother.

137
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,625
May you be blessed.

138
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,916
Allow me to attach the mic.

139
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:53,375
Um.

140
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,375
Dear didn't come with you?

141
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,375
Oh, Ms. Dear asked me to help here.

142
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,416
Let me check the lighting first.
Then we can shoot.

143
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,208
Oh, Brother.

144
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,583
Shouldn't you be sleeping?

145
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,541
Where are Win and Game?

146
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:00,458
They left.

147
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,666
Is there anything I can help with?

148
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:11,916
Um.

149
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:17,708
No, there isn't. Game said it's a sin
to make monks do things for you.

150
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,791
Did you want something?

151
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:31,875
Uh.

152
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:38,125
Can I have the questions
we'll use in the next podcast?

153
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:39,875
Oh.

154
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,750
Actually, I've already picked a few, but…

155
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:49,333
I'll print it out
and have Note bring it to you.

156
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,375
I haven't had the time to check them.

157
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:56,375
It's pretty busy at the moment, but once
this is over, we'll have nice long break.

158
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,666
That's good.

159
00:13:58,541 --> 00:13:59,625
You deserve a break.

160
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,083
You've been working really hard.

161
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,250
It's not that.

162
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,041
I mean…

163
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,041
when this is over,

164
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,166
I probably won't be
doing this work anymore.

165
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,333
Is that so?

166
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,166
Please excuse me.

167
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,250
Here, Grandpa.

168
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:29,375
Ah.

169
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,166
Okay.

170
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:41,833
Ah.

171
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,375
Oh!

172
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,250
Oh, shit.

173
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,833
Okay.

174
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,041
Hello?

175
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,250
<i>Hello? Do you hear me, Game?</i>

176
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:03,708
Who is it?

177
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,916
<i>Are you alone?</i>

178
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,166
NARUETHIP WATER

179
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,250
Game. It's me.

180
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,541
I know that.

181
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,416
How did you know I was here?

182
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,250
That's not important.

183
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:34,875
The reason I came to see you is,
let me be straight with you,

184
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,500
I want you to give me 500,000.

185
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,875
How would I have 500,000?
What's in your pockets?

186
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,916
- There's nothing.
- And the bag?

187
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,833
Here.

188
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,041
There's only a cloth.

189
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:54,958
Um.

190
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,083
Game, please help me.

191
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,333
- Game.
- Let go.

192
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,875
He's gonna kill me.

193
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,875
You're the only one who can help me.

194
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,750
Let go first. Let go.

195
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:08,375
Ah.

196
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,791
Think of it as my pay.

197
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:18,416
You're where you are now, with the temple,
because I helped you get there, no?

198
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,875
You have to help me.

199
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:23,208
Uncle, you should talk to Win about this.
There's nothing I can do.

200
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,500
No, no.

201
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,333
I promise.

202
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:33,458
I promise you won't ever
see my face again, okay?

203
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,875
I don't want to die.

204
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,750
Hey, just keep it down.

205
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,416
Keep it down, alright?

206
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,083
- Okay?
- Okay.

207
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:43,791
You need 500,000, right?

208
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,500
Yes, 500,000.

209
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,125
Game, you have to help me,

210
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,958
or I'll really end up dead.

211
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,000
Okay, okay, 500,000.

212
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,000
- Sure it's enough, 500,000?
- Yes.

213
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:09,791
Where's your BMW?

214
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:12,833
Getting repaired.

215
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,208
I really appreciate it.

216
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,458
Don't come to my house again.

217
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,250
We're done here. Okay?

218
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,833
PUBLIC SERVICE CENTER
PHANOM POLICE STATION

219
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,416
Go ahead. I'll catch up with you.

220
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:05,583
Too many people.
The queue was so damn long. But I got it.

221
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,750
- I ordered from online.
- What?

222
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,291
Why the hell did you make me go there?

223
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,500
Oh.

224
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,083
Hey, Au, check for me.

225
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,083
Which factory produced it? When?

226
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,791
You got it. Hey.

227
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,833
The pickup truck driver's address.
I wrote it down for you.

228
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,791
What about the CCTV footage
at the hospital?

229
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,708
Waiting for director's approval.

230
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,583
I'll get back to work.

231
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,250
Oh, shit!

232
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,416
What is it now?

233
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,875
I just gave you 500,000 yesterday.

234
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,333
I need to talk to you.

235
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,208
Just leave me alone.

236
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,208
I beg you, please.

237
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,958
You have to understand me.

238
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,416
I'm being hunted.

239
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,833
The 500,000 baht you gave me
won't be enough.

240
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,500
I want three million.

241
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,791
Uncle. How would I have three million?

242
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,125
With the amulets you made with Win,

243
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,125
Three million baht

244
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,958
is chump change for you guys.

245
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,416
Or I could come by your place
and ask for it.

246
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,000
Uncle.

247
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,166
Think about it.

248
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,208
If I didn't want to help,

249
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,666
I wouldn't even give you 500 baht.

250
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,750
But I helped you

251
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,833
because I appreciate
that you've done a lot for us.

252
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,166
But…

253
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,500
Three million? I don't have that.

254
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,125
Alright?

255
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:48,833
Win deposited all the money in
the wallet, and we can't take it out.

256
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,500
What wallet are you talking about?

257
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,791
It's crypto, okay?

258
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:57,083
If you don't know,
you don't have to ask about it. Alright?

259
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,083
Don't pull tricks with me.

260
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:05,041
You need to calm down first, okay?
If you want the money,

261
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:09,000
I'll try to get it in a few days,
but in the meantime,

262
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,875
I'll take you somewhere to hide.

263
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,541
You're so up and down with your moods.

264
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,541
Suddenly, you're nice to me.

265
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,666
What do you want me to do?

266
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,375
When I try to help, you brush it off.
What do you want?

267
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:28,041
If you won't my help,
then just shoot me and be over with it,

268
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,708
and get hit with another charge.

269
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:32,625
Alright.

270
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,333
But don't drive to the police station.

271
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:38,208
If I find out,

272
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,250
I'll blow your head off.

273
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I got it.

274
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:01,166
This amulet,

275
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,833
I bought it myself.

276
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:06,000
The reason I can walk again

277
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:08,666
is definitely because of this amulet.

278
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,291
How much was it?

279
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,541
Only 2,000 baht.

280
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:20,250
What month did you get it?

281
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:24,708
Actually, I asked my wife
to get it for me.

282
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:28,625
It was a long time ago.
I think she went to a funeral.

283
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:29,750
Um.

284
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,500
This same one?

285
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:36,291
Is it authentic?

286
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:37,958
This one.

287
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,875
It's authentic. I always wear it.

288
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:43,625
The price has shot up a lot.

289
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,541
- Aren't you interested in reselling?
- Oh.

290
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,041
No.

291
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:05,208
So, how exactly did you get this amulet?

292
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,208
I already told you.

293
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:13,333
I didn't see you wearing it that day.

294
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:19,666
I hung it on the rearview mirror,
and the rescuer returned it to me later.

295
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:28,291
I went to gather evidence at the scene.
I didn't see any amulet.

296
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:29,875
I only found this.

297
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:35,458
Hey.

298
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:37,666
That's not mine.

299
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,000
You can deny it,

300
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:42,875
but I have all the evidence,

301
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:44,875
pictures of the truck.

302
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:47,500
Everything points to you.

303
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:49,125
And do you know

304
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:50,833
how many people you killed?

305
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:53,500
No way, this isn't mine.

306
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:56,333
- Making an excuse?
- What fucking excuse?

307
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:58,208
You're accusing me.

308
00:24:58,291 --> 00:25:00,500
- I'm not going to accept this.
- Hey.

309
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,833
Au.

310
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:07,916
Listen.

311
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,083
Do you know

312
00:25:12,916 --> 00:25:16,041
that drug possession
carries a severe sentence?

313
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:22,125
And using drugs before the accident
only adds to a worse punishment.

314
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,666
You could get a life sentence.

315
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,958
- What do you want from me?
- Nothing.

316
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:35,791
Just tell me, on the day of the incident,

317
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:39,333
what did you agree with those two?

318
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,708
If you still want to keep
enjoying meals at home.

319
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:57,833
That was pretty smooth.

320
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:14,833
We're here.

321
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:21,250
NARUETHIP

322
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:38,541
There's nothing around here.

323
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:41,708
- Hurry up.
- Jeez, why the rush?

324
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,875
- Hurry up.
- Just a sec.

325
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:14,416
Oh.

326
00:27:14,916 --> 00:27:17,291
Okay, there's electricity and water.

327
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:32,541
Does the television work?

328
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:35,708
Try turning it on. If it does, it works.

329
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:38,750
If it doesn't, it's broken.

330
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:41,958
You brat.

331
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:53,375
- It's broken.
- Um.

332
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:17,083
Just stay put inside
and don't roam around too much. Alright?

333
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:21,500
How can I be sure
you won't just leave me here?

334
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,208
When will I get the money?

335
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,083
Uncle. Three million baht,
you think that's easy to gather?

336
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,458
Hey, why did you say it like that?

337
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:34,541
How else was I supposed to say it?

338
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:38,166
If you want the money,
just give me a bit of trust.

339
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:39,875
Alright?

340
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:41,791
Okay.

341
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,666
I left a bag in the car.

342
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:47,041
It's brown. Grab it for me.

343
00:28:48,791 --> 00:28:50,291
Okay, sure.

344
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:53,750
<i>Don't call the police.</i>

345
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:55,791
<i>Or I'll expose everything.</i>

how about we call it quits
after this stock?

356
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:25,333
Um.

357
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:28,541
Fuck.

358
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:30,208
It's empty?

359
00:29:41,791 --> 00:29:44,500
Hey. I just had an idea.

360
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:49,041
What if we make phone cases

361
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:52,500
targeting teenagers, office workers,
and online sellers,

362
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:57,625
expanding on the product we have?
Or do something like minimal bracelets.

363
00:29:58,416 --> 00:30:00,333
Wallpapers is also interesting.

364
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:07,000
Come up with a few designs.
I think the margin is gonna be huge.

365
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:18,125
So you're not gonna quit?

366
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,125
We don't need to quit.

367
00:30:23,791 --> 00:30:26,416
It's just a bit more.
We've set up the system.

368
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,583
After this, we just let it run.
Then we can go wherever we want.

369
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:33,541
Are you sure?

370
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:38,125
Of course. Why not do it
when we have the chance?

371
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,791
DEAR: GAME, WE GOT ALL THE MONEY

372
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:21,166
NARUETHIP WATER

373
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,708
This restaurant is better the last one.

374
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:28,625
- Which restaurant is it?
- Larb Yaso.

375
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:29,791
Oh.

376
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,333
The owner of this place
must be too proud.

377
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:34,833
Too proud how?

378
00:31:35,416 --> 00:31:36,625
Because the name's Yaso.

379
00:31:38,416 --> 00:31:39,291
Damn funny.

380
00:31:40,875 --> 00:31:42,083
How is that funny?

381
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:45,166
Not funny, then.

382
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:56,208
- Let me ask you something.
- Um.

383
00:31:57,541 --> 00:32:00,333
The person you're afraid of, who is he?

384
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:05,041
It's better you don't know.

385
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:07,000
Oh.

386
00:32:08,541 --> 00:32:10,333
I might be able to help you.

387
00:32:10,416 --> 00:32:13,916
Don't trick me into telling you.
Trying to get me killed?

388
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:19,625
Fine. I won't ask anymore,
if you think I'm trying to get you killed.

389
00:32:20,208 --> 00:32:25,000
- Don't end up dead on your own then.
- Damn, what a bad mouth you've got.

390
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:28,625
You should know your damn place.

391
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,208
- Huh!
- Ouch!

392
00:32:31,291 --> 00:32:33,041
You're wasting the damn food.

393
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:39,916
Boss.

394
00:32:45,916 --> 00:32:46,750
Hello?

395
00:32:51,541 --> 00:32:52,875
Care to join us for a run?

396
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,458
It's good for health.

397
00:32:57,583 --> 00:32:59,583
You're not answering. That's fine.

398
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:03,625
I just wanted to tell you that
health is important.

399
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:08,375
You seem only focused
on running your business.

400
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:12,958
As you get older,
remember to take care of your health,

401
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:15,000
or you'll end up like me.

402
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:20,416
- All good?
- All good, Boss.

403
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:25,333
Keep it.

404
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:27,041
Oh.

405
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:35,041
This is great.

406
00:33:35,708 --> 00:33:37,750
You're determined, I like that.

407
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:42,875
Both the principal and interest
have all been cleared.

408
00:33:43,541 --> 00:33:44,500
It's done.

409
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:48,375
Anyway, thank you so much
for doing business with us.

410
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:52,583
I've never done business with you,
and don't think I don't know what you did.

411
00:33:52,666 --> 00:33:54,541
That's not a nice thing to say.

412
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:57,666
It could be considered defamatory.

413
00:33:58,333 --> 00:33:59,500
But it's okay.

414
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:02,083
I don't mind such small matters.

415
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:05,750
In any case, you're our client.

416
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:08,125
And my responsibility is just

417
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,583
to make sure you pay your debt.

418
00:34:10,666 --> 00:34:13,666
So we're clear?
Nothing more to do with each other.

419
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,208
Your business is going
really well right now, isn't it?

420
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:22,875
If you need any help,
feel free to contact me anytime.

421
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:30,708
Don't rush off just yet.

422
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:33,625
Here.

423
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,833
Umm…

424
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:42,291
Keep it close to your heart.

425
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:47,541
Please drive safely. Have a good journey.

426
00:34:58,875 --> 00:35:00,500
May you prosper!

<i>Hello, Dear.</i>

430
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,750
What's up, Pui?

431
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,583
<i>How's it going with the work?</i>

432
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:13,208
<i>Let me know if there are any problems,</i>
<i>so we can fix it in time.</i>

433
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:17,833
- It's almost done.
- <i>Yeah? So, when can I see it?</i>

434
00:36:17,916 --> 00:36:18,958
Umm…

435
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:24,875
How about Friday evening?
I'll bring you the design.

436
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:27,208
<i>Friday? That's tomorrow.</i>

437
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:29,125
Um.

438
00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:30,791
Yes.

439
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:34,000
<i>Okay, see you at the usual place.</i>

440
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:35,458
Okay.

441
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:37,958
Bye.

442
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:44,000

445
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:25,083
- Fuck.
- Give me your hand.

446
00:37:26,666 --> 00:37:27,541
Um.

447
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:36,666
- Does it hurt?
- Yes, it does.

448
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:42,875
It hurts.

449
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:56,875
Tired much?

450
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:00,500
Wanna grab a bite?

451
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:06,916
Um.

452
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:35,625
Aren't you hungry?

453
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:38,458
No.

454
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:40,875
But I'm sleepy.

455
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:46,250
Sure you don't need my help?

456
00:38:48,541 --> 00:38:49,500
It's okay.

457
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:51,958
Only a bit left.

458
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:55,708
Aren't you going home today?

459
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:58,750
You can leave now if you want.

460
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:01,791
I'll go back to the office
and continue working.

461
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,458
Okay, I already called a cab.

462
00:39:13,291 --> 00:39:14,416
Is that your ride?

463
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:18,125
Yeah, I'll get going.

464
00:39:19,833 --> 00:39:20,833
- See you.
- Um.

Father.

478
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,333
Do you happen to know
who Tang was working for?

479
00:42:45,833 --> 00:42:47,000
Who did you say?

480
00:42:56,291 --> 00:42:57,666
Could you say that again?

481
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,333
Who is it?

482
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:31,083
Game?

483
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:33,375
What brings you here?

484
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:37,333
Hello.

485
00:43:39,541 --> 00:43:42,625
Let's talk over here.
Father needs his rest.

486
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:45,083
Sure.

487
00:43:57,625 --> 00:43:58,458
Tea?

488
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,541
No, I'm good.

489
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:07,083
How have you been?
It's been a while.

490
00:44:07,583 --> 00:44:09,958
It's been alright,

491
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:14,291
just been busy helping out
with the family business.

492
00:44:19,458 --> 00:44:21,166
Is something bothering you?

493
00:44:23,208 --> 00:44:24,291
You can tell me.

494
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,875
But if you don't want to, that's fine.

495
00:44:36,791 --> 00:44:39,000
Well, I mean…

496
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:44,000
there is something.

497
00:44:47,458 --> 00:44:49,791
It's about Tang.

498
00:44:55,916 --> 00:44:58,708
Well, he came to see me and…

499
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,208
asked me to help him find a place to hide.

500
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:05,375
Is that true?

501
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,125
Did you report it to the police?

502
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:10,125
Not yet.

503
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:12,791
He threatened that
if I went to the police,

504
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:14,500
he'd hurt my family.

505
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:18,291
He also wanted 3,000,000 from me.

506
00:45:18,375 --> 00:45:20,000
Did he harm you?

507
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:21,708
No.

508
00:45:26,833 --> 00:45:27,708
That's good.

509
00:45:28,583 --> 00:45:31,708
Try and stay calm.
Be mindful, don't be rash.

510
00:45:33,291 --> 00:45:34,166
Alright.

511
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:41,333
But think carefully about it.
Harboring a criminal is against the law.

512
00:45:41,916 --> 00:45:42,750
Right.

513
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:49,583
Brother.

514
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:53,958
Do you happen to know

515
00:45:54,833 --> 00:45:56,541
who Tang was working for?

516
00:46:00,083 --> 00:46:01,208
I'm sorry, Game.

517
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:05,291
I'm afraid I can't help you.
It's not within my duty.

518
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,500
It's alright.

519
00:46:08,125 --> 00:46:09,416
I should get going.

520
00:46:15,666 --> 00:46:17,458
Take off your shoes next time.

521
00:46:18,458 --> 00:46:19,416
Oh.

522
00:46:19,916 --> 00:46:20,875
I'm sorry.

523
00:46:21,666 --> 00:46:22,958
Goodbye, Brother.

524
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:37,125
<i>In Kyoto Protocol</i>
<i>and Paris Agreement, there has been…</i>

525
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:40,666
I'm going back to Bangkok next month.
My job here is done.

526
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:43,916
So I'll be working in Bangkok like before.

527
00:46:45,958 --> 00:46:46,875
Um.

528
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,750
<i>One of those factors is</i>
<i>arms trading</i>

529
00:46:50,833 --> 00:46:54,708
<i>or carbon credits</i>
<i>with developing countries.</i>

530
00:46:54,791 --> 00:46:56,250
I won't be able to visit often.

531
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:02,916
Wanna live with me in Bangkok?

532
00:47:04,833 --> 00:47:06,458
Where would I stay?

533
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:09,083
I'm planning to buy a house.

534
00:47:09,708 --> 00:47:13,041
If you live there, you don't have to work.
I can take care of you,

535
00:47:14,875 --> 00:47:16,541
and Salt will have more space.

536
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:20,375
<i>Due to the fact that</i>
<i>individuals or organizations</i>

537
00:47:20,458 --> 00:47:25,291
<i>have taken action towards the goal</i>
<i>of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</i>

538
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:26,916
It's fine if you don't want to.

539
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,416
<i>In that it can be measured</i>

540
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,916
<i>or traded through the</i>
<i>Carbon Credit trading market.</i>

541
00:47:35,958 --> 00:47:39,416
<i>The goal in greenhouse gas reduction</i>
<i>is the result of…</i>

542
00:48:26,625 --> 00:48:27,458
Hey, Game.

543
00:48:29,708 --> 00:48:30,541
You know,

544
00:48:32,291 --> 00:48:34,458
you're really talented.

545
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:38,041
I'm so glad

546
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:39,333
to have met you.

547
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:42,500
I just keep on getting richer.

548
00:48:44,583 --> 00:48:45,750
I'm fucking wasted.

549
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:09,625
PORTFOLIO - USDT
VALUE (THB) 15,023,442.75

550
00:49:10,833 --> 00:49:12,041
- Win.
- Hm?

551
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:15,666
What do you actually do for work here?
I don't even know.

552
00:49:17,083 --> 00:49:19,333
Just some regular work.

553
00:49:19,916 --> 00:49:20,875
Nothing special.

554
00:49:23,083 --> 00:49:24,750
You never tell me anything.

555
00:49:35,791 --> 00:49:37,250
Why are we going this way?

556
00:49:37,333 --> 00:49:40,833
What? We're going to
the temple I've always wanted to visit.

557
00:49:41,791 --> 00:49:43,333
It's a famous temple.

558
00:49:43,416 --> 00:49:45,916
Before you leave,
I thought I should visit.

559
00:49:50,916 --> 00:49:56,041
PHUMMARAM TEMPLE

560
00:49:57,708 --> 00:50:04,375
NARUETHIP WATER

561
00:50:09,333 --> 00:50:10,583
Hello?

562
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:13,416
<i>Game, is everything all right?</i>

563
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:17,041
What do you mean by that?

564
00:50:17,125 --> 00:50:19,333
<i>Why did you need</i>
<i>to borrow a million?</i>

565
00:50:20,625 --> 00:50:23,750
Oh, don't worry about it.
I'll pay you back soon.

566
00:50:23,833 --> 00:50:26,666
<i>Alright, rich guy.</i>
<i>You're acting weird.</i>

567
00:50:27,166 --> 00:50:28,041
Um.

568
00:50:28,833 --> 00:50:29,958
Okay, I have to go.

569
00:50:30,916 --> 00:50:31,791
<i>Bye.</i>

570
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:54,208
Namaskar, Brother.

571
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:04,125
MERIT-MAKING BUDDHA STATUE MOULDING EVENT

572
00:51:12,791 --> 00:51:14,458
Come on. Let's go home

573
00:51:14,541 --> 00:51:16,625
You should make merit sometimes.

574
00:51:16,708 --> 00:51:19,250
It'll calm your mind
and make you less cranky.

575
00:51:19,333 --> 00:51:20,333
That's not funny.

576
00:51:21,666 --> 00:51:24,125
By the way, I also got this.

577
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:25,875
It's for you.

578
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:27,500
Mom!

579
00:51:28,458 --> 00:51:32,291
What? I reserved it on the web
like you taught me.

580
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:35,625
I wanted to pick it up myself
to make it even more sacred.

581
00:51:36,958 --> 00:51:39,500
No, Mom. I'll return it.
I can talk to them.

582
00:51:40,583 --> 00:51:42,833
What's wrong?
I gave it to you so you can pray

583
00:51:42,916 --> 00:51:45,041
and ask for your dad to return.

584
00:51:48,708 --> 00:51:51,166
Do you remember
what we talked about at the beach?

585
00:51:54,166 --> 00:51:55,250
Can you remind me?

586
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:03,750
You asked if I had any regrets
about my life.

587
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:07,750
Right.

588
00:52:08,833 --> 00:52:13,541
I'm not sure
if it's too soon to talk about this now.

589
00:52:13,625 --> 00:52:16,416
Honestly, you can talk to me
about anything.

590
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:24,750
I've thought it through and decided that

591
00:52:26,541 --> 00:52:29,583
I want a chance to live a life
like a lay person.

592
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:38,583
I've decided to leave the monkhood.

593
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:44,833
Can you stop being so superstitious?

594
00:52:44,916 --> 00:52:48,208
It's all fake. They just trick people
into believing and spending money.

595
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:49,416
Haven't you realized?

596
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,375
I have my beliefs. Why is that so wrong?

597
00:52:57,875 --> 00:53:01,500
Dad's been gone for 18 years.
How would a fucking amulet bring him back?

598
00:53:01,583 --> 00:53:02,708
He's probably dead.

599
00:53:09,333 --> 00:53:11,208
Don't ever say that again.

600
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,291
How would you know if he's dead?

601
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,083
How come? Is something bothering you?

602
00:53:24,625 --> 00:53:26,625
You can tell me, or Win, or Game--

603
00:53:26,708 --> 00:53:28,125
It's because I love you.

604
00:53:36,041 --> 00:53:38,375
I've never felt this way with anyone

605
00:53:39,875 --> 00:53:41,541
until I met you.

606
00:53:45,333 --> 00:53:48,250
And I believe that
continuing as a monk like this

607
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:50,833
will only bring disgrace.

608
00:53:57,166 --> 00:53:58,291
Would it be alright

609
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,166
when I was no longer a monk

610
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:04,000
that we would…

611
00:54:14,958 --> 00:54:15,791
I…

612
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:20,583
I'm sorry.

613
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,166
Out of the way!

614
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:37,416
Get out of the way!

615
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,166
Out of the way, please.

616
00:54:39,958 --> 00:54:41,291
POLICE

617
00:54:42,958 --> 00:54:43,833
Excuse me.

618
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:53,166
Are you the person on the warrant?

619
00:55:21,125 --> 00:55:22,166
Hey, Uncle Tang.

620
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:29,916
I'm opening the door.

621
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,666
Oh!

622
00:55:41,416 --> 00:55:42,916
Why didn't you lock the door?

623
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:46,000
Why are you sitting in the dark?

624
00:55:47,291 --> 00:55:48,125
Huh?

625
00:55:49,833 --> 00:55:50,666
Here,

626
00:55:51,625 --> 00:55:52,833
I brought the money.

627
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:54,625
But…

628
00:55:55,291 --> 00:55:57,125
I've got one million for now.

629
00:55:58,333 --> 00:56:00,041
I'll sort out the rest later.

630
00:56:01,208 --> 00:56:02,083
Um…

631
00:56:04,916 --> 00:56:06,000
Are you listening?

632
00:56:08,791 --> 00:56:10,875
Hey. Uncle Tang.

633
00:56:11,375 --> 00:56:14,000
Hey. Wake up!

634
00:56:16,875 --> 00:56:18,208
Uncle Tang.

635
00:56:20,458 --> 00:56:21,291
Hey!

636
00:56:24,416 --> 00:56:25,791
Shit. Fuck!

637
00:56:44,875 --> 00:56:45,875
Shit!

638
00:56:47,416 --> 00:56:48,666
Shit!
