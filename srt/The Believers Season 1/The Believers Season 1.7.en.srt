1
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,333
This is Phummaram Temple.

2
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:22,708
They took less than six months
to develop it

3
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:26,500
from a small, secluded temple

4
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,625
no one cared about into a famous one.

5
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:37,333
This is Akkarachai, a descendant of a
wealthy family of businessmen.

6
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:40,708
Don't you find it strange
for someone from a rich family

7
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,958
to get involved with a temple's affairs?

8
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,791
Look at this, sir.

9
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:48,250
Chaiyong, the temple's liaison,

10
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:53,083
is on the run from drug charges
along with newly ordained monks.

11
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:54,541
I'm thinking that

12
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:57,333
Akkarachai and his two friends

13
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:01,208
might have something to do
with Chaiyong's drug case

14
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,666
and use the temple for money laundering.

15
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:08,208
What do you expect to get out of this?

16
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:12,541
Sir.

17
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,791
I think that…

18
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:17,166
in practice,

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,375
three teenagers and an old liaison
aren't capable of doing this themselves.

20
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:26,250
I bet they have a powerful backup.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,458
Sir, how about we do this?

22
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:37,583
Why don't you let
my team and I look into this?

23
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,833
Will it be like last time?

24
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:00,666
Fine.

25
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,250
Give it a try.

26
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:10,250
THE BELIEVERS

27
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:33,416
I think the amount
you paid this time is rather small.

28
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,750
Look.

29
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,250
It's not even half
of what you paid last time.

30
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:43,125
Well, there have been
some problems with my business.

31
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,541
Business problems, huh?

32
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,916
Well, if I have the money,
I'll pay you. Right?

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,583
I give you everything I have,
because in the end,

34
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,000
you live off interest anyway, don't you?

35
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,833
Hey, wait. Let go of me.

36
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,416
Stay still!

37
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,500
Huh?

38
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:25,958
You love to hear me say
"It's alright." Don't you?

39
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,458
Please calm down first.

40
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,250
Let's talk it out.

41
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,833
I'm not running away.

42
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,625
Hey! Hey!

43
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,375
Oh.

44
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,625
Huh.

45
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,541
What the fuck was that?

46
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:02,541
Huh?

47
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,333
As of now,

48
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,500
the sum of your debt,

49
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,541
including the interest,

50
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,833
is almost equal
to the amount at the start.

51
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,708
And next time,

52
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,750
if you still pay the same amount,

53
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,916
it won't be this gun anymore.

54
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:32,583
Yes, sir.

55
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,166
And…

56
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,791
don't even think of running away.

57
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,541
REMAINING BALANCE 43,832,800

58
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,875
NARUETHIP WATER

59
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,083
Hey, you there.

60
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,375
Hey.

61
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:08,833
Mr. Liaison.

62
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,750
What are you doing here?

63
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,208
Who are you?

64
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,750
Why did you follow me?

65
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:26,791
I'm here for golf driving.

66
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:30,000
What's wrong with you?
What are you upset about?

67
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,583
You're from a temple.
You should keep calm.

68
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,541
Falling. Rising.

69
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,791
Do you want to talk?

70
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,500
No, thanks.

71
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,041
I'm in a rush.

72
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,958
Your two friends didn't come along?

73
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:03,541
Hey, you.

74
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:09,208
Are you going to leave the tokens
of your shitty game just like that?

75
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,041
Hello? Au.

76
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,833
You wanna go golfing, shit head?

77
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,583
Fuck.

78
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,458
This prick.

79
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,416
Are you all right?

80
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:10,958
What the fuck did you do?

81
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:15,041
I didn't mean to do anything.
The car just crashed.

82
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,625
It was an accident.

83
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:25,791
So what do we do?
Should I call my insurance company?

84
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,041
I'll make the call.

85
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:41,875
No one is picking up.

86
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:45,250
What? Are you sure it's the right temple?

87
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,041
- Call and ask Game.
- He hasn't replied.

88
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,083
Let's check the abbot's residence.

89
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,208
Monk Dol, right?

90
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,791
You look somewhat familiar.

91
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,208
You were a forest monk before, right?

92
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,625
Why did you become a city monk

93
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,625
and want to make sacred objects?

94
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,125
What were you thinking?

95
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:27,166
Would it be possible for us to have
a small portion of sacred substance?

96
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,666
I have to decline

97
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:33,166
because we also have a plan
to make the sacred object of the year.

98
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,250
It won't be the same as yours.

99
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:43,208
Because we're going to put together
substances gathered from many places.

100
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:47,125
I don't know who gave an approval to this.

101
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,125
You should leave.

102
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:01,833
Father.

103
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,208
We have good intentions
for what we're doing,

104
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,250
to make people
more interested in religion.

105
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,125
All we want is your support.

106
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,875
Don't use religion
as a cover.

107
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,041
I can see through your true intention.

108
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:20,416
God damn it.

109
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,541
Fuck, we were so close.

110
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:26,958
Win.

111
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:32,333
GAME: WE ARE IN TROUBLE

112
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,041
Here you go.

113
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:44,666
- Thank you.
- Do you want a photo of his ID card?

114
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:46,833
Yeah, sure.

115
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:56,791
MR. KRITSANAPHOL ATCHARIYAPHON

116
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,875
- Okay, got it.
- Alright.

117
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:01,625
Are we all set?

118
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,666
Yes, we'll contact a garage
for you as soon as possible.

119
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,916
Alright. Itthara Insurance
is happy to serve you!

120
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,166
- Thank you.
- No worries.

121
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:23,958
Here's your ID card.

122
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:28,666
Here you go.

123
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,625
Itthara Insurance is happy to serve you!

124
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:36,791
Am I your friend?

125
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,125
Sorry, sir.

126
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
<i>Hello? Game, where are you?</i>

127
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,583
Hi, sis. What's up?

128
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,416
<i>Come back home quick.</i>
<i>Grandpa's collapsed.</i>

129
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,333
What?

130
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,416
Is he alright?

131
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,333
<i>It was pretty bad.</i>
<i>Come back home first.</i>

132
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,916
Okay. I'm heading back now.

133
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,833
- <i>Okay. Alright.</i>
- Okay.

134
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,458
What about this one?

135
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,250
Are there other shops?

136
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,125
They all look the same.

137
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:17,666
Read the reviews.

138
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,125
What reviews?

139
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,375
"It's holy as hell, sis." Like that?

140
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,166
The monk came with you right?

141
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,666
Take care of him well.

142
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:44,916
Where is Monk Dol?

143
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,125
Didn't he go to the restroom?

144
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:50,541
Fuck.

145
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,250
- You go that way.
- Okay.

146
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:20,750
Shit.

147
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,666
What happened to you?

148
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,791
I returned to the abbot's residence,

149
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,875
but I guess they really
didn't want us there.

150
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,750
Why didn't you tell me
you were going there?

151
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,375
This isn't right.

152
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,333
It's fine.

153
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,375
Here, Win.

154
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,625
Shouldn't we take him to the hospital?

155
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:07,625
It's okay.

156
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,333
I don't need to go to the hospital.

157
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,708
Let's get your wounds cleaned at least.

158
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:30,541
Here.

159
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,250
You're spilling it all.

160
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,125
Um.

161
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:48,625
Um.

162
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,625
What the hell are you doing?

163
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,666
Cleaning the wounds.

164
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,791
When cleaning wounds,
you have to start from here

165
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,291
and work your way outwards.

166
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,125
Give it to me. I'll do it.

167
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,291
I'm sorry, Brother.

168
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:22,916
It's all right.

169
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,791
Why did they have to do this to you?

170
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,625
They must have doubted me.

171
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,291
How?

172
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,041
I guess it's because…

173
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,583
I transferred to a city temple.

174
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:26,458
Dad. How are you feeling today?
Does it hurt a lot?

175
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,500
I'm a lot better now.

176
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,041
Okay, thank you so much.

177
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:33,708
Sis.

178
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:35,583
Mom.

179
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,125
Hi, Grandpa. Hi, Uncle.

180
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:40,708
Hey, Game.

181
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,000
How's Grandpa doing?

182
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,583
He broke his hip. He still can't move.

183
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,041
Why isn't he in the hospital?

184
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,416
- He doesn't want to stay there.
- Oh.

185
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,291
Who's gonna take care of him?

186
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,125
Me.

187
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,250
What about your baby?

188
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:02,500
Me.

189
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,041
Are you sure?

190
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,166
I'm fine.

191
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,208
And where is Dad?

192
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,958
He's working over there.

193
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,125
Okay. I'll be right back.

194
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:28,833
Dad.

195
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,375
Hey, what's up?

196
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,833
Can I talk to you?

197
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,000
Sure. What's up?

198
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:43,083
I need to borrow some money from you.

199
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,000
How much?

200
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,375
- Ten million.
- Ten million, Game?

201
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,791
I'll pay it back. The thing is…

202
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:56,291
my business has some problems with
cash flow, so I need money to manage it.

203
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,875
I don't have that much money.

204
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:06,000
Where is the watch I gave you?
You're not wearing it.

205
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,250
Did you sell it?

206
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,333
Are you in trouble or something?

207
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,083
Can you not change the topic?

208
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,333
Ten million is the problem.

209
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:19,458
How can our family not have money?
We have a huge business.

210
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:20,416
Game.

211
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:24,291
You know that it's a family business.

212
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,333
And Grandpa is not well.

213
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,833
Dad.

214
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,875
A family business, you say?

215
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,708
Why is Uncle's family getting so rich?

216
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,583
You're also Grandpa's son.

217
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:37,166
Why aren't you as wealthy
as everyone else?

218
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:38,708
Dad.

219
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:43,958
If you don't think about yourself,
you should at least think about your kids.

220
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:48,125
Look at my sister. She has to work
even though she's just had a baby.

221
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:49,625
Game.

222
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:53,166
Are you not satisfied living like this?

223
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,875
You're still not satisfied?

224
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:57,541
It's okay, Dad.

225
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,625
I'll take care of it myself.

226
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,000
Game! Game!

227
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,083
Are you feeling cold, Grandpa?

228
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,583
I'm better now.

229
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,333
I'll be right back, Mom.

230
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,833
What did you talk to Dad about?

231
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,875
Nothing.

232
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,583
You're so bad at hiding it.

233
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,875
Is something wrong?

234
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,291
No, I'm fine.

235
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:37,875
Um.

236
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,625
It's late. Why don't you stay over
and leave in the morning?

237
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:46,833
No, I can't. I'm very busy at the moment.

238
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,000
Take care of yourself.

239
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,416
Um.

240
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,166
What are you hiding in your hands?

241
00:19:58,458 --> 00:19:59,541
What do you think?

242
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,333
Look at it. What is it?

243
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:03,791
It's cigarettes.

244
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,125
You're smoking again.

245
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,250
Let me be.

246
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:10,166
- I'll cut it down later.
- Um.

247
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,958
- You should take your baby to bed.
- Alright.

248
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,833
Drive safely. Don't drive fast.

249
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,875
- Got it?
- Okay.

250
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:18,833
Bye.

251
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,291
Catch you later.

252
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,833
It's alright. I'll carry it myself.

253
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,458
Excuse me.

254
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,750
What happened to Monk Dol?

255
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,041
Didn't Dear tell you about it?

256
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,750
What the fuck.

257
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,875
BALANCE REMAINING 43,832,800

258
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,541
You know our debt is back
to the original sum?

259
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,458
Um.

260
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:35,083
Has Dear told you
that the cops are following me?

261
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,000
They can't do anything now. Don't worry.

262
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,791
- Did we get Jindamanee Powder?
- In about two days.

263
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:41,958
What about the footage?

264
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,666
- I'll take more.
- Hey.

265
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,583
Didn't you hear what I just said?

266
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,166
The cops are following me.

267
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:50,000
They have followed me
to the place we pay our debt.

268
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:53,166
They don't have any evidence yet.
What can they charge us with?

269
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,250
- It's not a big deal.
- Not a big deal?

270
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,500
How's that not a big deal? Huh?

271
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:02,958
You say it's not a big deal because
I'm always the one who takes the bullet.

272
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:04,666
Can you calm down?

273
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,250
Win is right.

274
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:09,500
How can the cops arrest us
if we haven't done anything wrong? Right?

275
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,541
I can be calm about the cops,

276
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,541
but I can't when it comes to debt.

277
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:24,750
We didn't pay all the interest last time.

278
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:27,166
It means we're back to the start.

279
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:30,250
So what now?
Will we get the money in time?

280
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:34,083
Or will both of you
take the bullet for me?

281
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:35,500
Huh?

282
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,041
Or will this shit you're drawing
shield me from the bullet?

283
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:41,916
I'm trying to solve
this problem right now.

284
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:51,875
- What a fucking idiot.
- Game.

285
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:54,250
Game, damn it. Get back here?

286
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,416
BROWN, ALMOST BLACK
INCLUDE ALL THE DETAILS

287
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:02,333
Yes, over here.

288
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:05,583
Look, the third one.
Here, the color is still uneven.

289
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,750
Have you finished packing? Hurry up.

290
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,833

297
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:11,000
How are the sales going?

298
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:12,666
So low.

299
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:14,791
Are there any orders online?

300
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:16,625
Around 300.

301
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:18,125
Damn it.

302
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,208
Fuck.

303
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,750
The sales are so bad.

304
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:26,000
Including the sales at the temple,
we've sold less than five percent.

305
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:27,541
What shall we do with the stock?

306
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:33,250
- I have to go.
- Where are you going?

307
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:34,375
To do some business.

308
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,375
What fucking business?

309
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:43,791
Can I go home too?

310
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:47,041
No, you're helping me with this. Here.

311
00:24:56,291 --> 00:24:58,625
Kai, Note, come here.

312
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,541
Help us move these.

313
00:25:03,416 --> 00:25:06,500
If you help,
Game will buy you kratom drink.

314
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:08,708
Hot damn.

315
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:11,000
The White Girl knows kratom drink.

316
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:12,583
Get moving.

317
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:14,208
Oh.

318
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,291
- So heavy.
- Isn't it a lot?

Please visit here.

320
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:02,458

Game. How's it going today?

328
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:36,583

Can I bum a smoke?

332
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:56,166
Here.

333
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:58,875
How are the sales?

334
00:27:01,541 --> 00:27:03,708
Look and see for yourself.

335
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,625
- It's really quiet.
- Um.

336
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:10,791
Fuck, it's so lonely.

- Win, you bastard.
- What's the matter?

339
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:54,041
Can you two stop acting so chill
like everything is normal?

340
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:57,541
I told you we've got no time.
We really have to pay debt.

341
00:27:57,625 --> 00:27:59,791
Have you seen any amulets getting sold?

342
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:02,583
Calm down. We still have time.

343
00:28:02,666 --> 00:28:04,375
And they're starting to sell.

344
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:05,833
Starting to sell?

345
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:09,875
Why don't you use the time and money
you've wasted to look outside?

346
00:28:09,958 --> 00:28:11,833
and see how deserted the temple is.

347
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:15,583
When you weren't here,
the cops were following me around.

348
00:28:15,666 --> 00:28:18,583
Okay. You two said
they can't do anything to me, right?

349
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:20,125
Take a look at this.

350
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:27,541
These guys waiting in front of my house,
they can't do anything to me, can they?

351
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,666
- Are they doing this to your mom?
- Hey.

352
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:36,833
I have a way now, Game.

353
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:38,666
What way is it now?

354
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:43,208
Let's say we put away this lot
and order a new model.

355
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:45,166
I'll make this lot a rare item.

356
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,875
You think I'm stupid enough
to waste money on this crap?

357
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:52,125
How do you even know
it's going to become a rare item?

358
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:57,458
If you can see the future, look at mine
and tell me when my family will be killed.

359
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,916
I'm asking you to trust me one last time.

360
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,500
I told you
I don't have time for you anymore.

361
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:06,041
Fuck, will you listen to me?
I said I have a way.

362
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:08,000
Can't you two talk nicely?

363
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:10,708
Shut the fuck up.
You only take your fuckboy's side.

364
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,208
What the fuck is wrong
with you, Game?

365
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:18,041
What are you gonna do?
Tell me your plan. What is it?

366
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:25,708
Okay, fine.
If you don't want to say it, then don't.

367
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:28,750
If you don't have a plan,
I'll do it my way.

368
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:33,541
You can do whatever the fuck you want.
I'll let the amulet experts sell this lot.

369
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:37,125
Why would you pay them to do that?
Fucking nonsense.

370
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,916
Nonsense?
What the fuck do you do these days?

371
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,916
Who always cleans up the mess after you?

372
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Who is it? Me!
I'm always the one who has to clean it up!

373
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:51,000
- You want me to believe you?
- What?

374
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:53,041
I shouldn't have
gotten into this with you!

375
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:57,250
And do as you please.
I'm not doing this shit anymore.

376
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:00,000
Are you done talking?

377
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,208
If you're done, think about it. Is it me
or you who brought that damn creditor.

378
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:08,375
Weren't you the one
dreaming about making that shitty token

379
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:10,708
and created this trouble
and made me deal with it?

380
00:30:10,791 --> 00:30:13,791
What the hell am I doing?
Fixing your damn problem!

381
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:20,750
- Think you're the only one who wants out?
- How can you say you're fixing this alone?

382
00:30:24,541 --> 00:30:27,791
Dear. Call the factory
and order another 100,000 pieces.

383
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:29,375
If you don't call them, I will.

384
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:42,583
FOOLS GET ENRAGED
MAD PEOPLE GET FRUSTRATED

385
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:49,958
FLOWERS INCENSE CANDLES

386
00:31:01,041 --> 00:31:02,916
You were too aggressive, Game.

387
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,250
<i>What about Win?</i>
<i>Why aren't you giving him a lecture?</i>

388
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:08,041
I haven't seen him for days.

389
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,000
<i>What wrong with him?</i>

390
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:13,833
<i>Not telling us anything</i>
<i>and going out every night?</i>

391
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:17,583
When are you two gonna talk things out?
It's freaking annoying.

392
00:31:18,541 --> 00:31:20,458
<i>It won't change anything. Hey.</i>

393
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:23,583
<i>I need to hang up. I have to help</i>
<i>my sister take care of my grandpa.</i>

394
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:25,166
Um. Okay.

395
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:36,916
Out of all days, you want to meet today.
Are you sober enough to talk?

396
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,958
Yes, I am.

397
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:40,625
Well, I forgot.

398
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:45,416
Hey, I'm sorry that I've only made
one option for you.

399
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,083
I have been busy like hell lately.

400
00:31:48,166 --> 00:31:50,333
Tell me honestly
if you don't like anything.

401
00:31:50,416 --> 00:31:53,666
Seriously, it's freaking good.

402
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,750
Are you sure
you've never organized an event?

403
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:57,166
You're exaggerating.

404
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:02,250
Hey, Nott is looking for
an interior designer for his clinic.

405
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:03,375
Are you interested?

406
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:04,375
What clinic?

407
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:10,083
Well, it's just a beauty clinic,
but he has many branches.

408
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:13,458
If you can do this,
it'll be a long-term project for you.

409
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:15,750
I can try.

410
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:20,208
Well then,
I'll talk to Nott for you.

411
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:25,333
If you have a portfolio of your work,
you can just send it to me via Line.

412
00:32:25,416 --> 00:32:31,041
WIN: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

413
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:33,000
Hey.

414
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:37,083
I need to go, and as for the rest--

415
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:41,000
You leaving already? It's my hen night.

416
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:44,125
You're fine with or without me.

417
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:46,583
I love you.

418
00:32:46,666 --> 00:32:48,708
Go. Go and be with your friends.

419
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:50,458
- Come with me.
- It's okay.

420
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:51,708
- Come on.
- I'm so busy.

421
00:32:51,791 --> 00:32:53,375
- Come on, Pui.
- Go on.

422
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:54,791
- Come on.
- Bye.

423
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:56,500
She's here, guys.

424
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:02,041
DEAR: SEND ME YOUR LOCATION

425
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:05,250
MY CURRENT LOCATION
1 HR 15 MINS 105 K.M.

426
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:13,875
Why did you become a rescue worker?

427
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:18,791
Well, I think doing rescue work
is another way to help society

428
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:22,750
because accidents occur very often
in our country these days.

429
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:26,125
Being a rescue worker
is like helping society.

430
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:30,375
I also help relieve the burden
of the officers of various agencies.

431
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:36,625
I feel like I get to work
with other people as a team.

432
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:38,750
Okay. Good.

433
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:40,041
This should do it.

434
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:43,250
Alright. I'll go back to my van. Okay.

435
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,291
What are you doing here?

436
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:52,625
Boosting sales of our amulets.

437
00:33:53,708 --> 00:33:54,541
Yeah?

438
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,750
If this plan is successful,
we can stop doing all this.

439
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,750
Um.

440
00:34:06,416 --> 00:34:07,875
PEERAPAT LUCKNGAM

441
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:09,625
- What the hell is this?
- Oh.

442
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:13,208
Here.

443
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:16,000
Wanna come? A motorcycle and a sedan.

444
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:18,541
- Maybe next time.
- Okay.

445
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:20,000
- Take the van out.
- Alright.

446
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:22,708
Go and check it now, hurry.
Go now. Go.

447
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:24,541
Hurry.

448
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:26,375
Get in the van.

449
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:54,291
- How long have you been coming here?
- A while.

450
00:34:55,916 --> 00:34:57,916
Since the day I told you about the amulet.

451
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:02,750
If we only rely on selling amulets,
it'll take ages.

452
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:07,375
Aren't they curious about who you are?

453
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,708
What're you gonna do about Game?

454
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:21,875
Fuck him. I'll talk to him myself.

455
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:24,166
Why don't you tell him?

456
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:27,541
Well, the cops are after him.

457
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:32,291
What about me? Why didn't you tell me?

458
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:36,000
Because it's dangerous.

459
00:35:38,708 --> 00:35:40,041
Are you serious?

460
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:55,583
<i>This is the Center.</i>
<i>We have a distress call on an accident.</i>

461

<i>Many people injured.</i>

462
00:35:58,833 --> 00:36:00,000
Let's go!

463
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:03,000
- Are you coming with me? It's a big case.
- Let's go. Come on.

464
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:04,416
Requesting destination, over.

465
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,583
- Guys. Come on.
- Okay.

466
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:08,750
You're so slow. I'm going first.
Follow me.

467
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:16,666
Fuck.

468
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:21,708
Let's go.

<i>at the scene? Over.</i>

471
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:49,875
<i>Not yet.</i>
<i>Heavy rain up front. Over.</i>

472
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:53,000
Can you get us there before them?

473
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:54,041
Yes.

474
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:57,125
Dear.

475
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,583
Dear! Dear! Dear!

476
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:00,750
Dear.

477
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:05,250
Let's go.

478
00:38:06,416 --> 00:38:07,708
Eleven people.

479
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:10,583
Be careful. Hurry up.

480
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:11,958
Help me.

481
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:14,291
Hurry up. Let's help them.

482
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:17,166
BANGKOK - TRAT

483
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:23,625
Guys, come on, hurry.

484
00:38:24,291 --> 00:38:26,500
Get the injured. Quick.

485
00:38:27,916 --> 00:38:28,833
Dear.

486
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:48,000
Why don't you go to the bus?

487
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:50,583
If you're gonna do this,
shouldn't we use bus victims?

488
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:53,875
Too many people. Someone might see us.

489
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:57,708
Damn it, give me a hand.

490
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:04,541
His legs are stuck.
How can we get him out?

491
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:34,291
They're here.

492
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:37,041
Hey, there's an injured person
over here.

493
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,750
Sir. This way!

494
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:43,625
Get the bed here.

495
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:09,125
Thank you so much.

496
00:40:09,666 --> 00:40:12,875
If it weren't for your help,
he would have likely died.

497
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:17,458
Where are you taking him next?

498
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:19,375
The provincial hospital.

499
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:22,125
Since there are many cases,
we have to gather them there.

500
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:24,750
Anyway, I need to go.

501
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,625
Fuck, I'm sorry.

502
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:41,750
Let's wait for the next case.

503
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:10,000
Let's go with this case.
Let's go to the hospital.

504
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:18,333
EMERGENCY

505
00:41:18,416 --> 00:41:20,541
EMERGENCY

506
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:27,666
Haven't you two gone home yet?

507
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,750
Sir, the man who was stuck in the car…

508
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:35,666
Oh, the truck driver you helped is safe.
He is probably out of the ER already.

509
00:41:38,083 --> 00:41:39,625
We would like to meet him.

510
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:43,041
Sure, I'll take you there. Come on up.

511
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:53,958
He should be around here.
Try looking for him.

512
00:41:54,625 --> 00:41:56,375
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

513
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:57,333
Bye now.

514
00:42:02,958 --> 00:42:04,083
- Dear.
- Yes?

515
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:09,541
- How much do we have in our account?
- Around 200,000. Why?

516
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:22,166
You're in a hospital.

517
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,083
Could you open your mouth? I'm going to…

518
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,916
- Are you Pairach?
- Um.

519
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:05,458
we're here to tell you
that your car fell into a ditch.

520
00:43:07,625 --> 00:43:09,125
How can that be?

521
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:12,541
Your car collided with a bus.

522
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:14,916
I remember that.

523
00:43:16,041 --> 00:43:17,291
I remember that part.

524
00:43:22,708 --> 00:43:25,166
Were you conscious when your car crashed?

525
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:26,666
Yes, of course.

526
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:28,708
I wasn't asleep.

527
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:33,166
The bus crossed over
to my side of the road.

528
00:43:34,791 --> 00:43:37,041
I was just driving like I normally do.

529
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:39,166
And who are you two?

530
00:43:40,875 --> 00:43:42,666
We are here to help you.

531
00:43:43,958 --> 00:43:46,583
Many reporters will probably
come to see you tomorrow.

532
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:49,458
I need you to tell them
you're alive because of this amulet,

533
00:43:50,166 --> 00:43:52,125
and I'll wire you 200,000 immediately.

534
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:58,083
You can use it to make the down payment
for a new truck or we can help as well.

535
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:01,166
Oh.

536
00:44:03,416 --> 00:44:04,583
I remember now.

537
00:44:04,666 --> 00:44:07,208
You were the one
who pulled me out of the car.

538
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:08,166
That's right.

539
00:44:09,333 --> 00:44:12,000
If you're saying I've saved you,
and now that you're alive,

540
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:14,333
can you return the favor
and tell the reporters--

541
00:44:14,416 --> 00:44:15,541
You should leave.

542
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:21,875
- I'm sorry?
- I said leave.

543
00:44:22,416 --> 00:44:25,083
But if you get a new truck,
you can start--

544
00:44:25,166 --> 00:44:26,833
I said I'm not doing it.

545
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,083
I'm not accepting anything
from you guys.

546
00:44:35,458 --> 00:44:36,291
Look at this.

547
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:41,125
Do you see my legs?

548
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:44,458
I can't move them.

549
00:44:45,791 --> 00:44:47,791
I can't fucking move my legs.

550
00:44:51,541 --> 00:44:54,625
So what the fuck
do you want me to tell anyone?

551
00:44:57,458 --> 00:44:58,791
A new truck?

552
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:03,125
What's the fucking use of a new truck?

553
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:09,416
How am I supposed to drive?

554
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,541
Calm down. It might not be
that difficult. If you want money--

555
00:45:12,625 --> 00:45:13,833
I'm not doing it!

556
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:16,375
Get out!

557
00:45:18,041 --> 00:45:19,875
I said get out!

558
00:46:31,541 --> 00:46:36,166
<i>Regarding the bus crashing</i>
<i>into a vegetable truck bound for Bangkok…</i>

559
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:37,291
