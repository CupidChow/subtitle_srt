- <i>Would you like some candy?</i>
- <i>How much?</i>

2
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:20,791
Twenty baht.

3
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,541
Pick one for me.

4
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:24,958
Here you go.

5
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:31,708
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

6
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:33,541
Thank you.

7
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,208
Would you like some candy?

8
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,000
- Didn't have to come if you're busy.
- Bye, then.

9
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,708
- See you.
- Asshole.

10
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,291
- What the hell?
- Want a drink?

11
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:49,375
No.

12
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:55,333
It's for you.

13
00:00:57,833 --> 00:00:59,000
Isn't it your birthday?

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,666
What? You remembered?

15
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,416
Of course, I remember, asshole.

16
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,750
Hey, not bad.

17
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:12,333
What's this?

18
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:16,333
A lucky stone for good luck
and smooth-running business.

19
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:18,250
Smooth, my ass. I don't want it.

20
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:22,000
It's not for you. It's for your cat.

21
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:24,625
Don't you dare throw it away.
It was pricey.

22
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:29,041
- Fine, if Salt will wear it.
- Um.

23
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:39,708
Happy birthday.

24
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:43,625
Would you please splurge a bit?

25
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,291
Why would I? You ain't my woman.

26
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:51,791
That's all you got for me?

27
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,583
- It's dry as hell.
- That's your rice.

28
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:55,000
You asshole.

29
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:03,000
THE BELIEVERS

30
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,041
One, two…

31
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,625
MAKING MERIT BY DONATING COFFINS

32
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:10,333
- Did you contact the USDT trader?
- Huh?

33
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:12,541
Yeah.

34
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,250
Yeah.

35
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:18,833
Hey, who's the new monk with Father Kiw?

36
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,375
I caught a glimpse of him.

37
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:22,583
His name's Ekachai.

38
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:26,375
I heard he used to be here
and went to study in Bangkok.

39
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:27,875
Will he be a problem?

40
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:30,541
Let's wait and see.

41
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:38,958
Ow!

42
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:40,875
Shit.

43
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:51,833
What now?

44
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:56,208
Don't give me that look.
I'm not here to shake you down. Jeez.

45
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,375
Someone wants to sponsor us.

46
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,458
This one?

47
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:05,958
Who's she?

48
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,916
A local politician.

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,458
She saw that we're good
at throwing events,

50
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,625
so she wants to be a regular sponsor.

51
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:18,916
You bring in money now?
I thought you only eat money.

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Hey, watch your mouth.

53
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:27,083
Only corpses eat money.
So, are you guys interested?

54
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,041
Let's do it.

55
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:34,083
- Okay.
- Do we have enough monks' residences?

56
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:35,666
How hard can it be?

57
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,958
Pick a plot. Except the ordination hall.
We need to tear that down.

58
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,833
And once we have the plot,

59
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,208
have Dear design it.
I'll take care of the rest.

60
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,041
- It won't be hard.
- Okay.

61
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:46,875
Okay.

Sadhu.

81
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:26,000
I rejoice in your merit.

82
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,708
I have some documents for you to sign.

83
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:37,500
Here you are.

84
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,041
Since we have many monks
residing at our temple now,

85
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,916
I think we need to build more residences.

86
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:50,041
- Would you handle this for me?
- Sure.

87
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,916
Let Monk Ekachai know
if you need anything else.

88
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,208
What's that medicine?

89
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,791
It's Chinese medicine, a tonic.

90
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,250
Would you like some for yourself?

91
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,041
- Oh.
- You've aged a lot.

92
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,875
- Hey, watch it.
- Tang.

93
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,833
He's a monk.

94
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:07,791
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,708
Tell me if you need anything, Chaiyong.

96
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:16,791
I will.

97
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,250
Hi.

98
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,708
Exchange money?

99
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,958
- Yes.
- Get in.

100
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:11,166
- What about the rest?
- No, I'm not exchanging it.

101
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,250
What do you want it in?

102
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,708

Lawyer Yos, a client's here to see you.

109
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,125
- Hello.
- Um.

110
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,625
So…

111
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,916
Was the traffic bad?

112
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:07,583
No.

113
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,458
Do you like to play golf?

114
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,500
I don't play golf.

115
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,500
Then…

116
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,000
All these…

117
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,083
All these trophies…

118
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,208
how did you get them?

119
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,000
In my line of work,

120
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,125
one needs to have what we call…

121
00:09:58,791 --> 00:09:59,625
prestige.

122
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,833
I see.

123
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,875
- Want some mango?
- No, thanks. I don't like it.

124
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:28,333
The amount you've paid
doesn't cover this month's interest.

125
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:29,750
Right.

126
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,833
The interest rate is 20%.

127
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,708
Don't you remember?

128
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,291
I remember.

129
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,250
Well, it's…

130
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,958
very high.

131
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,291
I don't care whether it's high or not.

132
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:48,500
My responsibility
is to ensure the debt gets paid.

133
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:52,875
All done.

134
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,708
OUTSTANDING BALANCE: 45,020,000

135
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,583

I'll be on my way.

137
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,875
- Hang on.
- Yes?

138
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,000
Next time,

139
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,958
please try to be a bit more punctual.

140
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,458
You were 15 minutes late.

141
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,625
Sure, of course.

142
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,500
Take it easy, now.

143
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,083
Goodbye.

144
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:41,291
When you have wealth,
friends gaze upon you.

145
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:45,916
When tarnished,
those friends regard you as animals.

146
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,875
When you have nothing,
no friends seek you out.

147
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:54,958
Upon passing, even animals turn away.

148
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,625
May you be blessed.

149
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:00,583
Right here.

150
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,166
Oh, right here?

151
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,291
This area seems bustling now.

152
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,000
You're the reason
this area is beginning to thrive.

153
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,791
Did someone give you sugar cane drink?
Such a sweet talker.

154
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,458
Choom! Pull over.

Master, PCM. Ae won't be sponsoring
our temple's annual event this year.

157
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,541
She only donated funds for merit-making.

158
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,958
Which temple is she sponsoring?

159
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,083

Led by Monk Veera.

163
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:55,333
Then you should find… make a sign,
and look for a new sponsor,

164
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,750
and put it up now.

165
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:57,833
I will.

166
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,666
Right this moment, right now.

167
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,750
Right, right.

168
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,708
<i>If you have come to know</i>
<i>Buddhism</i>

169
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,875
but don't try to make use of it

170
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:14,208
by learning from Lord Buddha's teachings,

171
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,583
that is neglectful.

172
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:20,250
For that reason,
now that you've heard the teachings,

173
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,000
let's put them into practice.

174
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,250
Alright, everyone.

175
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:29,500
Close your eyes.
Let's do some meditation practice.

176
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,708
Behave. Listen to the monk.

177
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:39,166
Stay mindful of your breath,
be aware of your presence.

178
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,208
Students,
come and line up over here.

179
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,041
- Namaskar.
- Greetings.

180
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:09,291
I want to ask about your availability
for recording clips and podcasts.

181
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,541
Can't you record during my sermons?

182
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:16,208
The audio quality isn't great,
so it's better to record separately.

183
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,000
When are you available?

184
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:23,541
I'm available every day.
I'm not going anywhere.

185
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:25,666
I see.

186
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,750
Master, Master.

187
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:33,125
My teacher wants you to sign this.

188
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:41,958
You're so pretty.

189
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,541
Do you have a boyfriend?

190
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,416
I have a bunch. Why? Wanna hit on me?

191
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,750
Master, do you think she's pretty?

192
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,375
You can't ask him that.

193
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:58,083
- Dear!
- Huh?

194
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,583
Follow me! Hurry!

195
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,750
Just come and see this.

196
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:09,750
Shit.

197
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:14,250
I don't know how close you are with Tang,
but you can't play favorites here.

198
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,583
- What's this about?
- How would I know?

199
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,708
They requested me.

200
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,833
You're just lying.
You don't even know the chants.

201
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:22,750
Fallen monk!

202
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:26,291
Fallen monk, my ass!

203
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,958
- You fuck!
- Stop it!

204
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:29,708
- Scum!
- Wait!

205
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,083
Get out of my way!

206
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,500
- Game! Step back.
- Let go!

207
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:36,708
Let's kick his ass

208
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,041
Fucking asshole!

209
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,541
Pong, enough!

210
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,375
- Pong, don't!
- You fuck!

211
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,291
Let go!

212
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,833
That's enough!

213
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,000
What are you all doing?

214
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:57,125
Do you know engaging in a physical fight
could lead you to getting defrocked?

215
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:00,750
If you're not considerate toward me,
at least be considerate toward the abbot.

216
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,750
What's this all about?

217
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:09,375
These monks keep accepting
service requests and not sparing us any.

218
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,041
They requested us.
What were we supposed to do?

219
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,083
We entered monkhood
to study Buddhist teachings,

220
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,375
not to exploit it for personal gain.

221
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,666
Have you no shame at all?

222
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:32,625
I'll discuss with the abbot
and sort this out for you.

223
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:35,625
As for all of you,

224
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,833
it's time for repentance.

225
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,875
From now on,
after the evening chants,

226
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:46,250
I'll post the queue of requested services
for each monk on the board every night.

227
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,333
Except for you,

228
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,958
because our monastic activities differ.

229
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:06,208
The problem occurred
because our temple has gotten bigger.

230
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:10,500
More monks have joined,
but we've never had a system to organize.

231
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,333
RULES FOR ACCEPTING REQUESTED SERVICES

232
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,666
All monks residing in this temple

233
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,333
must follow the rules
drafted by the abbot and me.

234
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:21,708
If anyone is dissatisfied
or unable to follow the rules,

235
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,666
the abbot is open
to allowing you to reside elsewhere

236
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,041
or to leave the monkhood.

237
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,791
That'll be all for now.

238
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,916
You're free to go about
your personal activities.

239
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:40,000
But let me reiterate,
don't let anything like this happen again.

240
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,333
<i>He who is</i>
<i>the Peaceful One.</i>

241
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:51,750
<i>The Worthy One,</i>
<i>the Perfectly Enlightened One.</i>

242
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:58,791
<i>The Dharma taught</i>
<i>by the Blessed One is well-spoken.</i>

243
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,333
<i>The Sangha</i>

244
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:05,916
<i>of the Blessed One's disciples is</i>
<i>well-gone.</i>

245
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:07,791
Can you continue?

246
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:12,875
<i>I seek refuge in the Buddha,</i>
<i>the Dharma, and the Sangha.</i>

247
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:17,750
<i>With these offerings, arranged in</i>
<i>accordance with the Buddha's guidance,</i>

248
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:22,000
<i>we pay our respects.</i>

249
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,083
Please come out.

250
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,666
Did everything go well?

251
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,125
Yes, everything went well.

252
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,541
Who has the collected merit funds?

253
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,583
I do.

254
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,291
Madam Phon said that…

255
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:42,291
She said that monks from our temple
could chant so beautifully.

256
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:44,833
That's good.

257
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,375
Please be our temple's eyes and ears.

258
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:50,958
The abbot said
you know every corner of the temple.

259
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:56,500
That's right. I know every corner.
You don't need to worry.

260
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,875
May I be reimbursed 2,000 for gasoline?

261
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:03,666
Bring me the bill.

262
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:13,625
Look, the tower is getting destroyed.
Let's crush them, bitch. Get them.

263
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:17,958
It's getting destroyed. Get them. Idiots.

264
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,458
- Hello there.
- Yes?

265
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,375
Hello.

266
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,750
Continue playing.
I don't mind.

267
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,291
You're Game, right?

268
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:29,750
Yes.

269
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,625
Father said you're in charge
of temple's accounts.

270
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,333
I just help Uncle Tang with it.

271
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,625
Then help me sort this money.

272
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,416
Here you go.

273
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,583
Did Uncle Tang leave that with you?

274
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,333
Put 1,000 baht in each envelope.

275
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:54,500
Okay.

276
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:07,416
This is the rest.
What do you want me to do with this money?

277
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,458
That's for temple's general funds.
You can keep it in the safe.

278
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,166
Okay.

279
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,916
And I'll need your help
to print this for me.

280
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:29,833
Sure.

281
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:35,000
If you're leaving, could I give you
documents for Father Kiw to sign?

282
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:39,333
I believe it's a sin
to have monks do things for you.

283
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:43,458
My apologies.

284
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:45,666
Give them to me.

285
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:47,916
Alright.

286
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,833
Here you go.

287
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:00,041
I'll print the document for you now.

288
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,500
- Please.
- Sure.

289
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,416
SRIMONGKOL

290
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,791
You're really pulling off
being a monk here.

291
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,500
Go. Just get lost.

292
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,875
Alright, Bro.

293
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,708
Tang, here's the money.

294
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,083
Did you count it?

295
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:25,083
Come on, at this level,
no need to count.

296
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,125
Give me a cig.

297
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:31,333
The gold watch guy asking for a cig.

298
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,416
- Is it even real?
- Oh, fuck off.

299
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,458
You asshole.

300
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,333
It's fake.

301
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:43,291
What? Where's the real one?

302
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:45,166
- I pawned it.
- Oh, shoot!

303
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Give me a cig.

304
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:49,708
I've got none left.

305
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:52,416
Yesterday, Ekachai fucked us up.

306
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:54,708
Hey, Tang.

307
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:57,541
Since fucking Ekachai
took over from the abbot,

308
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,041
We're gonna be screwed.

309
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:03,166
It's so hard to get in and out
of the temple.

310
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,625
That's right.
He made me and Chit plant trees all day.

311
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:10,000
- If you don't believe me, ask Chit.
- Is it true, Chit?

312
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:12,041
Yeah.

313
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:14,833
- I'll crush him some day.
- Hey.

314
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:16,916
Calm down.

315
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:20,083
Just do what he says for now.

316
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,666
He's probably trying to
show off to the abbot.

317
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:27,333
It's better to stay in. Try not to go out.

318
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:30,791
It's nice,
more time to sleep during the day.

319
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:31,875
That's true.

320
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:35,458
Hmm?

321
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,666
What's that sound?

322
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,916
- What?
- What the fuck?

323
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,875
Hey. Let's end it for now.

324
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,791
- Now, what?
- Told you he's on our side.

325
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:08,625
Hey.

326
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:14,333
Who are they?

327
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:17,291
What the hell?

328
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:19,875
I'm so sorry about this.

329
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,250
It won't be like this tomorrow night.

330
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,083
Hey, get the hell out of here!

331
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:44,708
CHANNEL13

332
00:24:44,791 --> 00:24:46,916
Hey, Kai, hit pause now.

333
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,458
Who the hell is that?

334
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:49,875
Is it a thief?

335
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:52,291
That's me.

336
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:54,666
I'm sorry.

337
00:24:58,166 --> 00:24:59,833
It must be Singto and his crew.

338
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:02,750
They like to come in here
with their motorbikes.

339
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:06,083
Do they have so much free time?
They've been coming all week.

340
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:07,500
It's normal for them.

341
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:11,541
I don't know what they're taking now.
They're amped up non-stop.

342
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:13,541
Call the police?

343
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:18,000
Just ask the police
to set up a checkpoint.

344
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,833
Let's not tarnish the temple's name.

345
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:21,958
I agree.

346
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,375
Is it possible that

347
00:25:28,916 --> 00:25:33,166
since our temple has become well-known,
other temples may have issues with us?

348
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,166
That's probably true.

349
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,500
The remaining days
of Mrs. Jamroon's funeral,

350
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:43,166
I propose we host it for them
free of charge as an apology.

351
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:45,250
What do you think?

352
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:49,625
I agree.

353
00:25:51,458 --> 00:25:53,916
- Take care of it, Game.
- I will.

354
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:57,916
This way, Father.

355
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:06,166
Just let it go.

- Thank you.
- Sure.

359
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:34,208
Brother, I was wondering
why you thought that

360
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:37,416
another temple did this.

361
00:26:38,791 --> 00:26:40,708
I talked to the abbot last night.

362
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:46,375
He said one big-named individual has been
sponsoring Mani Thong Temple's events.

363
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,041
but this year,
she switched to our temple.

364
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:51,083
So, that temple might be upset.

365
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:10,791
Brother.

366
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:17,375
This PCM recently began
sponsoring events at our temple.

367
00:27:17,458 --> 00:27:21,041
That's right. PCM. Ae.
She's a local politician's daughter.

368
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:22,791
Folks around here know her.

369
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:28,000
So, is there really nothing
we can do to that temple?

370
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:29,500
No, there isn't.

371
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:32,083
Their abbot is our district abbot.

372
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:35,916
- Will you excuse me?
- Of course.

373
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:41,875
Hey, Note.

374
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:44,708
Come here

375
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:46,875
What's up?

376
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:51,416
Do you know that temple, Mani Thong,
Thong Mani, or something?

377
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,958
Oh, you mean the Sissy's temple?

378
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:55,416
Sissy?

379
00:27:58,458 --> 00:27:59,750
How'd you get these?

380
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:02,541
Temple boys' group chat.
It has everything you need.

381
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,583
Uh… hold on.

382
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:11,875
I need more.

383
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:14,125
Of course, sure thing.

384
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:16,750
- I'll get going, then.
- Um.

385
00:28:17,583 --> 00:28:19,375
- See you at the temple.
- Yeah.

386
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:34,625
Comp 17, you have five minutes left.
Wanna add more time?

387
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:47,500
Hey, Mullet Boy. How much for
buying out the shop for the night?

388
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:50,000
Bro, my shop is very busy.

389
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:52,458
If you take over, I'll lose my customers.

390
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:57,000
And what if…

391
00:28:58,666 --> 00:29:00,041
I give you 20,000 baht?

392
00:29:03,958 --> 00:29:05,250
For real?

393
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:07,416
Does it look fake?

394
00:29:08,666 --> 00:29:09,541
Okay.

395
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,166
Go ahead and use
whichever computer you want.

396
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:18,500
Hey, hey!

397
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,666
Tonight,

398
00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:26,250
I'm buying out the shop
so y'all can play for free.

399
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:31,041
But…

400
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:33,916
you guys gotta do me a favor.

401
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:40,916
There.

402
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,291
SISSY MONK

403
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:45,416
When you comment,

404
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,833
type in a bunch of nines.

405
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:50,416
SADHU

406
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,375
FUCK 999999

407
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:52,375
SADHU
F.U. 99998

408
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,375
- Is this okay?
- Let me see.

409
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:57,333
SISSY MONK FROM FAMOUS TEMPLE
EATS BOYS' DICKS

410
00:29:57,416 --> 00:29:58,458
That's awesome.

411
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:01,916
Don't slack off, yeah?

412
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,791
FUCKKKKK

413
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:06,333
- See this? Fire back with an insult.
- Game on.

414
00:30:06,416 --> 00:30:07,625
Get 'em.

415
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:15,291
Save this and flood the comments with it.

416
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:18,458
This one's cool, bro.

417
00:30:18,541 --> 00:30:20,125
Cool, my ass. Get to work.

418
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:26,916
Keep it up, guys.
You're doing great. Keep at it.

419
00:30:30,708 --> 00:30:34,291
Do you know the game "Pirate's Hell?"

420
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:38,708
What the fuck is that?

421
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:46,625
How about this?

422
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:48,583
DEEP DIVE: FAMOUS TEMPLE'S SISSY MONK…

423
00:30:48,666 --> 00:30:51,708
Hey, that's good. Post this on every page.

424
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:53,375
Every page? Okay.

425
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:54,791
- Get 'em.
- Get 'em.

426
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:57,166
DEEP DIVE: FAMOUS TEMPLE'S SISSY MONK…

427
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:04,291
Please don't look at the camera,
just look in my direction.

428
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,583
- We all set?
- Yeah.

429
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:09,291
Please start.

430
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:14,583
When it comes to Buddhist holy days,
most people associate them with monks.

431
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,708
Cut. Please wait a moment.

432
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:20,083
What the hell?

433
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:23,291
Please start over.

434
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:30,208
When it comes to Buddhist holy days,
most people associate them with monks,

435
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,041
so they often make merit with monks

436
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:34,541
through alms

437
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:36,125
and offerings.

438
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:39,125
But, in fact, Buddhist holy days

439
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:42,291
actually mean days of Dharma,

440
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:45,125
listening to Dharma.

441
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,291
If you get a chance
to make merit with monks,

442
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:52,000
it's also worth finding time
to listen to Dharma.

443
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:59,958
Could you please start over
from the beginning one more time?

444
00:32:06,208 --> 00:32:07,083
TEMPLE BOYS

445
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:08,166
SHIT, A WHOLE ALBUM

446
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:14,416
Always maintain a pure mind,

447
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,583
and you'll see that

448
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:19,708
Buddhist holy days go beyond
full moon and new moon days.

449
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:23,208
But in our minds, every day

450
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:25,666
will become a Buddhist holy day.

451
00:32:26,541 --> 00:32:27,583
Okay.

452
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,791
How did it go?

453
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:36,708
I think it went well. I'll need to check
the footage, but it should be fine.

454
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:44,916
By the way, next time, will it be okay
to include a Q&A part at the end?

455
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,375
Many people have left comments
asking questions.

456
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:52,416
So, maybe you could
answer them in the next EP.

457
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,125
What sort of questions?

458
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:56,791
Something like…

459
00:32:57,958 --> 00:33:00,333
Dharma, everyday life sort of things.

460
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,541
Um.

461
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,958
Do you have any examples?

462
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:06,666
I'll search it for you.

463
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:08,791
Don't trouble yourself.

464
00:33:09,375 --> 00:33:10,666
You can ask your own.

465
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:17,375
After listening to me,
is there anything you want to ask?

466
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:19,625
Oh.

467
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:22,416
Me?

468
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,416
Um…

469
00:33:28,625 --> 00:33:31,000
How about love and Buddhism?

470
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:35,916
Love and Buddhism,
how does it work?

471
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:37,791
I mean, if…

472
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,083
loving causes suffering,

473
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:42,791
does that mean one shouldn't love at all?

474
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:48,833
That's a good question.

475
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:53,416
- I think that…
- Hey, Dear.

476
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:56,666
Do you think he did this?

477
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:59,166

Take it down now.

My goodness.

483
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:21,291
What am I going to do?

484
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:25,541
You're a good-named monk.
This won't leave a mark on you.

485
00:34:27,416 --> 00:34:30,208
What are you all doing?
Hurry up!

486
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Hurry!

487
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:38,458
From July 9 to 15,

488
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:41,666
please join us
for our big annual merit-making event

489
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:45,500
and cast the Buddhist Lent candle
together at Phummaram Temple.

490
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:49,458
Come and see many famous artists.

491
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:55,083
<i>Today is a good day.</i>

492
00:34:55,166 --> 00:35:01,541
It's the start of our first annual event
here at Phummaram Temple.

493
00:35:01,625 --> 00:35:06,375
<i>The temple is going all-in</i>
<i>with a five-day, five-night event.</i>

494
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:08,541
<i>Not only that,</i>

495
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:12,458
<i>we also have one day of the</i>
<i>Buddhist Lent candle procession.</i>

496
00:35:12,541 --> 00:35:14,666
<i>Coming here this time means that</i>

497
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,791
<i>you'll be full of merit,</i>
<i>full in your belly,</i>

498
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:21,041
<i>and most importantly,</i>
<i>full in your heart, folks.</i>

499
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:25,166
<i>Maen, you're coming here drunk again.</i>

500
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:31,208
<i>Please join us, folks. Please come this</i>
<i>way for flowers, incense, and candles.</i>

501
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:39,750
I saved this as the last spot
for you ladies, that is…

502
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:41,208
the donation spot,

503
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:44,500
from redeeming cattle
to the consecration ceremony.

504
00:35:52,791 --> 00:35:57,208
We often get infatuated
and enjoy moments of happiness

505
00:35:57,291 --> 00:35:58,958
without realizing that…

506
00:36:00,166 --> 00:36:02,791
<i>these things don't last.</i>

507
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:05,708
<i>So, when everything changes,</i>

508
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:08,041
<i>we experience suffering.</i>

509
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:12,125
<i>We often overlook the truth that…</i>

510
00:36:12,916 --> 00:36:16,166
<i>if something brings you happiness,</i>
<i>it also brings suffering.</i>

511
00:36:17,166 --> 00:36:21,250
Mrs. Wijit Kesorn, 50,000 baht.

512
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:25,583
Ms. Pranee Suetrongdee, 11,000 baht.

513
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:31,916
- Ms. Chamaiporn Klaiduang, 999,999 baht.
- Wow.

514
00:36:32,833 --> 00:36:35,291
Ms. Chamaiporn Klaiduang,

515
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:40,166
also known as PCM. Ae of Samakphol Sugar,

516

521
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:09,000
- Have you seen Game?
- Uh, no, I haven't.

522
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:12,625
The abbot asked me
to update the temple's bank book.

523
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:14,458
Do you have it?

524
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:16,875
I think Uncle Tang updated it.

525
00:37:19,666 --> 00:37:23,916
Uh, could you please
print a donation form for me?

526
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:26,000
Of course.

527
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:08,000
What did you graduate in?

528
00:38:09,916 --> 00:38:11,000
I didn't.

529
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:15,541
I studied computer engineering,
but didn't graduate.

530
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:21,541
What led you to work at the temple?

531
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,791
I didn't believe in religions.

532
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:35,583
But when I came to know Buddhism,

533
00:38:35,666 --> 00:38:38,125
I felt like there's a lot more
I still don't know.

534
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:42,500
It's like I've found
some answers for myself.

535
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:46,041
But there are still questions
I want to know answers to.

536
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:48,083
and it's something very interesting.

537
00:38:57,166 --> 00:38:58,000
BUDDHIST TEACHINGS

538
00:39:01,291 --> 00:39:02,291
Your pen.

539
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,041
I'm returning it.

540
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:06,166
Thank you.

541
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:13,958
By the way, I've finished editing
the first episode of the podcast.

542
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:15,750
I'll send you the link later.

543
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:18,291
Thank you very much.

544
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:20,500
Uh…

545
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:23,833
The question you asked me.

546
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:26,291
I have an answer to it.

547
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,666
It's true that
love brings happiness,

548
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:46,708
but happiness and suffering
often come together.

549
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,666
If you decide to love,

550
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:52,708
you need to be prepared
for suffering.

551
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,166
So, if you're going to love,

552
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,791
do it without holding on too tightly.

553
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:03,416
Don't expect the person
to be with you forever.

554
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,166
So,

555
00:40:07,791 --> 00:40:09,500
is it like a fan's love?

556
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:12,875
If that sort of love means

557
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,458
not holding on too tightly,
not expecting, then it probably is.

558
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:18,958
Um.

559
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,041
Because no matter what happens
to the person, we won't suffer

560
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:26,375
since we know it's just the way it is.

561
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:29,416
It's impermanent.

562
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
It's temporary.

563
00:40:32,541 --> 00:40:34,916
But if we hold on too tightly or expect,

564
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:36,625
we will suffer.

565
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:40,541
The truth is, nothing

566
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:43,958
can truly belong to anyone.

567
00:40:44,583 --> 00:40:45,833
That is non-self.

568
00:40:46,833 --> 00:40:47,875
Oh.

569
00:40:48,875 --> 00:40:51,791
Honestly, what you said
is really difficult to do.

570
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:58,000
What about you?
Have you ever been in love?

571
00:41:06,666 --> 00:41:08,041
It won't be long

572
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:10,708
until our work here is over.

573
00:41:18,833 --> 00:41:20,541
Please enjoy.

574
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:21,500
Sure.

575
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:39,416
MANI THONG TEMPLE

576
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:46,500
Shit.

577
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,541
Sorry, excuse me.

578
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:50,958
- Here you go.
- Hey, Note.

579
00:41:51,666 --> 00:41:53,500
- Have you seen Tang?
- No.

580
00:41:54,166 --> 00:41:55,833
Give me the microphone.

581
00:41:57,041 --> 00:41:57,875
Here.

582
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:03,875
Announcement, Mr. Chaiyong, please come
to the front of the abbot's residence

583
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:05,041
right this moment.

584
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,958
I repeat, Mr. Chaiyong, come to the front
of the abbot's residence now. Thank you.

585
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:15,416
Go.

586
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:19,541
Namaskar, Master.

587
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:24,041
Why are you so skinny? Let's talk inside.
It's too hot.

588
00:42:32,791 --> 00:42:34,875
Temple boys here are quite good-looking.

589
00:42:38,083 --> 00:42:38,916
Hi.

590
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,541
Want to sit?

591
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:47,208
I'm okay, thank you.

592
00:42:47,958 --> 00:42:49,625
WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU, UNCLE TANG?

593
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:59,458
ABBOT'S RESIDENCE
MONK VEERA ITSAVARO

594
00:42:59,541 --> 00:43:02,375
The elder monks are talking.
You don't need to go in there.

595
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:03,375
Oh.

596
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:05,375
I'm the abbot's assistant.

597
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,583
So am I, and I'm sitting right here.

598
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:11,791
Let's sit here and wait.

599
00:43:33,458 --> 00:43:34,625
- Uncle.
- Oh!

600
00:43:34,708 --> 00:43:36,708
- Where've you been?
- Out running errands.

601
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,208
What errands?

602
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:39,875
Lots of them.

603
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:49,833
- Take care.
- I will. Thank you.

604
00:43:54,625 --> 00:43:56,000
Oh, you folks,

605
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,958
come talk to me inside.

606
00:43:59,041 --> 00:43:59,916
Okay.

607
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:09,416
I want to thank all of you

608
00:44:09,916 --> 00:44:14,541
for helping to improve the temple
to where it is today.

609
00:44:16,625 --> 00:44:21,125
I never thought our temple
would be thriving like this.

610
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:28,166
Uh…

611
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:32,750
Brother, could you please
step outside for a moment?

612
00:44:57,166 --> 00:45:02,333
I'm going to ask all of you to stop
your involvement with the temple

613
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,375
- Huh?
- What?

614
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:08,583
Why is that, Father?

615
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:15,125
Did you see Master Songchai
who has just left?

616
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:17,583
He's the district abbot.

617
00:45:18,166 --> 00:45:19,958
He came to tell me to stop,

618
00:45:20,625 --> 00:45:24,333
and he wants us to stop holding
night events like the one we're doing,

619
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,250
limiting to merit-making events only.

620
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,083
He will send a committee
to inspect our temple.

621
00:45:32,916 --> 00:45:33,750
Hold on.

622
00:45:34,666 --> 00:45:36,083
This is cheating.

623
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:39,875
- Why do you have to comply?
- Game.

624
00:45:40,666 --> 00:45:41,541
He's a monk.

625
00:45:42,625 --> 00:45:44,666
We've put in so much work.

626
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:46,916
Do you want the temple
to go back to how it was?

627
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,583
I'm well aware

628
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:51,541
that you folks are doing this

629
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:53,458
to make a living off my temple.

630
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,291
What's going on here?

631
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,500
Do you want a larger share,

632
00:45:59,583 --> 00:46:01,875
or has Tang not given you enough?

633
00:46:01,958 --> 00:46:02,916
Game!

634
00:46:03,666 --> 00:46:04,541
Tang.

635
00:46:07,166 --> 00:46:10,000
Please understand me.

636
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,416
If I don't do this,

637
00:46:13,541 --> 00:46:16,125
I'll have to go live somewhere else too.

638
00:46:19,125 --> 00:46:20,791
Alright.

639
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:22,666
That's settled then.

640
00:46:23,208 --> 00:46:24,041
Also,

641
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:28,000
return the temple's bank book to me

642
00:46:29,208 --> 00:46:31,708
Tang, call Ekachai in for me.

643
00:46:31,791 --> 00:46:33,125
Yes, Father.

644
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:35,791
Can we finish up with this event
as planned?

645
00:46:36,291 --> 00:46:37,291
- Tang.
- Yes?

646
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:39,541
- Lift me up.
- Okay.

647
00:46:49,125 --> 00:46:51,833
You do realize the temple is where it is
because of us.

648
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:12,416
What the hell, Uncle?

649
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:17,208
Shouldn't you return our money,
since you can't honor the deal?

650
00:47:17,291 --> 00:47:18,708
Just calm down, alright?

651
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:23,833
Let's wait until the event is finished,
then I'll talk to the abbot myself.

652
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:29,083
And tone it down a notch, will you?
Don't come on too strong with Father.

653
00:47:47,375 --> 00:47:50,083
How much cash do we have left now?

654
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:53,958
- Not enough to cover the next payment.
- And the money on Defi?

655
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:55,458
Still won't be enough.

656
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,666
Why does Father Kiw
have to have a problem now?

657
00:48:04,625 --> 00:48:06,583
Although, it might be because of…

658
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:08,833
me.

659
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:16,625
I dropped a bomb on their temple.

660
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:20,666
I knew it, you asshole.

661
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,625
Even if you didn't, they would've come
anyway, if not this temple, then another.

662
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,708
Then…

663
00:48:43,333 --> 00:48:46,250
how about we pay Father Kiw
to quit being a monk?

664
00:48:46,875 --> 00:48:48,291
You're at it again?

665
00:48:49,208 --> 00:48:50,250
He won't do it.

666
00:48:57,416 --> 00:48:59,125
What's the remaining debt?

667
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:09,250
More than 40 million.

668
00:49:11,541 --> 00:49:13,333
Shit.

669
00:49:32,166 --> 00:49:36,166
PHUMMARAM TEMPLE

670
00:49:50,291 --> 00:49:51,625
SADHU
PHUMMARAM TEMPLE

671
00:51:53,125 --> 00:51:56,333
Keep fanning, harder.
Yeah. That's it.

672
00:51:57,916 --> 00:51:59,083
Will I get to eat?

673
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:02,791
Yeah, keep a steady motion.

674
00:52:04,083 --> 00:52:05,083
Kai.

675
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:08,291
Oh, Venerable Brother.

676
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,666
Why eating here this late?

677
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:13,125
If we eat near the monks' residences,
the smell might tempt you guys.

678
00:52:13,708 --> 00:52:17,166
Clean up after you're done
and remember to put out the fire.

679
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,250
Of course.

680
00:52:21,125 --> 00:52:22,416
Let's dig in.

681
00:52:23,916 --> 00:52:25,625
Oh, man. That was close.
