1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Once upon a time, in a small time, there was a summer like eternity.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I couldn't play with my family or friends, no matter how much I played.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The sun kept shining brightly every day.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Before I knew it, those memories were far beyond my memory.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But that day, I remembered the brightness I felt in my eyelids.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I was looking for that brightness and I was flying.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I was almost there. I was almost there.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That summer.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Welcome. I'm listening.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Thank you for your time.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We will soon arrive at Torishiro Island, Torishiro Island Port.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
If you land on the ship, please wait until the ship is hit by a strong impact.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Torishiro Island, huh?

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Please wait as it is.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm a canary who forgot to sing.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What?

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What?

18
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What am I doing?

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Where am I?

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Hello?

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Hello?

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Hello?

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Please wake up!

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Hayari!

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's already 8 o'clock.

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's already 8 o'clock.

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Good morning, Umi.

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Good morning, Umi.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Thank you for the food.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I made it.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I made it.

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Really?

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Is it good?

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's okay today.

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'll help you.

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'll help you.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Take your time.

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Okay?

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Hayari?

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I've been here for a few days.

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I've been here for a few days.

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I came to help with my grandmother's funeral.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I came to help with my grandmother's funeral.

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I haven't done anything yet.

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I haven't done anything yet.

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I've been getting to know the people

75
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I've been getting to know the people

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Not everyone is bad.

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Not everyone is bad.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Only the mostenses are strong.

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Especially her.

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Especially her.

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That's shocking!

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
If I approach her with this

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
If I approach her with this

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It would seem like a very scarelike phrase.

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It would seem like a scarelike phrase.

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I wonder what you're talking about?

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I wonder what you're talking about?

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I wonder what you're talking about?

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,760
That's the one that the old lady in the

90
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,760
temple said, the canary who forgot to sing.

91
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,760
It's a canary singing rock.

92
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,760
It's distorted.

93
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,760
It was farther than I thought.

94
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,760
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,760
Hey!

96
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,760
Canary?

97
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,760
Canary?

98
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,760
What are you doing there?

99
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,760
I'm looking for something.

100
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,760
What are you looking for?

101
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,760
Myself.

102
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,760
And I'm looking for something I want to do.

103
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,760
I think it's dangerous to be in such a place.

104
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,760
Canary?

105
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,760
It's not dangerous.

106
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,760
You might die if you fall.

107
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,760
I won't die.

108
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,760
Are you invincible?

109
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,760
I'm invincible.

110
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,760
I'm jealous.

111
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,760
The bath?

112
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,760
That's right.

113
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,760
The water stopped suddenly.

114
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,760
Then I don't have to go in today.

115
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,760
No.

116
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,760
You can't not go in the bath on a summer night.

117
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,760
It was late, Numi.

118
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,760
It's normal.

119
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,760
No, it's not.

120
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,760
Sorry to keep you waiting.

121
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,760
Nice to meet you.

122
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,760
Nice to meet you.

123
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,760
Well then.

124
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,760
Is it a season-challenge?

125
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,760
What?

126
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,760
It feels good.

127
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,760
I'll get a license when I turn 16.

128
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,760
Huh?

129
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,760
It's night time, but the light isn't on.

130
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,760
Is it that lighthouse?

131
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:19,760
No one is managing it, so it's not used now.

132
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,760
I see.

133
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,760
The next morning

134
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,760
I'm looking for something.

135
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,760
Looking for something?

136
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,760
Oh my.

137
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,760
Here, take this.

138
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,760
Thank you.

139
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,760
Are you looking for something too?

140
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,760
I see.

141
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,760
A mysterious doll that no one has ever seen.

142
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,760
What?

143
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,760
What?

144
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,760
A doll?

145
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,760
By the way, what's your name?

146
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,760
I'm Takahara Hairi.

147
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,760
I see.

148
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,760
Takahara Pairi.

149
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,760
Wait, my name is Hairi?

150
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,760
You're right.

151
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,760
Pairi is Pairi.

152
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,760
Right?

153
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,760
Pairi?

154
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,760
I'm Shizuku Mizuori.

155
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,760
If you like, call me Shizuku or Oppai-san.

156
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,760
Then I'll call you Shizuku.

157
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,760
I see.

158
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,760
Too bad.

159
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,760
Shizuku!

160
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,760
Please let me go!

161
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,760
Are you okay?

162
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,760
Yes, I'm fine.

163
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,760
You're the one from yesterday.

164
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,760
Oh.

165
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,760
Who are you?

166
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,760
Sorry for asking you to help me.

167
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,760
No, I was just bored.

168
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,760
Thank you so much.

169
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,760
Um, Takahara Hairi-san.

170
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,760
Did you forget my name?

171
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,760
Yes, but I remembered.

172
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,760
Takahara-san.

173
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,760
Anyway, we're glad we gathered this much.

174
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,760
We thought it might be fun to play hide-and-seek, so we decided to pick up trash on the beach.

175
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,760
Well, we have to support what our friends want to do.

176
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,760
Friends?

177
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,760
So, how was it?

178
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,760
Was it fun?

179
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,760
It wasn't fun.

180
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,760
Why did we start this?

181
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,760
It's a series of regrets.

182
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,760
That much?

183
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,760
But we have more friends now.

184
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,760
We have to separate the trash for now.

185
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,760
Oh? Which one is this?

186
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,760
Paringlis' empty container.

187
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,760
The body is made of paper, so it's a burning trash.

188
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,760
But the bottom part is made of metal.

189
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,760
So we can't just throw it away.

190
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,760
Yeah, we could recycle it.

191
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,760
Recycle?

192
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,760
Takahara-san, thank you for today.

193
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:21,760
Then I'll show you around the tourist spots on this island, thanks to the person who helped me.

194
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,760
Look, over there.

195
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,760
It's called Oppa-Iwa.

196
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,760
I named it after it.

197
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,760
What a terrible name.

198
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:34,760
Shizuku, I have three rocks, but don't you usually have two Oppa-Iwa?

199
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,760
Tsumugi, who's the one who's in trouble with three rocks?

200
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,760
It's actually a good deal.

201
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,760
This is also a tourist attraction.

202
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,760
I see.

203
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,760
It's a house of a powerhouse.

204
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,760
A powerhouse?

205
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,760
Yes. But it collapsed a long time ago.

206
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,760
No one lives here now.

207
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,760
How is it?

208
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,760
Even if you ask me...

209
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,760
It's wonderful, Shizuku. It's exactly like an Oppa-Iwa.

210
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,760
Well, it's the best compliment.

211
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,760
Well, I'll be going now.

212
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,760
If you follow me, you'll find something you want to do.

213
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,760
The water bath.

214
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,760
If you like it, Shizuku, it's totally okay.

215
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,760
Do you wear that costume?

216
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,760
That's right.

217
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,760
I didn't bring my swimsuit, so I'll just put my feet on it.

218
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,760
Let's go, Takahara-san.

219
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,760
I'm...

220
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,760
...going to quit.

221
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,760
What?

222
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,760
You don't like getting in the water?

223
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,760
Well, that's just how it is.

224
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,760
Well, there's a lot of things.

225
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,760
That's right. There's a lot.

226
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,760
But why don't you try getting in today?

227
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,760
If we get in the water together, we'll be able to build friendship.

228
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,760
We'll be able to swim together and we'll be able to build friendship forever.

229
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,760
Then it'll be fun.

230
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,760
In that case, let me show you my real skills.

231
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,760
One, two...

232
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,760
Wait a minute.

233
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,760
Oh, I see. If it's just my feet...

234
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,760
Tsumugi!

235
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,760
Are you okay?

236
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,760
Oh, you're soaked.

237
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,760
Oh, this is embarrassing.

238
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,760
I got in.

239
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,760
Takahara-san, I got in the water!

240
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,760
I got in the water!

241
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,760
I lost something this summer.

242
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,760
Something I want to do.

243
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,760
That's why I think...

244
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,760
...that I came here to find something I lost.

245
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,760
It's a coincidence.

246
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,760
I've been looking for it all along.

247
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,760
What I want to do.

248
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,760
And the reason I'm here.

249
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,760
The reason you're here?

250
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,760
I've always thought it was difficult.

251
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,760
But if Shizuku and Takahara-san are together, I think I'll find it.

252
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:41,760
Then I don't know if I'll find it, but let's look for it together.

253
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,760
What Tsumugi wants to do.

254
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,760
Thank you very much.

255
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,760
So what do you want me to do?

256
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,760
That's a direct question.

257
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,760
Let's do everything that Tsumugi wants to do.

258
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,760
Is there anything?

259
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,760
Well...

260
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,760
Oh, I got an idea.

261
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,760
That's surprisingly fast.

262
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,760
I want to be with you two forever.

263
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:14,760
We can eat together, watch the stars at night, and talk a lot.

264
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,760
That means we're staying together.

265
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,760
That's right.

266
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,760
Shizuku, you're amazing.

267
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,760
Staying together.

268
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,760
But is it okay to stop me from getting to know you?

269
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,760
I'm fine.

270
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,760
I'm fine too.

271
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,760
I love you, Takahara-san.

272
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,760
What?

273
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,760
You love me?

274
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,760
Yes.

275
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,760
I love you with all my heart.

276
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,760
With all my heart...

277
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,760
Welcome, Takahara-san.

278
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,760
What's that?

279
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,760
Meow.

280
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,760
It's a cat.

281
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,760
It's a cat.

282
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,760
And a cow.

283
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,760
You really live in the Tokyo University, Tsumugi.

284
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,760
And you have cute hair.

285
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,760
Really? I'm a little shy.

286
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,760
Let's make dinner.

287
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,760
Okay.

288
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:16,760
I'm always alone, so I only have one meal.

289
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,760
If I don't eat, everyone will starve.

290
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,760
You're so overreacting.

291
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,760
You don't have to eat for a day.

292
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,760
I don't think so.

293
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,760
I've prepared some snacks.

294
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,760
Pringles.

295
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,760
You're amazing, Takahara-san.

296
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,760
I have a good idea.

297
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,760
Takahara-san.

298
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,760
Yes?

299
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,760
Me too.

300
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,760
I can't help it.

301
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,760
It's delicious.

302
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,760
Pringles are invincible.

303
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,760
I want to eat it too.

304
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,760
There were so many stars.

305
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,760
This is also a good thing about this island.

306
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,760
I think I can catch it.

307
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,760
Today is the end of the month.

308
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,760
I sang that song when I first met you.

309
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,760
When you're happy or when you're having fun, you sing it.

310
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,760
What song is it?

311
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,760
I don't know.

312
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,760
You don't know and you sing it?

313
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,760
Yes, I don't know the title and lyrics.

314
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,760
But it's a song I've loved for a long time.

315
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:56,760
When I sing this song, I feel like I can find myself.

316
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,760
I feel like I can find what I want to do.

317
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,760
Let's find out about that song.

318
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,760
A song?

319
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,760
That's a good idea.

320
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,760
I want everyone on the island to hear the song.

321
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,760
Then we'll know what it is.

322
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:20,760
You're going to prepare a stage for me and everyone on the island?

323
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,760
That's impossible.

324
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,760
I'm glad I was able to be with you two.

325
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,760
I'm so excited.

326
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,760
I don't want to sleep like this.

327
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,760
Did you sing the song you want to do?

328
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,760
I think it's a little different.

329
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,760
But I want to do it again.

330
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,760
Can I call another person?

331
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,760
I'm a good friend.

332
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,760
Of course.

333
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,760
What kind of girl is she?

334
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,760
She doesn't like making friends.

335
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,760
But she's very kind.

336
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,760
Oh, my.

337
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,760
She's asleep.

338
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,760
I said it was a waste to sleep.

339
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,760
Well, it's okay.

340
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,760
There are still a lot of summer holidays.

341
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,760
Are you going home?

342
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,760
I have to go home once.

343
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,760
Otherwise, the people at home will be worried.

344
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,760
But...

345
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
Don't look like that.

346
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,760
Let's take a rest today to play a lot from tomorrow.

347
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,760
That's right.

348
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,760
See you tomorrow.

349
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,760
See you tomorrow.

350
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:52,760
I wonder if this summer will last forever with Tsumugi and Shizuku.

351
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,760
You're finally here.

352
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,760
It's already evening.

353
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,760
Really?

354
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,760
Please take out the laundry.

355
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,760
Oh, my.

356
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,760
Sorry, Tsumugi.

357
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,760
I forgot something.

358
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,760
Tsumugi?

359
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,760
Mugi?

360
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,760
Takahara-san, why?

361
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,760
No, did something happen?

362
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,760
No, it's nothing.

363
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,760
But...

364
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,760
Um, Takahara-san, would you like to stay over tonight?

365
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,760
What?

366
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,760
No, if Shizuku is here, it's not good for just the two of us.

367
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,760
Is it bad?

368
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,760
See, the summer vacation is still long.

369
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,760
Next time.

370
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,760
No.

371
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,760
I don't have much time.

372
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,760
Um, I have to go home right away.

373
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,760
What did you say?

374
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,760
But I'm sure we'll meet again.

375
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,760
I can't call you, text you, or contact you.

376
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,760
I can't.

377
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,760
It's a very far place.

378
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,760
I'm sure we'll never see each other again when we get home.

379
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,760
So, you won't see me again after the summer vacation?

380
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,760
I've been thinking about saying this forever,

381
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,760
but if I do, the two of us might not be able to play together anymore.

382
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:41,760
But before I go home, I want to play with you and Shizuku more.

383
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,760
That's why...

384
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,760
That's why...

385
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,760
I'm sorry.

386
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,760
I can't stay over tonight.

387
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,760
But...

388
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,760
Instead, I'll use the rest of my time for Tsumugi.

389
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,760
What?

390
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,760
I'll give you all my summer vacation for Tsumugi.

391
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,760
Airi-san...

392
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,760
I'm sorry.

393
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,760
I'm sorry.

394
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,760
I'm sorry.

395
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,760
I'm sorry.

396
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,760
I'm sorry.

397
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,760
I'm sorry.

398
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,760
I'm sorry.

399
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,760
I'm sorry.

400
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,760
I'm sorry.

401
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,760
I'm sorry.

402
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,760
I'm sorry.

403
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,760
I'm sorry.

404
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,760
I'm sorry.

405
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,760
I'm sorry.

406
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,760
I'm sorry.

407
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,760
I'm sorry.

408
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,760
I'm sorry.

409
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,760
I'm sorry.

410
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,760
I'm sorry.

411
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,760
I'm sorry.

412
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,760
I'm sorry.

413
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,760
I'm sorry.

414
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,760
I'm sorry.

415
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,760
I'm sorry.

416
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,760
I'm sorry.

417
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,760
I'm sorry.

418
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,760
I'm sorry.

419
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,760
I'm sorry.

420
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,760
I'm sorry.

421
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,760
I'm sorry.

422
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,760
I'm sorry.

423
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,760
I'm sorry.

424
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,760
I'm sorry.

425
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,760
I'm sorry.

426
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,760
I'm sorry.

427
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,760
I'm sorry.

428
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,760
I'm sorry.

429
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,760
I'm sorry.

430
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,760
