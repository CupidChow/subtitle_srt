00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Summer Vacation

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Summer vacation... for Tsumugi?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I decided on my own, but if I can, I want to go with Shizuku...

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
...I guess I can't?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Shizuku...

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
No way...

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Ah, ah!

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Of course, it's up to you!

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'll give you all the remaining summer vacation time for Tsumugi!

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Shizuku, I love you!

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Me too, Tsumugi!

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Thank you, Shizuku!

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I should be the one thanking you!

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Let's enjoy the summer vacation with a wonderful proposal!

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Right, Tsumugi?

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh?

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Tsumugi?

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And so, our real summer vacation began...

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Summer Vacation

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Summer Vacation

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Summer Vacation

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's a paringus!

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And a veranda!

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I can't see the story...

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Paringus...

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I found it in the garbage collection before...

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yes, I couldn't distinguish it, so I couldn't throw it away, but I found it last night!

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm going to make a veranda!

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's a recycle!

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The empty containers of paringus will be reborn into verandas!

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Why verandas?

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Because I want verandas!

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But if you ride on that, you'll break and fall...

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Don't worry! Paringus is invincible!

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But if you're going to make a veranda, you might need a lot more...

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'll bring it right now, so let's have a strategy meeting!

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Please wait a moment!

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
A veranda with paringus...

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That's a crazy idea!

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You're really so smart!

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But I still can't believe it...

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I can't believe I can't see Paringus after the summer is over...

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Anyway, I want to use my time for Paringus now.

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That's what I want to do this summer.

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Do you like Paringus now?

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Huh?

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You're so cute!

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Paringus is also a fan of Takahara-san.

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
W-What are you talking about?

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I just want Paringus to be happy...

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's all I want to say.

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You know, you should say you like that feeling.

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Huh? But...

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That's all of a sudden...

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I knew it...

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Is that so?

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I like Paringus...

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Paringus!

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Airi-san, do you like me?

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Ah...

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Um...

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Are you okay?

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You look a little strange...

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm going to be strange!

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I've never been told that I like a man!

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm embarrassed!

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Paringus!

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
If you get dumped, you can cry as much as you want.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'll just ignore it.

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm okay.

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm still okay.

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Today's lunch is fried sea urchin!

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Huh? Are you listening, Airi-san?

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
No, I'm so depressed.

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm just making Tsumugi feel uncomfortable.

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Do it right!

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Takahara Airi!

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Good morning, Airi-san.

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Huh?

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's a nice day today.

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It seems that Airi-kun didn't come yesterday.

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Welcome!

83
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Huh?

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Hello!

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yo!

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
M-Misori-senpai!

87
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
How are you, Kano-kun?

88
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Hey!

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Senpai, how are you?

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Senpai? Shizukuna?

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Ouch!

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You called me by my first name?

93
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You bastard!

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
What are you doing here?

95
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Hey, Kenzen! Takahara, didn't you know?

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Mizuori-senpai is the president of our school, and the leader of the school.

97
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What? Really?

98
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
No way.

99
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Hey!

100
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Huh? What are you talking about?

101
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Mizuori-senpai wouldn't say such a stupid thing.

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Huh?

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Hmph! You want to see me that much?

104
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I can't help it!

105
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Here!

106
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What a face in front of Mizuori-senpai!

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Don't take it off!

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's a rare combination.

109
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I've never seen Tsumugi with anyone other than Mizuori-senpai.

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I see.

111
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Well, it's rare, but Tsumugi herself is a rare character.

112
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I don't see her much on the island.

113
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Tsumugi is always fluffy, and I can't leave her alone.

114
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And now she's in the same class as you.

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What happened?

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Well, it's nothing.

117
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What's with that atmosphere?

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So, what are we doing today?

119
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Oh, that's right. Actually...

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm glad.

121
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Everyone's helping out with the paringles collection.

122
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yes. And the candy is as delicious as ever.

123
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Here, Risa. It's for you.

124
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Here.

125
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Here, Shizuku.

126
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's delicious.

127
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It is.

128
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Your cheeks are going to fall off.

129
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The summer holidays that Tsumugi gave me

131
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
were so much like this, looking for her summer days.

132
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I collected paringles autumn containers for making verandas.

133
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I looked up who knew about Tsumugi's song.

134
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Thank you, Kano-kun.

135
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yes, thank you for today.

136
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And I did a lot of other things.

137
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The three of us had a great time.

138
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Our own special summer holidays passed.

139
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Hello, Mr. Watermelon Boy.

140
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Oh, Mr. Watermelon Boy.

141
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Hello, Mr. Narse.

142
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Hello.

143
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Here, your usual souvenir.

144
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Thank you.

145
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What is it?

146
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
What?

147
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I didn't know that Tsumugi and Shiroha knew each other.

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I got to know Mr. Watermelon Boy here.

149
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Let's recreate the day we met.

150
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Do you want to catch it?

151
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Huh?

152
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Do you want to catch it?

153
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Um, it's a little bit of a bump.

154
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Is that a fish's name?

155
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
No, it means it's a fish.

156
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Really?

157
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Do you eat it?

158
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I do.

159
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Really?

160
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What do you think is the most delicious thing?

161
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Watermelon bar.

162
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Huh?

163
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Can you catch it?

164
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
No, I can't.

165
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's in a candy shop.

166
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I see.

167
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I like watermelons.

168
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I see.

169
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I see.

170
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm starting to want to eat watermelon bars.

171
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I want to eat watermelons, too.

172
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
We're getting along like this.

173
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'll bring some watermelon bars from time to time.

174
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm grateful for the watermelon bars.

175
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It seems like they're communicating.

176
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It seems so.

177
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yes, we're getting along.

178
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
We're getting along.

179
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Watermelon bars?

180
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I don't have a paringlus.

181
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I see.

182
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But if I have to eat something, I'll bring some empty containers.

183
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Watermelon bars, thank you.

184
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Thank you, Shiroha.

185
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's not for you.

186
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Huh?

187
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Oh, that's true.

188
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm sorry.

189
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm sorry.

190
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I sold out all my paringlus.

191
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
No, not today.

192
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I want some watermelons.

193
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Well...

194
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm Sorakado Aoi.

195
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Sorakado Aoi.

196
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You remember my name, right?

197
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Well...

198
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm a two-legged person.

199
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That's not your name.

200
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Sorakado Aoi.

201
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
She's involved.

202
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I see.

203
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Aoi.

204
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And she remembered.

205
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yeah.

206
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Ehem.

207
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Baily, wait.

208
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
A present?

209
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
For the watermelon?

210
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
No, no.

211
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I've already been rejected.

212
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I haven't been treated like that.

213
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You should be honest with yourself.

214
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Besides, when summer vacation is over, you'll be separated from the watermelon.

215
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Then, at least,

216
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I think it's better to remember this summer.

217
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
But, a present in a place like this...

218
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
There's everything here.

219
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Eh?

220
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Hello, grandma.

221
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yeah.

222
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Huh?

223
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Hailey, Shizuku.

224
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What were you talking about earlier?

225
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Eh?

226
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
N-Nothing.

227
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You're so suspicious.

228
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Well, Tsumugi.

229
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What do you want to do next?

230
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yes.

231
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I want to go to Hailey's house.

232
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
My house?

233
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Aoi said earlier.

234
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
If you want to get along with the girl you care about,

235
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
you should go to the other person's room.

236
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Wait.

237
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Eh?

238
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
But, if you suddenly push me, Kyoko will...

239
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Well, welcome.

240
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Hailey always takes care of me.

241
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Thank you for your care.

242
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm also grateful.

243
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
This is Hailey's room?

244
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm a little nervous.

245
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Even if it's my room,

246
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm just letting you use it this summer.

247
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You know that, don't you?

248
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Thank you.

249
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
No, my friend forced me to do this.

250
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Hailey, can you go outside for a moment?

251
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Oh, there it is.

252
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Here.

253
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's a poem.

254
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Tsumugi, I heard you're looking for an old song.

255
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I thought it might be useful.

256
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Thank you, Kyoko.

257
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It might be in here. Tsumugi's song.

258
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Really?

259
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I can't read it.

260
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's like German.

261
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's a book.

262
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Can you show me?

263
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
This is...

264
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Yes, it's my favorite song.

265
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I finally found it, Tsumugi.

266
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I don't know what I'm singing about.

267
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Then, Tsumugi can make the lyrics.

268
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Me?

269
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It sounds fun. Let's try it.

270
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Yes, but it looks a little difficult.

271
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Anyway, if you say what you like,

272
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
it will be a song that looks like Tsumugi.

273
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What I like?

274
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Oh, it's cute.

275
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Thank you so much.

276
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
No, it's nothing.

277
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Please come again.

278
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Take care.

279
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Thank you.

280
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Good luck, Tsumugi Pendas.

281
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Shizuku Mizuori.

282
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Takahara Aeri.

283
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Tsumugi Pendas.

284
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Shizuku Mizuori.

285
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Takahara Aeri.

286
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Tsumugi Pendas.

287
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Shizuku Mizuori.

288
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Scary.

289
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Scary.

290
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's the sister of the song.

291
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Everyone...

292
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Yes.

293
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I wish Shizuku could come with us.

294
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
That's right.

295
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You have to go home early today.

296
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
The rest is the two of you.

297
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What are they thinking about?

298
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Excuse me.

299
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Would you like to come closer?

300
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I didn't know Tsumugi always saw this scenery.

301
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yes, it's my favorite scenery.

302
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
The next day

303
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Well...

304
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm finally ready.

305
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm ready to do anything.

306
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Ready to do anything?

307
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Well...

308
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I like you too, Aeri.

309
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm sure you like me.

310
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I love you with all my heart.

311
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
That's not as a friend.

312
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It was like that at that time.

313
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
But...

314
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
There was a different meaning.

315
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
When I was told that I would do all the summer vacation,

316
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I fell in love with it when I was told that.

317
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
So I was in front of you all the time,

318
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
so I wouldn't get nervous.

319
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
But it's impossible.

320
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm still nervous.

321
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Tsumugi...

322
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But I'm going home soon,

323
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
so it's meaningless to say I love you.

324
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I cry a lot when I say goodbye.

325
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I don't want to say goodbye.

326
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Why?

327
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Why?

328
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Why do you say that?

329
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I guess it's meaningless to say goodbye.

330
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Tsumugi...

331
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I know I can't see you anymore,

332
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
but I don't think it's meaningless to say goodbye.

333
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
No matter how hard it is,

334
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
loving you doesn't change anything.

335
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Tsumugi reminded me of that.

336
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Me too?

337
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
So I'll tell you the truth.

338
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I love you.

339
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Aeri!

340
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Me too!

341
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I love you, Aeri!

342
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm home, Kyoko!

343
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Welcome home.

344
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You look happy, Aeri.

345
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Do I?

346
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'll help you.

347
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Sorry.

348
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Tsumugi?

349
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
That day,

350
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Tsumugi disappeared from our sight.

351
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I heard the sound of rain in the window.

352
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I heard it in the bed.

353
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Even if I try to rotate the MD I borrowed one day,

354
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I can't remember the name of the song you were whispering.

355
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I can't remember the name of the song.

356
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's strange to see rain on a sunny day.

357
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Even though I was able to sing a short phrase,

358
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I can't remember the melody

359
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
that was mixed with the sound of the rain.

360
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It's a boring everyday.

361
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It repeats.

362
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Summer is coming.

363
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I hide my tears and my true self.

364
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Since when did we forget?

365
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm going to dance from the clear sky.
