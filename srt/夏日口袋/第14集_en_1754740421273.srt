1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm sleepy...

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Aoi-chan...

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hey!

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I've always wanted to be bright

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The end of the notebook that writes down the summer is coming

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:22,000
On the day I finally reach it, I'll just wave my hand with a smile

7
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
There's something that only reaches me when I keep walking

8
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm still searching for the warmth of your warm hands

9
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
No matter how much kindness I hold, I can't reach it

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Even now, no matter how many times, I'll keep looking back at the summer's shadows

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Aoi-chan... It hurts so much...

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Aoi...

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's painful, Aoi-chan...

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Aoi...

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
There were so many things I wanted to say...

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
There were so many apologies...

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But... Thank you...

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
For believing in me...

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
For always... For always...

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Thank you...

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Aoi-chan, you did your best for me

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I could hear your voice all the time

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Aoi-chan was there to connect me

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Thanks to you, I was able to come back

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Thank you... Aoi-chan...

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Takahara... Did you meet Airi-san?

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You know her?

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Aoi-chan has been talking to me all this time

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Thank you for supporting Aoi-chan

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I did something natural...

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But I won't accept you as my girlfriend

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Eh?

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Aoi-chan is my precious sister

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I have to be a good person for her

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
If that's what you want, then it can't be helped

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Ehh...

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But you know, Airi is a very good person

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
She's the type that I like

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I know... So it can't be helped

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm so sleepy now...

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Airi, I'm sorry...

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Can you sleep a little longer?

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah, I understand

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm still...

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Airi...

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
When you wake up, let's talk a lot

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Let's talk a lot

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Good night, Airi

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Good night, Aoi-chan

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Airi...

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Wake me up again...

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The fact that Ai woke up is a big news on the island

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The doctor was surprised that it was a miracle

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But I know that this isn't a miracle

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Ai...

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You really woke up...

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Do you know who I am?

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah...

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Miki-chan, right?

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Ai...

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Do you know who I am?

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah...

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's been a while, Tenzen-chan

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm so sure of it!

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I was the one who was left with the impression

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
To be honest, I just knew that there were two boys

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So I didn't care which one was which one

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
We were childhood friends, right?

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Right?

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
We're Aoi-chan's friends

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
We're not friends!

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Ah, she's really awake

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Shiroha-chan...

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's been a while

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's been a while...

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That's all?

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Because there are a lot of people here...

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Boys should think that they're a frog's egg

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That's terrible!

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Ao is asleep, right?

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yeah, you should wake up early, Ao

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yeah, I want you to wake up early

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,000
After that, we talked about the same things in Ai and Ao's hospital room

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
While waiting for Ao to wake up

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But on that day, Ao didn't wake up

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's rare to see something like this

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's early to open the door

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Excuse me

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Ah, sorry

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Did you expect a lucky escape?

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Ah...

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I wonder why

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You're feeling a little bitter

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's just my imagination

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Anyway, where's Ao?

96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
She's cute today too

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I know that

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But it's not like that

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I see

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's been two days

101
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's rare for Ao to keep sleeping like this

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
At least, it's not like this ever happened to me

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You're the same as me, and you don't know the cause

104
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
But the cause is the situation, right?

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Did you hear from Ao?

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yes, when she was asleep

107
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It seems that sleep is necessary to organize your memories

108
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I think she's not following the order of her memories

109
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's my fault

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Don't say that

111
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You'll deny her effort

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm sorry

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Ao will wake up

114
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
If you say thank you again at that time, she'll be rewarded

115
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Airi-san

116
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Please wake up early

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I promised you that if you find your love, you'll be a good lover

118
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What?

119
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
This is a good place, so be quiet

120
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm sorry

121
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I heard some inappropriate words

122
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Maybe you like me, who is your twin

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Why would that happen?

124
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I don't think so

125
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm not a fool to be with you

126
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
We're both flowers

127
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That kind of joke is...

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Are you serious?

129
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Please take care of Ao for now

130
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'll take care of Ao-chan for now

131
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
If Ao doesn't wake up, things won't start

132
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You're right

133
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
BAN!

134
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Tanuki?

135
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
No, Kitsune

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm Inari, who was always with Ao searching for the Seven-Eye Castle

137
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm Inari

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I heard your name

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I wanted to meet Ao, so I kept it a secret from the teachers

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You're no good either

141
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But Ao-chan is sleeping, and she's talking about sleeping

142
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Really?

143
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I was talking about Airi-san's name

144
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What? Mine?

145
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I guess you met me in your dreams

146
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What do you mean by being embarrassed outside?

147
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's about sleeping

148
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What do you mean by being very happy?

149
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's about sleeping

150
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Say it again!

151
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's about sleeping!

152
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Ao-chan got hurt!

153
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
No, Ao is more...

154
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Sorry

155
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm sorry

156
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Airi-san, if you don't mind, could you tell Ao-chan something?

157
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Tell me what?

158
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's about how you think it's more fun than sleeping

159
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I see

160
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I don't know if it's fun or not, but I used to be a swimmer

161
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And then I entered high school and was immediately accepted as a regular in relay

162
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Isn't that amazing?

163
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
But I was at that summer competition

164
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Thank you for talking to Ao-chan

165
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
No, I got a good opportunity

166
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But I wonder if it was a good thing to talk about

167
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm glad to know about Airi-san

168
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You were so straightforward that you never gave up

169
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You were so strong that you were attracted to me

170
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yes, I'm proud of you, Ao-chan

171
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's delicious

172
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Ao!

173
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'll be with you forever

174
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's about sleeping

175
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Two minutes of love

176
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Let's drink

177
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What?

178
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So let's get through the good parts

179
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I tried it, but I can do it too

180
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Ao!

181
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Oh, another one cut

182
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You don't have to touch it like Ao

183
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Ao!

184
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Hm?

185
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The flowers are almost withered

186
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The mountain festival is almost over

187
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
No, it's not just the festival that's going to end

188
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The summer vacation is almost over

189
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
When the summer vacation is over, I have to go home

190
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'll wake up before that, Ao

191
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yes?

192
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
What?

193
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Ao!

194
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Did you sleep too much?

195
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Ao-chan

196
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Ai, I'm sorry

197
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You woke up, but I was sleeping

198
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
No, I was able to hear you

199
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm fine now

200
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'll call the doctor

201
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Wait

202
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I want to breathe the air outside

203
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Oh, should I open the window?

204
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
No, I want to walk outside

205
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So...

206
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Give me your hand

207
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I remember everything you've done for me

208
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
What's wrong?

209
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
My body doesn't move well, but I'll do my best

210
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'll do the same thing as you

211
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I see

212
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm looking forward to it

213
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's okay to go outside, but just a little

214
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I've been sleeping all the time, so don't overdo it

215
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Please make it come true

216
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
While Ao-chan is awake

217
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
What? What are you talking about?

218
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Why are you here?

219
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Ao, that's...

220
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I've touched a lot of memories

221
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I've been thinking about it

222
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I can hear people's voices

223
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's hard to keep myself

224
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Ao, that's...

225
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
While I'm awake

226
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I have to return these to you

227
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I can only ask you

228
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
No, I can't do anything about it

229
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Mr. Hayri

230
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Please

231
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Please make it come true

232
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I just have to go to the lost place

233
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I think I'll take a detour

234
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
A detour?

235
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm sorry

236
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm sorry

237
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm sorry

238
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'm sorry

239
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm sorry

240
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm sorry

241
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm sorry

242
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm sorry

243
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm sorry

244
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm sorry

245
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm sorry

246
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm sorry

247
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm sorry

248
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm sorry

249
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm sorry

250
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm sorry

251
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm sorry

252
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm sorry

253
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm sorry

254
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm sorry

255
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm sorry

256
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm sorry

257
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm sorry

258
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm sorry

259
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm sorry

260
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm sorry

261
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm sorry

262
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm sorry

263
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm sorry

264
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm sorry

265
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm sorry

266
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm sorry

267
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm sorry

268
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm sorry

269
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm sorry

270
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm sorry

271
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm sorry

272
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Isn't that...

273
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Are you okay?

274
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I don't know

275
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I don't know

276
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I don't know

277
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I don't know

278
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm fine

279
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm fine

280
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
But I think we should hurry

281
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I don't know

282
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Yeah

283
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Aoi, it's Inari.

284
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Huh?

285
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Poon!

286
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Inari...

287
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Poon! Poon!

288
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I've made you worry too.

289
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Poon! Poon!

290
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Thank you for helping me a lot.

291
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Poon!

292
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Inari, can you ask her to stand up?

293
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Poon!

294
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Inari's House

295
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I wonder if it's around here.

296
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's the first time I've seen you play a role.

297
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I told you not to go into the mountain at night.

298
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You...

299
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You didn't protect me at all.

300
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But I had a lot of fun this summer.

301
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You were with me every day,

302
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
doing stupid things,

303
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
and doing reckless things.

304
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You were with me all the time while I was asleep.

305
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Thank you.

306
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I have to go home after the summer vacation.

307
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Yeah.

308
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But I'll come here on weekends.

309
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Huh?

310
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'll spend the fall, winter, and spring with you on this island.

311
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And we'll be together all summer.

312
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
That makes me so happy.

313
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
But I...

314
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Even if you keep sleeping,

315
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'll come to this island.

316
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Inari...

317
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'll wake you up.

318
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You were nice at first.

319
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'll be nice to you forever.

320
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
That might be a little too much.

321
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
We're here, Ao.

322
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
We're lost.

323
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Ao?

324
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Yeah!

325
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So fast?

326
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yeah!

327
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Hey!

328
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
What are you...

329
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
This is...

330
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Could it be that the memories I can't get rid of when I'm asleep are overflowing?

331
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
If the City Mayor keeps going like this,

332
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Ao will wake up...

333
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Boon!

334
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Inari!

335
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Ao!

336
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Wake up!

337
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Your memories are still in your head, right?

338
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Ao!

339
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Boon!

340
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Boon!

341
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Could it be...

342
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That's...

343
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You're kidding!

344
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Wait for me, Ao!

345
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Ao!

346
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You suddenly attacked a cat?

347
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Or are you worried about me?

348
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You're weird.

349
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Oh, come on!

350
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You saw me change and you're going to hit me with a shaved ice?

351
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It was a little fun, but...

352
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You're a kid who's been so hard on your kid.

353
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
But you really wanted to lose, right?

354
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
For now, you're not a bad guy.

355
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You said it was beautiful, but I was like,

356
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Can I touch it?

357
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You're kidding!

358
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I was so excited!

359
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I heard you were bold!

360
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
What should I do?

361
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
If you say you're in love,

362
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I don't know how I feel yet.

363
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm hugging you!

364
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's warm and warm!

365
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I'm so excited!

366
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm glad!

367
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm so glad you're safe!

368
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You're so mean!

369
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
If you say that, I can't say no!

370
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm so happy right now.

371
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm so happy.

372
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm happy.

373
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm so happy because you're by my side.

374
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I love you.

375
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I kissed you.

376
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I want to be with you forever.

377
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Even if summer ends,

378
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I want to be with you forever.

379
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Airi.

380
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Airi.

381
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm sorry.

382
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I love you forever.

383
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Aon, is that your memory?

384
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You care so much about me.

385
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It's not like I'm saying goodbye.

386
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Don't apologize.

387
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You're just going to sleep.

388
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Let's go home, Aon.

389
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Aon.

390
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Wait a year.

391
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
The flowers of the lost flowers will bloom again.

392
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Then, at the end of the mountain,

393
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'll find you.

394
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
What?

395
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You were going to do the same thing, weren't you?

396
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'll do the same thing as you.

397
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'll just return what I did.

398
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Then, you have to do your best in rehab.

399
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Airi, I have a favor to ask you.

400
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I want you to come see me again.

401
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I want you to fill the blanks with what you saw, heard, experienced,

402
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
and the time Aon sleeps.

403
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I want to return the time Aon gave me.

404
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
But I can't walk freely yet.

405
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's okay.

406
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I told Aon.

407
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'll go home after the summer vacation,

408
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
but I'll work part-time and save money.

409
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'll come here on weekends.

410
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'll spend the fall, winter, and spring with Aon on this island.

411
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'll be with him all summer long.

412
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Airi.

413
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Besides, I've been making promises for a long time.

414
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's my duty to wake up Aon who's asleep.

415
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's okay.

416
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm sure you'll find him.

417
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm...

418
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm still okay.

419
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
The sound of rain knocks on the window.

420
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I heard it in my bed.

421
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Even if I try to rotate the MD I borrowed one day.

422
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:40,000
The day you said the name of the song I can't remember.

423
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
The day the sun rises.

424
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's strange to see the rain.

425
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Short phrases.

426
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Let's get started.

427
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
The night stands in the way.

428
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
A melody I can't remember.

429
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I could hear voices all the time.

430
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It's a very reassuring voice.

431
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
A voice I love.

432
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
A voice that makes me smile.

433
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
A gentle radiance shakes my heart.

434
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm a little suffocated.

435
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
The warmth of my body is flowing.

436
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I know what to say first.

437
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Words I've been saying.

438
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Words I've always wanted to say.

439
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Good morning.
