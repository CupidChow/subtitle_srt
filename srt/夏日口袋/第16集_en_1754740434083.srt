1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's eat!

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Delicious!

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Here's your change!

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'll boil it now, so wait for me.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
There's something that only reaches you.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm still looking for the warmth of your warm hands.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
No matter how many kindnesses I connect, I can't reach you.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Even now, I'm still in the middle of the summer.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'll repeat it.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Chapter 2

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You're sleeping well.

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I ate a lot.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You two are brothers?

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
No, we're not.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You two look alike.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We're relatives.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I was surprised.

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You're brother's girlfriend?

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
We're not.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You came to visit me from the White-Haired.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I just came to thank you for sending me yesterday.

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I didn't expect you to make lunch.

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I wanted you to eat white-haired food, too.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It was fun.

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's been a long time since I've been so lively.

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm going home.

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I knew something bad would happen if you were with me.

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
White-haired people are like a special kind of shrine maiden to this island.

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I have to get everyone around me closer.

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Goodbye.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Wait.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You know what?

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Let's play tomorrow.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Ougi!

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Bukesho Hattou!

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I can't stand my intense play anymore.

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What's wrong with him?

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What's wrong with him?

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Playing table tennis isn't the only thing.

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Right, White-haired?

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm going to go.

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Wait!

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You came all the way here.

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
No problem.

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I've already asked Tokuda to find a new table tennis table.

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Tokuda?

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
He's the owner of a sports goods store on the island.

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But there's one problem.

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What's the problem?

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
We don't have money!

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So we have to make money quickly.

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Hey, what's the bill?

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Grandma's braised pork.

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's a 200-year-old braised pork and it's really delicious.

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
A real-life bill?

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The drinking water bill is a homemade bill.

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's a good price for a maniac.

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You can't sell something like this to someone else.

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You're selling that to us?

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Um...

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We're selling yakisoba at the port.

91
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I was wondering if we could try it too.

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That's great.

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
If you make it, you'll definitely sell it.

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It looks fun.

95
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's like a festival.

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And unlike a festival, there are few people who can compete.

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
We can borrow the shop from the shopkeeper.

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The ingredients are all over the island.

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But...

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The food is completely white-haired.

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Are you okay?

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'll do my best.

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Buy a bunch of cheeses.

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Pour into a bag of sauce

105
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
This is the new chicken soup?

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yes, it's the new chicken soup.

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's a new dish that you can't eat on the island.

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Here's your best dish.

109
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Thank you for waiting.

110
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Thank you.

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Thank you very much.

112
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Welcome.

113
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Three of them please.

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It will be 1500 yen.

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I don't think we have enough rice.

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I know.

117
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
What's going on?

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Nothing.

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'll give you the money.

120
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But I don't need money.

121
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm just here to help Naruse Shiroha.

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Good for you.

123
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Do you like Shiroha?

124
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What?

125
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
No.

126
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I can only come to this island because of the Naruse family.

127
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So I don't take money from Naruse.

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
That's what happened.

129
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm here.

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Welcome to our secret base.

131
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
By the way,

132
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I think it's better for Shiroha to take the money from Naruse.

133
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Good idea.

134
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Well, the money and the table tennis table are what Shiroha got.

135
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I don't need it.

136
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I don't need to use it.

137
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I agree.

138
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I don't think we can go to this island.

139
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Then let's go to the main road.

140
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
If we go to the main road,

141
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
we might find something we want.

142
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I can't go alone to the main road.

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Then you can go with Takahara.

144
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What?

145
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's a date.

146
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'll forgive you.

147
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The next day

148
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Tomorrow?

149
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Do you have time?

150
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yes.

151
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Then tomorrow I'll treat you to a meal.

152
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
A meal?

153
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'll treat you to a meal.

154
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Then let's meet at the cafeteria.

155
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's the harbor.

156
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The harbor?

157
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Goodbye.

158
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm looking forward to your kind cooperation.

159
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The last part of the conversation was getting worse.

160
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

161
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Hiyo.

162
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Hi.

163
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Sorry.

164
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's okay.

165
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's a thank you.

166
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You invited me.

167
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You invited me today, didn't you?

168
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's more general.

169
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's the same.

170
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
That's...

171
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm sorry.

172
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's okay.

173
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Well, let's go.

174
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yeah.

175
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Thank you.

176
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So, what are you going to treat me to today?

177
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Oh, yeah.

178
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm curious about the magazine.

179
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You've been looking into a lot of things.

180
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
They say the lunch here is delicious.

181
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Oh, this?

182
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's a limited edition model.

183
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I got it when I won the tournament.

184
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Tournament?

185
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Well...

186
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But you don't wear it on the island, do you?

187
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I don't really care about the time on the island.

188
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I only wear it when I have a match.

189
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Match?

190
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
No, no.

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That's not what I meant by a match.

192
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yes.

193
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I know.

194
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I should have checked it out.

195
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I told you, it's okay.

196
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
This is really good, too.

197
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

198
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What's wrong?

199
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Oh, no.

200
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I got on that train and changed to the fifth station.

201
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I went to the third station for about 30 minutes.

202
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What kind of place is it?

203
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's normal.

204
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's a quiet and quiet town.

205
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
But it's not that bad.

206
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
There are quite a few interesting places.

207
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I see.

208
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'll show you around if I have time.

209
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I see.

210
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That might be a little difficult.

211
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I see.

212
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm a boy.

213
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
If I see you with a girl, I'll tease you.

214
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm a boy.

215
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
If I see you with a girl, I'll tease you.

216
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
If I see you with a girl, I'll tease you.

217
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
If I see you with a girl, I'll tease you.

218
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
If I see you with a girl, I'll tease you.

219
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
If I see you with a girl, I'll tease you.

220
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
If I see you with a girl, I'll tease you.

221
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
If I see you with a girl, I'll tease you.

222
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
The End

223
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's about time to go home.

224
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Where?

225
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Where?

226
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
To the island.

227
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I haven't found it yet.

228
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
How to spend your summer vacation.

229
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I see.

230
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
The End

231
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Hailey.

232
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Thank you for today.

233
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Summer bird ritual.

234
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The ritual of the traditional bird-hunting tradition

235
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
that the shrine maiden sends to the sea

236
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
by raising the souls of her ancestors into the lantern.

237
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Shiroha, you're going to this festival, too?

238
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Go home.

239
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm going to the island right now.

240
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What's wrong?

241
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's not sudden.

242
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I've been saying this all the time.

243
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But as I said earlier,

244
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I haven't found the way to spend my summer vacation yet.

245
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I haven't found such a thing.

246
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Thank you for today.

247
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Goodbye.

248
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Shiroha!

249
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Welcome back.

250
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
What's wrong?

251
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Did you fight with your sister?

252
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm glad I didn't.

253
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Welcome back.

254
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I've got a letter for you.

255
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Are you going home?

256
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm not going home.

257
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm going out for a while.

258
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Hailey, you look different from when you came.

259
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Maybe it's because I'm sun-dried.

260
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You're really...

261
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You're good at running away from me.

262
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Well, I'm not saying I ran away from this island.

263
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You ran away?

264
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's nothing.

265
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It was an ordinary water field.

266
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But my classmates have talent.

267
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
My seniors were very supportive.

268
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I got an ace.

269
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I can aim for the championship.

270
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
But I couldn't even reach the goal.

271
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
No one was able to attack me.

272
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I was so grateful that I wanted to cry.

273
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
This time, I thought I'd do my best.

274
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It was no good.

275
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm sorry.

276
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,000
In the end, there was no place for me to go to school, home, or town.

277
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I ran away from this island.

278
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But I'm still a good guy.

279
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You made me do so many things.

280
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You'll find a place to go home.

281
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Yeah, if that's the case...

282
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm not going home.

283
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
How to spend summer vacation.

284
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I think I can find you with Shiroha.

285
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Hailey...

286
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
No.

287
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I can't be with you.

288
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Shiroha...

289
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
He said he liked me.

290
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Once upon a time, there was a boy on the island.

291
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I didn't know him well.

292
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I refused.

293
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
But he came over and over again.

294
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I was in trouble.

295
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
One day, I saw him.

296
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It wasn't a dream.

297
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I can only say that I really saw him.

298
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
He fell from the cliff and drowned.

299
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Shiroha cursed him and killed him.

300
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It was so real.

301
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I thought he was really going to get angry.

302
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I was scared and chased after him.

303
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And...

304
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
That's what happened.

305
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I have a mysterious power.

306
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Since I was little, I've been seeing the future.

307
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's a future that's not decided.

308
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Future?

309
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Or maybe I'm deciding the future.

310
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I was in trouble that time, too.

311
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I thought I should go somewhere.

312
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Wait, calm down.

313
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And then I saw it again.

314
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'm going to die this summer.

315
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
What?

316
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I saw it.

317
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
The dark sky.

318
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
A lot of red light.

319
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
The sea that comes.

320
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm dragged into it.

321
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
The Summer Bird's Gifts.

322
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Summer Bird's Gifts?

323
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
A port poster?

324
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Yeah.

325
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'll be a shrine maiden there.

326
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Is a shrine maiden such a dangerous job?

327
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Of course, I can't go into the sea at night.

328
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But I saw it.

329
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Someone other than me and I were there.

330
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Me?

331
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So I was away from it all the time.

332
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I was trying to get out of the island.

333
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I didn't have a proof.

334
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
But in the evening, I saw the future more vividly than before.

335
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
That person was wearing a watch.

336
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I don't mind dying.

337
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
What are you talking about?

338
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
But I don't want to involve anyone.

339
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I don't want to involve anyone.

340
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
But why do you come close?

341
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Shiroha...

342
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I believe you.

343
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I don't understand.

344
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
But I'm not saying it lightly.

345
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I can believe you because you're Shiroha.

346
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Thank you.

347
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
So let's do our best together.

348
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
If the future you see is really waiting for you,

349
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
let's do what we can to avoid it together.

350
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
There's nothing I can do.

351
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Because I couldn't save her.

352
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But she didn't die.

353
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Maybe she was avoided because Shiroha was careful.

354
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
But...

355
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Do you really think you don't care about dying?

356
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I don't care.

357
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
That's why you tried to swim.

358
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That's...

359
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Let me help you.

360
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Let's do what we can.

361
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Airi...

362
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Thank you.

363
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Airi...

364
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I know that Shiroha is isolated by a stupid rumor.

365
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's a small island.

366
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Rumors will remain forever.

367
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
But if Shiroha contributes for the sake of the island,

368
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
no one will care about such rumors.

369
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
So you want to let Shiroha do Miko for the sake of Natsudori?

370
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I can't do that for a stupid reason.

371
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
But...

372
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
That's all.

373
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Then...

374
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
If you can't stop Miko,

375
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
let me be with Shiroha during the festival.

376
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'll protect Shiroha.

377
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Airi...

378
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Why do you want to protect Shiroha?

379
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Because we're friends.

380
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And maybe...

381
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
No, it's nothing.

382
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Then show me your resolve.

383
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm sorry.

384
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I'm sorry.

385
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm sorry.

386
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm sorry.

387
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm sorry.

388
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm sorry.

389
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm sorry.

390
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I'm sorry.

391
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm sorry.

392
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm sorry.

393
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm sorry.

394
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm sorry.

395
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I'm sorry.

396
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I'm sorry.

397
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I'm sorry.

398
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I'm sorry.

399
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I'm sorry.

400
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I'm sorry.

401
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm sorry.

402
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'm sorry.

403
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm sorry.

404
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm sorry.

405
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'm sorry.

406
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I'm sorry.

407
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I'm sorry.

408
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'm sorry.

409
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm sorry.

410
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I'm sorry.

411
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm sorry.
