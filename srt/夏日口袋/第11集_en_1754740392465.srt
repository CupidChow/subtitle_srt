1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,440
It was that in the

2
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,480
end, I played people play play

3
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,760
de

4
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,760
Please be kind at first!

5
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,760
Please be kind at first!

6
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,760
Please be kind at first!

7
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,760
I will be waiting for you

8
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,760
I suddenly woke up.

9
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,760
It's a grassland that I can only see.

10
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,760
My shadow and another shadow-hat are

11
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,760
standing next to my shadow and swaying.

12
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,760
That's right, I came to play.

13
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,760
My shadow and shadow-hat are

14
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,760
holding hands.

15
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,760
We walk towards the wide grassland.

16
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,760
Once again...

17
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,760
I'm sorry.

18
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,760
Hello?

19
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,760
Wake up!

20
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,760
Hey!

21
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,760
Hello?

22
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,760
I finally woke up.

23
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,760
Hayari-san, wake up by yourself.

24
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,760
Good morning, Umi-chan.

25
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,760
Hurry up, the food will get cold.

26
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,760
Is that how you talk?

27
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,760
I just met you yesterday, what am I saying?

28
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,760
It's been three days since I came to this island.

29
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,760
I really don't have anything to do.

30
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,760
I'll eat it.

31
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,760
It's not good.

32
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,760
There's a face that I haven't seen.

33
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,760
That means that's the famous

34
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,760
lost host, Shocking Takane.

35
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,760
What?

36
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,760
I heard that you were the real one.

37
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,760
Who?

38
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,760
Kido Grandma!

39
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,760
Who's the lost host?

40
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,760
Furi's...

41
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,760
Takahara Hayari-kun.

42
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,760
What?

43
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,760
Takahara Hayari-kun who has been on the island

44
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,760
since yesterday.

45
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,760
Please come to the scene.

46
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,760
Me?

47
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,760
You're being called, Shocking Takan.

48
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,760
What did you say, Shocking Takan?

49
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,760
You should go, Shocking Takan.

50
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,760
Please don't say that nickname.

51
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,760
Is the welcoming party for me?

52
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,760
The tourists who have been on this island

53
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,760
are called the lost host.

54
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,760
It's a form of greeting.

55
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,760
Don't be shy.

56
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,760
Torishiro Island is warm to the guests.

57
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,760
You should hurry up and put on your clothes.

58
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,760
Hey, can I and the other one

59
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,760
join the welcoming party?

60
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,760
I don't mind.

61
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,760
The people on the island are like family.

62
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,760
What?

63
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,760
Why should I go?

64
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,760
You're the only one who can go.

65
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,760
Let's not talk about that.

66
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,760
Let's have a deep conversation with the people on the island.

67
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,760
Welcome to Torishiro Island.

68
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,760
Welcome to Torishiro Island.

69
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,760
Let's welcome them.

70
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,760
Nice to meet you.

71
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,760
Let's meet at the sky.

72
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,760
Wait, you!

73
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,760
Huh?

74
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,760
Are you sleeping?

75
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,760
I almost fell asleep.

76
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,760
Good for you.

77
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,760
No, I'm not.

78
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,760
But you came to me.

79
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,760
Good for you.

80
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,760
I think I was too harsh.

81
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,760
Be nice until the end.

82
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,760
Good for you.

83
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,760
I'm sorry.

84
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,760
You're in the right mood.

85
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,760
Umu, you're like a double-edged swordman

86
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,760
who's been with you for years.

87
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,760
Who is this?

88
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,760
My relative.

89
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,760
I'm taking care of her in the same house.

90
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,760
I'm going to the beach.

91
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,760
This is for you.

92
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,760
A small one?

93
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,760
You're polite, so I'm looking forward to your future.

94
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,760
What's wrong?

95
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,760
Nothing.

96
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,760
The End

97
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,760
I'm so full.

98
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,760
Here's some water.

99
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,760
Thank you, Sorakado.

100
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,760
You can drink it.

101
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,760
They're lively and fun.

102
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,760
They've been together since they were little.

103
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,760
They're the boy band of the island.

104
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,760
It's not like that in my hometown.

105
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,760
I admire them.

106
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,760
It's fine to be a boy band when you're on the island.

107
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,760
You're qualified to be the relative of Kato's grandmother.

108
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,760
I see.

109
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,760
That's good too.

110
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,760
Where's Shiroha?

111
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,760
Why do you know about Shiroha?

112
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,760
Well, I know a lot about him.

113
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,760
I did ask him out, but...

114
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,760
I'll go if I can.

115
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,760
He's not going to come, is he?

116
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,760
He's shy.

117
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,760
Don't give him any weird looks.

118
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,760
Look over here.

119
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,760
You don't have to send me.

120
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,760
What are you talking about?

121
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,760
What are you going to do if you get lost?

122
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,760
I'll take care of him.

123
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,760
You feel sorry for him, don't you?

124
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,760
Well, yeah.

125
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,760
I'll send you to him when he's home.

126
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,760
That's fine.

127
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
I grew up on this island.

128
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,760
I won't get lost.

129
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,760
No, you can't go on a night trip alone.

130
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,760
Thank you.

131
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,760
But there's no place as safe as this island.

132
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,760
Is that so?

133
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,760
That's right.

134
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,760
The End

135
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,760
It's sweet.

136
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,760
I'm sure Shiro and Sato are mistaken.

137
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
But this is Umi's new work,

138
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,760
and it might be a new possibility for fried rice.

139
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,760
It's not!

140
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,760
Get me some soy sauce, Dad.

141
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,760
What?

142
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,760
I made a weird call.

143
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,760
It's okay.

144
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,760
You can call me Mom.

145
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,760
That's right.

146
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,760
That's right!

147
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,760
It's still okay.

148
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,760
There's no place to live in Kyoto today.

149
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,760
That's 100 yen.

150
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,760
Strawberry, melon, lemon, blue Hawaii.

151
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,760
They all taste the same.

152
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,760
Really?

153
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,760
You can eat it in your seat.

154
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,760
It's cool because there's a fan.

155
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,760
Then I'll be polite.

156
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,760
I'm a boy,

157
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,760
so I don't have any immunity to high-priced women.

158
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,760
I think this is also a part of something.

159
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,760
Can you help me to get rid of it?

160
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,760
What do you mean?

161
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,760
You're going to take it off?

162
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,760
You're going to pose like you can't see it,

163
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,760
and get rid of your superpowers?

164
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,760
You're going to wet your clothes,

165
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,760
lick the ice cream,

166
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,760
and cover yourself with a fallen cover?

167
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,760
I'm not not interested in boys.

168
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,760
That's a problem.

169
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,760
It doesn't look like a full plate.

170
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,760
By the way,

171
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,760
can you give me some shaved ice?

172
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,760
I ate too much and I'm thirsty.

173
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,760
What?

174
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,760
Where are you going?

175
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,760
You can't do that.

176
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,760
It's scary.

177
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,760
I'm scared.

178
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,760
I ended up eating shaved ice.

179
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,760
But it was fun.

180
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,760
I think I did something stupid without thinking about it.

181
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,760
What's this?

182
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,760
The smell of love.

183
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,760
This shaved ice is delicious.

184
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,760
Are you free?

185
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,760
Kyoko-san won't let me help with the cleaning of the house.

186
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,760
Besides, there's nowhere else to go.

187
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,760
Teacher!

188
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,760
Please help me!

189
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,760
Are you making children call you a teacher?

190
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,760
I'm pretty good at it.

191
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,760
You're being called that while you're teaching me a lot of things.

192
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,760
What's wrong with you?

193
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,760
You look so pitiful.

194
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,760
It's okay.

195
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,760
Humans can be kind of graceful sometimes.

196
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,760
Shocking Taka!

197
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,760
Are you going to give up already?

198
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,760
Shocking Taka, there's a way out for you.

199
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,760
Good luck, Shocking Taka.

200
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,760
How much does that skin spread?

201
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,760
It's okay.

202
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,760
Humans want to be different sometimes.

203
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,760
That's not true!

204
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,760
Shocking Taka, let's have a competition!

205
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,760
Please stop being so cheeky.

206
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,760
Then you'll win against us.

207
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,760
It's also the duty of the selection to teach the world how strict the world is through a competition.

208
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,760
Then I'll have a fair competition.

209
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,760
Don't write a bad word, kids!

210
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,760
Shocking!

211
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,760
See you later, teacher!

212
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,760
Hurry up and get used to it, Shocking Taka!

213
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,760
Be careful on your way home!

214
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,760
Okay!

215
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,760
That was so much fun!

216
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,760
What's wrong?

217
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,760
You're a good guy.

218
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,760
You bring weird things to lose.

219
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,760
You're a little cool about that.

220
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,760
Of course.

221
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,760
You were pretty serious, weren't you?

222
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,760
Damn it!

223
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,760
Welcome.

224
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,760
Welcome.

225
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,760
Oh, you're in.

226
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,760
200,000 yen, right?

227
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,760
Here.

228
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,760
That's not enough.

229
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,760
Keep it for me.

230
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,760
Did you all do something together?

231
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,760
Yes.

232
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,760
We were talking about the festival of the island that's about to be held.

233
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,760
There's a festival?

234
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,760
There's a sea festival and a mountain festival on this island.

235
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,760
Visitors will also come to the sea festival.

236
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,760
If you're here during the summer vacation, you should see it.

237
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,760
What about the mountain festival?

238
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,760
It's more like a festival than a festival.

239
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,760
Anyway, have you ever been to Starbucks?

240
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,760
Yeah, a few times.

241
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,760
I'm doing something called Mango Mix Frappuccino right now.

242
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,760
What are you talking about?

243
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,760
You're working at a store!

244
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,760
I was a little confused.

245
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,760
Is blue erotic?

246
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,760
Yeah, it's erotic.

247
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,760
It's erotic!

248
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,760
It's just a little.

249
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,760
It's a little!

250
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,760
Damn it! Why can't I win?

251
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,760
Is this how strong you are?

252
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,760
It looks like the game is over.

253
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,760
Let's go home.

254
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,760
I'm going to the island soon.

255
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,760
It seems that you've been staying here lately.

256
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,760
Yeah, it's comfortable.

257
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,760
I see.

258
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,760
Then I asked you to do it.

259
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,760
What do you mean by asking?

260
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,760
Bad job.

261
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,760
I'm going home.

262
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,760
You look sleepy, but are you okay?

263
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,760
I'm going to sleep.

264
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,760
I'm fine.

265
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,760
See you.

266
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,760
Is this what you mean by asking?

267
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,760
Aoi, are you awake?

268
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,760
All Hawaii.

269
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,760
What do you mean?

270
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,760
Watch out!

271
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,760
You're so mean!

272
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,760
It's beautiful.

273
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,760
What?

274
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,760
It's beautiful.

275
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,760
Can I touch it?

276
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,760
It's my first time, so if you're kind to me...

277
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,760
Then, I'll do it without hesitation.

278
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,760
It's beautiful, this glass ball.

279
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,760
It's not a glass ball, it's a rice ball.

280
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,760
That's it!

281
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,760
Don't touch it!

282
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,760
I said I could touch it.

283
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,760
Shut up!

284
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,760
Anyway, don't touch it!

285
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,760
I understand.

286
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,760
I'll send it to you, so let's go home.

287
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,760
You really look sleepy.

288
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,760
Are you sleeping?

289
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,760
I started working.

290
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,760
You started working?

291
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,760
Can I ask you something?

292
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,760
It's not like I'm hiding it, but the mountain we talked about in the daytime,

293
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,760
that's our house.

294
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,760
Does that mean that the Sorakado family is like a family of the Miko who protects the island?

295
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,760
What are you doing?

296
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:43,760
I don't know what you're expecting, but I don't have any strange powers or such a manga.

297
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,760
I'm just walking on the mountain at night with a lantern.

298
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,760
I'm disappointed.

299
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,760
I'm really disappointed.

300
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,760
Don't expect it and despair!

301
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,760
But do you do that job as a family?

302
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,760
I'm alone.

303
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,760
During the festival, people on the island other than the job shouldn't enter the mountain.

304
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,760
Isn't it dangerous?

305
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,760
Even if you're alone, no one will notice.

306
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,760
It's okay.

307
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:17,760
I said it before, but there's no place as safe as this island.

308
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,760
Well, if you say it's okay, it's okay.

309
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,760
Hayri...

310
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,760
Did you fall in love with me?

311
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,760
No, not at all.

312
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
You can say you fell in love with me even if it's a lie!

313
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,760
Then I fell in love.

314
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,760
Really?

315
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,760
No, it's okay to lie, so just say it.

316
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,760
You're definitely making fun of me!

317
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,760
Please come in.

318
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,760
Welcome.

319
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,760
Hello.

320
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,760
Is Aou off from work?

321
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,760
No, she's with Ai today.

322
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,760
She probably has a check-up.

323
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,760
Ai...

324
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,760
Aou isn't coming.

325
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,760
There!

326
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,760
She missed it.

327
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,760
What's going on?

328
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,760
Could it be...

329
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,760
The job has started.

330
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,760
Is that Aou?

331
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,760
Yes.

332
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,760
I thought it was around here...

333
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,760
There!

334
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,760
Huh?

335
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,760
Huh?

336
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,760
The butterfly...

337
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,760
It's shining.

338
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,760
Come here.

339
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,760
Who's there?

340
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,760
Ah...

341
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,760
I...

342
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,760
Hayri?

343
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,760
Why are you here?

344
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,760
That butterfly...

345
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,760
What is it?

346
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,760
Can you see the butterfly?

347
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,760
The sound of rain is knocking on the window

348
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,760
I heard it in my bed

349
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:31,760
Even if I try to rotate the MD I borrowed one day

350
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:38,760
I can't remember the day you were hurt

351
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:46,760
Rain is so strange on sunny days

352
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,760
A short phrase

353
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,760
A replay

354
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:58,760
The rain that was on the other side of the sink

355
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:04,760
A melody I can't remember

356
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,760
Every day is so boring

357
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,760
It repeats and summer comes

358
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:20,760
I hide my tears and my true self

359
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,760
Since when did we forget?

360
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,760
The rain that was on the other side of the sink

361
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,760
A play

362
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:39,760
The rain that was on the other side of the sink

363
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,760
A play

364
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:47,760
The rain that was on the other side of the sink

365
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,760
A play

366
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,760
The rain that was on the other side of the sink
