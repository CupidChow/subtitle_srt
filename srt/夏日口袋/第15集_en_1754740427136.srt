1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I was sweating a lot after playing around for a while.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I sat down on the floor and looked up at the sky.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The sun was just above me.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I saw the grass turn yellow after the sun.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
A soft sensation gently stroked my head.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Was it the wind or the shadow boy's hand?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Did someone ever stroke my head like this?

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I heard a voice calling us from afar.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's play together.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The voice I heard was supposed to be the one I was talking to.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But I turned my eyes away from the unchanging scenery.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I turned my back on the white snow that was falling.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I was so scared that I couldn't see it.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I was so scared that I couldn't see it.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I was longing for only the white light.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The end of the notebook that writes down the summer is coming.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:51,000
On the day I finally come, I'll just wave my hand with a smile.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
There are things that can only be reached by walking.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm still searching for the warmth of your warm hands.

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
No matter how many things I connect, I can't reach you.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:22,000
No matter how many times I look back at the summer, I'll keep going.

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
According to the old lady,

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It seems that a champion has come to fix the broken fist on the island.

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Champion?

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
No, champion!

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Champion?

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yes, champion!

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
OK, champion!

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'll leave it at this for today.

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Maybe the old man is not in the mood as he said.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Excuse me.

33
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Who?

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Takahara Hairi.

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Takahara?

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And you?

37
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Name.

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Shiroha.

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Shiroha? What are you doing?

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Practicing.

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Swimming?

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's my line.

43
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yes?

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Are you lost?

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I want to go back to Kato's house.

46
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Isn't it Sakahara's house?

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
No, Takahara's.

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Sakahara?

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
No, it's okay to be Sakahara.

50
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm sorry, I'm going.

51
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Go back to the slope and follow the right.

52
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Huh?

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The third crossroad is on the left.

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Thank you.

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
By the way, why are you practicing at night?

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's dangerous, so you should stop.

57
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
If you catch a foot in a pool where no one is there ...

58
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Come on.

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What?

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Come on!

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Huh?

62
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Thank you for telling me the way.

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Welcome.

64
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You don't have to be so surprised.

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
By the way, I sold out of watermelon leaves.

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Wait, wait.

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm going to have a welcome party at the cafeteria tomorrow.

69
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Shiroha, are you coming?

70
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Welcome party? Who's that?

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Kato's grandmother's relative is coming.

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Kato's ...

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Who is it?

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Huh?

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Well ...

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I was about to be beaten up.

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Huh? I'm scared.

78
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Well, that's a joke.

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It doesn't seem like a bad guy to say.

80
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I met Ryoichi and Tenzen for the first time.

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Huh? I'm scared.

82
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
If you can go, I'll go.

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yeah, I'll wait.

84
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I wonder if it's okay.

85
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Where?

86
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Huh?

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Well ...

88
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Good evening.

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You lost your way again.

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That's not true.

91
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Then why?

92
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Are you going to make me a maid?

93
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I won't!

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Besides, I'm not alone or you're alone.

95
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Huh?

101
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Well ...

102
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Stretch your arms.

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And when you stretch them, put them a little bit forward.

104
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Just be aware of that.

105
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What?

106
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
See you later.

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What is it?

108
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Huh?

109
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Grandpa.

110
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yeah?

111
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm going out for a while.

112
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
At this time?

113
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
That promise ...

114
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
With my friends ...

115
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Is that so?

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm going.

117
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm going.

118
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
G-

119
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The first one is not Geto.

120
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
This ...

121
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Did you come?

122
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Welcome party.

123
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Thank you.

124
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Yesterday, I swam a little well in the pool.

125
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Is that so?

126
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
That's all.

127
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Thank you for your hard work.

128
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Please come back from the island.

129
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I just came.

130
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I just had a welcome party.

131
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm not welcome.

132
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Wait a minute.

133
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Well ...

134
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Why are you here?

135
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
No, I'm sure you'll be interested if I say that.

136
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Well, Shiroha-san.

137
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Eh?

138
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Why do you know Shiroha?

139
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I introduced myself when I first met you.

140
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Ah, Satoshi Haibara.

141
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
No, it's Hayari Takahara.

142
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So, Shiroha-san ...

143
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I don't need you.

144
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Eh?

145
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Ah, yeah.

146
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Then, Shiroha, what was it just now?

147
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That is ...

148
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Shiroha?

149
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It doesn't matter.

150
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What did you come here for?

151
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
On this empty island.

152
00:09:48,000 --> 00:10:08,140
It's a

153
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I remember the memory that the sun shone brightly every day no matter how much I played.

154
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I remember the small time since I came to this island.

155
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I wonder why.

156
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm a little excited.

157
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Is it because of that?

158
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
His embarrassing smile.

159
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I think it's because the island is right for you.

160
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I see.

161
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Then it's fine.

162
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Um ...

163
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I have one thing I want to ask you.

164
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Eh?

165
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Um ...

166
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You know ...

167
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What is the broken fist?

168
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Eh?

169
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I heard that you are a champion who came to fix the broken fist.

170
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's just a secret.

171
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
There are many things.

172
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
How can I say ...

173
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Um ...

174
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I can't fight.

175
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's hard to say that.

176
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Hesha ...

177
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Hesha?

178
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Eh?

179
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Ah ...

180
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's nothing.

181
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Hesha ...

182
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's strange.

183
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Brother! Brother!

184
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's morning.

185
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Morning ...

186
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Good morning, brother.

187
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Good morning, Umi.

188
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Brother ...

189
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Ah ...

190
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's me.

191
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm not used to it yet.

192
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Umi, what is this?

193
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I got it from the port.

194
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Kani-chan who used the material.

195
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
No, I used too much material.

196
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
At least I can use it after disassembly.

197
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Umi ...

198
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's hard to say.

199
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Gah ...

200
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Umi ...

201
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Ah ...

202
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Eh ...

203
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Mama ...

204
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Oh, Kani is gorgeous from the morning.

205
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It seems that it was grilled with elegance.

206
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The essence of fried rice is firepower.

207
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
By the way, Kyoko-san ...

208
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Kuranoseili ...

209
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's okay, so enjoy the island more.

210
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Enjoy the island ...

211
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Well, I can meet interesting guys.

212
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
silho ...

213
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Shiroho...

214
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Can you catch it?

215
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Not really.

216
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Why did you come?

217
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Why?

218
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
That's because I'm your friend.

219
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I can call you if I see someone I know.

220
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I see.

221
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Gohon.

222
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So what are you catching?

223
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Anything.

224
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Anything.

225
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Sao, can you lend me a hand?

226
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But it doesn't seem to be a fish here...

227
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I caught it!

228
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
A black one.

229
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
No, but I wonder if it's talented.

230
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
By the way, I'm good at catching crayfish.

231
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm good at catching crayfish.

232
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
By the way, I'm good at catching crayfish.

233
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You bastard.

234
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It was too late.

235
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Huh?

236
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Could this be...

237
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Oh, yeah.

238
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's like a drink.

239
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
But it's amazing.

240
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
The food is delicious.

241
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
The food is delicious.

242
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's my job at home.

243
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Wow, it's really good.

244
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Really?

245
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's delicious.

246
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Really?

247
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Thank you for the meal.

248
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It was really delicious.

249
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
No one can cook at home.

250
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
If you're done eating,

251
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
don't bother with me anymore.

252
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Huh?

253
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
There's nothing good about it.

254
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
When I get hungry,

255
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I want to eat something sweet.

256
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Do you want to go eat ice cream?

257
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I want to thank you for the food.

258
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
If it's watermelon bar...

259
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Okay, it's decided.

260
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Oh...

261
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm glad you're still here.

262
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Yeah.

263
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Oh, you're white.

264
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
What?

265
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's cold.

266
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Hey, hey.

267
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
If you take off your clothes, you'll get drunk.

268
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
No, I don't care about you.

269
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I don't care.

270
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Normally,

271
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
tattoos are more desirable

272
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
to prevent you from sweating.

273
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Your parents will cry.

274
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
What's wrong, white?

275
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Are you having a fever?

276
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's the hottest day of the summer.

277
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
No, it's probably because of the watermelon bar.

278
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's okay, white.

279
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
See you tomorrow.

280
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What are you doing?

281
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
What are you doing?

282
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You're so rude.

283
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You're not just showing your skin.

284
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You're not just showing your skin.

285
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's a misunderstanding!

286
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
White, you were scary.

287
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Are you okay now?

288
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
My precious...

289
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You stole it.

290
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
White, you're so mean!

291
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Hey, boy.

292
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Stop staring at me.

293
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Girls,

294
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
get out of here.

295
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Take this.

296
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It's cold.

297
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I've been thinking about this for a while.

298
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
White,

299
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
take back the dust you lost.

300
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Well, then.

301
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Let's start a manhunt.

302
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You've done a good job.

303
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's cold!

304
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It's so cold!

305
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I've been training hard on table tennis.

306
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm so good at it.

307
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Stop it, white.

308
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
My breath...

309
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Stop it.

310
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I've...

311
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I've... hit you.

312
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
White.

313
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
We did it.

314
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
We won.

315
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
But I didn't expect

316
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
that we'd be gathered like this, including idiots.

317
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Yeah.

318
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's been a while since I've had so much fun with you.

319
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It's been a while since I've had so much fun with you.

320
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I-It's not fun.

321
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
White?

322
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Oh,

323
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I lost yesterday.

324
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
But it was pretty fun.

325
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah.

326
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yesterday too,

327
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
but is it okay to be in the dark?

328
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
The watermelon I couldn't eat yesterday...

329
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
What?

330
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
White!

331
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Why were you outside until it got so dark?

332
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I was testing it.

333
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What did you test?

334
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I saw it,

335
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
and I thought it was okay.

336
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I knew someone would help me.

337
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I knew someone would help me.

338
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You saw it? You were angry?

339
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm fine now.

340
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Put me down.

341
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Hey, are you listening?

342
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
No.

343
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Be quiet.

344
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm really fine.

345
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I was worried.

346
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm sorry.

347
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm sorry.

348
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Thank you,

349
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Airi.

350
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Yeah.

351
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Hm?

352
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Hey.

353
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Can I talk to you for a bit?

354
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
White was

355
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
the type to draw a line around him since he was a child.

356
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
But

357
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
he was also quite playful.

358
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Just like yesterday.

359
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But about four years ago,

360
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
a small incident happened.

361
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Our classmate said it.

362
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Shiroha was cursed

363
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
and killed.

364
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Cursed?

365
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Killed?

366
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Actually, he fell from the cliff to the sea.

367
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Well, he wasn't dead, but...

368
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Waaaaaah!

369
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Waaaaaah!

370
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Shiroha was there.

371
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
That was

372
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
a coincidence, right?

373
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
If you think about it normally,

374
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
but Shiroha's house

375
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
was a bit...

376
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
This place

377
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
is called Naruse Shrine.

378
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Naruse?

379
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Naruse?

380
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's a normal town now, but

381
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
if you go back,

382
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
you can see everything about the island.

383
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
The people who were so famous

384
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
are still dead.

385
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
A special family...

386
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Like a shrine maiden?

387
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That's right.

388
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
They bring good and bad things.

389
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
So don't touch them.

390
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
That's the secret understanding of this island.

391
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So I shouldn't get close to them either.

392
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
...

393
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
That's wrong.

394
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Huh?

395
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Even though we're old friends,

396
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Shiroha is our childhood friend.

397
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Takahara,

398
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
even though we just met,

399
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
you're not the one who's going to get along with them.

400
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Shiroha seems to be going back to the past.

401
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm not asking for this,

402
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
but...

403
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
About Shiroha...

404
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Will you care about him as much as you can?

405
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Ryoichi...

406
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Tenzan...

407
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Yeah,

408
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
of course.

409
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
The sound of rain

410
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
knocks on the window.

411
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I heard it in my bed.

412
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Even if I try to

413
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
rotate the

414
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
emu I borrowed

415
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
one day,

416
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
you were

417
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
pierced.

418
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I can't remember

419
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
the name of the song.

420
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
On a sunny day,

421
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
it's strange

422
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
to see

423
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
the rain.

424
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
A short

425
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
break

426
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
is

427
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
a common thing,

428
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
but

429
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
the evening

430
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
is passing by.

431
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I can't remember

432
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
the melody.

433
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
A boring

434
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
everyday

435
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
repeats

436
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
and

437
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
tears

438
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
fall.

439
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I hide my true self

440
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
and

441
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I wonder

442
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
when

443
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'll be able to

444
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
forget

445
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
the moment

446
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I'm going to

447
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
leave the clear sky.
