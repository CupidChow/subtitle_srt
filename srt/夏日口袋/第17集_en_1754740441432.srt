00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 2

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Who's there?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The underwater martial arts are a gift for the Sea God.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
When the men of the island are important, they always show their resolve in the sea.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
If you have resolve, show it to me, kid!

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Sea God

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I should have decided what to say

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But I turned away from the unchanging scenery

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I wanted a little courage

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I longed for the white radiance

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The end of the notebook that writes the summer is coming

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:24,000
On the day I will come, I will at least wave my hand with a smile

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
There is something that can only be reached by walking

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm still looking for the warmth of your warm hands

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I can't reach you even if I connect the warmth of your clouds

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Even now, I will repeat in the shadow of the summer

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The Sea God

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let's do what we can do

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Is it useless?

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
This is again...

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Hailey, do your best!

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Shiro...

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What the...

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Jogai?

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We won!

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Hailey won!

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Ten years ago in the summer, Shiroha lost her father and mother.

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,860
Since then, she has been a

32
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,000
secretive woman, and has no friends.

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
She has been living alone in the summer, causing bad rumors.

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Please take care of Shiroha!

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Grandpa...

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yes, during the summer festival, I will always be by Shiroha's side and protect her.

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
If I do that, even the stupid rumors will disappear.

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Hailey...

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But...

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The match between the summer birds and the summer birds is limited to the physical body.

41
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Physical body?

42
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
No, no, no, no!

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You can't do that!

44
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Hailey and her husband...

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Of course, they are both very smart.

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm grateful to Shiroha.

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Grateful?

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So, if Shiroha is in danger, I want to help her as soon as possible.

49
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
If...

50
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
If it's not a bother...

51
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I beg you...

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
...

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Please be my husband.

54
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Wow!

55
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You and your brother are getting married!

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's just an imitation.

57
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You'll be busy preparing for the bloodshed and other things, so don't worry about the cleaning of the warehouse.

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Be strong.

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Thank you.

60
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yeah.

61
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
On the day of the festival, we'll light this up and send it to the sea.

62
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Don't forget to bring it.

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I see.

64
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The red light Shiroha saw in the sea was a thief.

65
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Hey, Aou.

66
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What?

67
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That girl...

68
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That girl is Hotta-chan.

69
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Last winter, my mother was sick...

70
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Hotta-chan.

71
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Do you know what a obon is?

72
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I don't know.

73
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Only the dead come back between the obons.

74
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The dead come back?

75
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Sorry.

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I can't see you.

77
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So, on the night of the festival, we'll cross the sea and go home.

78
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's scary when it's dark, right?

79
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Scary?

80
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
That's why we have to light this up.

81
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So you can go home with peace of mind.

82
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yeah.

83
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Toshikan, you were dressing up today, right?

84
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yeah.

85
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's time for Shiroha to do it.

86
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
If it's Shiroha's place, Takahara and the others will drown on the festival day, right?

87
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Isn't it the cause of the kimono at night?

88
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I see.

89
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What?

90
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
How can I take off that kimono?

91
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Why do you ask?

92
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I don't know if I can take it off when it's time.

93
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
When it's time?

94
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Are you stupid?

95
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Is that what chigiri means?

96
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You'll be in trouble if you don't take it off.

97
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
If you wear something like that, you can't swim.

98
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I see.

99
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's not a cover.

100
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Sorry.

101
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I was just joking.

102
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
But I can't swim if I wear a kimono.

103
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Right?

104
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Ryoichi told me to think about it.

105
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'll think about it too.

106
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Airi.

107
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Thank you for thinking about it.

108
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's finally tomorrow.

109
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yes, this is Kato.

110
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Oh, Nomiki?

111
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Shiroha?

112
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What's going on?

113
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The day before the festival, the shrine maiden should be in the hall, right?

114
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't know.

115
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But for now, Aoi is in Shiroha's place, and Ryoichi and Tenzen are looking for Shiroha.

116
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I see.

117
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Then I'll look for her too.

118
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What?

119
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I have a feeling.

120
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Everyone is worried.

121
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
At least tell someone.

122
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Sorry.

123
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
But I really wanted to come here.

124
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
As the summer birds' season approaches, it's getting clearer.

125
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Now I can clearly see Airi's face.

126
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm sorry.

128
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Why did you call me?

129
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I was invited to many places.

130
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm glad I'm alone.

131
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I don't mind if I'm gone.

132
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
But I can't stand it when someone important is gone.

133
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's okay.

135
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
...

136
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Even so, I'm glad I met you.

137
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I was saved because you were there.

138
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So don't say that.

139
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm sure everyone is.

140
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I can't stand the fact that you're gone.

141
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What?

143
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I don't know, but...

144
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm sorry.

145
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Let's go back.

146
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Wait.

147
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's almost time.

148
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I want you to see it.

149
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
What do you mean?

150
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Fireflies.

151
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Sea fireflies.

152
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Sea fireflies?

153
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Sea fireflies?

154
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
This place used to be a secret place that my father taught me.

155
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It hasn't been lit up for a long time.

156
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But this summer, it's lit up again.

157
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
For the first time in ten years.

158
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Ten years?

159
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm lucky.

160
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's strange.

161
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You know, I used to want to go to the future.

162
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
To the future?

163
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm tired of waiting.

164
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I wanted to send time early and see you.

165
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So I guess I can see you now.

166
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Do you want to go now?

167
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yeah.

168
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I don't know how long I should wait.

169
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So I'm fine.

170
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I see.

171
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Welcome back.

172
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm home.

173
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm looking forward to seeing you.

174
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Yes, I'll be back.

175
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm used to this road.

176
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
That was a rainbow butterfly.

177
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Sea fireflies

178
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Huh?

179
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Umi?

180
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Onii-chan?

181
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Why are you here?

182
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I was chasing after Shou.

183
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Why are you here?

184
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm going for a walk.

185
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I see.

186
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Let's go together.

187
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
No, I want to go for a walk.

188
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What were you doing?

189
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's almost time.

190
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Sorry.

191
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I was looking for someone I knew.

192
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Hurry up.

193
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
If you don't finish the blood cutting of the butterfly, the summer festival won't start.

194
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I see.

195
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'll start the blood cutting of the butterfly.

196
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm sorry.

197
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm sorry.

198
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm sorry.

199
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm sorry.

200
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm sorry.

201
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm sorry.

202
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm sorry.

203
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm sorry.

204
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm sorry.

205
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm sorry.

206
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm sorry.

207
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm sorry.

208
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm sorry.

209
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm sorry.

210
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm sorry.

211
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm sorry.

212
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm sorry.

213
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm sorry.

214
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm sorry.

215
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm sorry.

216
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm sorry.

218
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm sorry.

219
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm sorry.

220
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm sorry.

221
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm sorry.

222
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm sorry.

223
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm sorry.

224
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,780
The

225
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:47,000
Sun

226
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
The

227
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Sun

228
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
That ship...

229
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It was on fire last year, but it's not getting any heavier.

230
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
The number of wishes will increase the weight.

231
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It looks like nothing happened.

232
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm glad.

233
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's raining.

234
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm glad it ended before it started raining.

235
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's a shame we can't watch it until the end, but let's go back.

236
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That's right.

237
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Hailey!

238
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Didn't you see Hotta?

239
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
No, I didn't see her.

240
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
She's nowhere to be found.

241
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It looks like she's calling for the drinker on the air.

242
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
If you find her, please catch her.

243
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Hailey!

244
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
The future I saw...

245
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You're saying that me and Siroha are in the sea, right?

246
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
But that's already...

247
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I just saw it clearly!

248
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
The other person who thought it was Hailey was a girl!

249
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
That's Hotta?

250
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But why is she in the sea?

251
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
A ship!

252
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Hotta is over there!

253
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
If so, we have to take her back!

254
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
But how?

255
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Hey, over here!

256
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
There she is!

257
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Hotta!

258
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
She's going to take the ship and get hit by her dad!

259
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Please stay safe!

260
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Over there!

261
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Leave it to me!

262
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Hotta!

263
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Brother!

264
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Wait!

265
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I thought I could see my mother!

266
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I thought I could get on this ship and go to the same place!

267
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm sorry!

268
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Give me your hand!

269
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Over here!

270
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Hailey!

271
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Siroha!

272
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Siroha!

273
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Ryoichi, please take care of Korko!

274
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Siroha!

275
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Hailey...

276
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Deliver!

277
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Siroha...

278
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
No, that's not it...

279
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:47,520
We are the

280
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
We just keep on knitting.

281
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Where are you going?

282
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I...

283
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Over here.

284
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Over here.

285
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Here!

286
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Here.

287
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Sigh...

288
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Ryo...

289
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Thank you for your hard work.

290
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
No, thank you for your hard work.

291
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm sorry.

292
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I've always wanted to tell you something.

293
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Actually, since the first time we met...

294
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Hailey...

295
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I realized that I was in the pool in my underwear.

296
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm sorry for being quiet all this time!

297
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Why are you being like this now?

298
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,000
There's so much going on that I don't know what to say anymore.

299
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I think that's why you don't have to choose between this or that.

300
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
That's right.

301
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm really in love.

302
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I thought about it.

303
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
The future is as dark as the sea at that time.

304
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Normally, you can't see anything.

305
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But I think that's the power of the White Fang that throws a ray of light there.

306
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
That's amazing, isn't it?

307
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
What's wrong, White Fang?

308
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's nothing.

309
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's just that I saw it.

310
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
What?

311
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Is it something ominous again?

312
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's nothing.

313
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It wasn't ominous at all.

314
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
What's wrong?

315
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I remember.

316
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
What?

317
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
How I spent my summer vacation.

318
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I wonder when I forgot.

319
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It's so simple and simple.

320
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I loved summer.

321
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm going out soon.

322
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Please let me finish the challenge.

323
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
There are two things I want to say at the end.

324
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
What is it this time?

325
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Well...

326
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'll tell you, but it was fun.

327
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I had fun too.

328
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It was fun.

329
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
So I fell in love with you.

330
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
White Fang.

331
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
What?

332
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I fell in love with you too.

333
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'm going to this island again.

334
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'll return the money for the sake of the situation.

335
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
What?

336
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Why are you coming back?

337
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I'm home.

338
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Welcome back.

339
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'm sure next time...

340
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Next time?

341
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
What's next?

342
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm...

343
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
What?
