00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 2

2
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,880
We will soon arrive at Torishiro Island, the Torishiro Island Port.

3
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,560
If you land on the ship, there may be a strong impact.

4
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,560
Torishiro Island, huh?

5
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,560
So I'm a wounded rooster.

6
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,560
What?

7
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,560
Who's a wounded rooster?

8
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,560
Um...

9
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,560
Me?

10
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,560
You? Why?

11
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,560
Because I'm wounded.

12
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,560
Where?

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,560
My heart.

14
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,560
Oh.

15
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,560
N-Nothing.

16
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,560
It's my first time coming to this island.

17
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,560
Why does it feel nostalgic?

18
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,560
What do you mean?

19
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,560
Oh, you were talking.

20
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,560
I was just talking.

21
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,560
It's my first time seeing this scenery, but it feels nostalgic.

22
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,560
That's what it is, right?

23
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,560
That's what it is.

24
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,560
Hm?

25
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,560
It's a hijab.

26
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,560
What?

27
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,560
Isn't that a dejavu?

28
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,560
That's right.

29
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,560
It's a hijab.

30
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
Let's go.

31
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,560
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,560
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,560
Please excuse us.

34
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,560
The End

35
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,560
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,560
I was going to go to the harbor, but...

37
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,560
Once again,

38
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,560
I'm Kyouko Misaki, the housekeeper of this house,

39
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,560
who has been entrusted with this house since my grandmother died.

40
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,560
I'm Hayari Takahara.

41
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,560
I'll be in your care during the summer vacation.

42
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,560
I'll show you around the room.

43
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,560
I'm sorry for being so proud.

44
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,560
I cleaned up, but I've been in a good mood for a long time.

45
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,560
No, it's a perfect room for your current mood.

46
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,560
I'm a wounded bird of prey.

47
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,560
What?

48
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,560
No, it's nothing.

49
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,560
That's right.

50
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,560
Another relative of Hayari's is coming.

51
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,560
A relative?

52
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,560
Yes.

53
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,560
He's been walking around all the time, so he's not here now.

54
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,560
I'll introduce him to you later.

55
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,560
Would you like to come to Torishiro Island?

56
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,560
It was a little before the summer vacation that I received such a letter from Kyouko Oba.

57
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,560
My grandfather, who was a substitute, died last month,

58
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,560
and a lot of the relics he collected from traveling around the world were left in the warehouse.

59
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,560
Some of them are related to family memories,

60
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,560
so I can't leave them to the company.

61
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:11,560
So I decided to give them to a person I had time with among my relatives.

62
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,560
That was me.

63
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,560
I didn't have a day off until last year.

64
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,560
The next day

65
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,560
I will tell you the weather forecast for tomorrow, July 26.

66
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,560
Setouchi is under high pressure, and it's going to be sunny.

67
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,560
Excuse me.

68
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,560
Did you get some rest?

69
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,560
I'm sorry I'm early.

70
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,560
Sanuki Udon!

71
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,560
A large, large, fresh tempura.

72
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,560
It's light and smooth.

73
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,560
Sanuki Udon!

74
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,560
This is the first meal I've ever had on this island.

75
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,560
I don't mind.

76
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,560
I'm sorry.

77
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,560
I wish I could cook for you.

78
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,560
Just a moment.

79
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,560
Okay.

80
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,560
I understand.

81
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,560
Huh?

82
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,560
Huh?

83
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,560
Oh, right. I have a good idea.

84
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,560
Airi, do you want to ride a bike?

85
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,560
I have a license.

86
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,560
There's a restaurant down the hill.

87
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,560
It's delicious.

88
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,560
This is...

89
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,560
Excuse me.

90
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,560
I'd like a happy set.

91
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,560
Huh?

92
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,560
Here you go.

93
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,560
The train is about to depart.

94
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,560
The Red Machines...

95
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,560
Wait.

96
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,560
Huh?

97
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,560
The Sisters are about to depart.

98
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,560
The train is about to depart.

99
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,560
Excuse me.

100
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,560
Huh?

101
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,560
I think I asked for a happy set.

102
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,560
You're happy because you can go with your parents, right?

103
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,560
Huh?

104
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,560
Huh?

105
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,560
Tricks Buster House!

106
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,560
Let's go around the island and go home.

107
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,560
I'm screwed.

108
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,560
I'm lost.

109
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,560
Huh?

110
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,560
Huh?

111
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,560
Excuse me.

112
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,560
Huh?

113
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,560
Who are you?

114
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,560
I'm a woman.

115
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,560
I'm a woman.

116
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,560
I'm a woman.

117
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,560
I'm a woman.

118
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,560
I'm a woman.

119
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,560
I'm a woman.

120
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,560
I'm a woman.

121
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,560
Who are you?

122
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,560
Oh, I'm Takahara...

123
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,560
I'm Takahara...

124
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,560
I'm Takahara...

125
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,560
Takahara?

126
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,560
And you are?

127
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,560
Huh?

128
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,560
Your name?

129
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,560
Shiroha.

130
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,560
Shiroha...

131
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,560
What are you doing?

132
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,560
Training.

133
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,560
Swimming?

134
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,560
Huh?

135
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,560
That's my line.

136
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,560
What?

137
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,560
Are you lost?

138
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,560
I want to go back to Kato's house.

139
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,560
Huh? Not Sakahara's house?

140
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,560
No, Takahara's.

141
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,560
Sa...Sakahara?

142
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,560
No...

143
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,560
I'll go with Sakahara.

144
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,560
Sorry, I'm going.

145
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,560
Go back to the hill and follow the right.

146
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,560
Huh?

147
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,560
The third crossroad is on the left.

148
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,560
Thanks.

149
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,560
By the way...

150
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,560
Why are you practicing at night?

151
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,560
It's dangerous, so you should stop.

152
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,560
If you can't find anyone to swim in the pool...

153
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,560
Come on.

154
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,560
Huh?

155
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,560
Come on!

156
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,560
Thanks for telling me the way!

157
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,560
The next morning.

158
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,560
In the back of the ball, the sisters are under the control of the absolute guardian god, Sasami.

159
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,560
They are out two out in a row.

160
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,560
Well...

161
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,560
How was it?

162
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,560
It was delicious, right?

163
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,560
Yes, it was unexpected.

164
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,560
By the way, what is DOSKOI?

165
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,560
Shitsukoi.

166
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,560
I'm sorry.

167
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,560
No, it's the dialect of the island.

168
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,560
It's very stubborn.

169
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,560
When you're angry, you say DOSKOI.

170
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,560
Shitsukoi!

171
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,560
Oh...

172
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,560
It's...

173
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,560
Shitsukoi...

174
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,560
The reverse home run!

175
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,560
Goodbye!

176
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,560
The next morning.

177
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,560
Hello?

178
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,560
Please wake up!

179
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,560
It's already 8 o'clock.

180
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,560
Well...

181
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,560
Nice to meet you. I'm Umi.

182
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,560
Oh...

183
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,560
You're my relative.

184
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,560
I'm Takahara Airi.

185
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,560
Nice to meet you.

186
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,560
Nice to meet you too.

187
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,560
Takahara-san...

188
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,560
Please eat.

189
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,560
Osokoro Chohan?

190
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,560
Yes.

191
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,560
I made it.

192
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,560
Wow, that's amazing.

193
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,560
Huh?

194
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,560
It's not like that.

195
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,560
It is.

196
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,560
What is it?

197
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,560
Oh, sorry.

198
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,560
That's amazing.

199
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,560
Well, I'll eat it.

200
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,560
Please.

201
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,560
It's delicious!

202
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,560
The rice is crispy and the seasoning is just right.

203
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,560
Rock-paper-scissors!

204
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,560
I lost again.

205
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,560
You're cheating!

206
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,560
How can you cheat on rock-paper-scissors?

207
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,560
It's strange to lose like this.

208
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,560
I can't help it. I'll teach you.

209
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,560
You're cheating!

210
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,560
I'm not cheating.

211
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,560
I'm showing my face.

212
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,560
What?

213
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,560
When I'm going to say,

214
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,560
I'll say,

215
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,560
and when I'm going to say,

216
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,560
I'll say,

217
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,560
so it's a round-trip.

218
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,560
Wait.

219
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,560
Then you can win if you say,

220
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,560
I'll say,

221
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,560
while making a face.

222
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,560
Rock-paper-scissors!

223
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,560
Why?

224
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,560
Then I'll say,

225
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,560
while making a face,

226
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,560
I'll say,

227
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,560
Rock-paper-scissors!

228
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,560
What?

229
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,560
Why? Why? Why?

230
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,560
Why?

231
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,560
Then how about this?

232
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,560
This is it.

233
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,560
This is...

234
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,560
nothing.

235
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,560
Rock-paper-scissors!

236
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,560
I won! I won!

237
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,560
I won!

238
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,560
I did it!

239
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,560
How was it?

240
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,560
Well, then,

241
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,560
I'm going out.

242
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,560
See you later.

243
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,560
See you later.

244
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,560
You can be free for a while.

245
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,560
I'll help you with the cleaning of the warehouse.

246
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,560
Well, enjoy the island.

247
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,560
You might have a wonderful encounter.

248
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,560
A wonderful encounter?

249
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,560
I'm just sleeping.

250
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,560
No,

251
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,560
it's too loud, isn't it, dog?

252
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,560
Dog?

253
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,560
Watch out!

254
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,560
Well...

255
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,560
Good morning.

256
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,560
Who are you?

257
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,560
Why are you hugging me?

258
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,560
Are you going to be my servant?

259
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,560
Please be nice to me at first.

260
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,560
In the end, you can be aggressive.

261
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,560
Is there any reason for that?

262
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,560
Takahara Hayri?

263
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,560
What a strange name.

264
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,560
Tell your parents about that.

265
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,560
Do you stay on this island for a while

266
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,560
to clean up the warehouse?

267
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,560
Not really.

268
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,560
Stop being so cautious.

269
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,560
I'm not that strong mentally.

270
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,560
I'm cautious, too.

271
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,560
Because I was attacked by a cat.

272
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,560
You weren't attacked.

273
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,560
Anyway,

274
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,560
leave me alone even if I'm sleeping.

275
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,560
Oh, no! It's 2 o'clock!

276
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,560
I'm going to be late!

277
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,560
Inari, let's go!

278
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,560
2 o'clock?

279
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,560
Why did I realize that?

280
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,560
Let's change our feelings.

281
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,560
The sea will swallow everything.

282
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,560
We'll spend a summer in an unknown land.

283
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,560
I'm a little worried.

284
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,560
Summer is always cruel.

285
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,560
It's coming.

286
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,560
Who are you?

287
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,560
If you're dressed like that...

288
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,560
It's dangerous.

289
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,560
Dangerous?

290
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,560
That bastard!

291
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,560
He shot me without warning!

292
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,560
Shot?

293
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,560
The exposure of the bottom.

294
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,560
It is prohibited to take off your clothes outside the beach.

295
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,560
Get dressed and leave immediately.

296
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,560
What's going on?

297
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,560
It's naked.

298
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,560
Naked?

299
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,560
Run away without wanting to die!

300
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,560
I'm home.

301
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,560
Welcome back!

302
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,560
What? What? What?

303
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,560
That's my line.

304
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,560
Why are you naked?

305
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,560
What?

306
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,560
Naked?

307
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,560
Is this island a custom?

308
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,560
Custom?

309
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,560
Yesterday...

310
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,560
I saw a naked man yesterday.

311
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,560
Naked?

312
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,560
Naked?

313
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,560
No, it's nothing. Forget it.

314
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,560
Anyway, please get dressed quickly.

315
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,560
Oh, right.

316
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,560
Takahara-san, your luggage has arrived.

317
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,560
Is it from your parents?

318
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,560
Oh.

319
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,560
Was it from the swimming club?

320
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,560
No.

321
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,560
It's the board club.

322
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,560
There's nothing like that.

323
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,560
I'll ask Kyoko-san.

324
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,560
Kyoko-san! What is the board club?

325
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,560
Takahara-san, Kyoko-san looks strange.

326
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,560
Huh?

327
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,560
Takahara-san?

328
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,560
Takahara-san!

329
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,560
Oh, man...

330
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,560
Is it like that?

331
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,560
Where, I mean...

332
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,560
Didn't화

333
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,560
Sorry.

334
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,560
You lost your way again?

335
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,560
Ah...

336
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,560
That's not it.

337
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,560
Then what?

338
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,560
What are you going to do?

339
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,560
You know, you have to stretch your arms out.

340
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,560
And when you stretch them out, you have to put some space between them.

341
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,560
Just being aware of that is going to make a big difference.

342
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,560
See you later.

343
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,560
Ah...
