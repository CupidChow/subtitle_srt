1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
Thus, I didn't understand why she was cute, but she compression onto her

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,980
face that she had never experienced before.

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,220
Welcome back.

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,520
Let's eat up, please!

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
...

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's delicious.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I-Is that so?

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I should have decided the words to tell you, but I looked away from the unchanging scenery.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I was sad and depressed because I wanted a little courage.

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I longed for only the white brightness.

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The end of the summer is approaching.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:43,000
On the day I will arrive, I will hold my hand with a smile.

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
There is something that only can be reached by continuing to walk.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm still looking for the warmth of your warm hands.

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
No matter how many kindnesses I connect, I can't reach you.

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I will repeat myself in the shadow of the summer again and again.

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The dark side is still good. If you can play today.

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Even if you say you can play...

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Oh?

20
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Well...

21
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Then...

22
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Wait!

23
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Huh? Me?

24
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Hm?

25
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What?

26
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Thank you.

27
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I was swimming a little well in the pool before.

28
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Well then.

29
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Thank you.

30
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Look, look, it's that person.

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Kirono grandma said.

32
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I am a man who lost his wings.

33
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's the angel Lucifer.

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That's not true!

35
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Huh?

36
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It was farther than I thought.

37
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Hey!

38
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Huh?

39
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Mugi?

40
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Mugi?

41
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What are you doing in such a place?

42
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm looking for something.

43
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What are you looking for?

44
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I am myself.

45
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And I'm looking for what I want to do.

46
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I think it's dangerous to be in such a place.

47
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Mugi...

48
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's not dangerous.

49
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You might die if you fall.

50
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I won't die.

51
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Are you invincible?

52
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm invincible.

53
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm jealous.

54
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm jealous.

55
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Takahara Haeri, who has been staying on the island since yesterday.

56
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Please come to the scene.

57
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You're late.

58
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You...

59
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Don't tell me you're naked.

60
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Stop calling me that.

61
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I have a proper name called Nomura Miki.

62
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Is that the water cannon you shot at me with?

63
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yes.

64
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Hydrogradiator Kaida.

65
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Oh.

66
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I used to be a water soldier, too.

67
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What's with that embarrassing name?

68
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Oh, you're here.

69
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You are...

70
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You haven't introduced yourself yet.

71
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
My name is...

72
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Mitani Raku.

73
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I told you not to be naked in public.

74
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm sorry I showed you something so embarrassing.

75
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Once again, I'm Nomura Miki.

76
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Everyone calls me Nomiki.

77
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm Mitani Ryoichi.

78
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Nice to meet you, Haeri.

79
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Oh, nice to meet you.

80
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What's going on?

81
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
We have a meeting tonight.

82
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
A meeting?

83
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's a welcome party for Haeri.

84
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I just came here for a trip.

85
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Don't be shy.

86
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Torishiro Island is warm to the guests.

87
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The tourists who have been here for a long time are called the Watarinohito.

88
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Anyway, I'm just saying that it's a good way to say goodbye.

89
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Just shut up and welcome them.

90
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Thank you.

91
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's settled.

92
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
By the way, what about Tenzen?

93
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What's wrong?

94
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I think he's hiding in the mountains.

95
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Hiding in the mountains?

96
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
We have a welcome party ready.

97
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Sorry, but can you go call Tenzen?

98
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I don't know what to do.

99
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Tenzen

100
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Excuse me.

101
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
There's no one here.

102
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Excuse me.

103
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Who are you?

104
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
My blood...

105
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Ha!

106
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Ha!

107
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Excellent!

108
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It seems that you are not an amateur.

109
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
No, I'm just an amateur.

110
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Then let's get serious.

111
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I've never worn something like that.

112
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
When did you start taking this off?

113
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Karui, I can fly now.

114
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What are you doing?

115
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Is it time?

116
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Everyone is waiting.

117
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
By the way, who is he?

118
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's too late.

119
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Welcome to Torishirojima.

120
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Welcome to Torishirojima Island.

121
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Hello.

122
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Nice to meet you.

123
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm Aoi Sorakado.

124
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Nice to meet you.

125
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Oh?

126
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Nice to meet you too.

127
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Rokuhara Tandai!

128
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Takahara Haili!

129
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You're the only one who's not in the right place!

130
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What? Do you know each other?

131
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
When did you meet?

132
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Oh, no.

133
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Just a little.

134
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
By the way, what are you guys?

135
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
We are the young boys' school.

136
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Even if you say that,

137
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
there are hardly any students of the same generation.

138
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Don't play with food.

139
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Where's Shiroha?

140
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Shiroha?

141
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
She's from the same generation, right?

142
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Oh, you mean Naruse.

143
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I was surprised to hear you call her by her name.

144
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Do you know her?

145
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
No, not really.

146
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Why did you call her by her name?

147
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I thought Shiroha was her last name.

148
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Shiroha is...

149
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
In short, she's not a good match.

150
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
She's shy.

151
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Don't give her any weird jokes.

152
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
What?

153
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What are you talking about?

154
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Maybe you already...

155
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I didn't do anything!

156
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I just met her for a moment.

157
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Huh?

158
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Is Shiroha not coming?

159
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Well, I did call her by her name.

160
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm going to bed!

161
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Good morning, Umi.

162
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You're going out early in the morning?

163
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yes, I'm going to do radio exercise.

164
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I made breakfast.

165
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Thank you.

166
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Please clean up after you eat.

167
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm going!

168
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
See you later!

169
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's so hot in the basement.

170
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Welcome.

171
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's hot today, too.

172
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I guess so.

173
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Would you like some shaved ice?

174
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yes, thank you.

175
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Here, one million yen.

176
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Oh, you really say that.

177
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm sorry.

178
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm sorry.

179
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You really say that.

180
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's hot there.

181
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:37,020
You should eat in the

182
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Huh?

183
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Hey, what do you mean?

184
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
No, no matter what you say,

185
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
this is an accident.

186
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Oh, you opened the door of the room where the girl in the dress was.

187
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
An accident?

188
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
No, it's not.

189
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The shaved ice was, um...

190
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I was surprised.

191
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I understand.

192
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
When you open the door, there's a girl in a dress.

193
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
That's surprising.

194
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So?

195
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm a boy, so I don't have the immunity to exposed women.

196
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So I thought it would be bad if I didn't hide it.

197
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Oh, I see.

198
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
That's why you're wearing shaved ice.

199
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
What the hell is that?

200
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm sorry.

201
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Why are you in a suit at a candy store?

202
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Is that your hobby?

203
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You're not reflecting on yourself.

204
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
This is my part-time job.

205
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Oh, my.

206
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm so sick of being in a suit.

207
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm sorry.

208
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Please give me shaved ice as an apology.

209
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What? What does that mean?

210
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I thought I had to look at you half-heartedly.

211
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Oh, I see.

212
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That's what you're wearing.

213
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Are you ready?

214
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Come on!

215
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Ready, go!

216
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Why did you throw it back?

218
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Because it was colder than I thought.

219
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You're a king of eyes.

220
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Wait a minute.

221
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
My eyes!

222
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm going to hit you!

223
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Hey, you can't touch that!

224
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Wait, wait, wait!

225
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm touching something!

226
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm touching something, too!

227
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Oh, my. That was terrible.

228
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You're not allowed to take off your clothes outside the beach.

229
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Put on your clothes immediately.

230
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Where did you get that?

231
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'll hit you next time.

232
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'll be right there!

233
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm home.

234
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Welcome home!

235
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm home!

236
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm home!

237
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Welcome home!

238
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Why are you touching my body again?

239
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
We're having shaved ice.

240
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I don't understand!

241
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
The bath is ready, so please come in.

242
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's only been three days, but there's so much on this island.

243
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Why did I come to this island?

244
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'd like to go out again.

245
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I heard that you got along with the boys.

246
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Yeah, well...

247
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm glad. Airi looks like she's having fun.

248
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm sorry. I couldn't help you at all.

249
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Well, I'll be nice to you.

250
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Nice to me?

251
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yeah.

252
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
That's right. I came here because Kyoko called me.

253
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
No, that's the day after tomorrow.

254
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Anyway, I wanted to run away somewhere.

255
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm looking for something I want to do.

256
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm looking for something I want to do.

257
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Huh?

258
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Good evening.

259
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
What are you doing?

260
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Just walking.

261
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I see.

262
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Well...

263
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Shiroha-san is...

264
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Huh? Why do you know my name?

265
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You introduced yourself when we first met.

266
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Satoshi Haibara.

267
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
No, it's Hayri Takahara.

268
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So, Shiroha-san...

269
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Your name?

270
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Sorry.

271
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's weird, so I don't need your name.

272
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Huh?

273
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So, what?

274
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I was going to ask you something.

275
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Well...

276
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
When I came here, I saw Shiroha-san on the boat.

277
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
What?

278
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
No, it wasn't that there was a reason.

279
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I just saw him on the boat.

280
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Shiroha was looking at something.

281
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
A bird.

282
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Huh? A bird?

283
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Yeah.

284
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
At that time, a bird in the garden was flying above the sea.

285
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Shiroha-san's

286
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
What are you doing here on this island?

287
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I can't remember.

288
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What do you mean?

289
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Huh?

290
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I felt like I could say it.

291
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
The reason I came to this island.

292
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
That's right.

293
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I can't remember.

294
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I feel like I'm drowning in the time that's flowing through that town.

295
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I feel like I'm going to die.

296
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I came here to remember.

297
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
How you spent your summer vacation.

298
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Huh?

299
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You know, when was the most fun summer vacation you've ever had?

300
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
When I was little.

301
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Yeah, it was when you were a kid.

302
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
A long time ago, when you were little.

303
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I was running around in a summer like eternity.

304
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I couldn't do anything with my family and friends, no matter how much I played.

305
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
The sun kept shining brightly every day.

306
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I forgot about the scenery before I knew it.

307
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
But I do remember the scenery.

308
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I remember the sound of when I was little after coming to this island.

309
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I wonder why.

310
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I'm a little excited.

311
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'm sure the island is meant for you.

312
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I see.

313
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I hope so.

314
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I have something to ask you.

315
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Huh?

316
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Um, you know...

317
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Yeah?

318
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
What do you mean by your wings are injured?

319
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Huh?

320
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I heard from my grandma that you came to heal your wounded wings.

321
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Ah!

322
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It's a secret.

323
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
There are many things that happened.

324
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
There are many things that happened that hurt my wings.

325
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I can't fly up.

326
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
That's how it is.

327
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
That's how it is?

328
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Is it weird?

329
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
The sound of rain is knocking on the window.

330
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I heard it in my bed.

331
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I tried to rotate the MD I borrowed one day.

332
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,000
The song you sang, I can't remember.

333
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
The song you sang, I can't remember.

334
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's strange that it's raining on a sunny day.

335
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I played a short phrase.

336
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
The evening rain is falling.

337
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I can't remember the melody.

338
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I repeat boring days.

339
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Summer comes.

340
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I hide my tears and true feelings.

341
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Since when did we forget?

342
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
The first week.

343
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
From the clear sky.

344
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I pretend.
