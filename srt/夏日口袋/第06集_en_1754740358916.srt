00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Last Ship

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hey, this isn't that old of a ship, is it?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Huh?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I just remembered everything.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I found the suitcase.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The suitcase?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Because the real me is there.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Huh? What do you mean?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hailey, thank you for being with me.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
For making my dream come true.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You know, I'm sure I'll...

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Bye-bye!

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The Last Ship

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Kamome!

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Kamome...

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Kamome!

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Takahara, how's the goggles?

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
They're really useful, but why do you have a safety goggles?

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Just in case.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So, where did you lose the suitcase?

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It should be around here...

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I think I got it here, and it got my foot.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Hey, isn't that it?

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But it's a nice cave.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
If it's this small, we could call it a tourist attraction.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's what the job was supposed to be.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But it's hard to check the safety of the ship.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So they started investigating the company.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hey, wait!

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What's this switch for?

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It might be a light.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You guys, take off your goggles.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Did Takahara get caught here?

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It looks like it, but...

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It wasn't this small of a river.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I can't drown in this depth.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Then, what was that?

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This is...

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
the real me?

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Is that a woman's underwear?

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Huh? It's real!

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Why is it here?

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's strange.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I see. I see.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Please don't ask me anything else.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'll do that.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I don't want to get involved.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Sigh...

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Is this...

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
the bearded cat's adventure?

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I know this!

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I read this book before.

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
A girl named Kamome comes to the summer camp.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
She was always alone, not getting along with the other kids.

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
One day, she sneaks into the father's book of a high school student,

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and finds a map.

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
She bravely calls out to the kids.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And then she forms a bearded cat gang and goes on an adventure.

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Huh?

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
No way...

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
In the book, Kamome lives on an island away from the island.

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
An island where people live?

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Okay, I'll look into it.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Thank you.

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
There's an island near Irie where Takahara arrived.

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That island is called Shiuchi.

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Shiuchi

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Excuse me...

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Huh?

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Who are you?

72
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Um...

73
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
That...

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Did you come to deliver that suitcase?

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Um...

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That's mine.

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Huh?

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Then you're Kamome's...

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Do you know Kamome?

81
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Uh...

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Um...

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm Takahara Irie.

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm Kushima Sagi.

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Kamome is my daughter.

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Finland?

87
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yes. Kamome has been there for two years.

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I don't know how far you've come to know Kamome.

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But you came all the way here to meet Kamome.

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Then I think it's okay to talk to you.

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
As a mother.

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Ten years ago, her father was a university student studying the ecology of plants.

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
He was asked to work in the field at a company and stayed on this island.

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He was weak since he was a child and had no friends.

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
He spent most of his time reading books.

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
He wanted to explore many places, but he couldn't.

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
He often sat on this suitcase and read books.

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
This was his father's suitcase, but he traveled the world with it.

99
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That's why Kamome liked it.

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I was a novelist.

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I once wrote a novel about a girl who modeled her.

102
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That's the adventure of the Higeneko.

103
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The reason was Kamome's words.

104
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
There's a pirate ship on this island and the cannon is sleeping.

105
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Of course it's a child's fantasy, but I had fun while listening to it and decided to write a book.

106
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The model of the place in that book was Torishiro Island.

107
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yes.

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And that book was discovered and it was the next summer.

109
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Well, I want a ship.

110
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Then that ship is ...

111
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Kamome asked me to get it.

112
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
She wanted to make it a pirate ship.

113
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
She had a great plan.

114
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's a story that even I, a novelist, can't make come true.

115
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Hey, Mama, you're going to recreate that book's adventure.

116
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Recreate the adventure?

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yes.

118
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Not in the book, but actually with a map, I can find the pirate ship.

119
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Takahara-san.

120
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yes.

121
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Did you look into the ship's captain's room?

122
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
No, it was locked.

123
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
There is the most precious thing of that child hidden there.

124
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,260
The

125
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Ten years ago, I wrote the cave and the irie that gave me the title of the novel as a reference.

126
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And this year, everything is complete.

127
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
If that child is fine, I was planning to invite everyone.

128
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
This is ...

129
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It was interesting.

130
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I was excited while reading it.

131
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I can't forget this memory.

132
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I want to be friends like this.

133
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Where is the stage of this book?

134
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I want to go on an adventure with Kamome-chan and the others.

135
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I want to see the continuation of this book.

136
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm waiting for my whole life.

137
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I like you, Takahara-kun.

138
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I want to get married.

139
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Kamome-chan, please put me in the bearded child's group.

140
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I thought Kamome-chan was a brave and amazing girl.

141
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
This kind of girl is not in the class.

142
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I thought it would be okay for me to be friends with a girl like this.

143
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yes, please do it immediately.

144
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Mom, thank you.

145
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Takahara-san, did you call the prince?

146
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Are you going home?

147
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm not going home.

148
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Is that so?

149
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I asked him to deliver the luggage.

150
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Luggage?

151
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
There it is.

152
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Thank you for the letter.

153
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Finally, Kamome and the others will meet again and promise to find the pirate ship again.

154
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
This time, I want to go on an even more amazing adventure.

155
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
If you remember the memories carefully,

156
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I invite you to a special adventure ten years later.

157
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I would be happy if we could meet at that time.

158
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Inviting you to a special adventure ten years later.

159
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Kamome was really trying to make it come true.

160
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But Kamome fell.

161
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
He was originally a weak child.

162
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
His father died early.

163
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's the same disease.

164
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Takahara-san found this suitcase in the cave, right?

165
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yes.

166
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Why did you go there?

167
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I brought this suitcase.

168
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But I lost it when I arrived on this island.

169
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Did you lose it?

170
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yes.

171
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I had a strange experience when I arrived on this island.

172
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
After that, the suitcase disappeared while I was looking away for a moment.

173
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What happened?

174
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I've seen that butterfly before.

175
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
If I think about it now,

176
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
did that butterfly have something to do with Kamome?

177
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,000
If Kamome had really gone through the cave and found the pirate ship,

178
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
if Kamome had completed the plan as he imagined,

179
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
he would be impressed.

180
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
He's a great person.

181
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But he didn't have enough time.

182
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
If Kamome could spend another summer here,

183
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
he should have completed it.

184
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's more like a ghost ship than a pirate ship.

185
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Let's repaint it from the top.

186
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
We have to be careful.

187
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Let's try to get the materials cheaply.

188
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Yes.

189
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Please.

190
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Kamome...

191
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Hey, are you up?

192
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I thought so, but I guess you're probably asleep.

193
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It might be a dream.

194
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Where were you?

195
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I was watching you from here.

196
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I've been watching you for a long time.

197
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm sorry.

198
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm sorry.

199
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm sorry.

200
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm back.

201
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I've been watching you from here.

202
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I see.

203
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I see, now.

204
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You prepared both the key and the ship.

205
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm sorry, but I also forgot about it.

206
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I forgot about everything.

207
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I spent most of the day sleeping in a foreign hospital.

208
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't know if it's real or not.

209
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Then I don't know what's real and what's not.

210
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's strange.

211
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
In the bed.

212
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Memories that were only in the novel became real memories.

213
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
How are you all?

214
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Do you remember me?

215
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm getting better and meeting everyone again.

216
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Ten years ago, in the pirate ship we found.

217
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
This summer, I came to the island.

218
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I chased my dream with that suitcase my mother brought me.

219
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I became a part of the dream.

220
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I really became a part of the novel.

221
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But when I arrived on this ship with you, I remembered.

222
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It was all a story of a novel.

223
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Airi, thanks to you, my dream came true.

224
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I see.

225
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm here in front of you now because I really wanted to see you.

226
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Last?

227
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I came to say goodbye.

228
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I have to go.

229
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Where?

230
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Kamome should be abroad.

231
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Are you going back there?

232
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
No.

233
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Somewhere far away.

234
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Somewhere far away?

235
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Airi, thank you for making my dream come true.

236
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And for being my friend.

237
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm sorry.

238
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I understand the meaning of the word, indiscriminate.

239
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You were so cute that you were sitting in the seat.

240
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Kamome!

241
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm sorry.

242
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
This summer, whether it's a dream or an illusion,

243
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I will use the remaining time for what I believe.

244
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Takahara-san, lunch is ready.

245
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Ah, yeah.

246
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
What are you writing?

247
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
A letter.

248
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You write a lot.

249
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yeah.

250
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'll meet my friends in the pirate ship again.

251
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'll grant his wish.

252
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Why ten years later?

253
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I should have replied that I was here when I got the fan letter.

254
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I suggested that too.

255
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
But Kamome didn't like it.

256
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'm a model for Kamome, so I thought that if I saw myself, I'd be disappointed.

257
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I hope I can become a girl who gets better and is like Kamome, who can pull everyone.

258
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I was a stubborn girl.

259
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
But I did my best.

260
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm getting better little by little.

261
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I can move as much as I can.

262
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Actually, I've been keeping quiet about something.

264
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Before this summer began, Kamome never woke up again.

265
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Thank you.

266
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Takahara-san, I'm glad I came to this island just because I met you.

267
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I've been keeping quiet about something too.

268
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I see.

269
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Kamome and I are going on an adventure on this island.

270
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I wanted to thank him.

271
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I wanted to complete the ship.

272
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I wanted him to see it.

273
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm sure I...

274
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I loved him.

275
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
The next morning.

276
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Big cloth?

277
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yes.

278
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It seems that the old lady hasn't kept it.

279
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I see.

280
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
By the way, I haven't seen Umi-chan.

281
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
She went home yesterday.

282
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
What?

283
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
She didn't say anything.

284
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm lonely.

285
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But I was worried about you.

286
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
What's that?

287
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I've prepared myself so far.

288
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Will they really come?

289
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
If no one comes...

290
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
No, I believe in Kamome's feelings.

291
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Shiroha!

292
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What?

293
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Do you have a big cloth?

294
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What do you use it for?

295
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
A flag.

296
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
That's right.

297
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Shiroha, are you good at drawing?

298
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm good at drawing.

299
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
There are a lot of people.

300
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Did you call them?

301
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
No.

302
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I didn't call them.

303
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Then who?

304
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Kamome.

305
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
What are these people?

306
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Shiroha!

307
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What did you ask for?

308
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I did it, but...

309
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Can I see it?

310
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Please.

311
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
If you have any complaints, please don't hesitate.

312
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
This is...

313
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Great!

314
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
What?

315
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Great!

316
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's amazing!

317
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Thank you.

318
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
No, I'm the one who should thank you.

319
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Kamome.

320
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
If you're still watching this from a distant place,

321
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
this isn't a dream.

322
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's a reality that you've come true.

323
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's a true memory.

324
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm watching.

325
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
You...

326
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Yes?

327
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You've been here all this time.

328
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I wanted to see this ship complete.

329
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Of course.

330
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
But I really shouldn't be here anymore.

331
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I see.

332
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You know, I wanted to go on more adventures.

333
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Like this summer, I went on an adventure on the island with Hairi.

334
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
More...

335
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Let's go on an adventure.

336
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
What?

337
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You promised me that you'd meet me again 10 years later

338
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
and that you'd go on another adventure on this ship.

339
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Yes.

340
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'll go on a trip.

341
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'll ride this ship and cross the sea.

342
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And then...

343
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
And then we'll meet again.

344
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Yes.

345
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Then, it's just the right time.

346
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It's a gift.

347
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Me too?

348
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Of course.

349
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You're the leader.

350
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You're right.

351
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Then, the Higeneko-dan, let's go!

352
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Summer is over again.

353
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'll cross the seven seas and go to see you.

354
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
With love, the pirate Higeneko-dan, Kushima Kamame.

355
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
The End
