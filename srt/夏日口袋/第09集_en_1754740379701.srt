Chapter 3

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,000
What's wrong?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,600
It's rare for Tsumugi to be away at this time.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,440
Did something happen?

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,800
An accident?

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,200
No, no, it can't be.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,280
Maybe Tsumugi suddenly got embarrassed.

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,160
She officially decided to go out with Pairi.

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,600
What?

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,000
I love you, Pairi-san!

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,280
No way!

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,000
I told you I loved you back then!

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,880
Ah!

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,520
I knew it.

15
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,840
I'm sorry!

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,800
I wanted to tell you this after we got together.

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,080
I'm so happy that you two are together.

18
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,720
Please make Tsumugi happy.

19
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,840
Of course.

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,960
But I'm sorry.

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,280
I can't believe that the Tsumugi I'm going to raise is not mine anymore.

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,280
What?

23
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,880
No, Tsumugi's boobs belong to Tsumugi.

24
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,680
It doesn't matter whose boobs it is.

25
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,000
T-The Tsumugi is still sleeping.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,280
I have no choice.

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,440
I'll go pick her up from here.

28
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,400
You said you live in Todai, but where is your real house?

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,480
Huh?

30
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,160
I don't know.

31
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,280
Huh?

32
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,360
Because Tsumugi always meets here and separates here.

33
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,280
Tsumugi always sees her off.

34
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,380
記憶の Ral Sakthis

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,960
So you're telling us what happened?

36
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,960
No, it's nothing but a로

37
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,400
時の快適の時の大きな暮らしが let our imagination moves demek

38
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,380
uration to the sun

39
00:01:50,380 --> 00:02:00,380
The words I wanted to tell you should have been decided

40
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:07,380
But I looked away from the unchanging scenery

41
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:14,380
I wanted a little courage, so I turned away

42
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:19,380
I longed for only the radiance

43
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:26,380
The end of the notebook that continues to write the summer is coming

44
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:36,380
Eventually, on the day I can reach it, I will at least wave my hand with a smile

45
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:43,380
There are things that only can be reached by continuing to walk

46
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:50,380
I'm still searching for the warmth of your warm hand

47
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:57,380
Even if I connect countless kindnesses, I can't reach it

48
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:07,380
Even now, I will repeat myself in the shadow of the summer again

49
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,380
Please excuse me

50
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,380
Yes, yes

51
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,380
I have something to ask you

52
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,380
Oh, I'm glad to hear it

53
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,380
Here, this is a gift

54
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,380
I hope you can reach it soon

55
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,380
It's the power of love

56
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,380
It might be a hidden letter

57
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,380
Hidden letter?

58
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,380
It was a few decades ago

59
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,380
It was a big mess at that time

60
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,380
The blonde girl disappeared

61
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,380
The blonde?

62
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:51,380
My parents and everyone on the island looked everywhere, but they came back

63
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:57,380
At that time, there was someone like you who was desperately looking for it

64
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,380
That was a man from the To-Daimori

65
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,380
To-Daimori?

66
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,380
Is there anyone you know who met the girl who hid the letter?

67
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,380
No, there is no one

68
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:15,380
The last person to know about that girl was Kato, who died the other day

69
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,380
I heard something amazing

70
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,380
It's a hidden letter

71
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,380
Pairi-kun?

72
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,380
Can you see this?

73
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,380
A hairpin?

74
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,380
But this is...

75
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,380
Wait a minute

76
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,380
Wait a minute

77
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,380
It's not

78
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,380
This is an old photo

79
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,380
Hey, Pairi-kun

80
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,380
I don't know

81
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,380
But I'm really curious

82
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,380
I think I saw this somewhere

83
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,380
Look, this is somewhere in front of me

84
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,380
This is the house of the powerhouse

85
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,380
No one lives here now

86
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,380
This is the house of the hairpin

87
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,380
Excuse me

88
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,380
Is there no one here?

89
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,380
Hey, hairpin!

90
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,380
It looks like a girl's room

91
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,380
Pairi-kun, this is...

92
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,380
A hairpin...

93
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,380
I'm going to go to the island school from today

94
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:58,380
Everyone is looking at my eyes and hair and is nervous

95
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,380
So my friend is just a hairpin

96
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,380
Hairpin...

97
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,380
What is that?

98
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,380
Everyone is not talking to me today

99
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,380
They are probably scared

100
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,380
They think it's a hairpin

101
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,380
So I'm going to be brave and call out

102
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,380
It's a hairpin

103
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,380
I'm scared

104
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,380
I'm scared

105
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,380
I'm scared of what my parents say

106
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,380
I took it off

107
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,380
I made a friend

108
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,380
Her name is Kato-san

109
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,380
She is interested in sewing

110
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,380
I was a little happy

111
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,380
That's good, Tsumugi

112
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,380
She has a lot of friends

113
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,380
She is used to the island

114
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,380
She seems to be living a happy life

115
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,380
Tsumugi seems to be running away with the people of the To-Daimori

116
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,380
I decided to go out of this island with that person

117
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,380
I'm sorry to see you in the To-Daimori today

118
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,380
I'm sorry, mom and dad

119
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,380
Thank you for everything on the island

120
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,380
I love you

121
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,380
Are you jealous?

122
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,380
I am

123
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,380
You're so mischievous

124
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:48,380
But what's written here is from decades ago

125
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,380
I wonder if this is what it was like to hide your hair

126
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,380
No, it's not

127
00:07:54,380 --> 00:08:13,560
The old lady from the

128
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,380
This diary has a sequel

129
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,380
What is this?

130
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,380
This is...

131
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,380
I'm scared

132
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,380
Shizuku

133
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,380
The more I look for it, the more I look for it

134
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,380
I feel like I can't see Tsumugi anymore

135
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,380
Sorry, is this okay?

136
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,380
Airi-kun?

137
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,380
I have to go somewhere

138
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,380
I'm sorry

139
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,380
I'm sorry

140
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,380
I'm sorry

141
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,380
You're all missing

142
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,380
I'm missing too

143
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:31,380
What I can do now is just wait for Tsumugi to come back

144
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,380
So...

145
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,380
Tsumugi

146
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,380
This is...

147
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,380
Not Tsumugi's room

148
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,380
What is this?

149
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,380
Where am I?

150
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,380
It won't open

151
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,380
Damn

152
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,380
What is this?

153
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,380
I'm scared

154
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,380
Why?

155
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,380
I was climbing up

156
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,380
What's going on?

157
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,380
Who are you?

158
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,380
Um...

159
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,380
Tsumugi! Where were you?

160
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,380
I was worried

161
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,380
I was here all this time

162
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,380
Here?

163
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:58,380
I looked everywhere but I couldn't find you

164
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,380
You're Tsumugi, right?

165
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:06,380
Yes, I am Tsumugi Vendance

166
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,380
There's no crying child!

167
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,380
What?

168
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,380
There's no bad child!

169
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,380
There's no child who doesn't listen to their parents!

170
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,380
Why did you introduce me to the iron plate?

171
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,380
You're kidding, right?

172
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,380
I'm also a god

173
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,380
I want to go home!

174
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,380
I really want to go home!

175
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,380
Can you really go home with this?

176
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,380
It seems like everyone else was like that

177
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,380
I've never been home so I don't know the truth

178
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:01,380
It's a shame but the person who's trapped in something here can't leave

179
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:08,380
It's a long time that I'll forget what I'm trapped in

180
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,380
Trapped? Then you too...

181
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,380
Do we look alike?

182
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,380
Me and Tsumugi?

183
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:24,380
Yes, we're two different types

184
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,380
But the atmosphere is different

185
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,380
It's lively and if you think about it, it's straight

186
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,380
So I can't take my eyes off it

187
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:36,380
Is that so? I hope you can go home soon

188
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,380
I understand how you feel

189
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:48,380
I'm always separated from my loved ones and my friends

190
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,380
That's the end of the line

191
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:57,380
I couldn't choose at that time

192
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,380
I became scared

193
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:11,380
I decided to leave everything behind to live with my loved ones

194
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:17,380
But I couldn't choose

195
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,380
So I came here when I realized

196
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:30,380
I still think I'm lost

197
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,380
Tsumugi-san...

198
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:36,380
But you came here because you wanted to meet someone, right?

199
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:42,380
If you think about that person strongly, you'll be able to return to the world you were in

200
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,380
If I think about it strongly...

201
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:49,380
Please believe in your lover

202
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,380
That's right

203
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:58,380
It doesn't matter who Tsumugi is or what kind of past she has

204
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,380
I just want to see Tsumugi now

205
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,380
I want to see that smile

206
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,380
I want to hear that song

207
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,380
That song...

208
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,380
It's nostalgic

209
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,380
A horn?

210
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,380
There might be an exit, Tsumugi-san!

211
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:32,380
If I keep saying that, the exit will disappear

212
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,380
Please tell me about Takahara-san

213
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,380
But...

214
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,380
Please take good care of Tsumugi-san

215
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,380
Thank you

216
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,380
What are you doing there?

217
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,380
I'm looking for something

218
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,380
What are you looking for?

219
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,380
Myself

220
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,380
Tsumugi...

221
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,380
The self you were looking for...

222
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,380
Could it be...

223
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,380
This is...

224
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,380
Paringles are invincible, right?

225
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,380
Tsumugi!

226
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:39,380
Airi-kun! Airi-kun! Airi-kun!

227
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,380
Airi-kun!

228
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,380
I'm sorry

229
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,380
I'm sorry

230
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,380
I'm sorry

231
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,380
Where have you been?

232
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,380
Shizuku...

233
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,380
If Tsumugi disappears and you disappear too

234
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,380
I don't know what to do

235
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,380
I'm sorry

236
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,380
Where's Tsumugi?

237
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,380
Airi-kun...

238
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:20,380
I'm so glad... I'm so glad... Airi-san...

239
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,380
Tsumugi...

240
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,380
The day after we parted...

241
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,380
I thought Tsumugi might come back

242
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,380
So I waited at the lighthouse

243
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,380
Shizuku...

244
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,380
Um...

245
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:42,380
Tsumugi! Tsumugi! Tsumugi! Tsumugi!

246
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,380
But...

247
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,380
In exchange for Tsumugi

248
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,380
Airi-kun disappeared this time

249
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,380
I was really worried

250
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,380
I'm sorry

251
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,380
I'm so glad, Airi-san

252
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,380
Tsumugi...

253
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,380
Tsumugi...

254
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,380
Tsumugi...

255
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,380
No, no!

256
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:07,380
I'm going to get tears and runny nose!

257
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,380
It's okay

258
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:16,380
Then, I want you to stay like this for a little longer

259
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,380
Oh, my...

260
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,380
Both of you...

261
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,380
I disappeared for a whole day?

262
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,380
That's right

263
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,380
Where were you?

264
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,380
Where...

265
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,380
That is...

266
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,380
I don't remember

267
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,380
What do you mean?

268
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,380
It's true

269
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,380
I don't remember anything

270
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,380
Umugi?

271
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,380
If you don't remember, it can't be helped

272
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,380
Welcome back

273
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,380
Um...

274
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,380
I'm really sorry

275
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,380
I'm sorry

276
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,380
I was worried about a lot of things

277
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,380
If you're fine, that's fine

278
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,380
Um, where's Umi-chan?

279
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,380
She's tired from worrying and sleeping

280
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,380
Please apologize tomorrow morning

281
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,380
Yes

282
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,380
Tsumugi-chan, it's already late today

283
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,380
Why don't you stay at home?

284
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,380
Oh, thank you

285
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,380
I'm sorry

286
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,380
Airi-san

287
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,380
May I come in?

288
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,380
Yes, please

289
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,380
May I talk to you for a moment?

290
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,380
Um...

291
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,380
I said I was going home

292
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:12,380
But I didn't mean to say that I was going home

293
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,380
Um...

294
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,380
Um...

295
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,380
Um...

296
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,380
Hey, Tsumugi

297
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:24,380
I don't need to hear that

298
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,380
What?

299
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,380
I've decided

300
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:31,380
I'll stay with Tsumugi until the last moment

301
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:36,380
So no matter what I say, no matter what I don't say, I'll stay with you

302
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,380
Airi-san

303
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,380
I want to be with you forever

304
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,380
Please stay with me until the end

305
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,380
I'll be with you

306
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,380
There's something I have to tell you

307
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,380
I met you, Tsumugi Bender-san

308
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,380
What?

309
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,380
I don't remember where I was

310
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,380
But I remember that

311
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,380
I feel like I shouldn't forget

312
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,380
Um, Tsumugi-chan, did you feel well?

313
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,380
Yes, I felt well

314
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,380
Really? That's good

315
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:23,380
Um, the person you've been looking for all this time, is that girl?

316
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,380
Yes, it's Tsumugi-chan

317
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:31,380
When the summer is over, will you go to her place?

318
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,380
That's right

319
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:39,380
Thanks to Airi-san's help, I can go back to Tsumugi-chan

320
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:44,380
I'm glad that you're feeling lonely

321
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,380
I'm in trouble

322
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,380
What?

323
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,380
I feel lonely too

324
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,380
Gyuun, please don't say that

325
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:02,380
I feel lonely too, and when you say that, I feel really troubled

326
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,380
Oh, that's right

327
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,380
This is for Tsumugi

328
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,380
For Tsumugi

329
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:18,380
Shizuku said that the best way to convey your feelings to someone you like is to give them a present

330
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,380
That's Shizuku

331
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,380
Um, can I put it on?

332
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,380
Of course

333
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,380
How is it?

334
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,380
It suits you

335
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,380
It suits you

336
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,380
I can feel it, Airi-san's feelings

337
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:48,380
Until August 31st, a week later, our summer break was about to end

338
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,380
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

339
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,380
I'm sorry

340
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,380
I'm sorry

341
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,380
I'm sorry

342
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,380
I'm sorry

343
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,380
I'm sorry

344
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,380
I'm sorry

345
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,380
I'm sorry

346
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,380
I'm sorry

347
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,380
I'm sorry

348
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,380
I'm sorry

349
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,380
I'm sorry

350
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,380
I'm sorry

351
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,380
I'm sorry

352
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,380
I'm sorry

353
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,380
I'm sorry

354
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,380
I'm sorry

355
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,380
I'm sorry

356
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,380
I'm sorry

357
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,380
I'm sorry

358
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,380
I'm sorry

359
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,380
I'm sorry

360
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,380
I'm sorry

361
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,380
I'm sorry

362
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,380
I'm sorry

363
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,380
I'm sorry

364
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,380
I'm sorry

365
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,380
I'm sorry

366
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,380
I'm sorry

367
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,380
I'm sorry

368
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,380
I'm sorry

369
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,380
I'm sorry

370
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,380
I'm sorry

371
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,380
I'm sorry

372
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,380
I'm sorry

373
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,380
I'm sorry

374
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,380
I'm sorry

375
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,380
I'm sorry

376
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,380
I'm sorry

377
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,380
