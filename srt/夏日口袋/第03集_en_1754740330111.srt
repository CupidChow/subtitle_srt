00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:51,280
END

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I was looking away from the unheard of scenery

3
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I turned away because I wanted a little courage

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I longed for only the white brightness

5
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The end of the notebook that writes the tears is coming

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Eventually, on the day I will arrive, I will at least step on my hands with a smile

7
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
There are things that can only be reached by continuing to walk

8
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm still looking for the warmth of your warm hands

9
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Because I can't reach you even if I connect the kindness of many

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I will repeat myself in the shadow of summer again and again

11
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Hmm, delicious!

12
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But where did you get the crab?

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I got it at the harbor

14
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I see, you can get expensive crabs like that

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
If you have any requests, I will put them in the fried rice

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's a pre-order for fried rice, right?

17
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Of course!

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The black one is still good

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
No, I have to work soon

20
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I have to share what I need with what I don't need

21
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What are you doing?

22
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Umi, go out today too

23
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Hi, I'm the only one on this island

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's such a nice weather, it's such a waste to go around the house

25
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I thought about it for a long time, why don't we have a summer vacation and try an adventure?

26
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But adventures are not old

27
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Then let's have an adult adventure

28
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
An adult adventure?

29
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Chapter 3

30
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You look like you don't like it.

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I don't!

32
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I don't know what you imagined, but...

33
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's like fishing for a rodent.

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
A rodent?

35
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
A rodent?

36
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It looks like there's a bug.

37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
A white-leaved one?

38
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Raider!

39
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Raider!

40
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Raider!

41
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Raider!

42
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Raider!

43
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Raider!

44
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Um...

45
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm done for!

46
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Ah...

47
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm sorry! I was wrong just now.

48
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Reigen Yachikonare...

49
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Reigen Yachikonare!

50
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What?

51
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Reigen Yachikonare!

52
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Rei...

53
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
There's this kind of magic!

54
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm not doing this kind of thing.

55
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's just a normal thing on this island.

56
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I was just saying that as a greeting to the river god.

57
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
If you're from this island, then it's not something to be ashamed of.

58
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You came from somewhere else, so it must have been very unusual.

59
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This is...

60
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's not something I'm doing. It's just a normal thing on this island.

61
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Reigen Yachikonare!

62
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Re... Reigen Yachikonare!

63
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
No!

64
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Reigen Yachikonare!

65
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Reigen Yachikonare!

66
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Reigen Yachikonare!

67
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Anna...

68
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Do you like manga?

69
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I like manga, but I hate you!

70
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
No...

71
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Even if I don't have to bring this up...

72
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I have to apologize next time.

73
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Hm?

74
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Um...

75
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Huh?

76
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Huh?

77
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What?

78
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Oh...

79
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I was wondering what's wrong.

80
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Oh, I got caught.

81
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Can I come in?

82
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Ouch!

83
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Oh!

84
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Thank you, Airi.

85
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Huh?

86
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Um...

87
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Did we meet somewhere?

88
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
No, it was our first meeting.

89
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
But my name...

90
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You're more famous than I thought you were.

91
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Kusima Kamome.

92
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
My name...

93
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's weird that you only know my name, right?

94
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Kusima Kamome...

95
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Kamome...

96
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Hm?

97
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Don't call me that when I'm drawing.

98
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
No, when you call me Kamome, I want to say,

99
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I want to say,

100
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I want to cry.

101
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
That's a sea cat.

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Huh?

103
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Then how do you cry, Kamome?

104
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Um...

105
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Like,

106
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Like,

107
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Like,

108
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Like,

109
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Like,

110
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Like,

111
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Like,

112
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Like,

113
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Sorry, sorry, I just...

114
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Then, sorry in the meantime.

115
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Hm?

116
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Can you do me a favor?

117
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Um...

118
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's okay to help with the suitcase.

119
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yeah.

120
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Why are you riding it?

121
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Be careful, be careful!

122
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Jeez...

123
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You have a good body.

124
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Hey.

125
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Is this road straight?

126
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yeah.

127
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Well, it's not that bad.

128
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Hey.

129
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What's in this suitcase?

130
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I don't know.

131
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I won't tell you.

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Ri.

133
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Humming

134
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Humming

135
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What was that?

136
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I think I've heard it somewhere.

137
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's a song from the media charlotte.

138
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's an old song, right?

139
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yeah.

140
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's pretty old.

141
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Takahara-san?

142
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Hey, Umi-chan.

143
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
What are you doing?

144
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I don't know.

145
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I think you're putting on a suitcase with a girl on it.

146
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's kind of like a shul, right?

147
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Maybe you want to ride it too?

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm not a child!

149
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Hey!

150
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Hm?

151
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
What?

152
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The kimono girl is falling down!

153
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
She's so hungry she can't move!

154
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
There are a lot of weird people in this island.

155
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
There's a slope ahead, so be careful.

156
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
This is dangerous.

157
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Get off for now.

158
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Okay, try to slide.

159
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
No, it's dangerous.

160
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's okay.

161
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Here we go!

162
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Hey!

163
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What?

164
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm going to take this balance!

165
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Can you turn it around?

166
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm fine.

167
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm going to take this!

168
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Kamome!

169
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Ah!

170
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This is...

171
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
from back then?

172
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
That's right.

173
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's from here.

174
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Take your marks!

175
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It starts from there!

176
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Too bad.

177
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Nothing started.

178
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
That's why it ended.

179
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What happened back then?

180
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Are you okay?

181
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm okay.

182
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
What are you doing here?

183
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm sorry.

184
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But thank you.

185
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You jumped in so I wouldn't be able to swim.

186
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
This cat?

187
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's a symbol of the Higeneko family.

188
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Higeneko family?

189
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What is it?

190
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I think I've seen it somewhere.

191
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What?

192
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It feels so cool!

193
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Hahaha!

194
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Oh my, you're wet.

195
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You're right.

196
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's so hot, it might dry up.

197
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Yeah, this is...

198
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I saw the sky.

199
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It was blue.

200
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Not the underwear.

201
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I think the underwear was blue too.

202
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
What's wrong?

203
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Oh, it's blue.

204
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Blue?

205
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The sky.

206
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Oh, it's really blue.

207
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yeah.

208
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I've been to this island before.

209
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
When was that?

210
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It was a long time ago.

211
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
When I was about the size of this suitcase.

212
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Oh, that's nostalgic.

213
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It was so nostalgic.

214
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
During the summer vacation,

215
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
there was a summer camp where kids from all over the country gathered.

216
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It was a summer camp.

217
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It was a summer camp.

218
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I was there.

219
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Oh, so you came to get your memories back.

220
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I guess so.

221
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
What did you come here for?

222
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Me?

223
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I...

224
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'll guess.

225
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Huh?

226
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Well...

227
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Adventure?

228
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Since it's summer vacation,

229
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
why don't you try an adventure?

230
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Adventure?

231
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'd like to try it if I could.

232
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Well, there's no adventure on this small island.

233
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
How about that?

234
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Let's go!

235
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
This way!

236
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Hey, where are we going?

237
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
We're going to find an adventure!

238
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
How far are we going?

239
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You'll know when you get there.

240
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's not an answer.

241
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Sorry, wait a minute.

242
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Shiroha.

243
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Sorry, I scared you.

244
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What?

245
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I wanted to apologize to you.

246
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Well...

247
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Do you have something you want to buy?

248
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
That's...

249
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'll go buy it.

250
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Is that okay?

251
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What do you want to buy for your apology?

252
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Watermelon bar.

253
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Okay, wait a minute.

254
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Here you are.

255
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
What's this?

256
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Melon bar.

257
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I sold out on watermelon bars.

258
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'll give it to you.

259
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
But the money...

260
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I know.

261
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Really?

262
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You can't just let a cute girl like that

263
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
go into your house.

264
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Do you want it?

265
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
No, thanks.

266
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'll buy it.

267
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Do you want it?

268
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Is that okay?

269
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I made you wait.

270
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Then I'll buy it.

271
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Thanks.

272
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
We're here.

273
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Where are we?

274
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
We're in elementary school.

275
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
That's dangerous.

276
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's okay.

277
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Oh!

278
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Airi.

279
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Come here, Airi.

280
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It's a structural defect.

281
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
The girl's child will climb up.

282
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
That's sharp.

283
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Then next is this way.

284
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Where are we going?

285
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Over there.

286
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's the beginning of the adventure.

287
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Hey, be careful.

288
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's okay.

289
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
We're almost there.

290
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm sure the lock on this window is broken.

291
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Can I come in without permission?

292
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Sure.

293
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Hurry up.

294
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
What's in here?

295
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
There it is.

296
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Thank goodness.

297
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
We still have it.

298
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
This is it.

299
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Yes, the beginning of the adventure.

300
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I climbed up here at the end of summer with my friends.

301
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
That's how I made a flag.

302
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's a mark for when we get together.

303
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
That picture...

304
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It's our team flag.

305
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
That's the summer camp we were talking about.

306
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yes, my friends.

307
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
We went on an adventure with this flag that summer.

308
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
So we hid the secret with the flag.

309
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Secret?

310
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Is that okay?

311
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Sure.

312
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Ten years later, when we get together again,

313
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
we'll seal the secret of this island that we found on this day in this treasure chest.

314
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Is that in this box?

315
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Yes.

316
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
The lock is on it.

317
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'll break it.

318
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Hey, hey.

319
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
So, what did you find?

320
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
The secret.

321
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Hailey, the view from here is the best.

322
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Did I come from the other side of the sea?

323
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
The end

324
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Thank you for being with me today.

325
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Yeah.

326
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Did you have fun?

327
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Well, yeah.

328
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'll take you on a more special adventure next time.

329
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
A special adventure?

330
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yeah.

331
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
See you.

332
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
See you.

333
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Adventure, huh.

334
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Adventure is a small thing,

335
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
but it seems that there was a treasure hidden in the attic of the elementary school

336
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
that reached the edge of the pool.

337
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm excited about that.

338
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It was an adventure.

339
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
What's wrong?

340
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm tired.

341
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
What?

342
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It seems a little difficult to go home while dragging this.

343
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Why don't you leave it there?

344
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
That's a problem.

345
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
So,

346
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'll push it.

347
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I'll take your time.

348
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
You're right.

349
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
How do I get to your house from here?

350
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Just go straight.

351
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Straight is the harbor.

352
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Yeah, heading to the harbor.

353
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Do you want to get on the boat?

354
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Yeah, that's the place.

355
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Hmm.

356
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You're not going home?

357
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Well,

358
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
it's not like I'm going home.

359
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
What's with that riddle?

360
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's okay.

361
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Where do you live?

362
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Huh?

363
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I think it was over there.

364
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm taking care of Kato's house.

365
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So it was the other way around.

366
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Was it bad?

367
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm just bored, so it's okay.

368
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You're so kind.

369
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Airi, a good guy.

370
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
What's that?

371
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It means the same thing.

372
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You're welcome.

373
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'm sorry.

374
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm sorry.

375
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'm sorry.

376
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I'm sorry.

377
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'm sorry.

378
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm sorry.

379
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I'm sorry.

380
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I'm sorry.

381
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'm sorry.

382
