1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,120
Now, I...

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,600
You...

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,380
...?!

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,800
When I looked at you...

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,840
Ah...

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,920
æŽ‰ed...

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,060
I could see the echo over my once small, covered face.

8
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:05,060
The end of the sound of writing the summer is coming

9
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:15,060
On the day I will come, I will shake my hand with a smile

10
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:22,060
There is something that can only be reached by walking

11
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:28,060
I'm still searching for the warmth of your warm hand

12
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:35,060
No matter how many kindnesses I connect, I can't reach you

13
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:46,060
Even now, I will repeat myself in the shadow of the summer

14
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,060
You can see the City Hall?

15
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:01,060
After all, I was made to be confused after that, but what was that bell?

16
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,060
What's your impression?

17
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,060
It's not delicious

18
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,060
What did you say?

19
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,060
Sorry, my instinct spilled

20
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,060
I'm not following

21
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:15,060
Aho-chan will come before noon, so I'm waiting for you to eat something cold

22
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,060
Thank you

23
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,060
This is the last one

24
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,060
Wait a minute

25
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,060
Do you want to ask Aho?

26
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,060
Why?

27
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,060
He seems to be with you a lot lately

28
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,060
What is the role of Soraka family?

29
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,060
I don't know

30
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,060
Even though it's about the island?

31
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,060
During the festival of the mountains, you can't enter the mountain at night

32
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,060
Aho said that too

33
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:03,060
There was a house called the Gosan family on Torishiro Island

34
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,060
Soraka family and Narse family

35
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:12,060
I don't remember the other one, but it seems that Soraka family has been playing a role for a long time

36
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,060
Wait, didn't you just say Narse family?

37
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,060
It's Shiroha's house, right?

38
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,060
It's an old story, but it doesn't have any role now

39
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:29,060
The sky's sky, the sea's Narse, the mountains

40
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,060
It's rare that Shiroha is with someone

41
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,060
It's about last night

42
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,060
What? I slept early last night

43
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,060
You saw an illusion, right?

44
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,060
Illusion?

45
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,060
I saw that Aho was fantastic, and it was beautiful and luxurious

46
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,060
Beautiful and luxurious?

47
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:10,060
I'm not happy to hear that

48
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,060
It's Aho

49
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,060
I think so

50
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,060
If I were you

51
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,060
Can you lie to me a little more?

52
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,060
I can't be fooled

53
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,060
It's not a lie

54
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,060
It's true

55
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,060
It's really true

56
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,060
Anyway, you don't enter the mountain at night anymore

57
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,060
This is the secret of this island

58
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,060
You're going to cry at this timing

59
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:42,060
Well, I've figured out why you lack sleep

60
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,060
Oh, no, the battery's going to run out

61
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,060
I'll lend you my lap

62
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,060
Then I'll sleep a little

63
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,060
Seriously?

64
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,060
Please

65
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,060
I'm going home, Tenzan

66
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,060
You don't have to buy a book

67
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:19,060
It's a man's friendship to pretend not to see here

68
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,060
See you, Dachiko

69
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,060
Be happy

70
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,060
Tenzan

71
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,060
Thank you for the meal

72
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,060
What?

73
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,060
It's better not to get close to the mountain at night

74
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,060
That's what Aho said

75
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,060
I think that's better

76
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,060
Sleep

77
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,060
I really sleep anywhere

78
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,060
This is a dangerous guy

79
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,060
What?

80
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,060
What's this situation?

81
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,060
It's so soft

82
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,060
It smells good

83
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,060
What's this?

84
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,060
Please, take your time

85
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,060
Good morning

86
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,060
Why? Why?

87
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,060
I want a girl at first

88
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,060
Calm down

89
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,060
I don't hate being a princess

90
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,060
But this is a studio

91
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,060
So calm down

92
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,060
You're hugging me in one step

93
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,060
Let go

94
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,060
You let go

95
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,060
I'm sorry

96
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,060
It's okay

97
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,060
Did you sleep at night last night?

98
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,060
Well, that's it

99
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,060
Then tonight?

100
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,060
I'll say it again

101
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,060
Don't come into the mountain at night

102
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,060
I'm doing this for you

103
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,060
But she came

104
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,060
Aho?

105
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:57,060
By the way, Aho touched this butterfly

106
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,060
Why did you do this?

107
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,060
Give it back

108
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,060
Your wife

109
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,060
Your daughter

110
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,060
Why did I survive?

111
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:12,060
Please let me go from this pain

112
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,060
I'm going now

113
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,060
I'll go to you

114
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,060
My body moves on its own

115
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,060
What's this?

116
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,060
But with this

117
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,060
I can relax

118
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,060
Hailey!

119
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,060
Idiot!

120
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,060
You said you shouldn't come into the mountain at night

121
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,060
Aho, I...

122
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:53,060
Because you touched the butterfly, other people's memories were mixed up

123
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,060
What is a butterfly?

124
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:04,060
The remains of the person who left the butterfly's shape and regret

125
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,060
I don't know

126
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,060
I don't know

127
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,060
I don't know

128
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,060
I don't know

129
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,060
I don't know

130
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,060
I don't know

131
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,060
The remains of the person who left the butterfly's shape and regret

132
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,060
If you touch it, you will experience the memories of that person

133
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,060
This butterfly is a person with a strong sensitivity

134
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,060
It's not an animal

135
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:27,060
Aho, what is your role?

136
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:33,060
Gathering lost city leaders and leading them to the place they should go

137
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,060
That's Sorakado's role

138
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,060
If you come this far, you can go home alone

139
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,060
Aho, you're not going home yet?

140
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,060
I'm still on duty

141
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:47,060
You know the mountain course at night, right?

142
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,060
Don't come any closer

143
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,060
Wait a minute!

144
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,060
What?

145
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,060
You touched the butterfly, right?

146
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,060
Are you okay?

147
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:02,060
I've been touching it all the time, so I'm in good shape

148
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,060
That's your role too?

149
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,060
A nightmare?

150
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,060
I have a memory that I have to find

151
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:14,060
You have to find something dangerous?

152
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:27,060
Hey, can I get a little time tomorrow?

153
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,060
Here

154
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,060
Aho, I'm coming in

155
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,060
Excuse me

156
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,060
Here you are, Ai

157
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,060
Ai?

158
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,060
Yes, Sorakado Ai

159
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,060
My twin sister

160
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,060
It's Ai

161
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,060
Today is Ai's birthday

162
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,060
Probably a celebration

163
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,060
Today, a friend came to see you

164
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,060
Do you remember what we talked about before?

165
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,060
Look, the relatives of the deceased Kato's grandmother

166
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,060
Ai had an accident a while ago

167
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,060
She's been sleeping since then

168
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,060
Well

169
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:25,060
You said last night, right?

170
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,060
You have a memory that you have to find

171
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:32,060
That's the memory of Ai

172
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,060
On this island

173
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:40,060
There is a strange butterfly story that woke up people who had been sleeping for a long time

174
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,060
Kato's grandmother told me

175
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,060
My grandmother?

176
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:49,060
It may be a story to cheer me up

177
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:54,060
But when I think about the role of Sorakado family and the mayor

178
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,060
I don't think it's a lie

179
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,060
So I was playing the role and I touched the mayor

180
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,060
I'm looking for the memory of Ai

181
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,060
Are you sleepy?

182
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:10,060
Sorry, can I sleep a little?

183
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,060
Yeah, of course

184
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,060
Wake me up in about 30 minutes

185
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:23,060
I'm sorry

186
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:27,060
I'm sorry

187
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:31,060
I'm sorry

188
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:36,060
I'm sorry

189
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:40,060
Good evening

190
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,060
I'm also praying

191
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:46,060
I told you not to go into the mountains

192
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,060
I was told, but I didn't say I wouldn't go in

193
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,060
Why don't you understand?

194
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:55,060
It's really dangerous to look for the mayor

195
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,060
That's why

196
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,060
If you're doing something dangerous

197
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:02,060
I thought I should at least be near

198
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,060
Well

199
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,060
That means

200
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,060
I fell in love

201
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,060
I think so

202
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,060
I think you're in love at least

203
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,060
What?

204
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,060
Are you serious?

205
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,060
Is it a trouble?

206
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,060
At least

207
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,060
I'm a little shocked

208
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:27,060
I can't care about that right now

209
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:31,060
I can only think about looking for the mayor of Ai

210
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,060
Then two people are better than one

211
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:40,060
The island people are not in the mountains at night

212
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,060
I don't need them, but I'm not an island person

213
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:47,060
That's why I can help you

214
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,060
I understand

215
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:57,060
Even if I say no, they'll come after me

216
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:01,060
In return, promise me you won't leave me

217
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,060
I understand

218
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:09,060
I will never leave you

219
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:20,060
That's how the search for the mayor of Ai began

220
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,060
Fluttering

221
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:41,060
I'm looking for the light

222
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:47,060
I'm going to do a lot of things

223
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:50,060
I chased after

224
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:54,060
What I really want to know

225
00:14:54,060 --> 00:15:00,060
Someone tell me where you are

226
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:08,060
Let me sleep a little more

227
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:14,060
I'm not ready yet

228
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,060
So wake me up gently

229
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:24,060
I'm lost in the beginning of the journey

230
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,060
I want to be strong at least

231
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:34,060
I'm lost in the beginning of the journey

232
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,060
Lost standing flowers

233
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,060
The sky is your home

234
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,060
The standing flower tree

235
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,060
If it's true, I'll put a flower before summer

236
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,060
This tree is a little late

237
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,060
A little off the map

238
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,060
A little off the map

239
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:59,060
It seems that it has become a sacred tree as it is in the borderline with the world

240
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,060
Only while this tree is blooming

241
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,060
The mayor of the city cannot be guided by the fishing road

242
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,060
That's the period of the mountain's rejuvenation

243
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,060
Yeah

244
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:32,060
So I made my face red and shut up

245
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:37,060
Hey, what's the effect of talking to Ai who's always asleep?

246
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,060
Hmm? It's like sleep learning

247
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:45,060
When Ai wakes up, he'll remember what I said

248
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,060
I wonder if I'll always be with you

249
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,060
Oh, that's right

250
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,060
Since it's a long time, why don't you tell Ai something?

251
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,060
Then since it's a long time, I'll introduce myself

252
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,060
I'm Aono's

253
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,060
I'm Takahara, her lover, Haili

254
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,060
Why are you her lover?

255
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,060
Not yet

256
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:08,060
I thought I'd go out to sleep with sleep learning

257
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:14,060
Well, I'm glad you said that

258
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:18,060
I like you too

259
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,060
Aoi

260
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,060
But I'm sorry

261
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:27,060
Ai is still asleep, but I can't be happy

262
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:33,060
It's a bad thing to say, but I want you to wait until Ai wakes up

263
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,060
I'm sorry

264
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:41,060
I'm looking for Ai's memories, I'm no longer a helper

265
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:45,060
If Ai wakes up, she'll be able to be Aoi's girlfriend

266
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,060
Then that's my goal

267
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,060
I wonder if that's going to happen

268
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,060
Yeah, I'm getting motivated

269
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,060
Kyoko, I have something to ask you

270
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,060
What is it?

271
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:13,060
I heard that there was a strange fairy tale that woke up people who were sleeping on this island

272
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,060
About Ichi-e-cho?

273
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,060
No way, there's a book left?

274
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,060
It seems so

275
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:22,060
Kyoko asked me to get it out of the cave

276
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:26,060
I see, I'm convinced if it's Kato's grandmother's cave

277
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,060
I'll come home tomorrow

278
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,060
Yeah, I'm going

279
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,060
I'm getting motivated tonight

280
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,060
Yeah, let's do our best

281
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,060
I'm sleepy

282
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,060
It looks like it's time to reach the limit

283
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,060
Not yet

284
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,060
Inari, next

285
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,060
Let's go back together

286
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,060
That would be good

287
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,060
Huh? Seriously?

288
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,060
Huh, did I say something?

289
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,060
Probably, your true feelings leaked

290
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,060
What? No, it's not like that!

291
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,060
Here, outside! No matter how much you say it

292
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:08,060
But... I need to put the pillow on first...

293
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,060
Sorry, it seems like it didn't leak.

294
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:15,060
But I know it's the limit, so let's go home.

295
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,060
Y-Yeah...

296
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,060
The next day

297
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,060
Demon King Ensatsu Koryuha!

298
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:39,060
Eh? Demon King... Ensatsu...

299
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,060
What are you doing?

300
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,060
Umi-chan...

301
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:46,060
I woke you up so many times, but you're not having breakfast anymore.

302
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,060
Sorry... Why didn't I wake you up?

303
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,060
Because you're always playing around.

304
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,060
The City Police Chief?

305
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,060
Hi, Riku.

306
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,060
Yes?

307
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,060
We have a visitor.

308
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,060
U-Um...

309
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,060
Sorry to bother you.

310
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,060
Why are you so nervous?

311
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,060
It's my first time entering a boy's room.

312
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:22,060
And... I suddenly had to put the pillow on...

313
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,060
Wait!

314
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,060
Kyoko-san and Umi-chan are here, and what am I supposed to do?

315
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,060
Ah! That's right!

316
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:35,060
Anyway, this is the book Kyoko-san found for me.

317
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:39,060
It's too old, I couldn't read what it says.

318
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,060
The Book of the Tenpo Period

319
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,060
The Tenpo Period...

320
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,060
You know it?

321
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:52,060
When you touch the City Police Chief, you experience his memories.

322
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,060
That's why you can gain a lot of knowledge.

323
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,060
Isn't that amazing?

324
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:00,060
I told you before, right? I'm pretty knowledgeable.

325
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,060
The Book of the Tenpo Period

326
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,060
No way!

327
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:09,060
It says how to restore the City Police Chief to his sleeping body!

328
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,060
Really?

329
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,060
I've been looking for this knowledge for so long!

330
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,060
I did it!

331
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,060
A-Ao!

332
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:20,060
You're getting hit by a lot of things!

333
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,060
Sorry!

334
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,060
I think I got a little too excited.

335
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,060
Well, I'm glad, so it's fine.

336
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,060
So, what's the solution?

337
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,060
Ah, um...

338
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,060
I'll find the City Police Chief of Love...

339
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,060
and go to the City of Lo.

340
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,060
City of Lo?

341
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:44,060
Anyway, if I can find the City Police Chief of Love, I'll solve everything!

342
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,060
That's right.

343
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,060
Airi, thank you.

344
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:03,060
The Book of the Tenpo Period

345
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:32,060
Even if I try to rotate the world

346
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:39,060
I can't remember the name of the song you were told

347
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:47,060
Rain is so strange on a sunny day

348
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:54,060
Even though I played a short phrase

349
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:59,060
Even the evening sun is reflected

350
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:04,060
I can't remember the melody

351
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:11,060
Repeating my boring everyday life

352
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:20,060
Summer is coming, I hide my tears and my true self

353
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:26,060
Since when did we forget?

354
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:29,060
A moment

355
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:36,060
From the clear sky, I shake it off
