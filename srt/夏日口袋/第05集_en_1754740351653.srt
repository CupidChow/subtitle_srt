1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
If I'm with you, I can go anywhere.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What are you singing?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Wheeze!

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
What's Wheeze?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It means the same in English.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Does it mean the same?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You sang without knowing?

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Huh?

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Is it a title that means the same?

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That's weird.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If it's a title, why don't we decide our team name?

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Team name?

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Oh, then we've already thought about it.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Ta-da!

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What's that?

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's a cat with a beard.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So we've decided.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Our team name is Cat with a beard, Kamome!

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Don't put Kamome in.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Then it's Cat with a beard.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Oh!

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Oh!

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Oh!

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Kamome!

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Kamome!

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's heavy.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Hey, Kamome, wake up.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
They're going to kill me!

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I won't!

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I won't let you get away!

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I won't let you get away!

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I won't let you get away!

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I won't let you get away!

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I won't let you get away!

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I won't let you get away!

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I won't let you get away!

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I won't let you get away!

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I won't let you get away!

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I won't let you get away!

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I won't let you get away!

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I won't let you get away!

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I won't let you get away!

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I won't let you get away!

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I won't let you get away!

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Arm!

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I won't let you get away!

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I won't let you get away!

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I won't let you get away!

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I won't let you get away!

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I won't let you get away!

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I won't let you get away!

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I won't let you get away!

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I won't let you get away!

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I won't let you get away!

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,440
Good food.

56
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,480
Good camping equipment that Ryoichi-kun borrowed.

57
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,120
Go-ren, Takahara, go!

58
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,120
Are your arms okay now?

59
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,640
Yeah, just like that.

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,960
Then let's go on an adventure to find the pirate ship!

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,560
So, how do we proceed from here?

62
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,400
Let's see...

63
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,720
Over there!

64
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,480
That's...

65
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,920
This is the starting point.

66
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,640
It looks like it.

67
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,800
Was it Wiz?

68
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,640
I've heard that song before.

69
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,720
Right?

70
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,360
Sorry for walking so late.

71
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,680
It's hard to pull a suitcase on the tracks, right?

72
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,360
Not really.

73
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,160
I made it a mountain type before I went out.

74
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,520
I-Is that so?

75
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,680
Am I the original?

76
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,040
No, it's fine.

77
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,160
I see.

78
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,920
Let's go.

79
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,120
I remember...

80
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,800
I remember causing trouble to everyone back then.

81
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,040
I'm the only one walking late.

82
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,480
I see. But don't worry.

83
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,400
Huh?

84
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,160
We can slowly remember things while we go, right?

85
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,600
Heidi...

86
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,560
Heidi is a good person!

87
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,040
Stop it, you...

88
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,600
Wow...

89
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,720
It really was there.

90
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,880
The meant for walking in snack time was actually чтобыAU15~!

91
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,680
Heidi isading right into it!

92
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:26,260
A simple escape is most avecon to that.

93
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,260
I see.

94
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:32,200
You're so

95
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,200
excited!

96
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
Is there a cave ahead of this track?

97
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,200
I wish I could say that.

98
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,200
It's hot.

99
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,200
Are you okay?

100
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:44,200
Take a little break in the shade.

101
00:05:45,100 --> 00:06:09,020
Kamome?

102
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,880
Hey!

103
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,780
Kamome!

104
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,780
It's so hot.

105
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,780
Hey, how long are we going to walk?

106
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,780
Kamone-kun! Hurry up!

107
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:33,780
Sorry. I'll go while enjoying the scenery.

108
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,780
You go ahead.

109
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,780
Isn't that heavy? I'll hold it.

110
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,780
No, I'll hold it myself.

111
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,780
No, I'll hold it myself.

112
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,780
Don't be a mess.

113
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,780
No!

114
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,780
Come on.

115
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,780
Stop it!

116
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,780
You...

117
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,780
Go ahead.

118
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,780
I don't want to cause trouble, so go ahead.

119
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,780
Hayri?

120
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,780
Hey, Hayri.

121
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,780
Hey, Takahara Hayri-kun.

122
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,780
Are you okay? You were kind of lost.

123
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,780
No, where were you?

124
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:20,780
I was following you all the way behind you.

125
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,780
I see.

126
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:36,780
I've walked a lot, but I wonder if I can still reach you.

127
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,780
If I can't find you walking this much...

128
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,780
A cave!

129
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,780
A cave...

130
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,780
There it is!

131
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,780
Yeah!

132
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,780
So noisy.

133
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,780
Ouch.

134
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,780
Hey, are you okay?

135
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,780
Does your leg hurt?

136
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,780
Yeah, but I'm okay. It'll be healed soon.

137
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,780
You're kidding!

138
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:26,780
Didn't you hurt since this afternoon?

139
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:32,780
You didn't give me a suitcase because you used it as a cane, right?

140
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,780
Yeah.

141
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,780
Why was I so quiet?

142
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,780
Good morning.

143
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,780
You're making me do something dirty!

144
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,780
I'm not.

145
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,780
Anyway, did you sleep well?

146
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,780
Thank you.

147
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,780
Hey, can I ask you something?

148
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,780
I slept well, but I sweated a lot.

149
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,780
Yeah, me too.

150
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:09,780
And there was a small well right there.

151
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,780
I see.

152
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:17,780
So I thought I'd go and take a look.

153
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:22,780
The End

154
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,780
Oh, a water sound?

155
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,780
I wonder what it is.

156
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,780
Just kidding.

157
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,780
Are you okay?

158
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,780
There was something!

159
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,780
A big one!

160
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,780
It was there.

161
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,780
It was huge.

162
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,780
What? What's there?

163
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,780
The rock there.

164
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:03,780
Maybe this is the place where he used to sleep.

165
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,780
You were excited because you were there.

166
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,780
I see. I was excited because I was there.

167
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,780
No, it's not about me!

168
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,780
No!

169
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,780
You didn't see it, did you?

170
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,780
What?

171
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,780
Well, a lot of things.

172
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,780
Oh, I didn't see it.

173
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,780
You're lying.

174
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,780
I saw it! I saw the water monkey!

175
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,780
What did you see?

176
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,780
What?

177
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,780
There it is!

178
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,780
The mysterious man Mugoh!

179
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:02,780
It's hard to say now, but isn't it dangerous to go into a cave?

180
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:07,780
Yeah, but you can't come here and worry about it.

181
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,780
I'm worried about it.

182
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,780
I'll go alone.

183
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,780
I knew you'd say that.

184
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,780
It's the same as before.

185
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,780
What? The same as before?

186
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,780
No, it's nothing.

187
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,780
We can go on like this.

188
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,780
I think so.

189
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:36,780
There's a place that's 300 meters from the entrance that's suddenly narrow.

190
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,780
Here?

191
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,780
Yeah, here.

192
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:47,780
If you go through here, you'll get to a little wider place.

193
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:53,780
Here! You can go through here!

194
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,780
I'll go first.

195
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,780
Yeah.

196
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,780
Have I ever come here?

197
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,780
Wow!

198
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,780
Which way do we go?

199
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:22,780
Over there. There's a river over there.

200
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,780
I got it.

201
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,780
Are your feet okay?

202
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,780
Why?

203
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,780
I just thought so.

204
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:41,780
I think you're pulling that suitcase because your feet are bad.

205
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,780
Why?

206
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,780
I'm fine.

207
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:50,780
If my feet are bad, I can't come here.

208
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,780
I see.

209
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,780
Then why are you pulling that?

210
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:59,780
I'm not going to tell you.

211
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,780
No, I want to ask you.

212
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,780
You're a friend who's been on an adventure together, right?

213
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,780
Adventure is dangerous.

214
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,780
If you get caught up in it, it'll be a bother to everyone.

215
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:15,780
Well, even if I tell everyone, it's just you and me.

216
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:22,780
Actually, my feet have been hurting for a long time.

217
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,780
Especially on cold days like mornings and nights.

218
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,780
I see.

219
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,780
I'm sorry. Please be quiet.

220
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,780
I'm sorry. Please be quiet.

221
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,780
Are you sick because you were hospitalized?

222
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:41,780
I'm not usually walking.

223
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:48,780
Sometimes I can't breathe, I get sick, and I can't get any strength in my body.

224
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,780
Don't be silly.

225
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:54,780
Why are you doing this?

226
00:13:54,780 --> 00:14:00,780
I'm sorry. I was in a good mood, so I thought I was okay.

227
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,780
I'll go home in the morning.

228
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,780
No!

229
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,780
Don't be stupid.

230
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,780
Are you going to go into the cave?

231
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,780
Please.

232
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:15,780
I don't want to go back because I asked you to.

233
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,780
I thought you'd say that.

234
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:23,780
Well, if you come this far, you'll go back and forth.

235
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,780
Thank you.

236
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,780
Let's take a break.

237
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,780
Yeah.

238
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,780
Hey.

239
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,780
Why are you on this island?

240
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,780
Why all of a sudden?

241
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,780
Because I feel like you're always thinking about me.

242
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:46,780
You said you were here to be healed.

243
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,780
So you're hurt?

244
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,780
Well...

245
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,780
Why?

246
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:55,780
Why do you have to talk about personal things like that?

247
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,780
Because I want to know. I don't have any secret work.

248
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,780
Oh, my God.

249
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,780
I was defeated in a club.

250
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,780
You were defeated?

251
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,780
I betrayed the expectations of others.

252
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,780
And then you ran away?

253
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,780
I ran away...

254
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,780
Well, that's about it.

255
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,780
I see.

256
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,780
You couldn't meet the expectations.

257
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,780
But it's amazing that you can get expectations in the first place.

258
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,780
That's right.

259
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,780
It's hard to betray that much.

260
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,780
That's right.

261
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,780
It's hard to betray expectations.

262
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,780
Hey, can't you say something more meaningful?

263
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,780
Oh, sorry.

264
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,780
No, that was about me.

265
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,780
Not about you.

266
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,780
I'm expecting something.

267
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,780
I didn't mean to do that.

268
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:14,780
But as the goal is getting closer, I'm getting closer to the expectation.

269
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,780
About what?

270
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,780
I can meet everyone.

271
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:21,780
There's still a pirate ship ahead of this cave.

272
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,780
And someone else is coming with me.

273
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:29,780
I'm expecting someone to be waiting for me.

274
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:34,780
But to be honest, I don't think anyone's there.

275
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:38,780
I've been sick since I was a kid.

276
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,780
I've been in the hospital all the time.

277
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,780
I don't remember playing in the summer vacation.

278
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:49,780
That's why I only care about this memory.

279
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:53,780
But I know that's not what everyone thinks.

280
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,780
That summer became one of many memories.

281
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,780
I was buried, I was forgotten.

282
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:05,780
But it's just one of my treasures.

283
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,780
That's why I'm particular about it.

284
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,780
Well then, let's go.

285
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,780
Wait a minute.

286
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,780
A pirate ship.

287
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,780
I-It's okay.

288
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,780
I'll change the battery.

289
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,780
Kamoe!

290
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,780
Kamoe!

291
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,780
Kamoe!

292
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,780
Hailey!

293
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,780
Hailey!

294
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,780
Hailey!

295
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,780
Hey, Hailey!

296
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,780
It's okay.

297
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,780
The destination is just a little further.

298
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,780
It's okay.

299
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,780
I'll take you.

300
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,780
I'll take you.

301
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:21,780
If I'm with you, I can go anywhere.

302
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:28,780
I don't have to go anywhere.

303
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:39,780
If I'm with you, I can go anywhere in the world.

304
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:48,780
I don't have to go anywhere.

305
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,780
It's light!

306
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,780
It's the exit!

307
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,780
It's outside!

308
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,780
I can smell the sea.

309
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,780
Let's go.

310
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,780
Yeah.

311
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,780
Hailey, are you okay?

312
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,780
Yeah, I'm fine.

313
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,780
Thank goodness.

314
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,780
I'm so glad you're okay.

315
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,780
I'm from the water department.

316
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,780
Th-Thick ears.

317
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,780
That's right.

318
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:18,780
So you couldn't answer the machine in the water department.

319
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,780
That's right.

320
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,780
I'm sorry.

321
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,780
I'm sorry.

322
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,780
I'm sorry.

323
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,780
I'm sorry.

324
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,780
I'm sorry.

325
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,780
I'm sorry.

326
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,780
You couldn't answer the machine in the water department.

327
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,780
Don't bring that up now.

328
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,780
I'm sorry.

329
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,780
And I'm sorry if I'm wrong.

330
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:41,780
I felt like I was kissed before I woke up.

331
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:46,780
So you did artificial respiration for me?

332
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,780
It's a life-saving operation.

333
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,780
You don't have to be so shy.

334
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,780
That's right.

335
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,780
Life-saving operation.

336
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,780
Look.

337
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,780
You can see the light over there.

338
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,780
Does your leg hurt?

339
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,780
I'm sorry.

340
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,780
Where's your suitcase?

341
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:10,780
It's still there when I fell into the water.

342
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,780
I see.

343
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,780
Your shoulders are thin.

344
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,780
It's okay.

345
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,780
I'm almost there, so let me go by myself.

346
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,780
Okay.

347
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,780
But you can take your time.

348
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,780
Okay.

349
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,780
About what you said earlier...

350
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,780
What?

351
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,780
You said you'd forget about your memories.

352
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,780
You must be overestimating your summer vacation.

353
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,780
What?

354
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,780
You can't make amazing memories as you think.

355
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:48,780
For example, you're on an adventure on an island to find a pirate ship.

356
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:53,780
I'm not a kid anymore, but I'm still excited.

357
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,780
I see.

358
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,780
You won't forget about today?

359
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,780
I won't.

360
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,780
I think I'll remember forever.

361
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,780
The End

362
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,780
The End

363
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,780
The End

364
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,780
The End
