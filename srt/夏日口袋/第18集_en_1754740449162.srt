00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 1

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,600
Hey, don't just stand there and get up.

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,800
It's you, Hitomi.

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,400
Kyoko, you're still sleeping?

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,200
Huh? Did I sleep?

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,000
You were sleeping.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,400
I don't know if I'm awake or asleep.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,000
Am I a butterfly or a human?

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,600
What's that?

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,800
You don't know? You're so childish.

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,800
I don't know, and I don't want to hear a girl's grumbling.

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,600
Geez, you have a bad mouth.

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,200
So, what's the matter?

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,800
Yeah, I have a favor to ask you.

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,600
Huh?

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,200
One day, a girl will appear before you.

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,600
One day, a girl?

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,200
That's a coincidence.

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,400
But I'll know if I see her.

20
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm talking about this girl.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,800
Yeah, I get it.

22
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,600
A girl will appear.

23
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,400
You'll know if you see her.

24
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,400
Ami...

25
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,400
Welcome.

26
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
What's your name?

27
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
Umi.

28
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,600
Umi, right?

29
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,200
Come on, get up.

30
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,800
And one more thing.

31
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,200
You'll probably meet a boy too.

32
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm Takahara Airi. Nice to meet you.

33
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,200
Nice to meet you too.

34
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm Kyoko Misaki.

35
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,800
Huh?

36
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,200
I want you two to take care of Kyoko.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I want to tell you that I love you

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
With those eyes

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So that you'll remember me someday

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'll be able to do it with a clear smile

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:22,600
Until the flower blooms that plays the promised night

42
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,800
I'm Umi, the future Mide.

43
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,800
Wow, you're cool.

44
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,600
Nice to meet you, Umi.

45
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm Chiyo.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,200
Huh? I'm not allowed to?

47
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,200
Right?

48
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,800
Oh, by the way...

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,200
The letters of the wings are the same as Airi's.

50
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,000
Well, then...

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Umi?

52
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,800
I'll be in your care during the summer.

53
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,600
There's a lot of stuff here.

54
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,800
Grandma's collection is amazing.

55
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,800
When I see something unusual, I want to keep it right here.

56
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,800
That's why I was called.

57
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,400
You really came to help me.

58
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,600
It's almost dinner time.

59
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,000
But I'm sorry.

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
My cooking is unique,

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and I'm not a person who can cook for anyone.

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,400
There's a restaurant in the back of the hill.

63
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,400
Would you like to come with me?

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Mide.

65
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,000
Well, then, let's go home.

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Hold on tight.

67
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Let's go!

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Huh?

69
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I can't believe it's a gas station.

70
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Wow, it's a countryside.

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Wow, it's a countryside.

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Stars?

73
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah, stars.

74
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I can see a lot of them.

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I can see them.

76
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Who are you?

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm Takahara Airi.

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And you are?

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Umi.

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Umi.

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And you?

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Shiroha.

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Shiroha?

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Name?

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Name?

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Name.

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
How did you know?

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You knew?

89
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What were you doing here?

90
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I was swimming.

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I could tell by looking at you, but why are you here at this hour?

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
There's not much light, and I think it's dangerous.

93
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's hard to swim in a pool where there's no one.

94
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
At least, when there's people around...

95
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You're so mean.

96
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What?

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You're so mean!

98
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You were a strange girl.

99
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You were beautiful.

100
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
That's right.

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I visited Torishiro Island to help with my grandmother's funeral.

102
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
My 17-year-old summer vacation started like this.

103
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm hungry.

104
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Let's make something.

105
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Do you have any requests?

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Fried rice.

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Let's eat.

108
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
How is it? Is it good?

109
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
7 points.

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
7 points.

111
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
What?

112
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
How many points are you at?

113
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
100.

114
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You're so low that you can get hurt.

115
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I don't need it anymore.

116
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Sorry, I didn't have any money.

117
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So you haven't seen my performance yet.

118
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That's right. If you'd like, I could play with you.

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm not doing anything anymore.

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I went around the island with the sea.

121
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I've only met you for a few days.

122
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Everyone's a little different, but they're all good-natured.

123
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
A new place, new friends, a new summer.

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I might be able to be a new me here.

125
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Welcome to the sea

126
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Sea, this is the revenge fried rice.

127
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Let's eat.

128
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Half...

129
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,400
...eight points.

130
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
Kae...

131
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,400
That's how you make fried rice.

132
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,500
That's right.

133
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,700
If I remember correctly,

134
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,400
Shiroha's fried rice was the best.

135
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,900
Shiroha's fried rice?

136
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Shiroha's family used to run a restaurant.

137
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,100
Yeah.

138
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,600
Shiroha's fried rice is very popular.

139
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm Nodoka.

140
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,000
Hello.

141
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,000
Shiroha, you're good at fishing.

142
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,600
I just don't have enough salt today.

143
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,400
What about the fish you caught?

144
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,800
I'll eat it. That's the etiquette.

145
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,800
It's pulling.

146
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,200
It pulled.

147
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,400
It's a bit salty, so I'll simmer it for an hour.

148
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,800
That's nice.

149
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,600
You're so stubborn.

150
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,000
Can I borrow your fishing rod?

151
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,800
I think it's better not to underestimate the sea of Torishiro.

152
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,800
It's not easy to catch for an amateur.

153
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,900
Hit.

154
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,400
Professional fishing.

155
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,400
I'm not sure if I can catch it.

156
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,400
I'm not sure if I can catch it.

157
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,400
I'm not sure if I can catch it.

158
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,000
Professional?

159
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,600
No, beginner.

160
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,600
Do you want to try?

161
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,100
Yeah.

162
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,800
Hit.

163
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,300
It's a god.

164
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,600
It's the sea.

165
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,600
I did it.

166
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,600
Yeah.

167
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,600
The sashimi is so crunchy.

168
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,400
It's freshly caught.

169
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,600
Is the sea good?

170
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,300
95 points.

171
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,300
I'm glad I got it.

172
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,600
That's right.

173
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,800
Can you tell me how to make fried rice?

174
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,700
What's the matter?

175
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,000
I want to make fried rice that makes the sea say it's good.

176
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,700
Heat is important for fried rice.

177
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,400
First, prepare a Chinese pot.

178
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,300
Wait.

179
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,400
I only have a normal frying pan.

180
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,400
Then it's impossible.

181
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,500
What?

182
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,400
Don't underestimate fried rice.

183
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,300
Make rice with your family.

184
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,600
Eh? Family?

185
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,400
Yeah.

186
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,600
Like a family reunion.

187
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,800
I don't know what a family reunion is.

188
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,000
I don't have parents.

189
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,800
I'm going home.

190
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,100
Oh, really?

191
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,600
I see.

192
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,400
Well, Shiroha, thanks for the fish.

193
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,400
Yeah, bye.

194
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,300
Hey, you wanted to play with me a little longer, didn't you?

195
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,500
I'm fine.

196
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,400
You're still a kid.

197
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,800
Tell me what you want to do.

198
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,800
Kids don't have to be patient.

199
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,900
Yeah.

200
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,800
Kyoko, what's wrong?

201
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Airi, are you alone?

202
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,000
Yes, I'm taking a walk.

203
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,800
What's wrong?

204
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,100
Umi isn't here.

205
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,700
I was in a quiet house.

206
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,800
My father died when I was just back.

207
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,800
I don't know how long it's been.

208
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,800
In this house,

209
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,800
it's just a word to increase loneliness.

210
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,800
So you were here.

211
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,800
Dad.

212
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,800
No, I'm not your father.

213
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,800
Do you want to see your father?

214
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,800
He's busy.

215
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,800
Well, he works.

216
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,800
Yeah.

217
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,800
He told me a long time ago

218
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:57,800
that he had worked hard, but he failed.

219
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,800
He regretted running away from there.

220
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,800
Ran away?

221
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,800
I ran away too.

222
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,800
There were people who were kind to me,

223
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,800
and there were people who worried about me.

224
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,800
I ran away.

225
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,800
That's why I'm here.

226
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:21,800
I want to apologize, but I can't.

227
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,800
I don't want to run away anymore.

228
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,800
Umi.

229
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,800
Yeah, that's right.

230
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,800
You don't want to run away from summer anymore, do you?

231
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,800
Yeah.

232
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,800
Let's go home. Kyoko is worried about you.

233
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,800
Yeah.

234
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,800
But why did you go out?

235
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,800
Because my father wasn't there.

236
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,800
Don't say that.

237
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,800
Wait, you were looking for me?

238
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,800
Yeah.

239
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,800
Why me?

240
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:16,800
I don't want to run away, so I want you to be with me.

241
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,800
I see.

242
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,800
Everyone's here.

243
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,800
Umi!

244
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,800
I'm so glad.

245
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,800
I'm sorry to have worried you.

246
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,800
I hope you're okay.

247
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,800
Thank you for everything, everyone.

248
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,800
Do you have anything you want to do?

249
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,800
Something I want to do?

250
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,800
We came all the way to this island,

251
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,800
so let's make some memories and go home.

252
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,800
Something I want to do...

253
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,800
Mom.

254
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,800
Oh, it's just a matter of time?

255
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,800
It's a little hard at this age.

256
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,800
No.

257
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,800
I have something I want to do with you.

258
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,800
Okay.

259
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:23,800
I'll have your mother call you and let you come to the island.

260
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,800
No.

261
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,800
I'm not there.

262
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,800
You're not there anymore?

263
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,800
I see.

264
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,800
I'll look for her.

265
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,800
What?

266
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,800
Mom, I'll look for her.

267
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,800
You'll look for her?

268
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,800
She'll be the mother of the sea.

269
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,800
You're here again.

270
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,800
I'd like to talk to you.

271
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,800
Well...

272
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,800
I see.

273
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,800
You don't have your mother either.

274
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,800
I'm sorry. I was just being careless.

275
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,800
Hey, why are you here?

276
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,800
She said she didn't want to run away.

277
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,800
She didn't want to run away?

278
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,800
I didn't ask her why, but...

279
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,800
I ran away to this island.

280
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,800
I had some bad things in my hometown.

281
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,800
I came here to forget about them.

282
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,800
But she said she didn't want to run away.

283
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,800
So I wanted to help her.

284
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,800
Watermelon bar.

285
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,800
I want you to bring it when I want to eat it.

286
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,800
What if I do that?

287
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,800
I'll be the mother of the watermelon bar.

288
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,800
How about a contract like that?

289
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,800
Thank you!

290
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,800
I'm glad you're happy!

291
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,800
Shiroha will be your mother!

292
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,800
Hello.

293
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,800
Hey, hey.

294
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,800
What do you say when I say hello?

295
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,800
Sorry.

296
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,800
It looks like the human eye is activated.

297
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,800
Shiroha?

298
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,800
Are you nervous?

299
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,800
I'm not nervous.

300
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,800
I just don't know what to say to the little girl.

301
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,800
This.

302
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,800
It's 189 yen including tax.

303
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,800
But if you want to buy it with this 12-color pencil,

304
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,800
the set price is 1,000 yen.

305
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,800
I bought it!

306
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,800
My darling.

307
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,800
Aoi, thank you.

308
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,800
You're in a hurry.

309
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,800
Your father is doing his best.

310
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,800
Umi, let's start a fun summer vacation.

311
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,800
What?

312
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,800
This is a magic drawing diary.

313
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,800
If you write what you want to do, it will come true.

314
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,800
Wow!

315
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,800
Is there really such a diary?

316
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,800
What?

317
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,800
On August 1st,

318
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:12,800
my father sang a song while imitating the Kesaru Quartle.

319
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,800
It was fun.

320
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,800
Wow! It's a magic diary!

321
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,800
Wow! It's a magic diary!

322
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,800
Wow!

323
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,800
Hey, Umi.

324
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,800
Do you want to see your mother's Kesaru Quartle?

325
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:39,800
My mother sang a song while imitating the Kesaru Quartle.

326
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,800
Then, write your diary from tomorrow.

327
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,800
Yes.

328
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:53,800
On August 2nd, I played origami with my mother.

329
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,800
My mother was very good at origami.

330
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,800
Try to grab this.

331
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,800
Okay.

332
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,800
Then, close your eyes for a moment.

333
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,800
Okay.

334
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,800
Here, you can open it.

335
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,800
It's strange.

336
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,800
It's magic!

337
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,800
Maybe so.

338
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,800
Tell me about magic.

339
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,800
Can I call you mother?

340
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,800
Mother.

341
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,800
It's amazing!

342
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,800
The trick to fly a paper airplane is to be gentle and fluffy.

343
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,800
I've never seen it fly so long.

344
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,800
Number one?

345
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,800
Yes, number one.

346
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,800
Mother's paper airplane is amazing!

347
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:04,800
My hyper Mustang special, Dimension 4, Mark 3, flies better.

348
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,800
No.

349
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,800
This way.

350
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,800
Super Mustang Fire Cosmic Mode Level 7.

351
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,800
I'm not serious.

352
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,800
I want to fly it with you.

353
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:35,800
I want to fly paper airplanes with you.

354
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,800
I'm not serious.

355
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,800
Let's do it together.

356
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,800
Okay.

357
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,800
Ultra Pork Horizon Excavation 4.

358
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,800
Ready, set, go!

359
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,800
Super Mustang Fire Cosmic Mode Level 7.

360
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:40,800
Super Mustang Fire Cosmic Mode Level 8.

361
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:52,800
Super Mustang Fire Cosmic Mode Level 9.

362
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:04,800
Super Mustang Fire Cosmic Mode Level 10.

363
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:10,800
Super Mustang Fire Cosmic Mode Level 11.

364
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:22,800
Super Mustang Fire Cosmic Mode Level 12.

365
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,800
Super Mustang Fire Cosmic Mode Level 13.
