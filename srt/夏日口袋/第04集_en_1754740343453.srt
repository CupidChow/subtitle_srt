00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Chapter 3

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,800
The

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,000
Tent

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Tent

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Tent

6
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Look at this, Taka!

7
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The map of this island?

8
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yes!

9
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I want to go to this place where the punishment is.

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Is there something?

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
A treasure!

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You're kidding!

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
There's no way that's there.

14
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So let's go check it out.

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Why me?

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Because you have a good athletic sense.

17
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Even if something dangerous happens, we can do something about it.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Then there's someone who can be of more help than me.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Who?

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I knew it.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I am Tsubamenari.

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Where did you come from?

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You just came down from the tree, didn't you?

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Secret Nari.

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This is a ninja.

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You guys.

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It looks like you're planning something bad.

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Kiku...

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Who are you?

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm Hayato.

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I can't leave you as the director.

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Um...

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Um...

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm Susume-chan.

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
If I help you,

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I wonder if I can get a treasure.

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Let's look for it together.

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
End

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,200
I step on it

40
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:38,000
There are things that can only be reached by walking

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,600
I'm still searching for the warmth of your warm hands

42
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:51,200
Even if I connect countless kindnesses, I can't reach it

43
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,400
Even now, I'm still in the shadow of summer

44
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,400
I'll look back

45
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,000
Hey

46
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,600
You're here

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,200
You're here, my dear

48
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,600
Come on, come on, come on

49
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,600
The secret of the island we found

50
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,000
I hid it in this treasure chest

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,600
So we all locked it

52
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,000
Four keys

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,800
And we were five

54
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,000
You hid the key with five people?

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,800
But there are only four

56
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,200
I'm the leader, so I have this memo

57
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,000
I didn't hide the key

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,800
You're the leader?

59
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,000
I-It's fine

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,600
What about the members?

61
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,000
Dogs or goats?

62
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,600
Hey!

63
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,000
Sheep?

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,400
Are you angry?

65
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,600
You're the leader of the team

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,600
Yeah

67
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,800
If you collect the key and open the treasure chest, you'll find the secret of the island

68
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,600
What's the secret?

69
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,800
Just a moment

70
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,000
That's...

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,600
Yeah

72
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,800
I won't tell you

73
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,600
Anyway, we have four keys

74
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,600
We need to find the hint that's written here

75
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
The secret?

76
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,600
But it's from ten years ago

77
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,000
I don't think it's still there no matter where we hide it

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
If the bottom of the sea is at the bottom of the sea, it's impossible to collect it

79
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,200
I think we've thought about that part and hid it

80
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,600
For example...

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,400
It doesn't look like there's a key

82
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,600
Yeah, what's a monster?

83
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,000
Monster...

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
If it means the god of the sea, it's a statue or something

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,200
We've been walking around the island, but we haven't seen anything like that

86
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,600
Monster...

87
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
God of the sea...

88
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,000
Protect the sea...

89
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,600
Protect the sea...

90
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,400
It's like the lighthouse

91
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,600
Oh, I see

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Moyu, you are...

93
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,000
Do you know each other?

94
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Well, a little

95
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,800
I'm Takahara Hayari

96
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,000
And this is Kushima Kamome

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,600
Mee...

98
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,000
You're a little different

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,600
Nice to meet you, I'm Kushima Kamome

100
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,400
I'm Tomo, I'm Tsumugi Benders

101
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,000
You're picking up trash, you're great

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,600
I'll help you too

103
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,200
Huh?

104
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
Then I'll help you too

105
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Moyu...

106
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,400
You two are really nice people

107
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,000
Is that so?

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,600
You're looking for the key?

109
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,000
Hmm...

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I've never seen it

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,800
I see, that's right

112
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,000
So it's around the lighthouse?

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,600
If that's the case, it's a good start

114
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,400
To the bottom of the sea guarded by monsters

115
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,200
Maybe there's a different meaning to it

116
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,800
Take this!

117
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,600
Get lost!

118
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Is that a monster?

119
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,400
It appears in Sentai Mono

120
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,800
Yeah, that's it

121
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,400
I'm sure there's no monster like that

122
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,000
Ah...

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But not only the monster, there's a different meaning to the bottom of the sea...

124
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,200
Excuse me

125
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,000
Hmm?

126
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Do you have a national language dictionary?

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,800
Yes

128
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,200
Is it really here?

129
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,200
If my guess is correct

130
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,800
Hmm...

131
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,000
Ah...

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Ah...

133
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,800
Ahhhhhhh!

134
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
There it is!

135
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,200
There's the key!

136
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,800
I knew it

137
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,400
Huh?

138
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,800
What does that mean?

139
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,800
The bottom of the sea, that is, the stairs

140
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,600
The bottom of the sea guarded by monsters

141
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,800
It means the stone altar of the shrine where the god who protects the sea was worshiped

142
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,600
Oh, I didn't know that

143
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,400
I'm glad I still have the key

144
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,600
Thank you

145
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,200
It's all thanks to you, Airi

146
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,600
Geez

147
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,600
I wish I could give you a simple hint

148
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,600
You're right

149
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,400
Thank you for sending it

150
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,000
See you tomorrow

151
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,200
Maybe the day after tomorrow

152
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,400
That's fine

153
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,000
If you can't do it tomorrow, there's a day after tomorrow

154
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,200
There's always a tomorrow

155
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,600
Don don gaba chotto

156
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
What's that?

157
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Huh?

158
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,200
You don't know?

159
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
I don't know

160
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:24,000
Hmm...

161
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,600
Anyway, if you feel like it

162
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,800
Help me again

163
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,800
Yeah, see you tomorrow

164
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,000
It wasn't here either

165
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,200
The entrance to the Meifu where Banquen sleeps

166
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,000
It's a dog that's been living for over ten years

167
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,800
How many more are there on this island?

168
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Oh

169
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,600
It's probably here

170
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,600
The dressing room?

171
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Oh, I see

172
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
The entrance to the Meifu

173
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,600
I feel a little uneasy

174
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Excuse me

175
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,600
Oh, there it is, Airi

176
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,600
The second hunt

177
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
Oh, okay

178
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
Next one

179
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,600
The Basirisk is in the desert

180
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,600
The Basirisk is a bird monster, right?

181
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,600
The bird is in the desert

182
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,600
Is it about the chicken coop?

183
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
Oh, that's it

184
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,600
The house that's hunting chickens

185
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Huh?

186
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Hmm, I wonder if there were a few

187
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,600
I'd like a house that's hunting as many as possible

188
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,600
That's right

189
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Then, is it Narse's house?

190
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Huh?

191
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,600
There should be a lot of big huts

192
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,600
I-Is that so

193
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,600
Narse?

194
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,600
You were in front of the stream earlier, right?

195
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Oh, that girl

196
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,600
Oh, you're going to run away from home

197
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,600
You're good, little girl

198
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Huh, well

199
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Speaking of Narse's house, Shiroha-san

200
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,600
I've known her since I came to the island

201
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
Little girl

202
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Excuse me

203
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
Excuse me

204
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,600
What is it?

205
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,600
Oh, um, I'm Takahara Haeri

206
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,600
You don't know her?

207
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Um, Shiroha-san

208
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Shiroha?

209
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
You're used to it

210
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Who are you?

211
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,600
We're friends

212
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
You're a bad person

213
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,600
You're a bad person, are you really a friend?

214
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,600
I didn't know there was such an old man

215
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Hey, that girl is wearing school uniforms, right?

216
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Yeah, that's right

217
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:43,600
If you wear that, will the old man trust you as a school friend?

218
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,600
Well, maybe the attitude will change a little

219
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
What

220
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
I wonder if I can get it

221
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,600
School uniform

222
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Aoi, lend me your school uniform

223
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,600
What?

224
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Lend me your school uniform

225
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,600
What? Why? It's impossible

226
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,600
I'm asking you

227
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,600
My friend says she admires you, she says you're cute

228
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
What?

229
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,600
No, I'm not an idol or anything

230
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,600
I'm worried about being admired

231
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
School uniform?

232
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,600
I know

233
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,600
Now I'm a dream student

234
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
It looks pretty tight

235
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Especially Mugoho

236
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
Mugoho? What?

237
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,600
No, nothing

238
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:44,980
Just think of it as something like a

239
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,600
A friend

240
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,600
Shiroha, it's a friend

241
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,600
Ge

242
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
No, get

243
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,600
Hello

244
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
Who?

245
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
I'm Kujima Kamame

246
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,600
Hello

247
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
What?

248
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,600
Excuse me

249
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,600
Well, where do you think I can hide it?

250
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,600
Ah, there it is

251
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,600
There's a woman naked

252
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
Is that what you're looking for?

253
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
No, no, no

254
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,600
This is the third one

255
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,600
Yay

256
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,600
What's that?

257
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,600
The key to open the treasure chest that hides the secret of the island

258
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
It looks interesting

259
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,600
Wait

260
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
Yeah

261
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,600
Then let's look for it together

262
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
No

263
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
Ah

264
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,600
It's a problem if you suddenly say it

265
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,600
She's like that, so you shouldn't worry

266
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
But what is it?

267
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,600
Was it a bearded cat?

268
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,600
I think I know that you were the leader

269
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,600
I wonder

270
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,600
You're a mysterious person

271
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,600
I don't think so

272
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,600
I just wanted a friend

273
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,600
I couldn't talk to her

274
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,600
Ten years ago, my parents let me participate in the summer camp because they were worried about me

275
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,600
At first, I didn't like it

276
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,600
I couldn't get along with many groups

277
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,600
Then I found a map in my father's room

278
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,600
My father was a scientist and he was looking into the history of this island

279
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,600
The map was kept in the back of the desk

280
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,600
There was a red dot on the map and a simple memo was written there

281
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,600
Treasure, treasure

282
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,600
But it was a place where you had to cross the mountain

283
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,600
Even if I said I wanted to go, I was against adults

284
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:30,600
So I decided to call the most reliable girl

285
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
It's realistic

286
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,600
His name is Taka

287
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,600
He looks a little scary, but he was a boy who could exercise

288
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:43,600
Then Tsubame, Ayato, and Suzume gathered and we became five

289
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,600
What's wrong? Are you curious about something?

290
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,600
No, I feel like I've had a similar conversation

291
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,600
I see, you've also had an adventure

292
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
Maybe

293
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,600
The castle of the sky where the big feet live

294
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
Our theory has also been exposed

295
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
This is four

296
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Yeah, all the keys are in place

297
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Yes

298
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,600
I'm sorry

299
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
I'm sorry

300
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,600
The next morning

301
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
Wake up, Hayri

302
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,600
It's morning

303
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
Good morning, Hayri

304
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
Good morning

305
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,600
Why are you here?

306
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,600
I hurt Hayri because of me

307
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,600
I'm sorry, but I'm going to take care of Hayri for a while

308
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,600
I'm grateful, but what's with that outfit?

309
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,600
I told Kyoko-san that I would help her for a while

310
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
Then here you go

311
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,600
How is it? It suits you

312
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,600
Eh? Well, it suits me

313
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,600
Yay! I'll do my best from today

314
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,600
He's a hard worker

315
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Yeah

316
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Hayri, I'll help you

317
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
Why?

318
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
I came to help

319
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
But you...

320
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
Don't be so shy

321
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
You're wearing a towel, right?

322
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
No

323
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,600
Well, I'll help you

324
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,600
Put the towel on your back

325
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
Please

326
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,600
What's wrong?

327
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,600
You don't have to be so conscious

328
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,600
I'm sorry, I can't do it

329
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,600
Well, let's open the box

330
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,600
Yeah

331
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,600
Is this the map I was talking about?

332
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,600
Yeah, I'm glad we met again

333
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,600
You brat

334
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,600
I thought it would be hard to find it

335
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:04,600
But I found it because you helped me

336
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Thank you, Hayri

337
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
That's good

338
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,600
So what was it?

339
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
What you found

340
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
The secret of the island

341
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,600
I thought it was in the treasure box

342
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:29,600
What we found doesn't fit in this box

343
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,600
Is it that big?

344
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
It's really big

345
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,600
It's a great treasure

346
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,600
Yeah, it's great

347
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,600
What is it?

348
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,600
It's written here

349
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,600
A ship?

350
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Yeah

351
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,600
It's an island, so it's got a ship

352
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,600
No, it's not just a ship

353
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,600
Then what?

354
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,600
That's...

355
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
You can't ride it

356
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,600
What?

357
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,600
You said you wouldn't tell me

358
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,600
I can read it

359
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,600
No, I tried to tell you this time

360
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,600
What? Really?

361
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
Yeah, yeah

362
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Then I want to hear it

363
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,600
Really? Then I'll tell you

364
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Then again

365
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,600
We followed this map and went to the island

366
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:32,600
We went through the cave and traveled a long way

367
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,600
And we found it

368
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,600
A pirate ship

369
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,600
What? A pirate ship?

370
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:58,080
It's like a

371
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,080
It's a lie, right?

372
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,080
It's not a lie

373
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,080
We found the ship at that time

374
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:12,080
But we had to return it immediately

375
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,080
Then the next day the summer camp was over

376
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,080
Everyone was separated

377
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,080
So you found it and left it as it is?

378
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,080
Yeah

379
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,080
If that's true, is it still in the same place?

380
