1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
Pyramid of Misty

2
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:17,820
Py.... Pyramid of Misty

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:27,500
Grappling, Speechless

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
...

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Eh!?

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I wonder if they're gone again...

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I... I read back from there...

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Tsumugi-san's diary.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Eh?

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I somehow understood.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Tsumugi's role, and what she's saying about returning...

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I see...

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But, for us, Tsumugi is Tsumugi.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
No matter what happens, we'll be together until the end.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That's all.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You're right.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Ah! Shizuku! I just thought of something stupid!

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Good morning, Airi-san.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Eh?

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Eh?

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Shizuku's here too?

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Good morning, Tsumugi.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Good morning.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The words I wanted to tell you should have been decided,

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
but I looked away from the unchanging scenery.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I turned away because I wanted a little courage.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I longed for only the white brightness.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The end of the summer's note is coming.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:37,000
On the day I forget, I'll just wave my hand with a smile.

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
There's something that only reaches me when I keep walking.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm still searching for the warmth of your warm hands.

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
No matter how many times I connect kindness, I can't reach you.

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'll keep repeating myself in the shadow of the summer.

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Happy New Year, Tsumugi!

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Eh?

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Actually, today is the first day of January.

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Oh, that's fast!

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I just thought of something.

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:31,000
How about we hold a year-long event like New Year's Eve and fireworks for a week from August 31st?

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
A year?

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No, let's hold a year-long event.

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Ah, that's great!

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That's wonderful!

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We can enjoy Halloween and Christmas together.

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
That's too appropriate!

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
There's a culture that fits that season and season.

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
There is!

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's rude to be late for most things, but there's no problem to do it early.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Oh...

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But is that okay?

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Tsumugi.

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Ah?

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm not saying we should do this just for Tsumugi.

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Oh?

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That's right.

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Hm?

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I want to play with Tsumugi for the next few decades.

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Shizuku...

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
How about you, Tsumugi?

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Tell me what you want to do.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Ah...

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I want to play with you and Shizuku forever!

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Forever!

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I want to be with you!

65
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
A year-long event?

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's impossible to ask for a favor.

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Leave it to us!

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Leave it to us!

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
If that's the case, we'll gladly cooperate.

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Thank you.

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll do my best.

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's going to be interesting.

73
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah.

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And on the last day of August 31st, I'm going to celebrate your birthday.

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That's great.

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Let's celebrate it with all our heart.

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And I wonder if we can do a surprise.

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
A surprise?

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Ah!

80
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I just thought of something.

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Huh?

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And then our last week of summer vacation began.

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm sure we'll look back at it someday

84
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
In the sunshine

85
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I heard it so much

86
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The quiet waves

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The lively green heart

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The sand spills out

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I wonder how dense summer we're spending.

90
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's a waste of time to breathe.

91
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
To make this summer vacation a great memory.

92
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Merry Christmas!

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I have a Christmas present for you two.

94
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
This is the key.

95
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,000
When you and Shizuku come to play, I can go out with you.

96
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Thank you.

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But you're surprisingly active.

98
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Tsumugi, too.

99
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Giving a key to a lover.

100
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh, no!

101
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That's what it means.

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I have a present for you, too.

103
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Here you go.

104
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Oh, thank you.

105
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's a swimsuit.

106
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
No, it's not.

107
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I thought you were going to give me some kind of chemical reaction.

108
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's impossible to be bigger than Shizuku's boobs.

109
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
That's right. I'll tell you that, too.

110
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What? I wanted you to grow up.

111
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Tsumugi.

113
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
No, I don't want to go home.

114
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
More! More!

115
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I wanted to go to the sea again.

116
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I want to wear a yukata and go to the festival.

117
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I have a lot of things to do.

118
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I want to be with you forever.

119
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's okay, Tsumugi.

120
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's okay.

121
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But tomorrow...

122
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You're going to have fun with the three of us, right?

123
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Then you have to smile.

124
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Right, Baily?

125
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yeah, of course.

126
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
We'll always be by Tsumugi's side.

127
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Airi-san...

128
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So don't cry anymore.

129
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I love you.

130
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Why? Why are you two so kind?

131
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
That's obvious.

132
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I love you.

133
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I love you, too.

134
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Me, too.

135
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I love you, too.

136
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I love you.

137
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And so we had the last day of summer on August 31.

138
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Well, I'm going.

139
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I have a lot of preparations, so you can spend the rest of your time with Baily.

140
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I want to be with Shizuku more.

141
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Don't look like that. You've had a lot of fun, haven't you?

142
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It was really fun, Airi-kun.

143
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Shizuku, thank you.

144
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I love you, Tsumugi.

145
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Me, too, Shizuku.

146
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Don't cry. It's a promise.

147
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yes.

148
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Tsumugi

149
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Tsumugi?

150
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Tsumugi!

151
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Airi-san?

152
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What's wrong?

153
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Tsumugi, can you tell me you love me?

154
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I can't.

155
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I want to remember your voice.

156
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I want to remember it, too.

157
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I love you, Tsumugi.

158
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I love you, Airi-san.

159
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's about time.

160
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Is something about to start?

161
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I wonder. I'm looking forward to it.

162
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Airi-san is mean.

163
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's amazing.

164
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Today is Tsumugi's birthday.

165
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So we have to celebrate.

166
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
We'll light up a birthday candle for the rest of her life.

167
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
My birthday?

168
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
But how can we light up so many candles?

169
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's for all the boys.

170
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
We're all going to celebrate.

171
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm going to celebrate with you.

172
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
How?

173
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
With all the boys.

174
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
All of you?

175
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Everyone helped me with the idea of making Tsumugi happy.

176
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I made it using the Paringlus' autumn machine.

177
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
As I thought, Paringlus is invincible.

178
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Paringlus

179
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Everyone is a very nice person.

180
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
They're the best friends.

181
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Airi-san, can I talk about something from a long time ago?

182
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Sure.

183
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Tsumugi-chan is my friend.

184
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That song was sung by Tsumugi-chan when she was at the house across the sea.

185
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Since she came here, she hasn't been able to make friends and hasn't sung much.

186
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
She only had stuffed animals as friends.

187
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
But when she became friends with someone called Arhi Kato, she told me that she was happy.

188
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
She was able to make friends with someone she liked, so she decided to go out to the island with him.

189
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But...

190
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Tsumugi-chan has disappeared.

191
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
But Tsumugi-chan will surely come back.

192
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Until then, I thought of replacing Tsumugi-chan.

193
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I told her not to forget Tsumugi-chan.

194
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Tsumugi-chan, who disappeared, has returned.

195
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
While searching for Tsumugi-chan who disappeared, she asked me if I knew her.

196
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
But the people who remembered Tsumugi-chan gradually disappeared.

197
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
One day, Kato-san came to visit.

198
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Tsumugi.

199
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
This is the one I was looking for.

200
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Tsumugi.

201
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
From now on, do what you want to do.

202
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What I want to do?

203
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But I didn't know what I wanted to do.

204
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:30,000
So, I thought of making friends so that Tsumugi-chan, who had disappeared for the time being, could come back anytime.

205
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Until I disappeared from here, I met someone.

206
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
That person praised me for my stuffed animal.

207
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,000
From such a small opportunity, I made a friend named Shizuku.

208
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And I met Hairi-san.

209
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I fell in love.

210
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Not for Tsumugi-chan.

211
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's my... It's my love.

212
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I made a lot of friends.

213
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I became happy.

214
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Now I have a lot of things I want to do.

215
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm looking forward to the future.

216
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm sure it will snow in winter.

217
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Then I'll be in a big trouble.

218
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's a snowy day.

219
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
The door won't open because of the snow.

220
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Thanks to Hairi-san and Shizuku, I'm alive.

221
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm a lifesaver.

222
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
That's a lot.

223
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
In the summer, I swim in the sea, wear a yukata, and go to a festival.

224
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Sometimes we fight, but we get along quickly.

225
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm glad that the three of us are together.

226
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm looking forward to it.

227
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yeah.

228
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm having fun today.

229
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yeah.

230
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, I'm having fun all the time.

231
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Yeah.

232
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Shizuku is here, and Shiroha-san is here.

233
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Aou-san is here, and Namura-san, Mitani-san, and Kano-san are here.

234
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'm having fun every day.

235
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
So...

236
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Don't cry.

237
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm sorry.

238
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
But you're not there.

239
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Hairi-san, I'm happy.

240
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm happy to meet you, to meet Shizuku, to meet Hairi-san.

241
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yeah.

242
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm happy, too.

243
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So, have fun.

244
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Okay?

245
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Mugi!

246
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It was a really wonderful summer vacation.

247
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I sing, looking for myself

248
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I sing in the lighthouse, so that you can find me

249
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I collect materials, a reliable birdie

250
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I play with birds, and cows

251
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I spend this summer with birds and cows

252
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I hold birds and hands, and we're lovers

253
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I love birds, and I love cows

254
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm a rainbow, my treasure

255
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I won't forget this island, this summer, and this lighthouse

256
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Tsumugi...

257
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Happy birthday.

258
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It was a great summer vacation.

259
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I think that Tsumugi was just a summer vacation.

260
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Yeah.

261
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I met a stranger, and we became friends.

262
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I felt like we had time forever.

263
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
In the end, I grieved that we didn't have time, and I said goodbye to my friend.

264
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
That girl was on a summer vacation.

265
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Yeah.

266
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I was like that too.

267
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I know.

268
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
This song?

269
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
What song is that?

270
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It's a song that the cat lady who came to the radio station often sang.

271
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I became friends with her.

272
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Then, I hope we can meet next year.

273
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Next year, huh?

274
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I see.

275
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I see.

276
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
That's right.

277
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Yeah.

278
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I hope you'll come again next summer.

279
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's raining again.

280
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
See you again, Tsumugi.

281
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
See you again.

282
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Goodbye.

283
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
See you again.

284
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
See you again.

285
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm sorry.

286
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm back.

287
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Welcome back.
