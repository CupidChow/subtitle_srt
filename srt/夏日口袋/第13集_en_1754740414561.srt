1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
...

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
...

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
... I burned it...

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
... and replaced it with a cover of a reference book...

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
... and my slimy little sister, Arana, was a single-parent boy...

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
...

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
... It was a strong regret...

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
... I don't think I'll die twice the day my parents see that...

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
... It wasn't a memory of love!

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So this is the cause of Aou's eardrums...

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Don't say eardrums!

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Let's find the next location, Inari!

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
... Wait, I forgot to search...

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Aou?

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
No...

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This memory...

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
... is dead...

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
...

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
...

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
...

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
...

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
...

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
...

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
...

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
...

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
...

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
...

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
...

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
...

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
...

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
...

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
...

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
...

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
...

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
...

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
...

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
...

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
...

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
...

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
...

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
...

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
...

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This memory...

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
... The feeling of being held in my chest...

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
... Sadness...

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
... I knew it was an unforgivable relationship...

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
... But I couldn't control my feelings...

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
... So we decided...

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
... To run away together...

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
... But...

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
... She didn't come...

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
... I believe she didn't come, but she couldn't come...

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
... I believe so...

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
... But...

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
... I kept believing...

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
... I went to war...

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
... I'm sorry...

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
... I couldn't wait for you...

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
... I was the only one who died...

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
... I wanted to see you...

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
... At the end...

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
... I wanted to see you...

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
... even just for a second...

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
... Inari...

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
... I'm sorry...

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
... I really...

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
... You're an idiot...

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
... You said you couldn't touch me...

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
... Thank you...

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
... I'll return this to you...

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
... At the place where you should return...

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
... With our own hands...

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
... Yeah!

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
... What's wrong?

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
... No...

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
... I just wanted to meet the person I remember...

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
... The person I've been waiting for...

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
... I see...

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
... The flowers...

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
... The flowers are starting to fall...

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
... So we don't have much time...

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
... Until we can gather the Seven Chiefs...

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
... We have to wait another year...

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
... I'll definitely...

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
... I'll definitely find them...

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
... It's okay...

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
... I'll be with you this year...

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
... Yeah...

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
... Pon!

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
... It's really late at night, so I'm sleepy...

91
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
... It's the Seven Chiefs' fault...

92
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
... What?

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
... If you touch the Seven Chiefs and see other people's memories...

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
... If you know them, they're already your memories...

95
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
... People need to sleep a lot to organize their memories while they're asleep...

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
... Is that why you were sleeping anywhere?

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
... Well...

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
... Then, isn't it the same with you?

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
... I'm used to it, and I've been doing it for a long time...

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
... It's a good thing that you can organize your memories...

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
... I understand that it's for the sake of love, but isn't it too much?

102
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
... Because...

103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
... It's my fault that love has become like that...

104
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
... Eh?

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
... Love is smart and can exercise...

106
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
... When we compete together, I always lose...

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
... My hands are also clever...

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
... My mother taught me how to make it because it has the effect of avoiding it...

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
... She told me to make it bigger and put it on when I was playing Sorakado...

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
... We made it together, but I couldn't make it beautiful...

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
... I was so frustrated and jealous of love that I cried...

112
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
... When Ai gave me this...

113
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
... She said, give me the one I made instead...

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
... Then, what about the one wrapped around Ai's wrist?

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
... It was a club, right?

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
... But she said she was happy just because it was something I made...

117
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
... Ai is really amazing...

118
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
... I wanted to be told that Ai was amazing...

119
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
... At that time, I saw a rare butterfly...

120
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
... A beautiful butterfly that glows faintly...

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
... It was the first time I saw a butterfly like that...

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
... Amazing...

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
... Ah...

124
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
... It's true! I saw it!

125
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
... A butterfly that glows...

126
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
... Didn't you see it with the light of the sun?

127
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
... I'm not lying! I really saw it!

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
... Ai believes in me, right?

129
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
... I couldn't believe it...

130
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
... So I found a butterfly that glows...

131
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
... I wanted everyone to say that it was amazing...

132
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
... At night, I thought it was easy to find a butterfly that glows...

133
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
... Ao-chan?

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
... Yes?

135
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
... Ao-chan...

136
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
... Let's go home...

137
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
... I haven't found the butterfly that glows yet...

138
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
... But the mountain at night is dangerous...

139
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
... It's not dangerous!

140
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
... Ai was able to come here alone...

141
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
... I'm fine too...

142
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
... Then, let's go together...

143
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
... No! There's no point in going together with Ai!

144
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
... Even though I don't believe in the butterfly that glows...

145
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
... You think I'm a liar!

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
... Ao-chan...

147
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
... Ao-chan!

148
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
... I said something terrible...

149
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
... I've never seen Ai's face...

150
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
... Ai...

151
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
... Ai...

152
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
... Ai... I'm sorry...

153
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
... I'm sorry...

154
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
... I'm sorry...

155
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
... Ao...

156
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
... Ao...

157
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
... I'm so glad...

158
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
... Eh? Father? Mother?

159
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
... Hey...

160
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
... Where is Ai?

161
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
... Ai was found to have fallen from the cliff at night...

162
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
... Eh?

163
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
... He was taken to the hospital and treated immediately...

164
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
... I didn't wake up because I was in a bad mood...

165
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
... It seems that this was held in Ai's hand...

166
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
... That night, I said something terrible to Ai and hurt him...

167
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
... I haven't been forgiven by Ai yet...

168
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
... I have to wake up Ai no matter what happens...

169
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
... Ao, I really want to be your strength...

170
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
... Did you fall in love?

171
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
... Yeah, I'm in love... You know that, right?

172
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
...

173
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
... I'm not afraid of sleeping lately...

174
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
... You're by my side, so I can keep myself safe...

175
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
... The feelings for Ai are letting me be myself...

176
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
... Ao...

177
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
...

178
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
... Um, are you okay?

179
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
... Eh?

180
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
... Ah, yeah, I'm fine...

181
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
... You were quite kind to me...

182
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
... No, I mean, about the house...

183
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
... I didn't go home for a night...

184
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
... Eh?

185
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
... Ah, it's nothing!

186
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
... I'm fine! I'm a maid!

187
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
... I'm totally fine! I'm fine!

188
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
... You're really a good girl, Ao...

189
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
... You're a very good girl!

190
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
... You should think about being a little more erotic!

191
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
... Well, the kiss was...

192
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
... It was intense...

193
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
... That's because I'm a maid...

194
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
... I thought I had to be with you at first...

195
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
... So you were talking about being erotic, being a maid...

196
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
... Ah, Shiroha...

197
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
... Did you enjoy last night?

198
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...

199
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
... Ao...

200
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
... What?

201
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
... I'm glad...

202
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
... I'm sorry to bother you this early...

203
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
... I'll call the emergency clinic, Ao...

204
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
... I'll call the emergency clinic, Ao...

205
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
...

206
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
... Doctor, where's Ai?

207
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
... I've brought her back for now...

208
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
... I want to tell you about the past and the future...

209
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
... So please, go ahead...

210
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
... Come in!

211
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
... Takahara, is Ai...

212
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
... Well...

213
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
... Is she okay?

214
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
... The doctor said she was brought back...

215
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
... I see...

216
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
... I'm glad...

217
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
... Ai is also your childhood friend...

218
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
... Yes...

219
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
... We played together when we were kids...

220
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
... Ai always cared about Ao...

221
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
... She's a twin, but she was always conscious of her sister...

222
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
... I took good care of Ao...

223
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
... Takahara!

224
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
... You're saying whatever you want, but please take care of Ao...

225
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
... Hey...

226
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
... I don't know what's going to happen in the future...

227
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
... Ao is relying on you...

228
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
... So...

229
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
... Please look up...

230
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
... This isn't something you can ask for...

231
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
... But...

232
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
... I'm by your side with my own will...

233
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
... Thank you...

234
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
... I'm home...

235
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
... It was a lot of trouble...

236
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
... No, I'm just like Ao...

237
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
... Are you okay, Airi?

238
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
... Eh?

239
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
... Huh?

240
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
... Maru!

241
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
... I'm kind of sleepy...

242
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
... Where am I?

243
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
... Takahara-san, Aoi!

244
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
... Please let me go...

245
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
... I'm sorry...

246
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
... I can't wait for you...

247
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
... Good morning...

248
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
... Please give me back my wife and daughter...

249
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
... I lost my life...

250
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
... I don't want to be an adult!

251
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
... I can relax...

252
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
... At the end, I'll give you a single glance...

253
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
... Huh?

254
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
... What was that dream?

255
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
... Wait, at night?

256
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
... How long did I sleep?

257
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
... Huh?

258
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
... No way...

259
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
... Aoi!

260
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
... Where are you?

261
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
... Aoi!

262
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
... Inari!

263
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
... Go!

264
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
... Aoi!

265
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
... Hey!

266
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
... Are you okay?

267
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
... How many memories did I see?

268
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
... Aoi, are you okay?

269
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
... Mom... I want to see you...

270
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
... I want to see you...

271
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
... Aoi?

272
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
... I want to see you...

273
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
... It's dark...

274
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
... It's dark here...

275
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
... I'm scared...

276
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
... It's cold...

277
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
... It's cold...

278
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
... If I could be someone's...

279
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
... I'd kill...

280
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
... Will that letter reach you?

281
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
... I'm looking forward to your reply...

282
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
... Aoi!

283
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
... My cheeks...

284
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
... hurt...

285
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
... Um...

286
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
... Why?

287
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
... Oh, right...

288
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
... Hurry...

289
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
... I have to find my love...

290
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
... Hey!

291
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
... Sit down!

292
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
... You're shaking!

293
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
... There's no time!

294
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
... If this goes on, Aoi will disappear!

295
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
... The doctor wants me to be prepared...

296
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
... I can't wait another year!

297
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
... But you're going too far!

298
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
... Don't go too far now!

299
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
... When will you do it?

300
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
... If Aoi disappears, you won't be able to go too far!

301
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
... That's true...

302
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
... At least rest a little...

303
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
... I'll wake you up...

304
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
... Will you...

305
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
... Wake me up?

306
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
... Yeah, I'll wake you up...

307
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
... Then...

308
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
... Just...

309
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
... Ten minutes...

310
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
... Hey, Ai...

311
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
... Aoi is doing her best...

312
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
... If you value her too...

313
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
... Come out and do it...

314
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
... Inari?

315
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
... What's wrong?

316
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
... You're kidding...

317
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
... If Aoi touches the Seven-Sword Palm...

318
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
... BAN!

319
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
... Damn it!

320
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
... Don't come here!

321
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
... What?

322
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
... BAN!

323
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
... This is...

324
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
... You...

325
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
... You protected me...

326
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
... ...

327
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
... Morning...

328
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
... Why?

329
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
... You said you'd wake me up!

330
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
... It's okay...

331
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
... It's not okay!

332
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
... While you're doing this, Ai is...

333
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
... Ai is here...

334
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
... See?

335
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
... Here...

336
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
... Where?

337
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
... I can't see...

338
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
... I see...

339
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
... I can't see...

340
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
... I can't find it...

341
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
... I closed my eyes...

342
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
... While I was saying I wanted to save Ai...

343
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
... I was afraid of her true feelings...

344
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
... I was afraid of myself...

345
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
... I'm...

346
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
... I'm really the worst...

347
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
... That's not true!

348
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
... While you were in such a mess...

349
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
... You did so much for Ai...

350
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
... You did your best!

351
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
... Don't say you're the worst...

352
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
... You were great!

353
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
... Airi...

354
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
... But I can't see Ai...

355
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
... If you can't see it, I'll help you...

356
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
... Help me...

357
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
... How?

358
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
...

359
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
... You think I'm a liar!

360
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
... A-Ao-chan!

361
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
... It's my fault...

362
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
... I should have believed in the shining butterfly that Ao-chan saw...

363
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
... Ao-chan can't be lying...

364
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
... That's what I hate...

365
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
... I have to find the shining butterfly...

366
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
... I just have to find it...

367
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
... Then Ao-chan won't be a liar...

368
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
... If Ao-chan is not in good spirits, I can't be in good spirits either...

369
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
... If Ao-chan can't laugh, I can't laugh either...

370
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
... I'm Ao-chan's big sister...

371
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
... Ao-chan will say I'm amazing...

372
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
... I can do my best...

373
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
...

374
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
...

375
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
... I have to find the butterfly...

376
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
... I want to make up with Ao-chan...

377
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
... Ao-chan...

378
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
... Ao-chan...

379
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
... Ai...

380
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,000
... Ai has always been thinking about me...

381
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
... Ao-chan is amazing...

382
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
... Yeah, because she's my big sister...

383
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
... What's wrong?

384
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
... I can see...

385
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
... Ai...

386
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
... Let's go home... Ai...

387
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
...

388
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
... Now then, Ao will do it...

389
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
... Of course...

390
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
... Ai, wake up...

391
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
...

392
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
... Now Ai will wake up...

393
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
... I think Ai's memory is back for now...

394
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
... And then...

395
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
...

396
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
... I'll keep an eye on Ai, so you can sleep...

397
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
... I'll do that...

398
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
... I'll wake you up next time...

399
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
... Ai...

400
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
... Good night...

401
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
...

402
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
...

403
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
...
