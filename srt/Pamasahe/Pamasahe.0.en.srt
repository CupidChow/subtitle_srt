It's far.

You have to hire a taxi
to take you there.

Can't I walk the whole way?

25
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,019
I don't have money.

26
00:07:19,044 --> 00:07:20,896
It's a long walk from here.

27

Ask someone else, miss.

00:07:46,954 --> 00:07:48,043
Sorry.

- The station.
- Yes.

- Yes, sir.

You can stop calling me 'mister'.

00:16:47,636 --> 00:16:48,678
Just call me 'Rod.'

00:16:51,181 --> 00:16:52,974
Don't have to call me 'sir' either.

134
00:16:52,974 --> 00:16:54,392
Just Rod.

00:16:54,392 --> 00:16:55,310
Okay, sir.

136
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,103
Ah, Rod. Sorry.

Much better.

00:16:59,664 --> 00:17:01,833
Couldn't get a smile
out of you earlier.

00:17:01,858 --> 00:17:04,569
At least now
you're laughing a little.

141
00:17:05,862 --> 00:17:07,697
Since we'll be on the
road for a good while,

142
00:17:07,697 --> 00:17:08,657
about four hours,

143
00:17:08,657 --> 00:17:10,549
why don't you tell
me about your life?

144
00:17:10,574 --> 00:17:11,992
Nevermind, mister.

145
00:17:12,177 --> 00:17:15,388
You'll just feel sorry for me.

146
00:17:15,413 --> 00:17:16,473
If you only knew,

147
00:17:16,498 --> 00:17:18,275
you'd be in tears.

148
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,344
You say you don't want to tell me

149
00:17:20,435 --> 00:17:21,603
but you keep giving hints.

150
00:17:21,628 --> 00:17:23,088
I guess.

151
00:17:23,522 --> 00:17:25,232
I'm sorry.

152
00:17:25,257 --> 00:17:27,978
There, you're starting to lighten up.

153
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:30,506
You looked like the
world's against you.

154
00:17:30,654 --> 00:17:31,947
Yeah,

155
00:17:31,972 --> 00:17:34,891
I felt really lost earlier.

156
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,952
I really don't have any money.

157
00:17:36,977 --> 00:17:40,580
Since we got on that ship

158
00:17:40,605 --> 00:17:41,773
and over on this bus,

159
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:46,236
we were begging
for food and change

160
00:17:46,236 --> 00:17:48,905
just to get to my husband

161
00:17:48,905 --> 00:17:52,617
in Nueva Segovia.

162
00:17:52,617 --> 00:17:56,037
I went through
hell on that ship.

163
00:17:57,222 --> 00:17:59,641
Hang on. I don't understand.

164
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,877
Why is your husband
in Nueva Segovia?

165
00:18:02,902 --> 00:18:04,654
And you're from Visayas.

166
00:18:05,273 --> 00:18:06,408
Listen,

167
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,692
I'll tell you about it

168
00:18:08,717 --> 00:18:10,093
but I hope

169
00:18:10,118 --> 00:18:11,494
you don't judge us too harshly.

170
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:14,558
Because back home,

171
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,961
people who know about our story,

172
00:18:17,986 --> 00:18:20,205
they look down on us.

173
00:18:25,483 --> 00:18:26,443
We were very young

174
00:18:26,468 --> 00:18:28,887
when my brother
and I became orphans.

175
00:18:34,278 --> 00:18:36,822
Papa died in an accident.

176
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:40,682
They said I wasn't old
enough to remember.

177
00:18:40,707 --> 00:18:41,916
I was five

178
00:18:41,941 --> 00:18:44,699
when he was run over by a truck.

179
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,838
Mom didn't take it very well.

180
00:18:48,036 --> 00:18:49,955
She was heartbroken.

181
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,963
She neglected herself.

182
00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:54,049
And us, too.

183
00:18:54,696 --> 00:18:56,353
They told us

184
00:18:56,407 --> 00:18:59,830
she developed a mental illness.

185
00:18:59,855 --> 00:19:02,662
Then one day,

186
00:19:02,687 --> 00:19:04,731
they found her dead.

187
00:19:04,756 --> 00:19:06,883
She hanged herself.

188
00:19:06,908 --> 00:19:09,202
Lita!

189
00:19:16,117 --> 00:19:18,828
Why did you do that?

190
00:19:18,828 --> 00:19:21,681
A relative had to take
me and my brother in.

191
00:19:21,706 --> 00:19:24,459
But one day,

192
00:19:24,459 --> 00:19:27,111
our aunt took us to the plaza.

193
00:19:27,896 --> 00:19:29,689
Sit over here, okay?

194
00:19:29,714 --> 00:19:31,611
- Here?
- Yes, yes.

195
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:34,361
We won't be long.

196
00:19:34,386 --> 00:19:37,472
We'll just take a walk, okay?

197
00:19:38,865 --> 00:19:40,492
Hey! Eds!

198
00:19:40,517 --> 00:19:42,143
Did you wait long?

199
00:19:42,168 --> 00:19:43,611
Yes.

200
00:19:43,828 --> 00:19:47,666
Here's my nephew

201
00:19:47,691 --> 00:19:50,527
he's the one I've been telling you about.

202
00:19:51,152 --> 00:19:52,445
Thank you.

203
00:19:52,921 --> 00:19:56,591
To, be a good boy.

204
00:19:56,616 --> 00:20:00,142
They said my brother
just disappeared.

205
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:02,175
They couldn't find him.

206
00:20:02,347 --> 00:20:04,174
When we got home,

207
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:05,951
I was inconsolable.

208
00:20:06,017 --> 00:20:07,185
I was so afraid.

209
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,963
I didn't have a
brother anymore.

210
00:20:09,938 --> 00:20:12,732
They couldn't find him anymore.

211
00:20:12,757 --> 00:20:15,869
They said they'd
searched everywhere.

212
00:20:16,194 --> 00:20:18,321
Even in the next town.

213
00:20:18,346 --> 00:20:20,853
But he was just gone.

214
00:20:21,057 --> 00:20:22,976
So I grew up alone

215
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:25,472
with my aunt and uncle.

216
00:20:25,578 --> 00:20:26,955
What's worse,

217
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:30,375
I was always scared
because my aunt bullied me.

218
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,694
She would say
I wasn't her real child.

219
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:35,722
That I was just a burden.

220
00:20:36,464 --> 00:20:38,550
Man, that's intense.

221
00:20:38,575 --> 00:20:40,910
You'd better eat

222
00:20:40,935 --> 00:20:42,533
or drink something.

223
00:20:44,581 --> 00:20:45,582
Here.

224
00:20:46,082 --> 00:20:49,502
Take a break.

225
00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:03,057
It's good.

226
00:21:12,292 --> 00:21:13,251
Want some?

227
00:21:13,276 --> 00:21:14,586
- I'm okay.
- You can have half.

228
00:21:14,611 --> 00:21:16,404
No, it's fine. Thanks.

229
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:17,847
Water.

230
00:21:20,629 --> 00:21:23,340
If you want more,
I have more food.

231
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:26,368
You look like you
could eat some more.

232
00:21:27,265 --> 00:21:29,225
Are you shocked?

233
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,128
I told you I had a terrible past.

234
00:21:33,644 --> 00:21:35,446
Let me just finish this.

235
00:21:36,316 --> 00:21:39,361
I'll get back to my story later.

236
00:21:52,334 --> 00:21:54,463
When I turned 16,

237
00:21:55,151 --> 00:21:57,216
I was usually left at home.

238
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,804
That's the first time
my uncle molested me.

239
00:22:20,902 --> 00:22:21,736
Shh, be quiet!

240
00:22:21,761 --> 00:22:23,457
Be quiet!

241
00:22:23,517 --> 00:22:25,602
Please, don't…

242
00:22:28,576 --> 00:22:30,370
I'll kill you!

243
00:22:30,395 --> 00:22:32,188
Sorry for what happened to you.

244
00:22:32,213 --> 00:22:34,132
Your uncle's crazy.

245
00:22:34,624 --> 00:22:35,917
Where is he now?

246
00:22:35,942 --> 00:22:37,817
Didn't your aunt do anything?

247
00:22:41,364 --> 00:22:43,199
You don't need to apologize, Rod.

248
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:46,814
You had nothing to do with it.

249
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,831
I didn't tell anyone because

250
00:22:50,957 --> 00:22:53,001
my uncle threatened me.

251
00:22:53,543 --> 00:22:54,627
What's wrong with you?

252
00:22:54,652 --> 00:22:57,030
She doesn't believe me.

253
00:22:57,726 --> 00:22:59,937
She just beats me up,

254
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:03,160
and calls me a liar.

255
00:23:08,164 --> 00:23:10,201
Since then,

256
00:23:10,226 --> 00:23:12,864
she had me sent to Quezon City.

257
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:18,506
I worked as a waitress there.

258
00:23:19,287 --> 00:23:22,790
I was looking after
their small eatery, too.

259
00:23:26,443 --> 00:23:28,778
I didn't go to college anymore

260
00:23:28,803 --> 00:23:32,807
so their cousins ​​helped me

261
00:23:32,832 --> 00:23:34,709
take a vocational course.

262
00:23:34,734 --> 00:23:36,982
That's where I
learned to massage.

263
00:23:38,671 --> 00:23:40,632
Your story's dragging on.

264
00:23:41,507 --> 00:23:43,134
All I wanted to know

265
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:44,912
was about your love story.

266
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:48,141
What happened to
you and your husband?

267
00:23:48,181 --> 00:23:50,621
Tell me that.

268
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:51,902
Don't worry,

269
00:23:52,228 --> 00:23:54,397
I'll get to that.

270
00:23:54,422 --> 00:23:55,924
Be patient.

271
00:23:56,064 --> 00:23:57,565
You'll find out in a bit.

272
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:01,544
I lived in Quezon City for four years.

273
00:24:01,569 --> 00:24:03,780
But while I was here in Manila,

274
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,657
my aunt called me.

275
00:24:05,657 --> 00:24:07,367
Lineth! Lineth!

276
00:24:07,392 --> 00:24:09,640
Someone's calling you.

277
00:24:26,653 --> 00:24:28,112
They said a man came

278
00:24:28,137 --> 00:24:30,181
to their house in Negros

279
00:24:30,206 --> 00:24:32,894
claiming to be Toto.

280
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:35,314
My long lost brother!

281
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,331
So my aunt gave him

282
00:24:38,356 --> 00:24:40,744
my address in Quezon City.

283
00:24:40,769 --> 00:24:42,354
And one day,

284
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:46,798
that man suddenly
showed up where I live

285
00:24:46,823 --> 00:24:49,138
and said he was my brother!

286
00:24:55,998 --> 00:24:56,916
Lineth!

287
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,918
Lineth!

288
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,688
At first,

289
00:25:01,713 --> 00:25:03,569
I couldn't believe it.

290
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,900
But I slowly recognized his face.

291
00:25:05,925 --> 00:25:07,176
And I felt it in my heart…

292
00:25:07,176 --> 00:25:08,678
it really was him!

293
00:25:08,678 --> 00:25:11,013
I threw my hands around him

294
00:25:11,013 --> 00:25:13,474
and we cried together.

295
00:25:14,016 --> 00:25:15,143
After that,

296
00:25:15,168 --> 00:25:17,962
he took me to Nueva Segovia.

297
00:25:18,871 --> 00:25:22,542
And he made me live
there with his wife,

298
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:24,244
Shiony.

299
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,878
They have been
married for two years

300
00:25:25,903 --> 00:25:27,775
but they still have no children.

301
00:25:28,506 --> 00:25:31,008
Shiony is so pretty,

302
00:25:31,033 --> 00:25:32,783
and very sexy.

303
00:25:32,844 --> 00:25:34,846
You see, she works in Japan!

304
00:25:34,871 --> 00:25:36,289
I thought she was mean

305
00:25:36,314 --> 00:25:38,504
and wouldn't make
me feel welcome.

306
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:39,851
But later on,

307
00:25:39,876 --> 00:25:41,394
we really warmed up to each other.

308
00:25:41,419 --> 00:25:42,420
She even taught me

309
00:25:42,445 --> 00:25:43,964
to take better care of myself.

310
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,089
How to dress up

311
00:25:45,114 --> 00:25:46,616
and do my makeup.

312
00:25:50,485 --> 00:25:52,018
You are so beautiful.

313
00:25:54,849 --> 00:25:57,935
Since my brother took me in

314
00:25:57,935 --> 00:26:00,062
and we were all living together

315
00:26:00,087 --> 00:26:02,160
We're each other's only family left.

316
00:26:02,315 --> 00:26:05,234
Ever since Shiony
went back to Japan,

317
00:26:05,234 --> 00:26:06,944
he would always bring

318
00:26:06,944 --> 00:26:09,530
home gifts for me after work.

319
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,908
He would buy me new clothes,

320
00:26:11,908 --> 00:26:13,618
and would take me to see places.

321
00:26:13,618 --> 00:26:14,952
He must have been

322
00:26:14,952 --> 00:26:18,581
making up for times lost.

323
00:26:19,332 --> 00:26:21,000
I got you your own soap,

324
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,251
toothbrush, toothpaste.

325
00:26:22,251 --> 00:26:23,377
But you know,

326
00:26:23,377 --> 00:26:24,837
that's not the only thing I learned

327
00:26:24,837 --> 00:26:27,590
living in my brother's house.

328
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,308
That's where I became aware of...

329
00:26:29,344 --> 00:26:30,845
You know…

330
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,144
Sex.

331
00:26:44,624 --> 00:26:45,808
You know what?

332
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:48,503
I always hear them

333
00:26:48,528 --> 00:26:50,863
doing it in the next room.

334
00:27:40,788 --> 00:27:41,956
Since then,

335
00:27:41,956 --> 00:27:43,124
I've been sneaking a peek at them

336
00:27:43,124 --> 00:27:44,834
whenever they're going at it.

337
00:27:44,834 --> 00:27:47,169
God, they were doing
all sorts of things

338
00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:49,005
in different positions!

339
00:27:49,005 --> 00:27:51,507
I used to be jealous of Shiony.

340
00:27:51,507 --> 00:27:53,426
I said to myself,

341
00:27:53,426 --> 00:27:55,970
it must be nice to have a man.

342
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:58,890
Shiony seems to enjoy it a lot

343
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:01,089
when my brother's
ramming into her.

344
00:28:01,271 --> 00:28:04,089
I just bite my lips from envy.

345
00:30:22,366 --> 00:30:23,117
Hold on.

346
00:30:23,117 --> 00:30:25,536
You're just telling me
all these sex stories.

347
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,913
Why won't you tell
me your love story?

348
00:30:27,938 --> 00:30:29,372
That's what I want to know.

349
00:30:30,249 --> 00:30:31,459
My brother…

350
00:30:33,794 --> 00:30:34,628
He's my husband

351
00:30:34,628 --> 00:30:36,175
and the one who
got me pregnant.

352
00:30:36,814 --> 00:30:37,940
What the...

353
00:30:37,965 --> 00:30:39,441
Did I hear you right?

354
00:30:39,817 --> 00:30:43,070
I asked you who's
the child's father.

355
00:30:43,095 --> 00:30:45,498
And you're telling me
it's your brother Toto?

356
00:30:46,432 --> 00:30:47,975
You heard right.

357
00:30:48,851 --> 00:30:51,462
My brother Toto
is the father of my child.

358
00:30:52,621 --> 00:30:54,957
Shiony was away for a long time.

359
00:30:54,982 --> 00:30:57,548
Her contract abroad
kept getting extended.

360
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:14,752
We saw how much

361
00:31:14,777 --> 00:31:16,774
like a married couple we were.

362
00:31:19,774 --> 00:31:23,027
I want you to do to me
what you do to Shiony.

363
00:31:23,052 --> 00:31:24,303
What?

364
00:31:42,488 --> 00:31:44,698
We knew it was wrong.

365
00:31:44,698 --> 00:31:46,534
We were living in sin.

366
00:31:46,534 --> 00:31:49,495
But what should never happen,
happened between us.

367
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,276
We were so attracted
to each other

368
00:31:52,473 --> 00:31:53,516
until it got to a point

369
00:31:53,541 --> 00:31:55,727
where we were
having sex a lot.

370
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:58,556
Especially since
Shiony wasn't around.

371
00:36:09,938 --> 00:36:11,690
I fill in for the sadness

372
00:36:11,715 --> 00:36:14,024
and longing he feels for his wife.

373
00:36:14,276 --> 00:36:17,488
Until our sin bore fruit.

374
00:36:17,513 --> 00:36:20,307
My own brother planted
a baby inside me.

375
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,311
Lineth?

376
00:36:24,937 --> 00:36:25,562
Lineth?

377
00:36:25,587 --> 00:36:27,005
Are you okay?

378
00:36:33,904 --> 00:36:35,532
We couldn't let anybody know.

379
00:36:35,756 --> 00:36:38,926
So while Shiony
was gone last year,

380
00:36:38,951 --> 00:36:40,970
because Japan
went on a lockdown,

381
00:36:41,245 --> 00:36:42,162
my brother decided

382
00:36:42,187 --> 00:36:44,759
to bring me home to the Visayas.

383
00:36:45,557 --> 00:36:49,353
To live and give birth
there for the time-being.

384
00:36:49,378 --> 00:36:51,407
I'm pained by what happened.

385
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,856
Once again,

386
00:36:52,881 --> 00:36:55,050
I felt depressed

387
00:36:55,075 --> 00:36:56,827
while carrying the child.

388
00:36:57,277 --> 00:36:58,237
There were times

389
00:36:58,262 --> 00:37:00,589
when I wanted to abort the child.

390
00:37:00,614 --> 00:37:02,491
My sadness went on

391
00:37:02,516 --> 00:37:04,059
until I gave birth.

392
00:37:05,018 --> 00:37:07,020
My brother wasn't by my side.

393
00:37:07,045 --> 00:37:10,799
I felt alone and abandoned.

394
00:37:31,295 --> 00:37:32,212
Lineth?

395
00:37:33,755 --> 00:37:34,590
Lineth.

396
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,716
Don't cry in here.

397
00:37:35,716 --> 00:37:36,925
Get it together.

398
00:37:36,925 --> 00:37:38,177
Wipe your tears.

399
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,961
Stop crying, Lineth.

400
00:37:40,512 --> 00:37:41,680
People might think

401
00:37:41,705 --> 00:37:42,956
I made you cry.

402
00:38:00,841 --> 00:38:04,761
Rod, I know it's too much but...

403
00:38:04,786 --> 00:38:07,056
Can I borrow your phone?

404
00:38:07,081 --> 00:38:09,792
I just need to call my brother.

405
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:10,559
Sure.

406
00:38:10,584 --> 00:38:12,186
But it's prepaid
so just hurry up.

407
00:38:12,211 --> 00:38:13,618
It might run out of credits.

408
00:38:13,854 --> 00:38:15,189
Do you know his number?

409
00:38:15,214 --> 00:38:17,007
Yeah, I have it memorized.

410
00:38:17,032 --> 00:38:17,991
I'll be quick.

411
00:38:28,887 --> 00:38:30,102
Damn it,

412
00:38:30,746 --> 00:38:32,581
the call won't connect.

413
00:38:32,606 --> 00:38:35,009
Maybe he changed his number.

414
00:38:35,734 --> 00:38:37,778
Actually, he doesn't know

415
00:38:37,803 --> 00:38:39,555
we're coming to see him.

416
00:38:42,032 --> 00:38:44,076
Can I borrow it again later?

417
00:38:44,118 --> 00:38:46,759
- I'll just try again.
- Sure, no problem.

418
00:38:47,454 --> 00:38:54,688
The victims are Chief Security
Sgt. Melchor Mercado and his two men...

419
00:38:57,439 --> 00:38:59,233
Passengers for San Rafael get ready.

420
00:38:59,258 --> 00:39:00,592
We're here.

421
00:39:00,617 --> 00:39:02,844
Check and keep an
eye on your belongings.

422
00:39:02,869 --> 00:39:04,162
Thank you very much.

423
00:39:22,155 --> 00:39:23,156
By the way, Lineth.

424
00:39:23,181 --> 00:39:25,049
What's the plan
when you get to Segovia?

425
00:39:25,217 --> 00:39:27,135
How are you going to tell

426
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,521
your brother's wife
about that baby?

427
00:39:30,264 --> 00:39:32,849
Shiony returned
home last month.

428
00:39:32,874 --> 00:39:35,493
She already knows
what happened.

429
00:39:36,098 --> 00:39:40,524
We couldn't keep it a secret
from our neighbors.

430
00:39:40,549 --> 00:39:43,962
She found out soon enough
from her friends in town.

431
00:39:44,344 --> 00:39:47,306
I don't know what
to tell them, honestly.

432
00:39:47,949 --> 00:39:50,034
I wouldn't trade
places with you.

433
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,890
Your life's like a tv series.

434
00:39:56,171 --> 00:40:00,425
What's your baby's name,
by the way?

435
00:40:00,502 --> 00:40:01,587
Ah.

436
00:40:01,612 --> 00:40:03,238
This is Lindsay.

437
00:40:03,263 --> 00:40:05,641
My beautiful baby girl.

438
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,869
Lineth, it might be a good
idea for you and your baby

439
00:40:08,869 --> 00:40:12,331
to freshen up or take a shower
when we get to the stopover.

440
00:40:12,356 --> 00:40:14,650
To keep the baby safe.

441
00:40:16,126 --> 00:40:18,295
Can you tell me your
complete name, sir?

442
00:40:18,295 --> 00:40:20,881
Besides, what do you do?

443
00:40:20,881 --> 00:40:22,424
Do you have a family?

444
00:40:22,449 --> 00:40:24,206
Kids? Wife?

445
00:40:24,651 --> 00:40:28,280
I am Rodolfo Padilla, Jr.

446
00:40:28,305 --> 00:40:29,640
I'm a seaman.

447
00:40:29,665 --> 00:40:32,620
I went to Manila
to settle my required documents.

448
00:40:32,701 --> 00:40:34,786
In a week,

449
00:40:34,811 --> 00:40:37,235
I'll be boarding the luxury ship.

450
00:40:37,584 --> 00:40:40,946
And I'm single,
and ready to mingle.

451
00:40:45,405 --> 00:40:47,240
So you're a seaman.

452
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,469
Why?

453
00:40:50,494 --> 00:40:52,454
Do you have something
against our occupation?

454
00:40:52,479 --> 00:40:54,940
My conscience is clear.

455
00:41:05,734 --> 00:41:08,070
I didn't have money
to buy a ticket.

456
00:41:08,095 --> 00:41:09,179
I just took a risk

457
00:41:09,204 --> 00:41:11,729
boarding that ship bound for Manila.

458
00:41:11,823 --> 00:41:14,415
I managed to slip in

459
00:41:14,534 --> 00:41:16,453
but they caught me...

460
00:41:16,478 --> 00:41:18,563
The ship's security guards.

461
00:41:18,563 --> 00:41:21,900
They took me to the
Chief Security's office.

462
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,487
That's where my
hellish nightmare began.

463
00:41:25,487 --> 00:41:27,823
With those fucking monsters.

464
00:41:28,646 --> 00:41:30,815
Who's this?

465
00:41:30,884 --> 00:41:32,344
Why'd you bring her here?

466
00:41:32,369 --> 00:41:34,413
Sir, we caught her skipping the line.

467
00:41:34,438 --> 00:41:35,939
No ticket.

468
00:41:36,331 --> 00:41:38,041
Trying to get a free ride, I think.

469
00:41:39,373 --> 00:41:41,352
The ticket doesn't
even cost that much.

470
00:41:41,873 --> 00:41:44,665
Why'd you board the
ship without a ticket?

471
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:47,157
Do you think this is a charity?

472
00:41:48,529 --> 00:41:50,990
We've got people working hard

473
00:41:51,015 --> 00:41:54,517
so they could afford
a ticket to this ship.

474
00:41:55,028 --> 00:41:57,126
And you expect a free ride?

475
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,337
I'm sorry, sir.

476
00:42:04,911 --> 00:42:06,986
I just don't have any money.

477
00:42:09,423 --> 00:42:11,071
No money for fare.

478
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,620
What do you want
us to do with you?

479
00:42:17,053 --> 00:42:18,876
Should we throw
you off the ship?

480
00:42:19,153 --> 00:42:20,453
Please don't!

481
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,563
I just really need
to get to Manila.

482
00:42:24,588 --> 00:42:25,939
I'm really sorry.

483
00:42:25,964 --> 00:42:28,341
We no longer have a house

484
00:42:28,366 --> 00:42:30,118
to return to in the province.

485
00:42:31,321 --> 00:42:33,909
My husband is in Nueva Segovia.

486
00:42:33,934 --> 00:42:35,462
I just need to get there.

487
00:42:36,518 --> 00:42:38,493
You're looking for
your husband, are you?

488
00:42:42,103 --> 00:42:45,837
That's what you all say
when we catch you.

489
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:48,392
I'm tired of those same excuses.

490
00:42:55,157 --> 00:42:56,409
What's in there?

491
00:42:59,122 --> 00:43:00,123
- Sanchez.
- Sir.

492
00:43:01,349 --> 00:43:03,351
- Check her bag.
- Okay, sir.

493
00:43:03,376 --> 00:43:06,046
She might be hiding
some cash or jewelry.

494
00:43:06,071 --> 00:43:08,406
Maybe she can pay
with something else.

495
00:43:10,202 --> 00:43:13,230
Sir, I'm sorry.
That's all I have.

496
00:43:13,255 --> 00:43:15,741
- Sir.
- You can take all of it.

497
00:43:17,224 --> 00:43:19,142
This model is ancient.

498
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,868
What am I supposed
to do with this?

499
00:43:22,408 --> 00:43:24,618
It's useless.

500
00:43:25,857 --> 00:43:26,608
Here.

501
00:43:27,651 --> 00:43:28,652
God.

502
00:43:29,861 --> 00:43:30,904
Sanchez.

503
00:43:30,904 --> 00:43:32,155
Just take a picture.

504
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,765
I already did, sir.

505
00:43:34,574 --> 00:43:36,493
I'll report her
to the office later.

506
00:43:37,828 --> 00:43:38,995
Filed a blotter, too?

507
00:43:38,995 --> 00:43:40,163
Yes, sir.

508
00:43:41,414 --> 00:43:42,290
We're in the clear, then?

509
00:43:42,315 --> 00:43:43,321
Yes, sir.

510
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,994
But sir, she stinks.

511
00:44:23,811 --> 00:44:25,479
But her skin looks smooth.

512
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:32,232
Hand them
your baby for now.

513
00:44:32,257 --> 00:44:33,470
- Sir?
- Give it to me.

514
00:44:33,495 --> 00:44:34,663
- Go on.
- Let me hold your baby.

515
00:44:34,688 --> 00:44:36,069
- Just do it.
- Please, sir.

516
00:44:36,094 --> 00:44:38,346
- Nothing's gonna happen to her.
- Don't take my baby.

517
00:44:38,346 --> 00:44:40,348
- Let go. Nothing's gonna happen.
- Come on.

518
00:44:40,348 --> 00:44:41,057
Just give it.

519
00:44:41,057 --> 00:44:43,310
Please have mercy.

520
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:44,936
- Come on.
- Not my baby.

521
00:44:44,936 --> 00:44:46,021
- Please, sir.
- Give it to me.

522
00:44:46,021 --> 00:44:47,397
I'll take care of it.

523
00:44:47,397 --> 00:44:48,982
Hush, hush, baby.

524
00:44:48,982 --> 00:44:50,525
- My baby…
- It's okay, baby.

525
00:44:50,525 --> 00:44:52,110
- Please, don't hurt her.
- Alright now.

526
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:54,070
- Don't take her away.
- No more crying.

527
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:55,572
It's all right.

528
00:44:58,992 --> 00:45:00,035
I'll call for you.

529
00:45:00,035 --> 00:45:01,745
You got it, sir.

530
00:45:13,131 --> 00:45:14,507
Take your clothes off.

531
00:45:16,092 --> 00:45:17,177
Take that off.

532
00:45:18,219 --> 00:45:19,262
I don't want to.

533
00:45:20,931 --> 00:45:21,890
Go on.

534
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:23,058
I don't want to.

535
00:45:23,058 --> 00:45:24,225
Take it off.

536
00:45:24,225 --> 00:45:26,353
- I don't want to.
- Go on.

537
00:45:26,353 --> 00:45:29,773
- I'm taking my clothes off.
- Please. Sir, have mercy.

538
00:45:29,773 --> 00:45:32,025
Your baby, there.

539
00:45:32,025 --> 00:45:33,318
We have your baby.

540
00:45:34,569 --> 00:45:35,779
My baby…

541
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:37,989
Get undressed.

542
00:45:39,032 --> 00:45:40,075
Go on.

543
00:45:43,009 --> 00:45:44,287
That's it.

544
00:45:46,706 --> 00:45:47,999
Your shirt, too.

545
00:45:54,464 --> 00:45:58,093
- Hurry up.
- Please don't, sir.

546
00:45:58,843 --> 00:46:00,637
Remove them.

547
00:46:01,805 --> 00:46:04,099
I don't want to.

548
00:46:04,933 --> 00:46:08,048
Think about your baby.

549
00:46:10,397 --> 00:46:12,190
Hurry up,

550
00:46:12,215 --> 00:46:14,926
so we can get it over with.

551
00:46:20,532 --> 00:46:21,574
Touch it.

552
00:46:24,577 --> 00:46:25,745
Touch it.

553
00:46:27,789 --> 00:46:29,666
Go on, hold it.

554
00:46:30,542 --> 00:46:32,711
It will be over soon.

555
00:46:33,962 --> 00:46:35,463
Go on.

556
00:46:39,634 --> 00:46:41,011
Do it.

557
00:46:43,263 --> 00:46:44,389
Hold it.

558
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:47,475
Put it in your mouth.

559
00:47:09,247 --> 00:47:11,474
Later. Take her later.

560
00:47:11,499 --> 00:47:12,834
- Sir.
- This won't take long.

561
00:47:12,834 --> 00:47:14,169
- It will be over soon.
- My baby...

562
00:47:14,169 --> 00:47:15,420
Give me back--

563
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:16,470
This won't take long.

564
00:47:17,689 --> 00:47:19,441
It'll be quick.

565
00:47:19,466 --> 00:47:21,693
- I said it'll be quick!
- My baby!

566
00:47:21,718 --> 00:47:22,552
Stop fussing!

567
00:47:22,577 --> 00:47:24,037
I don't want to!

568
00:47:25,221 --> 00:47:26,014
Stop moving!

569
00:47:27,907 --> 00:47:28,616
It's gonna be quick.

570
00:47:28,641 --> 00:47:30,376
Stop fussing
or I'll kill you!

571
00:47:31,102 --> 00:47:33,772
I'll fucking throw
you out, I swear.

572
00:47:34,481 --> 00:47:35,982
I said shut up.

573
00:47:41,029 --> 00:47:42,485
It's gonna be quick.

574
00:47:44,422 --> 00:47:46,396
Stop fussing or I'll kill you!

575
00:47:46,421 --> 00:47:48,251
I'll kill you!

576
00:48:12,852 --> 00:48:14,704
Come here. Your turn.

577
00:48:17,857 --> 00:48:19,181
Mister!

578
00:48:19,317 --> 00:48:21,142
Sir!

579
00:50:53,346 --> 00:50:54,847
Give her something to eat.

580
00:50:55,348 --> 00:50:56,391
Yes, sir.

581
00:50:57,767 --> 00:50:58,643
Sit here.

582
00:50:59,452 --> 00:51:00,596
And this too...

583
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:01,746
What are you waiting for?

584
00:51:01,771 --> 00:51:02,647
Sit here.

585
00:51:03,481 --> 00:51:04,357
Sit.

586
00:51:13,032 --> 00:51:14,742
Eat.

587
00:51:15,451 --> 00:51:16,786
You know the drill.

588
00:51:17,704 --> 00:51:19,372
Don't tell anyone.

589
00:51:20,832 --> 00:51:23,167
You know what
will happen to you.

590
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:24,711
Understand?

591
00:51:26,546 --> 00:51:27,755
Go ahead. Eat.

592
00:52:24,585 --> 00:52:26,921
Can you even pay us,
you assholes?

593
00:52:27,023 --> 00:52:29,025
This isn't some fuck now,

594
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:30,676
pay later scheme.

595
00:52:31,127 --> 00:52:34,047
Yeah, you brokeass perverts.

596
00:52:34,072 --> 00:52:36,240
Not even phone
credits or e-cash.

597
00:52:38,092 --> 00:52:40,553
You're the ones
who owe us.

598
00:52:40,578 --> 00:52:43,296
We allow you to get
on board this ship.

599
00:52:43,321 --> 00:52:44,572
Right.

600
00:52:44,682 --> 00:52:47,022
You score how many
clients being here?

601
00:52:47,643 --> 00:52:49,139
Two? Three?

602
00:52:49,604 --> 00:52:50,632
Fuck,

603
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:53,353
you should be
giving us a cut.

604
00:52:54,894 --> 00:52:58,413
You think you can
just do your business

605
00:52:58,714 --> 00:53:00,280
without paying your dues?

606
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:04,018
No such thing as a free lunch.

607
00:53:04,894 --> 00:53:05,895
Go ahead.

608
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,672
We'll look out for you.

609
00:53:09,774 --> 00:53:12,026
Massage some
aching balls in here.

610
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,918
How much?

611
00:53:29,627 --> 00:53:31,421
Go on. Do your thing.

612
00:53:41,472 --> 00:53:42,473
Thanks.

613
00:53:46,421 --> 00:53:48,498
Good evening, ma'am.

614
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:51,725
Can I sit here for a while?

615
00:53:52,024 --> 00:53:54,264
There? Nobody's staying there.

616
00:53:59,882 --> 00:54:01,300
Good evening.

617
00:54:01,325 --> 00:54:02,869
Good evening, ma'am.

618
00:54:02,894 --> 00:54:05,077
Are you a masseuse?

619
00:54:06,472 --> 00:54:09,725
This is my side-hustle

620
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:11,952
but my own back hurts.

621
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:14,983
It's cramping.
It won't let me sleep properly.

622
00:54:15,072 --> 00:54:16,413
It really hurts.

623
00:54:17,383 --> 00:54:18,342
You know, ma'am,

624
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:20,110
I know how to massage, too.

625
00:54:20,219 --> 00:54:21,429
If you want,

626
00:54:21,429 --> 00:54:23,014
I could help

627
00:54:23,014 --> 00:54:24,891
relieve your back pain.

628
00:54:24,891 --> 00:54:26,350
All right, please, dear.

629
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:28,853
Let me put my baby down here.

630
00:54:28,853 --> 00:54:30,146
It hurts.

631
00:54:30,146 --> 00:54:32,106
Must be a stubborn knot.

632
00:54:39,453 --> 00:54:41,080
Okay, please turn around.

633
00:54:42,575 --> 00:54:43,743
Yes, please.

634
00:54:43,768 --> 00:54:45,770
Right there. Ouch.

635
00:54:46,093 --> 00:54:49,996
- There we go.
- that storm, our roof was blown off.

636
00:54:50,105 --> 00:54:53,066
our roof was blown off.

637
00:54:53,144 --> 00:54:53,895
Oh, my god!

638
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,379
We were all soaked.

639
00:54:55,404 --> 00:54:58,627
And then my back started hurting.

640
00:54:59,837 --> 00:55:04,322
Ma'am, do you have
efficascent oil there?

641
00:55:04,347 --> 00:55:05,431
Ah, yes.

642
00:55:05,456 --> 00:55:09,252
I always carry oils with me.

643
00:55:09,964 --> 00:55:12,133
Here, here.

644
00:55:13,231 --> 00:55:16,234
I always have it here.

645
00:55:19,962 --> 00:55:22,089
Coconut oil

646
00:55:22,114 --> 00:55:26,827
and various types of herbs.

647
00:55:26,827 --> 00:55:28,454
This is effective.

648
00:55:28,454 --> 00:55:29,872
Go on.

649
00:55:40,299 --> 00:55:41,259
Keep going, dear.

650
00:55:42,385 --> 00:55:43,898
Ouch.

651
00:55:51,269 --> 00:55:53,396
There. How does it feel, granny?

652
00:55:53,896 --> 00:55:54,814
Oh, yes.

653
00:55:56,107 --> 00:55:58,651
You are a good masseuse,

654
00:55:58,903 --> 00:56:01,397
It hurts a bit but

655
00:56:01,796 --> 00:56:04,257
it also feels good.

656
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:07,927
You see, I took up
a vocational course

657
00:56:07,952 --> 00:56:09,453
as a massage therapist.

658
00:56:09,478 --> 00:56:11,234
So I know a few things.

659
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,083
There we go.

660
00:56:14,083 --> 00:56:15,418
Oh, thank you.

661
00:56:16,669 --> 00:56:18,421
Here it is.

662
00:56:18,729 --> 00:56:20,064
Is it better?

663
00:56:20,089 --> 00:56:21,299
Ah, yes.

664
00:56:21,324 --> 00:56:23,267
I feel better.

665
00:56:24,051 --> 00:56:24,844
All right.

666
00:56:24,869 --> 00:56:28,181
Always remember
to apply oil, okay?

667
00:56:28,239 --> 00:56:31,158
To reduce your back pain.

668
00:56:31,183 --> 00:56:32,391
I'll remember.

669
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:51,762
Granny, what's all those seeds?

670
00:56:51,787 --> 00:56:54,457
What are they for?

671
00:57:29,325 --> 00:57:33,120
These are seeds
of herbal plants--

672
00:57:36,207 --> 00:57:39,210
But please keep it quiet, dear.

673
00:57:39,235 --> 00:57:41,070
It's a secret.

674
00:57:49,278 --> 00:57:52,365
I gathered these seeds

675
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:55,935
from the mountains
and forests of Visayas.

676
00:57:56,721 --> 00:57:58,723
These seeds,

677
00:57:58,748 --> 00:58:01,584
are not herbal medicine.

678
00:58:01,732 --> 00:58:03,795
These are poison.

679
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:20,643
You can use them

680
00:58:20,668 --> 00:58:22,396
against your enemies

681
00:58:22,421 --> 00:58:24,122
or against bad people.

682
00:58:24,563 --> 00:58:26,232
Listen to me carefully,

683
00:58:26,257 --> 00:58:30,490
this one is an order for
my customer from Binondo.

684
00:58:30,712 --> 00:58:35,550
He asks me to look
for unique herbal plants

685
00:58:35,658 --> 00:58:37,535
with poisonous properties

686
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,603
and they process them.

687
00:58:39,603 --> 00:58:41,313
I don't know who
buys them from him,

688
00:58:41,338 --> 00:58:44,592
but a lot of customers
are looking for these.

689
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,257
How do you mean poisonous?

690
00:58:53,327 --> 00:58:55,204
This, for example.

691
00:58:55,244 --> 00:58:56,964
This one

692
00:58:58,055 --> 00:59:01,142
is called Butang-butang.

693
00:59:01,167 --> 00:59:04,847
It is obtained from soil
where Mangroves grow.

694
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,046
and it's dangerous

695
00:59:06,071 --> 00:59:09,278
because it contains a toxic sap

696
00:59:09,717 --> 00:59:11,677
more commonly known

697
00:59:11,702 --> 00:59:14,622
as milky juice or latex.

698
00:59:15,322 --> 00:59:19,201
One drop of this in your eye,

699
00:59:19,226 --> 00:59:20,699
you'll go blind in an instant.

700
00:59:21,869 --> 00:59:24,855
This is called Katana.

701
00:59:25,291 --> 00:59:28,294
It comes from the castor plant.

702
00:59:28,409 --> 00:59:30,619
We know that castor oil

703
00:59:30,644 --> 00:59:33,121
can treat various types of diseases.

704
00:59:33,146 --> 00:59:34,535
But this one,

705
00:59:35,176 --> 00:59:40,496
it's more dangerous
if a person ingests

706
00:59:40,521 --> 00:59:42,417
even one of these seeds,

707
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:45,269
one might feel

708
00:59:45,294 --> 00:59:47,457
a burning sensation in his throat.

709
00:59:47,493 --> 00:59:49,433
They might have diarrhea,

710
00:59:49,492 --> 00:59:50,869
vomiting,

711
00:59:50,925 --> 00:59:53,660
and within three to five hours,

712
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,303
they will die.

713
01:00:05,417 --> 01:00:09,338
This one is called Rosary P

714
01:00:09,363 --> 01:00:12,321
or better known as "Matang Ire".

715
01:00:12,321 --> 01:00:14,256
Ah, I know this one.

716
01:00:14,281 --> 01:00:16,267
They make these into bracelets.

717
01:00:16,292 --> 01:00:18,691
Protects babies
from the evil eye.

718
01:00:19,255 --> 01:00:22,967
This is the most dangerous of all.

719
01:00:23,224 --> 01:00:27,937
You swallow one of these seeds

720
01:00:27,962 --> 01:00:30,347
and in mere moments,
you'll be dead.

721
01:00:30,898 --> 01:00:34,068
That's how dangerous this seed is.

722
01:00:34,093 --> 01:00:37,847
More dangerous
than the first two.

723
01:00:37,847 --> 01:00:40,449
It is more poisonous,

724
01:00:40,494 --> 01:00:44,080
but all these three are dangerous.

725
01:01:23,017 --> 01:01:27,413
Granny, can I sleep here?

726
01:01:27,438 --> 01:01:28,814
We don't have a ticket

727
01:01:28,814 --> 01:01:31,550
so we don't have
a bed to sleep on.

728
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:32,585
It's for my baby.

729
01:01:32,610 --> 01:01:33,485
- I can sleep on the floor.
- You silly!

730
01:01:33,485 --> 01:01:34,987
Both of you sleep on that bed.

731
01:01:34,987 --> 01:01:36,361
It's not taken.

732
01:01:36,386 --> 01:01:37,512
You can have it.

733
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:40,451
Go ahead. You two sleep there.

734
01:01:41,744 --> 01:01:43,120
Thank you, Granny.

735
01:01:48,959 --> 01:01:50,050
Miss.

736
01:01:50,075 --> 01:01:50,826
Miss.

737
01:01:50,965 --> 01:01:52,425
Sleep later.

738
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:54,201
The captain wants you.

739
01:01:54,286 --> 01:01:55,663
Come with us.

740
01:01:55,688 --> 01:01:57,731
Give her your baby.

741
01:02:00,137 --> 01:02:01,096
Hurry up!

742
01:02:03,474 --> 01:02:04,892
She might cry.

743
01:02:04,892 --> 01:02:06,810
Just let her take care of it.

744
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,521
Come on.

745
01:02:09,546 --> 01:02:11,840
Granny, take the baby.

746
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:16,384
Granny, I'll leave her
with you for a bit.

747
01:02:49,411 --> 01:02:50,537
- Come in.
- Captain.

748
01:02:50,562 --> 01:02:52,308
She's the girl
we told you about.

749
01:02:52,333 --> 01:02:53,375
Okay.

750
01:02:53,415 --> 01:02:54,416
Okay, go in.

751
01:02:54,441 --> 01:02:56,285
Captain wants to meet you.

752
01:03:02,282 --> 01:03:03,659
Come in.

753
01:03:05,953 --> 01:03:07,037
Go in.

754
01:03:23,929 --> 01:03:26,849
My boys told me

755
01:03:26,849 --> 01:03:28,392
you're the one who

756
01:03:28,392 --> 01:03:30,811
got on my ship

757
01:03:30,811 --> 01:03:33,330
without a ticket.

758
01:03:33,998 --> 01:03:36,510
Carrying a baby at that.

759
01:03:36,631 --> 01:03:38,815
Is it even your baby?

760
01:03:43,449 --> 01:03:45,284
Why don't you answer?

761
01:03:46,035 --> 01:03:49,963
Chief Mercado told me

762
01:03:52,583 --> 01:03:53,959
that you're a masseuse.

763
01:03:53,959 --> 01:03:55,044
Is that true?

764
01:03:55,044 --> 01:03:55,919
Yes, sir.

765
01:03:56,587 --> 01:03:57,838
Really now?

766
01:03:59,256 --> 01:04:00,966
Come sit close to me.

767
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,010
Come here.

768
01:04:03,844 --> 01:04:05,888
Just sit.

769
01:04:07,819 --> 01:04:10,002
Lighten up.
There's nothing to be scared of.

770
01:04:12,229 --> 01:04:13,658
And I heard that,

771
01:04:15,294 --> 01:04:17,666
you provide extra service?

772
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:21,627
I am not offering extra service.

773
01:04:21,723 --> 01:04:22,807
Oh?

774
01:04:22,878 --> 01:04:24,797
They just forced me.

775
01:04:25,866 --> 01:04:27,367
They threatened me

776
01:04:27,743 --> 01:04:29,745
and exploited me.

777
01:04:31,038 --> 01:04:33,540
My only fault was

778
01:04:33,596 --> 01:04:35,918
I got on the ship without paying.

779
01:04:37,211 --> 01:04:39,338
We were devastated by the typhoon.

780
01:04:40,156 --> 01:04:41,490
We lost our home.

781
01:04:43,759 --> 01:04:44,593
I gave birth

782
01:04:44,618 --> 01:04:47,080
without a penny
to pay the hospital.

783
01:04:48,472 --> 01:04:50,861
I didn't have my husband
by my side either.

784
01:04:53,644 --> 01:04:56,313
So this is how it's gonna go.

785
01:04:57,372 --> 01:04:58,707
To be honest, you're right.

786
01:04:58,732 --> 01:05:02,986
You tried to get
a free ride, that's it.

787
01:05:03,011 --> 01:05:04,054
But,

788
01:05:04,671 --> 01:05:07,580
can you offer something

789
01:05:07,866 --> 01:05:10,786
to make us look the other way?

790
01:05:11,495 --> 01:05:13,372
I ask for a simple thing.

791
01:05:14,331 --> 01:05:16,458
If you could massage me.

792
01:05:28,846 --> 01:05:30,430
You okay?

793
01:05:32,558 --> 01:05:34,518
Where do you want to start?

794
01:05:34,935 --> 01:05:36,812
Up here or down here?

795
01:05:40,059 --> 01:05:42,019
Don't be afraid.

796
01:05:50,909 --> 01:05:52,077
Are you sure?

797
01:05:53,662 --> 01:05:55,455
What about your crime?

798
01:05:56,498 --> 01:05:57,791
I'll throw you into the sea.

799
01:05:58,709 --> 01:06:00,002
Please no.

800
01:06:00,627 --> 01:06:02,462
Get on with it.

801
01:06:03,881 --> 01:06:05,340
Can you do it?

802
01:06:06,508 --> 01:06:07,467
All right.

803
01:06:19,086 --> 01:06:21,380
Didn't you say

804
01:06:21,857 --> 01:06:23,713
there's a special offer?

805
01:06:27,362 --> 01:06:28,739
Let's do it.

806
01:08:05,815 --> 01:08:08,621
Are you for real?

807
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:10,354
I can't believe it.

808
01:08:11,358 --> 01:08:14,666
Lineth, we can sue them if you want.

809
01:08:15,201 --> 01:08:17,620
That's rape, if you think about it.

810
01:08:18,307 --> 01:08:19,683
I told you.

811
01:08:20,490 --> 01:08:22,409
They're monsters.

812
01:08:23,533 --> 01:08:25,284
Nevermind.

813
01:08:25,331 --> 01:08:27,709
Karma will get to them.

814
01:08:28,608 --> 01:08:31,236
Who knows, they
could be dead by now.

815
01:08:32,321 --> 01:08:33,113
What was that?

816
01:08:33,138 --> 01:08:34,931
Did you say they're dead?

817
01:08:35,166 --> 01:08:36,368
Nothing.

818
01:08:39,636 --> 01:08:40,512
Shit,

819
01:08:40,537 --> 01:08:42,080
you know what,

820
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,457
let's take a break.

821
01:08:43,482 --> 01:08:45,484
We've been talking for a while.

822
01:09:04,274 --> 01:09:07,193
Okay. Get some sleep, Rod.

823
01:09:14,043 --> 01:09:16,971
You haven't heard all of it.

824
01:09:17,448 --> 01:09:19,617
If you only knew,

825
01:09:19,642 --> 01:09:22,103
you'd be afraid of me.

826
01:10:21,614 --> 01:10:23,742
You're back.

827
01:10:23,935 --> 01:10:27,980
- Who were those people?
- They're monsters.

828
01:10:28,005 --> 01:10:30,132
What have they done to you?

829
01:10:33,469 --> 01:10:36,361
I need your seeds.

830
01:10:46,596 --> 01:10:48,932
Lord have mercy on you.

831
01:10:48,957 --> 01:10:50,959
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

832
01:10:59,092 --> 01:11:00,135
Oh,

833
01:11:00,927 --> 01:11:02,929
still hanging around, are you?

834
01:11:05,282 --> 01:11:07,701
What do you want?

835
01:11:07,726 --> 01:11:10,854
Where can I get
the captain's drink?

836
01:11:10,854 --> 01:11:11,980
Over there.

837
01:11:12,005 --> 01:11:13,924
In the kitchen.

838
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:16,172
Get the whiskey.

839
01:11:16,443 --> 01:11:17,611
That's what he likes.

840
01:11:20,714 --> 01:11:23,258
Boss, we're out of drinks, too.

841
01:11:23,283 --> 01:11:26,203
- Hold it right there.
- I need more, too.

842
01:11:26,228 --> 01:11:28,980
Open up some bottles for us, too.

843
01:11:30,248 --> 01:11:31,791
Do it.

844
01:11:33,126 --> 01:11:34,419
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

845
01:11:37,797 --> 01:11:39,966
You really wanna get hammered.

846
01:11:47,432 --> 01:11:49,935
Your bottle's empty.

847
01:11:52,646 --> 01:11:55,482
Caridad seems drunk already.

848
01:11:56,483 --> 01:11:57,859
I can drink more.

849
01:12:01,488 --> 01:12:02,656
What was that, boss?

850
01:12:02,681 --> 01:12:05,058
I said, you've had
your drinks filled.

851
01:12:05,826 --> 01:12:07,244
More than our fill.

852
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:14,167
Can you stand up?

853
01:12:14,167 --> 01:12:16,294
Our drinks are here.

854
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:22,050
So you're our waitress now, too?

855
01:12:24,344 --> 01:12:25,053
Oh,

856
01:12:25,078 --> 01:12:26,070
Cheers.

857
01:12:27,697 --> 01:12:29,824
- Thanks, sexy!
- Thank you.

858
01:12:29,849 --> 01:12:30,909
Thank you.

859
01:12:30,934 --> 01:12:32,410
Enjoy.

860
01:12:32,435 --> 01:12:33,954
- Wow.
- Come back later, yeah?

861
01:12:33,979 --> 01:12:35,605
Telling us to enjoy ourselves, huh?

862
01:12:35,630 --> 01:12:38,133
You'll be our appetizer.

863
01:12:39,859 --> 01:12:42,289
Cheers!

864
01:14:36,935 --> 01:14:38,478
I can't breathe.

865
01:14:39,562 --> 01:14:41,481
My hands are going numb.

866
01:14:42,038 --> 01:14:43,707
I'm getting dizzy.

867
01:14:43,732 --> 01:14:46,192
Shit, Captain.
Could be your blood pressure?

868
01:14:46,252 --> 01:14:47,379
Should I call a doctor?

869
01:14:47,489 --> 01:14:49,057
No need.
I'm sure it's nothing.

870
01:14:50,552 --> 01:14:51,655
For the mean time,

871
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:53,302
you take charge, okay?

872
01:14:54,744 --> 01:14:56,234
I'll step out for some fresh air.

873
01:14:56,259 --> 01:14:58,219
We're almost at the port anyway.

874
01:14:58,244 --> 01:15:00,329
- I'll be right back.
- Okay, Captain.

875
01:15:29,195 --> 01:15:30,280
Hey.

876
01:15:31,214 --> 01:15:34,426
What's your plan
once we get to the pier?

877
01:15:34,451 --> 01:15:37,078
What'll happen to
you and your baby?

878
01:15:39,289 --> 01:15:43,251
To be honest,
I don’t know, granny.

879
01:15:44,522 --> 01:15:47,400
But take care of
yourself, won't you?

880
01:15:47,589 --> 01:15:49,924
And don't forget

881
01:15:49,949 --> 01:15:53,578
to apply oils on your back.

882
01:15:54,763 --> 01:15:58,057
I'll miss your massages.

883
01:15:59,559 --> 01:16:01,478
I want you to know

884
01:16:01,503 --> 01:16:03,796
how grateful I am for your help.

885
01:16:04,314 --> 01:16:05,857
It meant a lot, granny.

886
01:16:06,483 --> 01:16:07,776
Come.

887
01:16:11,988 --> 01:16:13,573
Can I get a hug?

888
01:16:13,598 --> 01:16:15,287
Thank you, granny.

889
01:16:25,685 --> 01:16:28,730
You take care of yourself,

890
01:16:28,755 --> 01:16:30,724
and take care of your baby.

891
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:33,568
Take care of her.

892
01:16:33,786 --> 01:16:35,830
Thank you, granny.
Be safe always.

893
01:16:35,855 --> 01:16:38,024
I'll go ahead.

894
01:17:35,129 --> 01:17:39,843
Hello. You'd better stop the trip,
The winds and rain are too strong,

895
01:17:39,868 --> 01:17:42,396
it's flooding because of the
storm, it's signal number four.

896
01:17:43,121 --> 01:17:44,998
Sorry, dear passengers.

897
01:17:45,023 --> 01:17:46,968
I just have an announcement.

898
01:17:47,267 --> 01:17:49,978
We will not be able
to continue our journey

899
01:17:50,003 --> 01:17:52,130
because the rain
is quite heavy in Candava

900
01:17:52,155 --> 01:17:53,606
and it's been flooded.

901
01:17:53,631 --> 01:17:55,154
But don't worry.

902
01:17:55,275 --> 01:17:56,693
Our bus station

903
01:17:56,718 --> 01:17:59,232
will pay for your lodgings tonight

904
01:17:59,279 --> 01:18:02,318
so you can rest comfortably.

905
01:18:02,699 --> 01:18:04,534
And for everyone's safety,

906
01:18:04,559 --> 01:18:06,160
we shall continue
the journey tomorrow.

907
01:18:06,185 --> 01:18:07,604
Please bear with us.

908
01:18:07,629 --> 01:18:08,963
Thank you very much.

909
01:18:13,902 --> 01:18:15,069
San Leonardo's flooded.

910
01:18:15,094 --> 01:18:16,596
We can't pass through Candava.

911
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:18,698
Wait there.

912
01:18:18,698 --> 01:18:20,074
I need to make a call.

913
01:18:28,291 --> 01:18:30,585
I need to get home.

914
01:18:31,419 --> 01:18:33,171
We need to get home tonight.

915
01:18:35,381 --> 01:18:36,841
What about our family?

916
01:18:53,358 --> 01:18:54,901
I can't make any calls.

917
01:18:55,735 --> 01:18:57,028
No service.

918
01:18:57,904 --> 01:19:00,740
If you want, we can
go down at the stopover.

919
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:02,367
Let's have something to eat.

920
01:19:02,367 --> 01:19:03,117
That alright with you?

921
01:19:03,117 --> 01:19:04,535
Is that so?

922
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,647
I was going to ask if
I could make a call.

923
01:19:08,414 --> 01:19:09,958
But nevermind.

924
01:19:09,983 --> 01:19:11,643
I can try tomorrow.

925
01:19:11,668 --> 01:19:13,252
Okay. No choice.

926
01:19:13,277 --> 01:19:16,614
Maybe there'll be phone
service at the station.

927
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:40,947
When you're done eating,

928
01:19:40,947 --> 01:19:42,991
the hotel's right this way.

929
01:19:42,991 --> 01:19:45,493
Courtesy of our bus station

930
01:19:45,493 --> 01:19:47,078
for your convenience.

931
01:19:47,078 --> 01:19:48,913
We'll continue with our journey

932
01:19:48,913 --> 01:19:50,915
first thing tomorrow.

933
01:19:50,915 --> 01:19:52,166
Thank you all.

934
01:19:54,711 --> 01:19:57,130
I ordered rice,

935
01:19:57,130 --> 01:19:59,882
ginger chicken soup
with horseradish for you.

936
01:19:59,882 --> 01:20:01,592
Good for your breast milk.

937
01:20:01,592 --> 01:20:02,927
Really?

938
01:20:02,927 --> 01:20:04,345
Thanks.

939
01:20:04,345 --> 01:20:08,016
Thanks for being so nice

940
01:20:08,016 --> 01:20:10,601
but I really have
nothing to pay you with.

941
01:20:10,601 --> 01:20:13,104
I'm so embarrassed

942
01:20:13,129 --> 01:20:15,908
but you truly are a blessing
to me and my baby.

943
01:20:15,982 --> 01:20:17,358
If it wasn't for you,

944
01:20:17,358 --> 01:20:19,736
we've have been let off the bus

945
01:20:19,736 --> 01:20:21,529
and starving somewhere.

946
01:20:23,948 --> 01:20:25,299
Thank you, really.

947
01:20:25,324 --> 01:20:26,743
It's nothing.

948
01:20:26,743 --> 01:20:28,619
We're like friends by now.

949
01:20:52,727 --> 01:20:53,686
Are you full?

950
01:20:53,686 --> 01:20:56,272
Yes, I haven't had delicious
food in a long time.

951
01:20:56,272 --> 01:20:57,356
Thanks, Rod.

952
01:20:57,356 --> 01:20:58,066
I'll treat you

953
01:20:58,066 --> 01:20:59,442
- if you want some more.
- No, I'm good.

954
01:20:59,442 --> 01:21:02,612
- You sure?
- It's okay. We'll see you later.

955
01:21:02,612 --> 01:21:03,613
Wait here. I'll just load up my phone.

956
01:21:03,613 --> 01:21:04,614
Wait for me.

957
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:05,848
- Okay.
- I'll be right back.

958
01:21:07,658 --> 01:21:08,993
Yes, sir?

959
01:21:08,993 --> 01:21:10,703
Miss beautiful,
how much for this?

960
01:21:10,703 --> 01:21:11,496
800, sir.

961
01:21:11,496 --> 01:21:12,288
800?

962
01:21:12,288 --> 01:21:13,706
Can we do 500?

963
01:21:13,706 --> 01:21:14,665
Oh, no, sorry.

964
01:21:14,665 --> 01:21:15,750
Last price 800.

965
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:16,751
But you're so beautiful.

966
01:21:16,751 --> 01:21:18,377
Won't you give me a discount?

967
01:21:18,377 --> 01:21:19,670
Fine.

968
01:21:19,670 --> 01:21:21,130
- 500.
- You really are beautiful.

969
01:21:21,155 --> 01:21:22,242
Thank you.

970
01:21:23,382 --> 01:21:23,883
Thank you.

971
01:21:23,883 --> 01:21:25,051
Wait for your change.

972
01:21:25,051 --> 01:21:25,927
Does this have credits?

973
01:21:25,927 --> 01:21:27,430
Yes, it's all there.

974
01:21:27,929 --> 01:21:28,883
Thanks.

975
01:21:36,479 --> 01:21:37,355
LIneth.

976
01:21:40,024 --> 01:21:40,775
Second hand cell phone.

977
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:41,717
My gift to you.

978
01:21:43,194 --> 01:21:44,320
Yeah, right. Seriously?

979
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:44,987
Yes.

980
01:21:44,987 --> 01:21:46,656
You're giving this to me?

981
01:21:46,656 --> 01:21:48,199
Yeah, I saved my number, too.

982
01:21:48,199 --> 01:21:49,283
It has call credits.

983
01:21:49,283 --> 01:21:50,827
This is too much.
I can't accept it.

984
01:21:50,827 --> 01:21:52,078
No, you'll need that.

985
01:21:52,078 --> 01:21:53,746
So you can call your brother.

986
01:21:53,746 --> 01:21:54,956
I mean your husband.

987
01:21:56,624 --> 01:21:57,375
Here,

988
01:21:57,375 --> 01:21:58,292
keep this for your trip.

989
01:21:58,292 --> 01:21:59,335
You'll need it.

990
01:21:59,335 --> 01:22:01,337
This is way too much.

991
01:22:02,088 --> 01:22:03,131
I'm very grateful.

992
01:22:03,131 --> 01:22:04,799
You're too kind.

993
01:22:07,468 --> 01:22:10,179
Lineth, if you really
want to say thank you,

994
01:22:10,555 --> 01:22:11,931
maybe you'd like

995
01:22:11,931 --> 01:22:13,975
to keep me company in my room.

996
01:23:13,786 --> 01:23:15,663
Thank god.

997
01:23:15,688 --> 01:23:17,565
We can rest now.

998
01:23:17,851 --> 01:23:19,436
My joints are killing me.

999
01:23:19,461 --> 01:23:20,566
At least here,

1000
01:23:22,251 --> 01:23:23,886
we have a bed,

1001
01:23:23,911 --> 01:23:25,910
a TV, and air conditioning in here.

1002
01:23:26,756 --> 01:23:28,633
We can take it easy for a few hours.

1003
01:23:53,157 --> 01:23:55,027
Don't be afraid of me, okay?

1004
01:23:55,242 --> 01:23:56,993
I'm not like other men.

1005
01:23:57,018 --> 01:23:58,728
I'm nice.

1006
01:23:58,753 --> 01:24:01,230
I'm just concerned about
you and your daughter.

1007
01:24:02,141 --> 01:24:03,517
You should get changed.

1008
01:24:03,542 --> 01:24:05,246
She's asleep.

1009
01:24:06,212 --> 01:24:07,535
Take a shower.

1010
01:27:58,027 --> 01:27:59,028
Sorry.

1011
01:28:00,029 --> 01:28:02,323
You're probably thinking
I took advantage of you.

1012
01:28:05,993 --> 01:28:07,536
I was just carried away

1013
01:28:07,536 --> 01:28:09,038
by your stories

1014
01:28:09,038 --> 01:28:10,799
and the cold weather.

1015
01:28:11,207 --> 01:28:12,249
Nah,

1016
01:28:13,223 --> 01:28:14,767
no need for that.

1017
01:28:16,170 --> 01:28:17,963
I felt it back on the bus.

1018
01:28:19,465 --> 01:28:21,592
I knew we'll end up here.

1019
01:28:38,776 --> 01:28:41,945
A man wouldn't approach

1020
01:28:42,112 --> 01:28:44,156
a girl like me

1021
01:28:44,865 --> 01:28:46,325
without an agenda.

1022
01:28:46,617 --> 01:28:47,535
Am I right?

1023
01:29:01,131 --> 01:29:02,466
Fess up.

1024
01:29:02,967 --> 01:29:04,885
I caught you looking.

1025
01:29:05,970 --> 01:29:07,471
You were peeking at my nips

1026
01:29:07,496 --> 01:29:09,766
while my baby sucked on them.

1027
01:29:15,646 --> 01:29:17,481
Stop pretending.

1028
01:29:17,506 --> 01:29:19,550
I turn you on, don't I?

1029
01:29:20,359 --> 01:29:21,318
I can't believe you!

1030
01:29:21,318 --> 01:29:23,180
You mean all this time

1031
01:29:23,494 --> 01:29:24,995
you thought I was a creep?

1032
01:29:25,672 --> 01:29:27,257
You think I'm a pervert?

1033
01:29:27,282 --> 01:29:28,283
Yeah!

1034
01:29:28,308 --> 01:29:30,047
You're a son of a bitch.

1035
01:29:46,944 --> 01:29:49,321
You were lapping my pussy

1036
01:29:49,346 --> 01:29:51,348
like a starved dog.

1037
01:29:51,491 --> 01:29:53,617
You were sucking on my tits

1038
01:29:53,642 --> 01:29:55,644
harder than my baby.

1039
01:29:56,478 --> 01:29:59,356
You talk big about
not being a horndog.

1040
01:30:16,081 --> 01:30:18,709
All men, I swear to god.

1041
01:30:19,101 --> 01:30:22,938
You're just after our pussy.

1042
01:30:22,963 --> 01:30:25,883
After you get what you want,

1043
01:30:26,925 --> 01:30:28,677
you'll leave us.

1044
01:30:32,181 --> 01:30:33,724
Tomorrow,

1045
01:30:33,749 --> 01:30:35,209
you'll be gone.

1046
01:30:42,399 --> 01:30:44,777
No one really cares about me.

1047
01:30:45,653 --> 01:30:47,863
I'm just your plaything.

1048
01:31:22,606 --> 01:31:23,649
Hello, love?

1049
01:31:24,541 --> 01:31:25,918
I'm fine.

1050
01:31:25,943 --> 01:31:29,279
But we can't pass through
San Leonardo road tonight.

1051
01:31:29,382 --> 01:31:32,052
So I checked into a
hotel by the highway

1052
01:31:33,384 --> 01:31:36,553
instead of sleeping on the bus.

1053
01:31:36,578 --> 01:31:37,773
It's safer here.

1054
01:31:38,555 --> 01:31:40,516
I'll be home in a few hours.

1055
01:31:40,657 --> 01:31:41,574
Don't worry.

1056
01:31:41,613 --> 01:31:43,073
Kiss the kids for me.

1057
01:31:44,393 --> 01:31:45,773
And I love you. Okay?

1058
01:31:46,463 --> 01:31:48,132
Wait for me.
I'm coming home.

1059
01:32:10,738 --> 01:32:12,445
You're swimming in poop.

1060
01:32:12,823 --> 01:32:14,074
Hang on.

1061
01:32:48,776 --> 01:32:51,703
What's all these bottles?

1062
01:32:52,738 --> 01:32:54,698
Is your mom a witch or something?

1063
01:32:59,369 --> 01:33:00,412
Let me change your nappies.

1064
01:33:00,437 --> 01:33:01,730
You're stinking up the place.

1065
01:33:09,713 --> 01:33:11,548
Son of a bitch.

1066
01:33:13,509 --> 01:33:14,969
You're a boy?

1067
01:33:15,651 --> 01:33:17,278
Your mom told me you're a girl.

1068
01:33:17,303 --> 01:33:18,721
Why do you have a pee-wee?

1069
01:33:19,932 --> 01:33:22,602
Your mom's a little cuckoo, isn't she?

1070
01:33:22,851 --> 01:33:24,061
She called you Lindsay

1071
01:33:24,086 --> 01:33:25,879
but you're a boy.

1072
01:33:32,277 --> 01:33:33,654
Hold on.

1073
01:33:49,294 --> 01:33:50,337
Hi, hello, miss.

1074
01:33:50,337 --> 01:33:51,338
Your bus is leaving.

1075
01:33:51,363 --> 01:33:53,266
It's also time for checkout.

1076
01:33:56,510 --> 01:33:58,136
Okay, mister.

1077
01:33:58,720 --> 01:33:59,721
Okay, miss.

1078
01:35:04,244 --> 01:35:05,704
Miss. Excuse me.

1079
01:35:05,729 --> 01:35:07,731
Where's the man
you were with?

1080
01:35:08,749 --> 01:35:11,168
The seaman is gone, mister.

1081
01:35:48,330 --> 01:35:49,164
Eat up, sweetie.

1082
01:35:49,189 --> 01:35:50,482
Adam, put that down.

1083
01:35:50,888 --> 01:35:52,974
Gwen, take the gadget
from your brother.

1084
01:35:53,076 --> 01:35:54,786
Your noses are
always buried in them.

1085
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:56,480
Rod, put that aside.

1086
01:35:56,505 --> 01:35:57,798
The kids might see.

1087
01:35:57,823 --> 01:36:00,325
Mistake it for a toy.

1088
01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:01,927
Let's eat.

1089
01:36:05,030 --> 01:36:07,282
A woman was incarcerated
in Nueva Segovia

1090
01:36:07,307 --> 01:36:09,983
after meeting with
her brother and sister-in-law

1091
01:36:10,008 --> 01:36:13,230
who allegedly tipped the
police to help catch her

1092
01:36:13,230 --> 01:36:15,023
because she is no
longer in her right mind

1093
01:36:15,048 --> 01:36:16,830
and have come
to disturb their peace.

1094
01:36:17,084 --> 01:36:18,168
Based on the report,

1095
01:36:18,193 --> 01:36:20,967
the authorities have been
searching for several days

1096
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:23,298
for Maria Linetha Sagum,

1097
01:36:23,323 --> 01:36:24,282
twenty-three years old,

1098
01:36:24,282 --> 01:36:26,468
from the town of Roxas in Capiz.

1099
01:36:26,493 --> 01:36:28,537
CCTV footage shows

1100
01:36:28,562 --> 01:36:31,123
she entered the
canteen near the bus station

1101
01:36:31,123 --> 01:36:32,749
with her accomplice,

1102
01:36:32,774 --> 01:36:34,276
Rodolfo Padilla, Jr.

1103
01:36:34,393 --> 01:36:35,664
According to the police,

1104
01:36:35,689 --> 01:36:38,417
the two were planning
to sell the baby

1105
01:36:38,442 --> 01:36:40,777
which they stole from
a hospital in Capiz.

1106
01:36:41,046 --> 01:36:42,828
Based on follow-up reports,

1107
01:36:42,853 --> 01:36:46,905
this baby belongs to
Mario and Lolita Esteban.

1108
01:36:46,930 --> 01:36:49,883
This baby was stolen
from a hospital in Capiz

1109
01:36:49,908 --> 01:36:51,910
during evacuation operations
due to severe flooding

1110
01:36:51,935 --> 01:36:53,437
caused by typhoon Odette.

1111
01:36:53,437 --> 01:36:55,022
I am here at the scene of the incident,

1112
01:36:55,022 --> 01:36:56,690
Capiz Provincial Capitol,

1113
01:36:56,690 --> 01:37:00,152
where Lineth Sagum's
tried to escape.

1114
01:37:00,152 --> 01:37:01,653
According to my interview

1115
01:37:01,653 --> 01:37:04,656
Lineth fell into a depression

1116
01:37:04,681 --> 01:37:07,522
since her newborn died.

1117
01:37:09,094 --> 01:37:10,762
According to the hospital,

1118
01:37:10,787 --> 01:37:12,289
she took one of the infants

1119
01:37:12,314 --> 01:37:15,192
and thought it was her baby.

1120
01:37:15,559 --> 01:37:17,227
Latest information

1121
01:37:17,252 --> 01:37:19,713
places the suspect in Manila

1122
01:37:19,713 --> 01:37:22,883
on her way to Nueva Segovia.

1123
01:37:22,883 --> 01:37:25,218
If you have any information,

1124
01:37:25,243 --> 01:37:27,329
please alert your local police.

1125
01:37:34,561 --> 01:37:36,396
You son of a bitch!

1126
01:37:36,396 --> 01:37:37,689
How dare you!

1127
01:37:37,714 --> 01:37:40,025
You son of a bitch!

1128
01:37:40,025 --> 01:37:42,444
You said you had things
to take care of in Manila,

1129
01:37:42,444 --> 01:37:44,112
is that what you were doing?

1130
01:37:44,112 --> 01:37:45,238
Let me explain.

1131
01:37:45,238 --> 01:37:46,281
That wasn't me!

1132
01:37:46,306 --> 01:37:49,168
My children and
I are leaving you!

1133
01:37:50,010 --> 01:37:50,969
Anybody home?

1134
01:37:50,994 --> 01:37:51,928
Good day.

1135
01:37:51,953 --> 01:37:53,288
Is Rod at home?

1136
01:37:53,313 --> 01:37:54,898
Anybody home?

1137
01:37:56,792 --> 01:37:59,377
Rod is to blame
for everything.

1138
01:38:00,921 --> 01:38:03,048
He ordered me to do those things.

1139
01:38:06,026 --> 01:38:10,280
Does Rodolfo Padilla, Jr. live here?

1140
01:38:10,305 --> 01:38:12,365
Ma'am, a case has
been filed against him.

1141
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:14,129
Child kidnapping

1142
01:38:14,534 --> 01:38:17,332
and accessory to
four counts of murder.

1143
01:38:17,357 --> 01:38:19,317
Rod's the mastermind.

1144
01:38:20,565 --> 01:38:23,707
Rod gave me
the poisonous seeds.

1145
01:38:23,969 --> 01:38:27,043
You can look in
his bags, if you like.

1146
01:38:27,906 --> 01:38:30,325
We still have some seeds left.

1147
01:38:33,537 --> 01:38:37,999
I mixed those in
with the guards' beers.

1148
01:38:41,294 --> 01:38:42,629
Into the captain's drink, too.

1149
01:38:48,135 --> 01:38:50,345
I poisoned them because

1150
01:38:52,347 --> 01:38:55,308
they raped me on that ship.

1151
01:39:05,610 --> 01:39:08,822
It was also Rod's idea
to sell the baby.

1152
01:39:12,284 --> 01:39:13,994
We're partners.

1153
01:39:30,552 --> 01:39:32,554
Stop!

1154
01:39:33,905 --> 01:39:34,906
Don't shoot!

1155
01:39:34,931 --> 01:39:35,932
This is just a toy.

1156
01:39:35,957 --> 01:39:37,083
I'll go with you.

1157
01:39:55,468 --> 01:39:59,222
You're just after our pussy.

1158
01:39:59,247 --> 01:40:02,000
After you get what you want,

1159
01:40:02,959 --> 01:40:05,003
you'll discard us.

1160
01:40:11,551 --> 01:40:13,320
Tomorrow,

1161
01:40:13,345 --> 01:40:14,903
you'll be gone.
