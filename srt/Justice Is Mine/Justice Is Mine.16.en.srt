1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:03,500
Mr. Lo,

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,440
sorry to trouble you

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,780
when you're so busy.

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:06,780
Indeed, I am.

5
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,020
Mr. Ong,

6
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,420
let's make it quick.

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:10,570
Mr. Lo,

8
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,700
there's been a lot of talk lately.

9
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,980
Seems public opinion is firmly
behind the old town development.

10
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,300
Mr. Ong, you're trying

11
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,330
to help your friends
with their real estate business,

12
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,170
aren't you?

13
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,100
We just want to promote

14
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,580
Hokong's economic development.

15
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,650
With your talent and insight,

16
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,580
do you think you could

17
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:29,940
come up with the ideal solution?

18
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,620
Let's see if it's necessary.

19
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,260
As Chief Justice,

20
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,620
I'm under a lot of public scrutiny.

21
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,700
I have to set an example.

22
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,140
I can't afford
to be a poor role model, can I?

23
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,060
Mr. Lo, have some coffee.

24
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,060
I'm pretty swamped.

25
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,260

The doctor said

29
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,900
even after being discharged,

30
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,660
you still need to take
your anti-inflammatory meds on schedule.

31
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:27,980
Okay.

32
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,460
Does Yat-wai know I'm going to see him?

33
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,140
I already told him.

34
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,540
I'll go get the car

35
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,460
so you won't have to walk too far.

36
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:36,900
Okay.

37
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,860
I'll call you
when I get to the entrance.

38
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,740
Okay, thank you.

39
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,940
A quick chat?

40
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,580
Are you trying to rob me again?

41
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,740
If you approve my dad's medical parole,

42
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,980
I wouldn't have to come again.

43
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,660
You've got some nerve.

44
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,500
You couldn't kill me,

45
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,700
and now you expect me
to do your bidding?

46
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,780
My dad's heart is not doing so well,

47
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,300

if anything happens to him in prison,

00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,980
do you really think
it has nothing to do with you?

51
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,660
I've prepared
all the necessary documents.

52
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,820
Just sign them.

Mr. Lo, the Chief Justice,

55

is the only one
who has the authority to do so.

[Yu Sze-man, Reporter]
Last night,

64
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,660
at a known accident-prone bend
on the slope of Cheung Wan Road

65
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,020
in the Western District,

66
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,540
a serious car accident occurred.

67
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,100
After the driver was pulled out,

68
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,060
he was pronounced dead at the scene.

69
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,020
It has been confirmed

70
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,100
that the deceased is Lo Wai-tak,
the new Chief Justice.

71
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,980
Police initially speculate

72
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,260
that human error caused the accident.

73
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,900
For more information,

74
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,740
please tune in to the midday news.

75
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,780
We'll be right back after commercials.

76
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,480
Mr. Chun.

77
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,300
Sorry, I'm rushing to a meeting.

78
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,460
What happened to Mr. Lo is truly a pity.

79
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,440
Yes, indeed.

80
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,220
Mr. Lo was always cautious.

81
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,460
This accident

82
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,480
is truly unexpected.

83
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,860
Caution is good,

84
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,100
but too much of it

85
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,660
can cloud judgment in a crisis.

86
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,460
I'm pretty swamped.

87
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,940
Let's leave it for next time.

88
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,700
Mr. Ong.

89
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,620
It's fine.

90
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,300
If he wouldn't drink it,

91
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,740
someone else would.

92
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,420
By the way, Mr. Chun,

93
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,680
have you heard about

94
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,220
the land deed case in the old town

95
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,300
that Mr. Lo was handling?

96
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,420
At my level,

97
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,700
I don't have access
to the Chief Justice's cases.

98
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,220
With your experience,

99
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,620
you're likely to take over.

100
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,860
I wasn't up to it.

101
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,620
Otherwise,

102
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,160
I wouldn't have lost to Mr. Lo.

103
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,600
The land deed case

104
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,220
isn't within my expertise.

105
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,940
It's hard to make a ruling

106
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,980
that pleases everyone.

107
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,140
That's not true.

108
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,860
You handled Sek Chi-yeung's case

109
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,220
very well.

110
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,340
I believe you'll manage cases

111
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,300
with social impact effortlessly.

112
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,580
The appointment of a Chief Justice

113
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,260
needs to be issued
by the executive authorities.

114
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,640
Mr. Chun,

115
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,180
I believe

116
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,500
you have the public's full support.

117
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,540
All that's left

118
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,300
is for you to take
the Chief Justice's seat.

119
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,700
Just like the old town's development,

120
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,700
it's bound to happen

121
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,060
because it is the general trend.

122
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:52,660
Mr. Ong,

123
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,420
sorry to interrupt.

124
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,000
Mr. Chun, everyone is here
for the meeting.

125
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,000
I'll leave you to it, Mr. Chun.

126
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,480
Looking forward to hearing

127
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,220
about your promotion.

128
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,980
To avoid affecting the trial,

129
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,180
you will take over

130
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,900
all cases handled by Mr. Lo.

131
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,300
The letter of appointment

132
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,940
will be announced soon.

133
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,780
I'm sorry.

134
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,220
I need some time to think it over.

135
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,540
That won't be necessary.

136
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,700
If you hadn't withdrawn
so early last time,

137
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,060
the position
would have been yours already.

138
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,100
I truly believe

139
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,700
you deserve it.

140
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,380
I'd prefer to give it more thought.

[Hokong Prison]

142
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,300
A sudden prisoner riot broke out
at Hokong Prison at midnight,

143
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,500
and the scene was extremely chaotic.

144
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,380
Police have now deployed armed officers

145
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,740
and are rushing to the scene
to handle the situation.

146
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,100
Due to the current situation,

147
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,260
no one is allowed in.

148
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,700
No, my son is inside.

149
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,540
Sorry, Mr. Chun.

150
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,580
Under superior orders,

no one is allowed to enter.

152
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,460
Mr. Chun,

153
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,140
the anti-riot unit has entered,

154
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,380
and the riot has been contained.

155
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,980
Some prisoners are hurt.

your son's status yet.

I want to see my son.

158
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,660
Let me speak to the warden first.

159
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,420
Don't worry,

160
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,140
I'll make sure

161
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,180
your concern doesn't go unnoticed.

162
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,100

167
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,060
You have no right to stop him.

168
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,780
Hurry up.

169
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,020
Please follow me.

170
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,020
Mr. Ong, I apologize
for making you rush over so late.

171
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,020
With an incident this serious,

172
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,300
of course I had to come right away.

173
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,860
As a member
of the CSD Oversight Committee,

174
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,660
I am responsible for supervision.

175
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,420
It was the triad members
who started the trouble.

176
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,560
I've taken care of it,

177
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,780
and I'll be keeping a much closer watch.

178
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,780
Sir, I believe in you,

179
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,700
but I'm afraid the Chief Justice

180
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,360
might not feel the same.

181
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,580
What is his concern?

182
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,240
I can talk to him and clear things up.

183
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,900
Rather than you having to explain,

184
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,420
it would be far more convincing

185
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,380
if he could see for himself

186
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,560
that his son is safe and sound.

Are you injured?

You're bleeding so much.

Can you hold on?

Is this what you call
ensuring the prisoners' safety?

204
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,480
I guarantee I'll strengthen
supervision moving forward.

Sir,

206
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,180
I have a suggestion,

207
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,020
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea.

208
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,880
A young man like Chun Yat-wai,

209
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,620
who shows a willingness to reform,

210
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,700
should not be kept
in the general population.

211
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,840
It's a mixed crowd there,

212
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:32,960
and he could easily go astray.

213
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,980
Is there a chance to transfer him
to a four-person cell?

214
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,100
The prisoners there
have lighter sentences

215
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,020
and are closer to his age.

216
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,480
Most importantly,

217
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,120
this would put Mr. Chun at ease.

218
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:44,800
Good suggestion.

219
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,520
We'll proceed with that idea.

Finally, the storm has passed.

Can we come back to this later?

[Poon Hon-Yee, Middleman]
by the transitional government
100 years ago,

[Prosecution]
Secondly,

279
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,180
the land deed stipulates

that all land decisions
concerning the old town

00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,260

00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,820

377
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,100
I suggest you consult your lawyer

378
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,940
to submit through proper channels.

383
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,780

are perfectly legal and proper.

Medical parole

385
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,380
does not equal release from prison.

If he gets out and keeps making trouble,

387
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,340
he'll be arrested and locked up
to complete his time.

391

The change in him

452
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,600
that at a crime scene,

453
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:19,740
the criminal

454
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,380

It cannot be fake.

565
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,060
Your Honor,

566
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,620
my conclusion is written in the report.

567
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,420
Your Honor,

568
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,380
this appraisal report

569
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,340
has been submitted as Exhibit No. 8.

570
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,740
Let me see. It can't be fake.

571
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,020
Your Honor,

572
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,620
on behalf of my client,

573
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,780
I request a reappraisal

574
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,060
of this land deed.

575
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,540
This is a court-recognized

576
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,700
professional appraisal institution.

577
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,340
The Court does not believe

578
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,380
that a different institution

579
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,060
would produce a different result.

580
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,380
What court-recognized?

581
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,810
You're clearly in cahoots

582
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,300
to make us lose, aren't you?

583
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,860
Maintain proper decorum.

584
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,740
The Court has not issued a ruling.

585
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,060
I stake my life on the fact

586
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,060
that this land deed

587
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,260
is absolutely genuine!

588
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,260
The Court is sympathetic

589
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,260
to the subjective feelings.

590
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,820
However, court regulations mandate that

591
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,260
all arguments must,

592
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,660
and can only,

593
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,700
be founded upon objective evidence.

594
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,050
They're all corrupt officials!

595
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:16,810
Working together in collusion!

596
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,220
- Scoundrels in power!
- Shameless power players!

597
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,380
- Corrupt officials!
- Crooked bureaucrats!

598
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,420
This land deed is real.

599
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,780
Real!

600
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,020
- Uncle!
- Uncle!

601
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,020
- Uncle!
- Uncle!

602
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,100
Hey, call an ambulance!

603
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:30,570
Ambulance!

604
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,490
Uncle!

605
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,380
Uncle, are you okay?

606
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,740
- Uncle!
- Uncle!

607
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,980
[Old town defeated over a fake deed.
The elder collapses.]

608
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,660
[Old town defeated in a land dispute.
SH Asset Holdings wins the case.]

609
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,660
The old town

610
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,260
has finally been developed successfully.

611
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,330
Congratulations.

612
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,220
Thanks to your generosity, Mr. Hon,

613
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,500
we now thrive in peace and profit.

614
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,060
The time just hasn't come yet.

615
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,540
Gentlemen, sorry

616
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,500
I'm late.

617
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,060
Mr. Ong.

618
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,220
Let me introduce you.

619
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:15,980
This is Mr. Chung.

620
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,380
These two

621
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,700
are Hokong's rising stars.

622
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:20,730
Chi Cheung-wing.

623
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,180
Chi.

624
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,820
Mr. Chung.

625
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,140
Nice to meet you.

626
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:23,580
This is

627
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,460
Hon Lit.

628
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:24,900
Mr. Hon.

629
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:25,900
Mr. Hon.

630
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:26,980
Take a seat.

631
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:27,920
- Please.
- Please.

632
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,620
To have the Hon family
and the Chi family

633
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,700
sitting together,

634
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,520
toasting and chatting,

635
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:37,760
Mr. Ong,

636
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,960
you've truly helped

637
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,090
bring unity to Hokong.

638
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,300
Hey, Dad.

639
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:45,860
How are you?

640
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,660
Are you doing okay?

641
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:51,940
Hello?

642
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,180
Hello?

643
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,180
Don't worry. Go ahead.

644
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,260
Hey, Dad.

645
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,140
What did you say?

646
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,260
I didn't catch that.

647
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,580
Now that you're in a four-person cell,

648
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,490
feeling any better?

649
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:11,860
Yes,

650
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,140
it's better.

651
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:15,570
That's good.

652
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,940
It's been getting colder.

653
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:20,980
You got enough clothes?

654
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,660
I heard Mr. Chun

655
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,900
is very stubborn.

656
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,140
How did you manage him?

657
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:31,740
Four words:

658
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,180
Each takes their share.

659
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,900
There's nothing that can't be handled.

660
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,340
What was the deal

661
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,100
with that land deed in court?

662
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,340
Four words:

663
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,980
Fate

664
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,260
makes it happen.

665
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,580
No matter how I examine it,

666
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,140
there's no way this land deed
could be a forgery.

667
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:57,740
Impossible.

668
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,060
Uncle,

669
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,460
don't be like that.

670
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:02,940
Just put

671
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,100
this land deed away.

672
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,940
Since the judge ruled it a fake,

673
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,940
it is nothing more than waste paper.

674
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,380
Keeping it or throwing it away
makes no difference.

675
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,220
That may be true,

676
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,020
but I need your help

677
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,660
organizing the guys in the village

678
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,620
and negotiating a good price for them.

679
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,180
At this point, that's all we can do.

680
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,700
I also need you and Cheung-wing

681
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,980
to talk to the guys first.

682
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,860
No problem.

683
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,460
What concerns our fellow villagers

684
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,820
concerns us too.

685
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,700
We'll back them up all the way,

686
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,660
without looking back.

687
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,140
Thank you.

688
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:33,660
Everyone,

689
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,490
the court's judgment

690
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,530
is in my hands.

691
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,180
The land acquisition plan
can now move forward.

692
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,260
I propose another toast

693
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,340
to the success

694
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,540
of the Old Town Development Plan.

695
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,180
Let's all work together

696
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,540
and share the results.

697
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:49,580
Cheers.

698
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,500
I have two friends over there.

699
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,420
I need to go say hello.

700
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:01,480
Enjoy your meal.

701
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,940
Sorry for keeping you waiting so long.

702
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,300
I need to go to the restroom.

703
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,100
They pulled me in for a few drinks
before I left.

704
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,020
Ugh!

705
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,740
Cut the excuses.

706
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,660
I couldn't care less.

707
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,820
I was not waiting just for you.

708
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,140
Mr. Tat,

709
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,780
I must raise a glass to you.

710
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,340
Without the move you pulled this time,

711
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,620
we might not have gotten through this.

712
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,940
If Chun Yue hadn't reminded me,

713
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,180
I would have forgotten.

714
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,860
The entire set of tools

715
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,860
from last year's forgery case
was confiscated

716
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,900
and is now in the evidence room.

717
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,780
It is very useful.

718
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,940
It can make any government documents

719
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,300
or medals

720
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,810
so realistic

721
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,600
that even experts
can't tell the difference.

722
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,740
Since Mr. Chun presided over that case,

723
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,860
he naturally remembers every detail.

724
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,140
Sharp minds

725
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,490
always react fast.

726
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,730
Let's toast

727
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,940
to our excellent judgment
in recognizing talent.

728
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,980
- Come on.
- Cheers.

729
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,010
Since you couldn't get to the judge,

730
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,940
I wonder if you'll burn out
bottling it up.

731
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,380
What does that have to do with you?

732
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:18,980
Why doesn't it concern me?

733
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,340
I need to return this bullet to him.

734
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,220
His life is mine.

735
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,010
I will decide

736
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,530
when the time is right to act.

737
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:32,530
Okay.

738
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:33,980
I won't argue with you.

739
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:35,880
Even if I don't take his life,

740
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,380
I still need to collect some interest.

741
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,010
Do you need help?

742
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:46,770
Mr. Ong.

743
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,900
Chi Cheung-wing wants to use
the public outrage from the land case

744
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,770
to deal with Mr. Chun.

745
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,140
It's fine.

746
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,180
Having the citizens appear unruly

747
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,290
helps with acquiring land.

748
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,860
Just make sure they don't push it.

749
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,980
Chun Yue is still useful.

750
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,730
You never change.

751
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,840
I don't believe those two

752
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,660
can refrain from causing trouble.

753

786
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,840

787
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,560
when you covered for your son.

788
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,260

789

791
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,650
and collude with people like Tat Ga-ma,

792
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,940
in exchange for his protection?

793
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,610

794

just your assumptions.

00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,300
I believe Sek Chi-yeung,

796
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,090
so I believe

797
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,010
your judgment against him

798
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:20,610
was wrong.

799
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,210

What does it take

803
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,420
to set things right in history?

804
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,050
Time.

805
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:37,780
In other words,

806
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,940
what you see now

807
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,480
is not the final result.

808
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:53,860
When the Procuratorate

809
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,900
transferred the case to the judge,

810
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,340
there was a list like this.

811
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,340
When the arson case from that year

812
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,820
came into my hands,

813
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,300
after my verification,

814
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,380
I found
that a crucial piece of evidence,

815
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,720
witness statement A05, was missing.

816
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,740
So I asked them to provide it.

817
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,340
Later, this case

818
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,530
was transferred to other prosecutors.

819
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,560
I don't know if the information

820
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,210
was ever supplemented.

821
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,010
Didn't you tell Sek Chi-yeung

822
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,900
that you didn't remember anything?

823
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,460
It could be age catching up with me.

824
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,130
My memory's been slipping.

825
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,010
What I want to ask is,

826
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,740
why are you telling me now?

827
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,860
Look at it as me paying you back

828
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,530

who lost the old town land case.

831

832
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:54,980
They will be charged

833
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,340
with criminal damage
and assault with intent.

834
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,650
Is Chun Yue okay?

835
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:58,940

836
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,780
the higher-ups
are watching him closely now?

837
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,690

838

Hey.

839
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,010
Hey.

840
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,180
I'm talking to you.

841
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,130
Didn't you hear me?

842
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,210
Chun Yue told me

843
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,530
that on the presented list
for the arson case,

844
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,820
there was

845
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,740
a witness statement numbered A05.

846
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,460
But during the trial,

847
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,130
this statement suddenly disappeared.

848
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,420
Whether it was an oversight

849
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:28,940
or a deliberate act remains unclear.

850
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,900
Maybe it was considered irrelevant

851
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,210
or unnecessary,

852
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,300
so it wasn't brought to court.

853
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,610
That's normal.

854
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,170
I can't say if it's normal or not,

855
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:37,780
but the only thing

856
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,650
I'm certain of

857
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,050
is that this A05 statement

858
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,420
is currently our sole lead.

859
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,490
