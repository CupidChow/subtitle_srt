And

what's in the car outside?

27
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,100
A batch of arms.

28
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,060
I stole them for Chi Cheung-wing.

how to give them to him yet.

You actually helped him steal that?

31
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,660
That's way too risky.

If I were that kind of guy,

I've got something
to take care of today,

44
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,780
so I can't drive you to school.

45
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,730
You want me to call a cab for you?

46
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,020
No, it's okay. I'll take the bus.

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,460

With that drama last night,

78
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,370

00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,660
Get them here right now.

84
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,660
Chi Cheung-wing,

85
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,060
don't you think you owe me the truth?

86
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,850
I'm standing in front of the gods.

87
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,290
I promise you a lifetime of safety
for your wife and your kids.

88
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,050
I mean what I say.

89
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:01,930
OK.

90
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,860
That's enough.

91
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:11,620
Wai.

92
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,620
How can you go like this?

93
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,170
He's threatening me with my sons' lives.

94
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,100
I have no choice.

95
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,460
But I planted a bomb under the car.

96
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,540
The second he opens the trunk,

97
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,140
it'll blow him up.

98
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,290
Say no more.

99
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,340
I'll go.

100
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,370
I'll go.

101
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,100
I've been feeling

102
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,620
that something

103
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,580
is not right lately.

104
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,170
I think

105
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,780
your dad

106
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,490
has run into some trouble.

107
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,050
I've never seen him like this before.

108
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,020
I must be right.

109
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,340
Something's happened to him.

110
00:07:59,300 --> 00:07:59,980
You know,

111
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,540
I used to be a judge.

112
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,140
I've seen a lot.

113
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,050
Your father

114
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,050
must be being threatened,

115
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,340
even blackmailed, maybe.

116
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:11,620
Yat-wai,

117
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,220
if you know anything at all,

118
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,490
you have to tell me, okay?

119
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,900
I don't know.

120
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,730
Dad never tells me stuff like this.

121
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,580
Chi Cheung-wing is super paranoid.

122
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,100
We can't let him know

123
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,700
you're replacing me.

124
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,890
Once you get there, notify me.

125
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,530
I'll be the one to contact him.

126
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,650
Got it.

127
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,650
I'll take you to the hospital

128
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,580
before I come back for the car.

129
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,700
I can't go to the hospital.

130
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,530
They'll tell right away
this is a gunshot wound.

131
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,220
If they take the bullet out
and run a match,

132
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,100
I'm a dead man.

133
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,820
But the bullet's still in your body!

134
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,100
If you don't go,

135
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,020
you'll die too.

136
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,100
I'm not going.

137
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,180
Just go and drop the things over.

138
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,130
You owe me this.

139
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,220
No backing out.

140
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,530
Tell me what I should do.

141
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,300
Hey. What are you doing?

142
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,940
This is not for killing

143
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,420
but self-protection.

144
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,940
Have you

145
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,490
encountered anything

146
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,610
that looked

147
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,220
strange to you?

148
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,010
Like, strange calls

149
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,370
in the middle of the night,

150
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,010
or strange people spotted

151
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,060
around your home

152
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,580
like they were watching you?

153
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,850
No.

154
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:00,650
No?

155
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:01,860
No.

156
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,020
No,

157
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,780
you must stay at my home for a few days

158
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,490
just in case.

159
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,820
That's not necessary.

160
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,380
I don't see anything serious.

161
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,020
This isn't a negotiation.

162
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,900
Go home and pack your clothes later.

163
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,140
You're moving to my place.

164
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,010
But… my dad...

165
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:20,730
Your dad?

166
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,100
I'll explain it to him.

167
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,180
Mr. Chun.

168
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,530
You don't have to be scared.

169
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,610
I'm okay.

170
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,730
I'm not scared.

171
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,100
Don't fall asleep.

172
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,140
Keep talking to me.

173
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,890
Talk?

174
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,060
About what?

175
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,940
I just remembered

176
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,220
we were classmates in elementary school.

177
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,370
Actually, that day…

178
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,980
did you recognize me back then?

179
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,420
Your Honor.

180
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,730
[10 years ago]
As a police officer, the defendant

181
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,010
should clearly understand
his responsibility to society,

182
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,340
including protecting
the lives and property of citizens.

183
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,250
However, he has violated the law
he is supposed to uphold

184
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,980
and even embezzled
the seized illegal money.

185
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,700
This act has utterly betrayed
the public's trust in civil servants.

186
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,420
We urge Your Honor
to impose a severe penalty.

187
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,940
I know I'm not a model police officer

188
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,340
who is incorruptible
and dedicated to duty.

189
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,740
But I have never done anything

190
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,020
that harms people.

191
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,140
The only reason they framed me together,

192
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,260
claiming I was at the scene
and stole the money,

193
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,500
is that I refused to play along

194
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,860
and stood in the way

195
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,020
of their profits.

196
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,100
In this case, the defendant is accused

197
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,260
of violating the law
and stealing the seized illegal money

198
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,580
while performing his official duties.

199
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,370
Based on the evidence
presented in court so far:

200
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,220
First,

201
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,530
there is no direct evidence

202
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,530
proving that the defendant
stole the seized illegal money.

203
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:50,940
Second,

204
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,730
there is equally
no direct evidence proving

205
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,730
that the defendant placed
the seized illegal money in his vehicle.

206
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,060
A court ruling

207
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,650
is not based on one or two statements

208
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,060
but is grounded in evidence.

209
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:01,980
Therefore,

210
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,490
It is so ordered

211
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,980
the existing evidence
is insufficient to confirm

212
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,340
the defendant's theft,

213
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,770
and the defendant

214
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,490
is acquitted of the charge.

215
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,100
Mr. Chun,

216
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,610
thank you for clearing my name.

217
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,130
It's not me.

218
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,100
What helped you
was the law and the evidence.

219
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,340
Do you really think
the outcome would be the same

220
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,770
if any other judge had heard this case?

221
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,240
I don't have to go to jail
for something I didn't do,

222
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:37,890
and I owe that to you.

223
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,010
From now on, stay on the right track.

224
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,250
Thank you.

225
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,650
Well, you...

226
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,700
You were often made
to repeat a year's course.

227
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,850
Wai. Are you OK?

228
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,850
Wai.

229
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,370
Hey. Wai.

230
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,060
I...

231
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,400
I'm alright.

232
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,700
They ended

233
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,120
up dismissing me for misconduct,

234
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,740
but because of you,

235
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,260
I didn't go to jail
for something I didn't do.

236
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,890
I still need to thank you.

237
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,700
I also know

238
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,100
that when some gangsters
harassed me later,

239
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,580
you were the one who got me out
of the trouble secretly.

240
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,220
Repaying a favor to you, that's all.

241
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,530
Honestly, I'm pretty glad

242
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,490
that we can be friends.

243
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,460
Having a judge as a friend?

244
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,180
That's quite a status.

245
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,420
But your judge friend

246
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,300
has been up to
a lot of shameful things lately.

247
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,260
For your son,

248
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,340
you've got to do that.

249
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,060
Wai.

250
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,490
Sorry.

251
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,340
I never expected things
to turn this way.

252
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:19,900
You know what?

253
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,020
Without you,

254
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,100
I would still be serving
my time in jail.

255
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,010
But you're also the reason

256
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,010
that I end up getting shot.

257
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,260
Do you think I've gained more

258
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,700
or lost more?

259
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,180
Don't collapse.

260
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,370
When I come back,

261
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,650
get this even with me,

262
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,850
okay?

263
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,530
Don't fall asleep.

264
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,020
Your dad's home.

265
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,220
He said he had plans for something.

266
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,380
Maybe he went without his car.

267
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,500
Go up and pack your things.

268
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,780
I'll be waiting for you here.

269
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:46,770
Madam,

270
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,040
I've been suspended
for almost a month and a half.

271
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,420
C&IIB called me in for questioning,

272
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,610
but there's no conclusion.

273
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,610
They said whether I can get reinstated
depends on you.

274
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,820
Actually, it should be

275
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,250
whether you can get reinstated

276
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,890
depends on yourself.

277
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,530
Madam, I've told you this many times.

278
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,000
Even though I'm from the old town,

279
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,940
I'm also a cop.

280
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,160
Madam,

281
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:11,980
I have a tip about Chi Cheung-wing.

282
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,420
They say Hon Lit dared to kill people
in the old town.

283
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,320
That's a direct provocation
to the old town gang.

284
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,300
Can you tell me something
I don't already know?

285
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,960
Chi Cheung-wing's men
are handling a batch of arms.

286
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,380
He said a "good show" would start soon.

287
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,780
Is this tip reliable?

288
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,660
You can check and see

289
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,740
which news
didn't get released yesterday.

290
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,820
Report for duty tomorrow.

291
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,860
Yes, Madam.

292
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,300
Thank you, Madam.

293
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,500
I've asked around.

294
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,420
A piece of news
didn't get released yesterday.

295
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,380
Probably because the content
was considered a bit sensitive.

296
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,300
It's not "sensitive".

297
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,540
It's embarrassing.

298
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,860
Get to the point.

299
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,220
It was a batch of arms
seized by customs.

300
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,730
After the case closed,
they should be in the warehouse.

301
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,460
But no one expected they'd be robbed

302
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,290
while being transported there.

303
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,460
The Emergency Unit
rushed to the scene to intercept,

304
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,420
but the gangsters threw a grenade

305
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,460
and got away.

306
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,300
Ordinary people won't know

307
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,580
when arms are supposed
to be put into the warehouse.

308
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,480
There must be an insider.

309
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,060
It's not just that.

310
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,020
Among what they stole

311
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,180
ere two crates of firearms

312
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,060
and one crate of TNT explosives.

313
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,340
If this batch of arms
is used in gang fights,

314
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,240
the consequences will be catastrophic.

315
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,300
Is there an investigation team

316
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,740
following up on this case?

317
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,290
Yes.

318
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,640
If this case

319
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,380
is related to Chi Cheung-wing,

320
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,460
then he's trying
to use Ma San-po's death

321
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,740
to declare war on Hon Fui-lung.

322
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,460
So, could these two cases

323
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,660
be connected?

324
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,720
Tong Huen.

325
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:42,780
- Sir.
- Sir.

326
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,660
Perfect timing.

327
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,260
I have something to report to you.

328
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,500
Please give us some space.

329
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:46,980
Yes, Sir.

330
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:47,660
Yes, Sir.

331
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:50,490
What is it?

332
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,940
Some people from the C&IIB are here

333
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,460
to meet you specifically.

334
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,490
I'll sit in,

335
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,460
but I won't have the right to speak.

336
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,860
This is Senior Inspector Tong Huen.

337
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,980
This is Superintendent Kwu Pak-sing
from the C&IIB.

338
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,090
Mr. Kwu.

339
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,220
Please sit down.

340
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,380
We arranged this meeting

341
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,700
because we have a few questions

342
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,100
and we'd like Ms. Tang

343
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,980
to help us confirm.

344
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:25,530
Yes, Sir.

345
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,960
One quick question before we start.

346
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,820
Were you responsible

347
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:30,860
for Ma San-po's case?

348
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:31,760
Yes.

349
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,660
Were there any doubts
or inconsistencies?

350
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,120
What aspect of doubts

351
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,380
are you referring to?

352
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,180
We're from the C&IIB.

353
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,620
What do you think?

354
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,530
We suspect there's a mole in your team.

355
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,420
Who exactly are you suspecting?

356
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,380
And on what grounds?

357
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,700
These two photos

358
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,900
were taken after Ma San-po was detained.

359
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,460
Were you at the scene?

360
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:05,860
No, I wasn't.

361
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,730
Then why was he injured?

362
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,980
According to the statements

363
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,660
of Leung Kit and Kwok Wa,

364
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,940
he resisted arrest at the time.

365
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,050
He was emotionally agitated

366
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:16,860
and attacked the officers.

367
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,180
Those injuries were caused

368
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,620
while we were subduing him.

369
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,010
From what I know,

370
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,180
he was aware
of what had happened back then,

371
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,780
so he didn't file a complaint.

372
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,180
You're right.

373
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,940
He didn't file a complaint.

374
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,620
What are you suspecting then?

375
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,250
I've checked Kwok Wa's background.

376
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,500
When he first joined the force,

377
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,490
his partner was killed

378
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,380
in the line of duty

379
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,620
while stopping a gunfight

380
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,380
in the old town.

381
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,780
Since then, he's used excessive force

382
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,730
against members
of the old town gang more than once.

383
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,700
What does this have to do with the mole?

384
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,050
Ma San-po was electrocuted
while being interrogated.

385
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,330
I'll say it again.

386
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,860
Ma San-po's injuries

387
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,780
weren't caused during the interrogation…

388
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,700
No, no, no.

389
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,740
You only need to answer me this.

390
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,580
Did anyone
in the police station premises

391
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,860
electrocute Ma San-po?

392
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,050
Yes.

393
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,050
Who?

394
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,570
Kwok Wa.

395
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,380
But this doesn't make him the mole.

396
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,050
Who did he pass info to?

397
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,980
Hon Fui-lung's gang family.

398
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,700
Do you have evidence?

399
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,100
I've already sent two policemen to jail

400
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,100
precisely because they tried to collude
with the Hon family

401
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,420
to take down the old town gang.

402
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,180
Mr. Kwu,

403
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,010
using gangsters to take down gangsters

404
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,530
might be more time-efficient
than going after those corrupt cops

405
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:38,860
who actually take bribes.

406
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,220
Tell me more.

407
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:40,900
Tong Huen.

408
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,660
You don't need to record

409
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,730
what she just said.

410
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,050
What were you thinking?

411
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:07,570
Hey.

412
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,220
Are you there?

413
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:10,860
Almost.

414
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,250
Leave as soon as you drop the things.

415
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,380
I'll inform Chi Cheung-wing.

416
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,420
Don't be nervous.

417
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,860
I'll wait until you leave safely.

418
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:22,730
OK.

419
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,140
Wait for my call

420
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,000
and hold on a little longer, got it?

421
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,940
Did you know Kwok Wa met Hon Lit?

422
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,380
Or let me put it another way.

423
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,300
Did you authorize him

424
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,330
to meet Hon Lit?

425
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,460
Even if they had met,

426
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,360
it could've been
for investigation purposes.

427
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,050
Of course.

428
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,220
Because contacting criminals

429
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,530
is usually to gather intelligence.

430
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,050
Isn't that right, Ms. Tong?

431
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,100
Were you at the scene

432
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,580
of Hon Gong's car accident?

433
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,490
No, I wasn't.

434
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,660
The officer in charge
at the scene back then

435
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:02,860
was Sergeant Kwok Wa.

436
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,980
Which means
both the traffic accident report

437
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:05,860
and the forensic report

438
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,100
were submitted to you by him.

439
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,860
It should've been Kwok Wa

440
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,820
and Leung Kit.

441
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,120
From what you remember,

442
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,290
did the reports mention

443
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,420
finding an asthma inhaler

444
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,420
at the scene?

445
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,570
I don't remember.

446
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:21,460
Wait a minute.

447
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,300
When you say you don't remember,

448
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,490
do you mean you don't recall the reports

449
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,780
mentioning the inhaler?

450
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,460
Or

451
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,500
that the reports didn't mention
finding the inhaler at all?

452
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,330
I know an inhaler was found,

453
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,460
and it was submitted

454
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,700
for DNA testing.

455
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,730
Then why wasn't that mentioned
in the report at the time?

456
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,140
I don't know.

457
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,250
It was a momentary oversight on my part.

458
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,180
A momentary oversight

459
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,050
or did someone intentionally hide

460
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,330
such a crucial piece of evidence?

461
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,220
Why would anyone do that?

462
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:57,940
I don't know.

463
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,180
Maybe it was like what you said,
using gangsters to take down gangsters.

464
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,400
Someone deliberately stoked the conflict
between the two gangs

465
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,500
to profit from it.

466
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,500
Later, when they thought it was useless,

467
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,340
they turned the evidence over.

468
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,420
All of this is just your speculation.

469
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,460
Do you have any proof?

470
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,340
That's strange.

471
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,020
How did you get hold
of that inhaler in the first place?

472
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,640
Anyway, it ended up being included

473
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,900
in the investigation results.

474
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,260
Anyway, it ended up...

475
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,180
Ma San-po turning state's evidence,

476
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,090
who made that decision?

477
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,090
His attorney.

478
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,180
Bailing him out was decided

479
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,460
before or after

480
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,640
the DNA testing report

481
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,530
was released?

482
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,220
Please correct me if I'm wrong.

483
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,730
If the DNA test results matched with Ma,

484
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,220
he should be prosecuted,

485
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,060
not bailed out.

486
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,360
Investigating a case

487
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,840
is a process

488
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,700
of identifying doubts
and then verifying them.

489
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,860
We suspected Ma San-po

490
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,300
was connected to the car crash

491
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,560
because the vehicle he was driving

492
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,140
was the one involved in the accident.

493
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,760
We allowed him to be released on bail

494
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,140
hoping he would provide some info

495
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,260
to help us solve the case.

496
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,860
These are all our strategies
for solving cases.

497
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,810
Mr. Kwu, you should understand this.

498
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:17,980
Yes,

499
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,090
we often use these kinds of strategies.

500
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,570
There's no violation of rules here.

501
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,570
Who knew that Ma San-po

502
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,260
would be released on bail?

503
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,180
I did.

504
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,250
The judge,

505
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:36,860
the prosecutor,

506
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,200
Ma's attorney,

507
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,490
and...

508
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,180
Kwok Wa.

509
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,520
My whole team

510
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,810
and the policeman designated to drive.

511
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,960
Many people.

512
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,860
Only half a day after his release,
Ma San-po was shot and killed

513
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,770
by a gunner suspected to be sent

514
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,330
by Hon Fui-lung.

515
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,220
Ms. Tong.

516
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,050
So the point here is not about

517
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,180
whether it had been leaked

518
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,660
but who leaked it?

519
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,860
These are just indirect inferences
on your part.

520
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,290
You can't accuse
Kwok Wa of being the mole

521
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,860
based solely on an indirect inference.

522
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,770
I never said that.

523
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,290
That day,

524
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,680
around 3 A.M.,

525
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,340
I suddenly received an order

526
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,620
o review
the surveillance camera footage.

527
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,860
Before watching the footage,
I also thought it was him.

528
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,620
But it turned out not to be him.

529
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,860
That day was your birthday, right?

530
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,340
You there?

531
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,050
I will inform you when I arrive.

532
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,730
Why is it so quiet on your side?

533
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,250
Hey. Wai.

534
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,730
Don't you dare to play tricks with me.

535
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,860
I'm in the toilet.

536
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,330
Nature calls.

537
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,860
I'll let you know when I arrive.

538
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,460
If you'd watched the entire

539
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,540
surveillance footage to the end,

540
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,460
you should have seen me

541
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,980
refusing that gift.

542
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,420
Why would Hon Lit give you

543
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,530
such an expensive gift?

544
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,530
That watch is worth
over a hundred thousand.

545
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,180
I don't know.

546
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,490
You tell me.

547
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,280
Who's targeting you?

548
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,640
Tell me who's framing you.

549
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,090
Maybe you should ask

550
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,140
who exactly proposed reviewing

551
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,420
this segment
of the surveillance footage?

552
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,250
If you can find that person,

553
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,730
you might figure out

554
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,860
who leaked Ma San-po's information

555
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,010
to the Hons.

556
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,810
The Hons.

557
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,700
You visited Hon Fui-lung in prison

558
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,250
more than once, right?

559
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,140
Everyone knows

560
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,290
that even if Hon Fui-lung is in prison,

561
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,520
just one word from him

562
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,490
can bring chaos to the outside.

563
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,460
I went to see him to tell him

564
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,140
I could arrange for him to meet his son

565
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,680
on the condition

566
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,760
that he had to give us time

567
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,380
to investigate
the real culprit of the car crash,

568
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,460
no more interfering,

569
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,660
no more taking vigilante justice,
and no killing of innocent people.

570
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,820
The old town gangster, Tsui Hung.

571
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,580
How do you explain

572
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,540
his hot oil accident?

573
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,530
Ma San-po was killed.

574
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,730
Isn't that interfering?

575
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,140
Isn't that taking vigilante justice?

576
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,140
Isn't that killing innocent people?

577
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,290
I'd like to know

578
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,380
if this is an official interrogation?

579
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,220
Who are you trying to accuse?

580
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,460
Do you have any evidence?

581
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:48,770
Tong Huen,

582
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,290
we've received
a complaint from a lawyer.

583
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,810
She wants to report you.

584
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,010
Chow Lok-man?

585
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,180
The complainant claims

586
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,620
that Ma San-po once said

587
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,810
that at the time of the car accident,

588
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:03,940
he was in another place

589
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,140
stealing an old-model Mercedes-Benz.

590
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,700
She accuses you of knowing

591
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,220
this crucial alibi

592
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,660
but failing to verify it immediately.

593
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,860
Every suspect will make up

594
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,730
thousands of excuses
to exonerate themselves.

595
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,180
I have to filter through all of them,
analyze them,

596
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:17,730
and confirm the truth.

597
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,700
You waited three whole days
before going to look for that car.

598
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,220
Who set the car on fire?

599
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,180
I want to know that, too.

600
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,020
Who leaked the information
to his accomplice Pak

601
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:24,980
so Pak could go into hiding?

602
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,860
If I weren't sitting here

603
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,780
having you waste my time,

604
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,700
these are all the things
I'd be investigating right now.

605
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,540
Please answer my questions.

606
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,540
I don't know.

607
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,900
I haven't even heard that name before.

608
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,780
I just want to know how much longer
you're going to keep asking?

609
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,980
Until I'm satisfied.

610
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,620
Are you there yet?

611
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,620
Just entering some abandoned blocks.

612
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,250
Turn left

613
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,330
and you'll be there soon.

614
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:17,820
Wai.

615
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,740
Do we have to blow up
this batch of arms?

616
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,620
Or what?

617
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,580
This batch of arms

618
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,980
could kill countless people.

619
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,700
We can't let them fall into his hands.

620
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,860
We get rid of him together,

621
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,580
and Po's matter

622
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,740
can be fixed

623
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:36,940
once and for all.

624
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,860
That way, Sa and my kids can be safe.

625
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,220
Chi Cheung-wing is calling.

626
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,530
I'll call you back.

627
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,010
Hey.

628
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,220
Have you arrived?

629
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,300
You can come here in 10 minutes.

630
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,500
Don't need that much time.

631
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,620
I'll be there in a sec.

632
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:33,530
Hey.

633
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,620
Get out of there.

634
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,340
Chi Cheung-wing will be there in a sec.

635
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,340
Chi.

636
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,260
No problem.

637
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,820
Inspector Tong Huen,

638
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,860
I am now officially
suspending you from duty.

639
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,020
You came prepared from the start.

640
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,900
Your target was never Kwok Wa.

641
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,100
It was me all along.

642
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,800
You have had inappropriate contact

643
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:34,840
with Hon Lit and Hon Fui-lung.

644
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:35,900
Just now, you also claimed

645
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,180
that no information was leaked

646
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,380
before Ma San-po was killed.

647
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,220
Or to put it another way.

648
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,820
during the entire investigation,

649
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,820
when classified information

650
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,900
was continuously leaking,

651
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,380
you did not implement any plan

652
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,340
to address this matter.

653
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,980
You need to answer these questions.

654
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,490
I propose...

655
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,620
How about this?

656
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,740
Tong Huen, she...

657
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,740
will take leave,

658
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,340
instead of being suspended from duty.

659
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,140
She can come back anytime

660
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:06,820
for further questioning.

661
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,500
How you explain this
to the outsiders is not my business.

662
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,490
In short, my requirement is

663
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,740
that you must not have any involvement
in Ma San-po's case

664
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,170
while I am conducting the interrogation.

665
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,420
Alright, alright.

666
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,860
I will personally supervise this.

667
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:26,940
That's all

668
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:29,900
for today.

669
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,170
Dad,

670
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:46,690
you...

671
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,060
Hi, Mom.

672
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,460
What did you do?

673
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,490
What's with the panting?

674
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,420
Grandma asked me
to stay at her place for a few days.

675
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,260
Yeah.

676
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,660
I saw

677
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,440
that the public security's
been pretty bad lately.

678
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,340
How is that?

679
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,780
The public security around here is bad.

680
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,420
The car got stolen for no reason.

681
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,620
I want Yat-wai
to stay at my place for a few days.

682
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,540
Hey,

683
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,780
you've been going
to his school to see him

684
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,340
every other day lately,

685
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,060
and now you even want to take him away?

686
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,090
Can't we talk this over calmly?

687
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:14,860
No need to talk.

688
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,300
I'm just worried about him.

689
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:16,900
No way.

690
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,740
Stop arguing, both of you!

691
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,210
Grandma,

692
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,140
you go back first.

693
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,180
I'll come find you later.

694
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:21,960
Wait,

695
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,580
you should come stay at my place.

696
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:23,940
OK.

697
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,140
I'll go in a couple of days.

698
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:25,500
OK.

699
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,700
Yat-wai.

700
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,380
Yat-wai.

701
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,280
What happened, Dad?

702
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,460
Are you alright?

703
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,530
Why is there blood
on the bathroom towel?

704
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,570
Are you scared?

705
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:35,570
I...

706
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:45,680
How are you?

707
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,180
I am alright.

708
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,490
Why is someone hiding here?

709
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,460
Say hi.

710
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,090
Kiddo.

711
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,820
People have to pay for their mistakes.

712
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,280
Is he involved in the car accident, too?

713
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,090
He and everything else.

714
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,380
We have to take him to the hospital now.

715
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,490
Hospital?

716
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,210
The police will find out.

717
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,380
What should we do?

718
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,530
What are you doing?

719
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,650
Calling your wife.

720
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:23,780
Mr. Wu,

721
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,090
sorry

722
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,010
for troubling you.

723
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,780
The inhaler...

724
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:28,940
Who gave it to you?

725
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,000
I think I've figured it out.

726
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,780
Only one person is possible.

727
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,170
Sek Chi-yeung, huh?

728
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,690
I know because of Tat Ga-ma,

729
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,010
you don't hold
positive opinions towards him.

730
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,900
But regarding the inhaler,

731
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,380
he simply tried to help me
solve this case.

732
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,090
So it makes perfect sense
that he and Hon Fui-lung

733
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,820
were on the same side in this matter.

734
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,210
What I think of him

735
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,980
doesn't matter.

736
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,460
Because I believe

737
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,210
he wouldn't harm his own girlfriend.

738
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,460
As for that lawyer
wanting to file a complaint against you

739
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,490
and holding you responsible
for Ma San-po's death,

740
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,140
that's just an emotional appeal.

741
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,260
She hasn't a leg to stand on
for her theory.

742
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,460
It's a fact

743
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,170
that the leaked information

744
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,010
led to Ma San-po's wrongful death.

745
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,380
It's only natural for her

746
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,300
to take her anger out on me.

747
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,900
The leaked information

748
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,620
is the real key issue here.

749
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,340
You must find out

750
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,700
about the people

751
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,300
who are framing you

752
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,940
and why they're doing it.

753
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,860
Not for anyone else,

754
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,210
but for yourself.

755
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,940
Anyway, you haven't had
a vacation in a long time.

756
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,460
Think of this as a chance to relax.

757
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,800
Sometimes I think,

758
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,460
if you can step back and be an outsider,

759
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,200
you can see things much more clearly.

760
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,100
Madam.

761
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,090
What's wrong?

762
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,320
There has been an explosion
in the old town.

763
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,260
Evidence shows

764
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,570
that it's linked
to the previous arms case.

765
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:00,460
Hey.

766
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,080
I'm the victim here.

767
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:02,580
Hey.

768
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,020
What right do you have to arrest me?

769
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:05,940
You lousy policewoman.

770
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,570
Hey. Hey.

771
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,820
You were covering for Hon Lit

772
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,210
so he could start a war
against the old town.

773
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,300
You don't arrest the killers.

774
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,570
You don't care about the bomber.

775
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,570
What kind of cop are you?

776
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,740
- You're just plain evil!
-Repeat that again,

777
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,360
and I'll charge you with defamation!

778
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,860
Just try touching me.

779
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,860
The entire old town
won't let you get away with this!

780
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:19,840
Take him in.

781
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,530
Move, get inside.

782
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,340
Move.

783
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,980
Madam, you can interrogate him later.

784
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,860
Starting now, she's on leave.

785
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,050
This

786
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,300
will be my case.

787
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,300
What now, Mr. Sek?

788
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,530
The Intelligence Bureau

789
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,780
does have the privilege for updates.

790
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,360
Holidays for you. How rare!

791
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,050
I have the C&IIB to thank.

792
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,000
Are you also having holidays?

793
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,980
I'm not.

794
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,460
But seeing you stay at home,

795
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,490
I'm relieved.

796
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,090
I need you to comfort me, too.

797
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,570
My case is also torturing me.

798
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,820
Things didn't go well

799
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,570
with Lau Mao?

800
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,570
No.

801
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,610
I found him,

802
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,210
but he is in very poor condition.

803
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,650
No idea if he can make it through.

804
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,170
No answers from him at all.

805
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,820
Come on. Just go.

806
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,380
Let's leave this place full of sadness.

807
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,460
You'll drive your car

808
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,860
and I'll drive mine.

809
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,010
See you

810
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:47,740
in you-know-where.

811
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,300
Wai.

812
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,680
Wai.

813
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,010
He's having a high fever.

814
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:02,700
Yes.

815
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,130
He must be taken to the hospital.

816
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,170
Tell the police

817
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,780
it was an accidental discharge.

818
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,300
This happens all the time
in the old town.

819
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,860
He's been unconscious here for so long,

820
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,610
and you're only telling me
to take him to the hospital now.

821
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,340
Do you have
absolutely nothing to do with this?

822
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,860
It has nothing to do with my dad.

823
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,780
It's my fault.

824
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,050
You're the one who got him like this?

825
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,650
Are you?

826
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,610
Can we just take him
to the hospital first?

827
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,940
You don't need to interfere
with his business anymore.

828
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,090
Honey, come on. Let's go.

829
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:26,940
Let's go.

830
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,530
I don't want your help.

831
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,170
Be careful.

832
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,090
Be careful.

833
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:39,380
Mind your steps.

834
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:46,980
OK.

835
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,210
OK.

836
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,380
Thanks.

837
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:50,780
Come here now.

838
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,420
Any response, Dad?

839
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,300
What did Mr. Pang say?

840
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:54,980
Can he come?

841
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,530
Not until tomorrow.

842
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:57,740
He taught me

843
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,900
to use alcohol to lower his temperature.

844
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,260
We'll wait till tomorrow, then.

845
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:03,420
Wai.

846
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:04,860
Bear with the pain a bit longer.

847
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,420
Mr. Pang will come tomorrow.

848
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,900
You'll be fine
when he gets the bullet out.

849
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,130
You'll survive this.

850
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,620
You've prepared so much food.

851
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,170
There are only the two of us.

852
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:30,820
Do you think you're feeding pigs?

853
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,300
Strictly speaking, you're the pig.

854
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,340
I'm the little cabbage made to feed you,

855
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,300
the little piggy.

856
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,900
Why are you the little cabbage?

857
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,650
Because pigs
love eating cabbage, of course.

858
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,260
So... you're pig slop.

859
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,400
Yeah.

860
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:47,980
Hey.

861
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,360
You're looking
at the precious kind here,

862
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,010
Miss.

863
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,090
Only my beloved piggy
can have a taste of it.

864
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,050
Any other piggy can never be near it.

865
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:57,860
Oh, thank you so much.

866
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:09,860
Never mind.

867
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,610
Your soul may have drifted away,

868
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,340
but please,

869
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,570
give me back your body.

870
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:23,820
For what?

871
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,260
Dish washing.

872
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,130
What were you thinking?

873
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:29,690
I can do that, too.

874
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,530
Sorry,

875
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,740
I can't tonight.

876
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,940
OK, I'll let you off the hook.

877
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:40,780
Anyway,

878
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,090
you don't have to worry about

879
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,170
the C&IIB.

880
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:45,210
Your boss will fix it.

881
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,820
But the main thing I want to tell you is

882
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,260
that sometimes,
taking a step into the gray area

883
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,300
isn't a bad thing.

884
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,260
It all depends on
what your intentions are.

885
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:58,460
Is it really that hard to tell
black from white?

886
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,260
Right now, aren't people saying
you're "black",

887
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,820
but you claim you're "white"?

888
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,130
Who can judge that?

889
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:05,170
Are you going to get a judge to decide?

890
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,090
A judge?

891
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:13,900
Hello, Ms. Tong.

892
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,080
This is Chun Yue.

893
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,340
I'd like to talk with you again.

894
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:17,860
Okay.

895
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,180
I'm near your place now.

896
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:20,340
Can we meet?

897
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,700
Actually, we've always been
pretty subjective

898
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,880
in thinking that judges

899
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,650
are definitely
the fairest and the most impartial,

900
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:29,570
and that everything they say
is the truth.

901
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:31,940
But what if, from the very start,

902
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,010
everything he said was all a lie

903
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:35,460
and he aimed to mislead us?

904
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,650
Do you know what you're talking about?

905
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,170
Yes, of course I do.

906
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,020
What I mean is

907
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:42,980
if Mr. Chun,

908
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:43,780
Chun Yue,

909
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:46,220
had been misleading us
from the beginning,

910
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,780
then all the doubts

911
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:48,700
