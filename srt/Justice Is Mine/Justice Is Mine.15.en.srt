Whether I call the shots

409

00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,780
Feeling better?

573
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,140
Much better.

574
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,460
You went to see my dad today?

575
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,260
This was

576
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,740
what he gave to
Mr. Hon Gong before he went to prison.

577
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,100
He's now instructed me
to hand it over to you.

578
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:56,940
He said

579
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,260
from now on,

580
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,580
the Hon family will count on you.

581
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,700
Tell him not to worry.

582
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:13,980
I hired

583
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,580
[Medical Parole Application]
an entire team of lawyers

584
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,860
to draft this.

585
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,460
I promised to get him out,

586
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,460
and I'll keep my word.

587
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:21,980
Great to hear.

588
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,780
Dad...

589
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,220
You still don't understand me.

590
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:00,540
Cheung-wing,

591
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,460
I'm back.

592
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,740
Solid as ever,

593
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,700
and even stronger.

594
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,460
Of course.

595
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,740
It's full of men in there.

596
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,780
If I didn't work out every day,

597
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,740
how else could I burn off my energy?

598
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,260
Hey, let's go for a massage.

599
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,300
I haven't had a release in ages.

600
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,340
Why rush? There's plenty of time.

601
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,860
I've prepared pomelo leaves

602
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,900
to ward off the bad luck.

603
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,660
And I've got serious matters
to discuss with you.

604
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,340
Sure.

605
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,300
Try this roast pork.

606
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,700
Fresh out of the oven this morning.

607
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,660
Hot and fresh.

608
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,420
Let me try.

609
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,460
Chi, beer's ready.

610
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:31,660
Tastes good.

611
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,340
Three years sober,

612
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,580
and this first sip of beer

613
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,260
feels amazing.

614
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,500
I couldn't drink in there,

615
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,500
but before leaving,

616
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,540
I got to make a fool
of Hon Fui-lung in public.

617
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,700
That was pure joy.

618
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,460
Petty tricks

619
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,900
won't kill him.

620
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,260
The old Hon

621
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,620
is now in prison,

622
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,140
and the elder one's dead.

623
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,420
Only the younger one is left.

624
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,100
What can he do?

625
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,140
Don't underestimate him.

626
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,740
He is clever.

627
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,020
I've never feared anyone.

628
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,660
Cheung-wing, leave him to me

629
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,020
and I'll take him out in a blink.

630
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,540
Calm down.

631
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,420
I've got another task for you.

632
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,260
What is it?

633
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,500
Starting tomorrow,

634
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,140
shadow Uncle.

635
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,860
Whatever he does,

636
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,060
let me know immediately.

637
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,900
A guy again?

638
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,380
And an old one.

639
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,060
What's the plan?

640
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,340
There won't be
any fighting or bloodshed,

641
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,140
and you can make big money.

642
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,580
Sounds good?

643
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,940
Great!

644
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,100
We cut the roast pig

645
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,580
to wish everyone

646
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,540
peace and prosperity!

647
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,020
Great!

648
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,140
All right,

649
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:49,900
please sit down.

650
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,940
Everyone

651
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,020
from the old town,

652
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,420
Uncle Chen has tossed
the moon blocks three times

653
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,700
in front of the Hung Shing Temple,

654
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,180
and all of them are laughing answers.

655
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,580
So,

656
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,980
by the will of the deity

657
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,420
and in my role
as Area Committee Chairman

658
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,060
I declare that we oppose selling off

659
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,380
any land in the old town.

660
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,420
That's right!

661
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,620
To this day,

662
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,700
the old town is the last part of Hokong

663
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,780
that preserves
its centuries-old character.

664
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,420
We cannot allow

665
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,380
unscrupulous property developers

666
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,020
to ruin the old town.

667
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:26,100
Well said!

668
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,940
The land of the old town

669
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,900
is the root left to us by our ancestors.

670
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,980
We will not yield an inch.

671
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,740
Not an inch!

672
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,340
If anyone dares to trample on our home,

673
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,020
we will unite

674
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,220
and fight to the very end.

675
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:43,220
Fight to the very end!

676
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,060
All right.

677
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,380
Let me add to that.

678
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,500
The land deeds of the old town

679
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,500
grant us permanent residence rights.

680
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,140
So I've petitioned the court

681
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,620
to reject the developers' application.

682
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,780
This is the deity's will,

683
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,500
and it must not be defied.

684
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,300
Am I right?

685
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,380
- Yes!
- Yes!

686
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,980
- Great!
- Great!

687
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,940
Let's share the roast pork.

688
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,380
Come on, let's eat.

689
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,020
Here.

690
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,300
Yes, I want that one.

691
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,460
Yes, that one.

692
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:19,700
So,

693
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,180
how was the show I pulled on?

694
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,940
What did you do really?

695
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,180
All three throws of the blocks
came up as laughing answers.

696
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,020
The deity's secrets
must not be revealed.

697
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,580
Cheung-wing,

698
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,900
now that the business is done,

699
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,860
shouldn't we have
a little entertainment

700
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:39,820
as a reward?

701
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:40,580
Okay.

702
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,060
I'll take you to something thrilling.

703
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,460
Didn't expect it, huh?

704
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,540
We both survived.

705
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,980
So is it my good luck

706
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,820
or your bad luck?

707
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,780
If you really wanted to kill me,

708
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,260
you wouldn't waste words.

709
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,140
You're bluffing.

710
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,780
This bullet wound came from you.

711
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,060
Do you really think
I won't give it back?

712
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,420
The police

713
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,020
don't believe I was robbed anyway.

714
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,420
You came at the right time.

715
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:24,900
Look behind.

716
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,580
Whoever wants to kill me

717
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,020
won't get away.

718
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,660
Rest assured,

719
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,820
your life is still useful.

720
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,140
I'll spare you for now.

721
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,940
Hon Lit doesn't dare kill you anyway.

722
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,620
As for who ends you,

723
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,020
him or me,

724
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,620
let's take it slow

725
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,820
and see who rules the game.

726
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,380
Cheung-wing, the staff are on their way.

727
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:01,940
