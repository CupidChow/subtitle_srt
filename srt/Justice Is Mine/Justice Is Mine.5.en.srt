00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,940
Hang on.

192
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:30,980
It's alright.

193
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,220
Hang on. Son.

194
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,460
I heard your younger son,
Hon Lit, was back.

195
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,220
What?

196
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,260
Daddy's in prison,

197
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,940
Older Brother in hospital.

198
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,780
That makes him the captain now?

199
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,980
‌Strong connection between the brothers.

200
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,140
It's understandable.

201
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,180
Could it be a ‌strong connection
between father and son,

202
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,100
and he comes in to spend time with you?

203
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,660
Do you have proof?

204
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,500
According to your way
of handling things,

205
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,100
proof is not needed.

206
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,900
The truth is whatever I say it is.

207
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,060
I'm aware, though,

208
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,380
Hon Gong is your successor.

209
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,940
To you,

210
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,660
your eldest son's safety always
comes first.

211
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,540
Name your price.

212
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,660
This case,

213
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,940
we'll follow through.

214
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,420
During our investigation,

215
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,780
you stay out of it.

216
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,130
So do your men outside,

217
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,740
especially your younger son, Hon Lit.

218
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,980
[Special Permit for Out-of-Prison Visit]
I've filed an application

219
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,060
for you to visit your eldest son
outside of jail.

220
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,580
Once.

221
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,580
Twice.

222
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,060
Hey, Hon.

223
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,700
How did you like the pig head?

224
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,540
Hey, Chi Cheung-wing.

225
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,940
When the oil wasn't hot enough,

226
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,140
you couldn't make crispy skins.

227
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,580
I'll make it crispier for you next time.

228
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,620
Shut up.

229
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:57,900
You!

230
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
Not one inch forward.

231
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,180
Go.

232
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,620
Coward.

233
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:28,980
Hands up.

234
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:32,860
Turn around.

235
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,180
Turn around.

236
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,500
Bear with it a little.

237
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,460
Hung.

238
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,140
Tell me,

239
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,780
does Hung's condition

240
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,940
have anything to do with you?

241
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,340
You asked me to convince Po
to plead guilty.

242
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,180
You said the money

243
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,260
was for his several-year serving time.

244
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,140
Turns out it was for

245
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,140
Po's life.

246
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,060
What money?

247
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,340
Po was right next to Hung

248
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,300
when Hung got hurt.

249
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,780
Who knows who will be next?

250
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,260
What was the money Suet just said?

251
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,340
I've contacted the best doctor.

252
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,180
Hung will be alright.

253
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,500
Who on earth

254
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,460
has Hung offended?

255
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:04,860
Don't worry.

256
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,380
Hung is my man

257
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,580
but also my kin.

258
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,780
So is Po.

259
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:11,900
You can tell me

260
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,860
if anything happened.

261
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,220
With me in the old town,

262
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,980
they will be avenged.

263
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,980
Tell me about the money.

264
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,860
Why did you give money to Suet?

265
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,420
How did you get it?

266
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,020
How much did you give her?

267
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,740
Dear, I'm so afraid.

268
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,660
Our kids are so young.

269
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,260
I'm afraid of Chi Cheung-wing.

270
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,340
I know.

271
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,740
I won't let anything happen to you.

272
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,060
I'm fearing for you now.

273
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,780
Tell me what happened that night.

274
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,020
Why was Po arrested by the police

275
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,060
and his bail rejected?

276
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,220
What are you and Mr. Chun
hiding from me?

277
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,180
Tell me.

278
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:16,240
[Judge Chun Yue]

279
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,380
Who is it?

280
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:25,900
Mr. Chun.

281
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:27,620
Pick up.

282
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,220
Pick up.

283
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,060
I'll do it for you then.

284
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:43,740
You!

285
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,100
Mr. Chun.

286
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,460
Time to go to court.

287
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,780
Is my brother getting any better?

288
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,980
No big improvements,

289
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,740
but luckily,
it didn't get any worse either.

290
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,500
Long-term bed rest

291
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,660
will make his muscles
waste away slowly.

292
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,220
When you have time,

293
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,860
you can massage his hands and legs

294
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,060
to improve his blood circulation.

295
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,660
I hate to see him this way.

296
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,140
When he had a fight,

297
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,380
he never stopped

298
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,100
until every opponent was down.

299
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,740
It's just a fight.

300
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,260
No need to make it sound so dramatic.

301
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,260
Aren't you afraid of me?

302
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,740
Why should I?

303
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,980
Why didn't you dare to look at me then?

304
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,540
Hey.

305
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,100
A sandwich

306
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,540
and...

307
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,100
a cup of

308
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,660
bubble tea.

309
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,700
My treat.

310
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,420
Sorry for the misunderstanding.

311
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,300
People like you,

312
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,460
they don't apologize, do they?

313
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,820
Do you want to hear it?

314
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,020
I don't drink bubble tea.

315
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,620
Throw it into the dustbin then.

316
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,580
I don't take back

317
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:00,860
what I give.

318
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,060
Hey.

319
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,540
This is for you.

320
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,100
Thanks.

321
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,300
Where is the straw?

322
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,060
Mr. Hon Lit, your sandwich.

323
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,300
Where's the bubble tea?

324
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:29,780
Give me some space.

325
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,980
I'm just leaving the hospital.

326
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:10,660
Yat-wai,

327
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,060
you should stay

328
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,500
with your grandma for a few days.

329
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,380
Why?

330
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,060
I've been busy lately.

331
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,580
You'll be under good care,

332
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,740
and her home is close to your school.

333
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,340
Good morning, Mr. Chun.

334
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,180
Ms. Tong.

335
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,220
May I come in?

336
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,140
Please.

337
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,060
Good morning.

338
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,860
A friend from the Report Center

339
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,540
informed me

340
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,740
that you reported to the police

341
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,700
last night.

342
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,900
I've checked it out,

343
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,780
and it should have been
an attempted home burglary.

344
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,300
We have already increased police patrols

345
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,220
in the nearby area.

346
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,020
Thank you for coming by.

347
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,420
I'm a bit worried

348
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,180
that those behind the bomb scare
last time

349
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,180
haven't given up,

350
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,820
so I handled this for you
as soon as possible.

351
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,500
Anyway, stay alert

352
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,340
and be careful recently.

353
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,340
Anything else?

354
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,540
I need to drop him off at school.

355
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,420
If you need more details,

356
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,420
you can call me anytime.

357
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,500
Sure.

358
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:26,820
Stay safe.

359
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:32,940
Bye.

360
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,220
Coach,

361
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,300
sorry

362
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,060
for getting you involved.

363
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,940
It's alright. Just leave it behind.

364
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,700
I drank

365
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,740
because of a bad mood.

366
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,540
I really miss my mom.

367
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,580
I'm also from

00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,980
a single-parent family.

369
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,980
I know your mom

370
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,820
passed away.

371
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,700
But this can't be your excuse to drink.

372
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:39,580
No.

373
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:42,860
Not the same.

My mom...

376
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,940
She killed herself.

377
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:38,620
Yes.

378
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,060
Po has been transferred
to a single cell.

379
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,740
Maybe they want to protect him.

380
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,740
Maybe they're against him.

381
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:54,740
Calm down.

382
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,540
I can't.

383
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,420
I can't face his family.

384
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,740
We're at a dead end.

385
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,660
Turning ourselves in

386
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,460
may be the best option.

387
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,140
It may make things better.

388
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:05,900
No, no, no.

389
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,900
This is the least possible option.

390
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:07,940
Doing this

391
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,580
will worsen his situation, and yours.

392
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,020
Last night,

393
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,900
some strangers came outside my house.

394
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,580
Who are they?

395
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:18,820
I don't know.

396
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,940
They had left
when I went out to check on it.

397
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,940
But I suspect

398
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,420
they're Hon Fui-lung's men.

399
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,740
Even he knows?

400
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,340
I'm not sure.

401
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,540
What is certain

402
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,420
is that he won't let things go easily.

403
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,660
If you call the police,
he will find out.

404
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,300
By then,

405
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,500
you can't get away with it.

406
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,220
You have a wife and your kids.

407
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,220
What now?

408
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,580
Make sure about one thing

409
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:44,860
that Po

410
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,140
doesn't plead guilty.

411
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,420
If he does,

412
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,500
Hon Fui-lung

413
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,700
will kill everyone

414
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,620
who is involved in this case,

415
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,820
including me, my son,

416
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,660
you, your wife,

417
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:57,780
and your two kids.

418
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:00,860
Remember.

419
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,260
We can't say a word.

420
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,580
So does Po.

421
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,500
But I have lost contact with Po.

422
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,420
Why is that?

423
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,780
Last time, because of the money,

424
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,140
neither he nor his mother
trusts me anymore.

425
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,660
Even my wife is keeping an eye on me.

426
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,620
What about Ms. Chow?

427
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,380
She told me

428
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,140
she had quit.

429
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:51,740
Lok-man,

430
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,980
are... are you okay?

431
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,460
Here, have some water.

432
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,500
Thanks.

433
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,220
How are you feeling?

434
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,700
Getting better?

435
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:22,820
I'm not drunk.

436
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,060
I just

437
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,620
feel frustrated and depressed.

438
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,140
Sorry.

439
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,580
I messed up the case you gave me.

440
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,500
Don't be silly.

441
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,260
When you go to court,

442
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,900
you win or you lose.

443
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,340
Are you giving up?

444
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,180
Sometimes, I do hope

445
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,220
to be as strong as you are, Master.

446
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,580
I'm not as strong as you think I am.

447
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,540
When my wife passed away,

448
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,340
I felt

449
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,180
so lost.

450
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,900
My wife committed suicide.

451
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,380
What puzzles me the most

452
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,810
is the reason

453
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,300
why she did that.

454
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,900
I never figured it out.

455
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,620
I believe

456
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,340
Mrs. Chun did it for a solid reason.

457
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,580
And you had done your best.

458
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,460
You can't find an answer

459
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,100
for everything that happens
in this world.

460
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,060
I've never

461
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,020
told anyone about this before.

462
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,060
I just want you to know

463
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,740
that no matter you're a judge

464
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,860
or a lawyer,

465
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,060
you can't show your weakness

466
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,140
to others,

467
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,140
because these weak spots

468
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,300
will be used against you.

469
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,980
What happened exactly?

470
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,460
Tong Huen came to me

471
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,740
and showed me a photo

472
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,180
of a young man

473
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,740
severely burnt by hot oil.

474
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,620
Because I went to the old town

475
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,660
and because I accepted an interview.

476
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,780
It happened because of me.

477
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,020
You only told me Ma San-po stole a car,

478
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:27,740
but now,

479
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:28,620
it's about

480
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,500
gang conflict.

481
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,820
I can't.

482
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,420
I really can't.

483
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,740
Ms. Tong

484
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,740
only caught a suspect

485
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,260
during the investigation.

486
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,460
Her sole purpose

487
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,860
is to find enough evidence needed

488
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,220
to sue the suspect

489
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,460
and obviously,

490
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,780
she doesn't have enough.

491
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:53,940
How do you know?

492
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,580
If she had enough evidence,

493
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,020
she wouldn't need to scare you
with a photo.

494
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,220
They said

495
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,540
Ma San-po was in danger.

496
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,460
Taking him into protective custody

497
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,740
is the safest way.

498
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:07,900
They told you that

499
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,980
to buy more time

500
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,220
to interrogate the suspect.

501
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,060
This is their usual tactic.

502
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,980
Why did you go to the old town?

503
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,860
I went to look for Ma San-po's alibi.

504
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,740
What alibi?

505
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,500
When the car accident happened,

506
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:32,020
Ma San-po was stealing another car.

507
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,940
This is his alibi.

508
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,260
Hey.

509
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,380
Hon Lit.

510
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,140
This is my personal number.

511
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,620
Calling you directly

512
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,460
is faster
than calling the police station.

513
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,100
They took down my man.

514
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,340
We're working on it.

515
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,500
We'll find the culprit.

516
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,580
My man was burned alive

517
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,500
and thrown into a dump
like he was garbage.

518
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,020
He had a three-year-old kid, madam.

519
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,620
I said

520
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,060
we're investigating.

521
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,940
Why bother?

522
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,260
No one would do that
except Chi Cheung-wing.

523
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,180
And

524
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,100
my big brother's case.

525
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,820
You said the same.

526
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:19,780
Where is the culprit now?

527
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,820
Have you got him?

528
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,660
Well, the hot oil case.

529
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,540
Do you have any special leads

530
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,700
to offer to the police?

531
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:47,540
Mr. Hon Lit.

532
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:53,980
Mr. Hon Lit.

533
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:56,780
Mr. Hon Lit.

534
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,460
Mr. Hon Lit.

535
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,900
We've sent people to Timbo's home

536
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,700
to send our regards to his family.

537
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,860
Reimbursement has been sent to them

538
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,700
as per your order.

539
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,340
He worked for me for so many years.

540
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,820
No matter what,

541
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,580
he deserved a decent ending.

542
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,500
Chi Cheung-wing is way too arrogant.

543
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,900
We must get even with him.

544
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,060
Lung specifically instructed us

545
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,020
not to act on our own.

546
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:34,940
What does this mean?

547
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,380
Hire a bodyguard and hide at home?

548
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,580
Be a coward?

549
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,420
Lit,

550
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,260
don't be so angry.

551
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,660
Your brother is in the hospital.

552
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,020
If anything goes wrong,

553
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,140
we'll be the ones who suffer.

554
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,020
You have to trust your dad.

555
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,660
He's holding back right now,

556
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,860
not because he's a coward.

557
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,020
He has a plan.

558
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,260
It's not that I don't trust him.

559
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,060
I just don't trust those cops.

560
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,860
We can bribe the dirty cops,

561
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,940
so can Chi Cheung-wing.

562
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,900
No one is truly reliable.

563
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,900
I can only rely on myself.

564
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,860
Wait, what?

565
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,300
Stealing another car?

566
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,420
What alibi?

567
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,420
What did Ma San-po say to you?

568
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,100
We can't reveal the conversation
with the person involved.

569
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,100
Didn't you teach me that, Master?

570
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,860
Yeah, yeah.

571
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,780
I just think Ma San-po

572
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,940
has a criminal record.

573
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,500
I'm not sure

574
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,820
if we can trust what he says.

575
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,580
He also has another accomplice.

576
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,700
I went to the old town just to find him.

577
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,780
Another accomplice?

578
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,020
Who? What's his name?

579
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,260
I want to analyze for you.

581
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,860
He's also from the old town.

582
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,580
And he's one year younger
than Ma San-po.

583
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,740
Did you find him then?

584
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,220
Don't even mention it.

585
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,100
The minute I went in,

586
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,100
they chased me away with brooms

587
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,420
and kept yelling at me.

588

I think you'd better

595

You know

596

he's kept in a single cell now.

597
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,100
He must feel lonely

598
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,060
and helpless.

How should I tell him?

603
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,820
You'd better tell him

604
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,740
to say nothing at all.

605
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,380
Because no matter what he says,

606
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,700
it'll be misunderstood.

if there are Ma San-po's fingerprints
on the car,

663
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,540
and also interrogate the friend

664

who stole the car with him.

665
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,860
How reliable is that?

00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,620

up my sleeve.

These photos that I took

669
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,020
should be of the car
Ma San-po stole at that time.

670
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,700
As long as the car is found,

671
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,300
we can prove Ma San-po has an alibi.

672
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,860
At the same time, it can also prove

673
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,180
that the real culprit

674
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,180
is someone else.

How did you know?

678
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,260
Because that morning,

00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,820
around 10 AM, when I left home,

680
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,180
I found Ma San-po

681
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,620
around my home.

682
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:35,900
What?

683
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,740
I already told the police this

684
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,220
when I was at the police station
for the lineup.

685
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,340
Why didn't you tell me this before?

686
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,420
Because there was a two-hour gap

687
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,300
between my car being stolen

688
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,420
and the car accident.

689
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,180
Don't you think

690
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,020
you should tell me...

691
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:46,980
And a lot could have happened
in that time.

692
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,220
This is a crucial clue.

693
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,620
It's also possible
that someone drove my car

694
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,180
and hit someone.

695
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,100
Why didn't you tell me

696
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:52,780
you recognized Ma San-po?

697
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,100
I didn't want to influence
your judgment.

698
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:54,980
so I didn't tell you.

699
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,260
Do you want to drop this case?

700
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,900
Three hours ago,

701
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,980
I did want to drop this case.

702
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,180
You can tell him...

703
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,220
You asked me to stick to the end.

704
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,500
You can tell him

705
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,180
that Ma San-po

706
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,340
is willing to admit

707
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,860
to the crime of using the vehicle

708
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,420
without the owner's consent.

709
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,740
The maximum sentence
for this is two years.

710
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,340
If you request probation,

711
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,940
he might be released in three months.

712
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,700
Do you think Hon Fui-lung
will have the patience

713
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,500
to wait for Ma San-po
to walk out of the prison alive?

714
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,940
You're a lawyer, not a bodyguard.

715
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:22,500
Yeah.

716
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,740
I am a lawyer.

717
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,820
So were you.

718
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,500
A lawyer's duty

719
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,980
is to maximize the client's interests.

720
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,500
Sorry, Master.

721
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,180
I think there are

722
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,380
a lot of inconsistencies in this case.

723
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,460
I'll continue handling this case

726
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,780

that when the accident happened,

728
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,500
my client was going to steal this car.

729
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,260
The young man
who was with Ma San-po is named Pak.

and his family runs a grocery store.

733
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,620
If we can prove

734
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,420
that Ma San-po
wasn't the one who hit Hon Gong,

735
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,380
then Hon Fui-lung

736
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,140
will have no reason
to start a war with the old town.

737
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:22,580
Turn off the engine.

738
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,300
I know the old town better.

739
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,380
I can go alone.

740
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,100
You wait here.

741
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:27,540
No way.

742
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:28,900
This is our business.

We're going together.

00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,820
The car should be ahead.
