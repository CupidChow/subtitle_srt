00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,420
about Hon Gong's hit-and-run case.

191
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,140
Then, Mr. Sek, as the chief inspector

192
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,060
of the Intelligence Bureau,
what do you think?

193
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,770
Hon Fui-lung is now in jail.

194
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,820
Chi Cheung-wing must want to take
this opportunity to take his position.

195
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,100
But

196
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,860
Hon Fui-lung has dominated
all these years.

197
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,250
So it won't be easy for Chi Cheung-wing

198
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,260
to bring him down now.

199
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,580
It will also be troublesome.

200
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,060
And superiors only care about one thing,

201
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,180
stability.

202
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,010
It's simple.

203
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,100
We can

204
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,100
show Hon Fui-lung some benefits first,

205
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,100
letting him out to meet his son,

206
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,300
so as to calm him down,

207
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:37,980
right?

208
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,650
And we'll talk about the rest later.

209
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,730
As for the collective fights,
they are no big deal.

210
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,890
Just take it as saving the jail's cost.

211
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,420
But we should keep a close eye

212
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,460
on Hon Gong's hit-and-run case.

213
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,580
Report, Mr. Tat.

214
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,540
Last night, two gangs fought
with weapons

215
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,220
and caused many injuries.

216
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,340
It also involves criminal damage.

217
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,060
As for whether it is specially related

218
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,180
to Hon Gong's car accident,

219
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,180
it's still under investigation.

220
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,700
No more investigation.

221
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,650
Release them all.

222
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:14,820
Release them?

223
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,020
We found out last night...

224
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,850
That's an order.

225
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,650
Can't you understand it?

226
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,300
Close the door gently

227
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,250
when you go out.

228
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:26,780
Does it smell good?

229
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,890
It has a strong aroma.

230
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,490
And it's smooth on the palate.

231
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,220
Yes, sir!

232
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:30,900
More refreshing

233
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,900
than the cloying ones.

234
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,300
[Eastern District Police Station]
Mr. Chun, you are so lucky.

235
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,370
In the past,

236
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,060
not even a single one
out of ten reported missing cars

237
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,980
can be found in the Eastern District.

238
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,300
But it only takes one night

239
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,340
to find your car.

240
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,010
Take a look.

241
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,260
When we found the car,

242
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,300
its headlights and doors are damaged.

243
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,940
If there was no damage
before it was reported missing,

244
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,700
note it.

245
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:49,980
Not before that.

246
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,460
Then you can sign.

247
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,420
Alright.

248
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,850
It's just routine.

249
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,010
We found the young man.

250
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,580
He drove without a driver's license.

251
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,340
Consider it good
that he didn't crash your car.

252
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,080
Can I get my car back?

253
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:02,780
Yes.

254
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,280
Do you bring the key?

255
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,460
Do you need me
to call a tow truck for you?

256
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:06,490
I brought it.

257
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:07,940
OK. Thank you.

258
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:08,700
Mr. Chun.

259
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,100
Is it Mr. Lo Wai-tak
who competes with you

260
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,610
for the president of the court?

261
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:16,560
It seems to be him.

262
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,940
If you need anything in the future,

263
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:20,940
I'm at your service.

264
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,100
We don't want him

265
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,010
to spoil the reputation of the court.

266
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:26,770
I will do my best.

267
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,700
But the capable one
will get the position.

268
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,700
Thank you. Goodbye.

269
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,890
Mr. Chun, your car.

270
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,300
After getting the car back,

271
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,300
remember to get a car inspection.

272
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,820
And change the headlights as well.

273
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,730
Safety first.

274
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,180
Thank you.

275
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:53,940
What happened to you?

276
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,010
Relax.

277
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,010
Breathe to my rhythm.

278
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:08,700
Thank you.

279
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:10,530
Here you are.

280
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,610
Do you feel better?

281
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,250
Why didn't you come
to watch the game yesterday?

282
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,100
Let's go.

283
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,060
By the way, coach,

284
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,180
I forgot to bring my notes.

285
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:47,700
I need to go now.

286
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,130
Lung, I'm sure you can imagine
that without you,

287
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,100
how chaotic it is outside,

288
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:56,530
right?

289
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,820
There is no need to involve
all of your people.

290
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,610
Have a cup of coffee.

291
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,300
Lung.

292
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,850
Allow me some time.

293
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,460
If it's necessary,

294
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,100
how about I give you two days

295
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,010
to meet your son out there?

296
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,460
Let your people go home and rest.

297
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,010
There is no need to make it serious.

298
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,490
Nothing is settled yet.

299
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,860
It's a waste.

300
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,250
Here.

301
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:42,780
Mr. Wu.

302
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,820
Any instructions from our superior?

303
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,300
Release all the people

304
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,650
you arrested yesterday,

305
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,850
whether they are subordinate
to Chi Cheung-wing

306
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,010
or Hon Fui-lung.

307
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,130
What?

308
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,850
We arrested three cars of people.

309
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,300
They hurt people
and caused criminal damage.

310
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,250
And we also smashed several
newly-found drug trafficking spots.

311
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,420
And now you want me to release them?

312
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,130
Have you ever seen me drinking coffee?

313
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,130
Mr. Wu, don't beat around the bush.

314
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,010
It's decided by those who drink coffee.

315
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,770
They say harmony is important,

316
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,300
and they don't want further troubles.

317
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,890
Sorry, Mr. Sek.

318
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,500
The coffee
at our Eastern District Police Station

319
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,730
isn't as good as
the headquarters' coffee.

320
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,530
You had such a good chat with Mr. Tat.

321
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,340
So what brings you here?

322
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,730
If Hon Fui-lung's son matters much,

323
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,820
what about the man he killed?

324
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,130
You actually sympathized with him
and made a deal with him.

325
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,130
If so,

326
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,300
Hon Gong deserves it even more.

327
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,460
Will you let go

328
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,700
the murderer who hit him?

329
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,890
I know you're angry,

330
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,300
but we made a deal

331
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,250
not to let the business
affect our feelings，

332
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,010
right?

333
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,250
But to put it this way,

334
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,940
if your Regional Crime Unit

335
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,130
needs help from our Intelligence Bureau,

336
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,060
I don't mind

337
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,180
helping you

338
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,370
out of my personal feelings.

339
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,580
So I would like to ask you,

340
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,180
is it a clear distinction
between public and private

341
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,300
or the opposite?

342
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,370
Let me put it this way.

343
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,530
It means

344
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,610
I'll help you, Ms. Tong,
as long as you need.

345
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:18,330
See you in the usual spot.

346
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,020
[Hokong Judiciary]

347
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:28,580
Mr. Chun.

348
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,900
The court session starts
in half an hour.

349
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,260
And also,

350
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,860
I wanted to tell you...

351
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,420
Ms. Sum is here.

352
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,180
I've retired,

353
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,570
and I'm no longer a judge.

354
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,180
I'm sitting here

355
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,490
as Mr. Chun's mother-in-law.

356
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,900
Why did you come

357
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,980
without telling me in advance?

358
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,010
Do you mean I shouldn't?

359
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,250
Should I come back tomorrow?

360
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,460
It's okay.

361
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,460
Then I'll leave now.

362
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:52,900
Sit.

363
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:53,770
What brings you here?

364
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,730
Why didn't you tell me

365
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,330
that the car was stolen?

366
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,860
The car was once stolen,

367
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,140
and now it's back.

368
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,700
I didn't want you to worry.

369
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,700
The car was registered in my name.

370
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,090
But I didn't even know it
until the Transport Department

371
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:08,980
notified me.

372
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,290
Sorry.

373
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,660
I don't want to always be the last

374
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,010

no matter what.

steal Mr. Chun's?

to see an attorney.

413
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,770
They can only tell it's either
an European car or a Japanese car.

Judging from the pieces of headlights
found at the scene,

they said it was likely
to be a Japanese car.

I can sue them for excessive violence.

562
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,380
No need.

563
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:18,300
I

564
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,700
don't want to get into more trouble.

565
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,770
You have more trouble?

566
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,960
Are you now asking me

567
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:34,900
to be investigated formally?

568
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,050
If yes, there should be

569
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,980
some legal documents.

570
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,250
Not being investigated,

571
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,490
but to cooperate with the investigation.

572
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,570
Go back with us to identify the suspect.

573
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,180
In the early hours of this morning,

574
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,050
Hon Fui-lung
and Chi Cheung-wing's men

575
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:48,940
got into a violent conflict

576
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,810
over territory.

577
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,700
More than ten of them were injured,
with three in critical condition.

578
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,770
It's just commonplace for them.

579
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,770
If Hon Fui-lung gets to know

580
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,700
it was Chi Cheung-wing's men
who injured his son,

581
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,490
god knows how many more people will die.

582
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,620
So what can you do?

583
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,940
I can catch the suspect who hit Hon Gong

584
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,570
as soon as possible

585
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,700
and bring them to justice,

586
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,250
giving Hon Fui-lung an explanation.

587
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:09,490
This

588
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,730
is the best way to settle the crisis.

589
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:12,730
Otherwise,

590
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,570
this will only go on and on.

591
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,220
I know you have criminal records
for car theft

592
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,860
and other thefts.

593
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,490
But you were sentenced lightly
as a minor.

594
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:26,900
These are all in the past.

595
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,900
You are eighteen years old.

596
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,570
They will sue you as an adult.

597
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,250
Maybe

598
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,250
I can intercede for you in other ways.

599
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:40,940
For example,

600
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,140
your family's situation?

601
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,050
Before I came,

602
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,620
I met your mom.

603
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,180
She was worried about you.

604
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,660
She kept asking me

605
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,420
when you can go home.

606
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,520
Your mother said

607
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,940
your family can't live without you.

608
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,090
You have three younger siblings

609
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,140
and your father is gone.

610
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,860
They can only rely on you.

611
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,860
I need you to tell me

612
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,420
everything that happened

613
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,530
before you were arrested by the police.

614
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,220
I need to know everything.

615
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,220
Only then can I help you.

616
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,660
I am your attorney.

617
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,700
My duty

618
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,570
is to protect your rights and interests.

619
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,530
Remember,

620
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,700
whenever being interrogated,

621
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,380
you must also require
the presence of an attorney.

622
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:57,620
And I am

623
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,770
your attorney.

624
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,250
Understand?

625
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,660
Mr. Chun.

626
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,730
If you need me to go through the process

627
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,180
by formally submitting the application

628
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,570
and asking you to go back
to assist in the investigation,

629
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,730
I can do that.

630
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,570
But do we

631
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,620
have to be

632
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,460
so businesslike?

633
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,900
The sooner this matter is resolved,

634
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,250
the fewer innocent people
will be harmed.

635
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,180
Mr. Chun,

636
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,860
could you help us this time?

637
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:43,070
[Hokong Eastern District Police Station]

638
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:43,700
Ms. Tong.

639
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,330
I need you to keep my name and identity

640
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,090
confidential.

641
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:48,660
And also,

642
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,420
the registered owner of the car

643
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,260
is my mother-in-law,

644
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,140
but if you have any questions,
come to me directly.

645
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,180
After all, she is a retired judge.

646
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,220
I don't want her to be bothered.

647
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,180
Totally understood.

648
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:58,860
Mr. Chun.

649
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,090
I know Hon Fui-lung is involved

650
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:01,980
in the matter this time,

651
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:02,980
so you might be a little nervous.

652
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,460
But I assure you

653
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,330
that all information
will be kept strictly confidential.

654
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,660
Just help me identify the prisoner later.

655
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,420
OK.

656
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,050
Are we now going
to the Identification Room?

657
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:12,900
Sure.

658
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,570
The prisoner can't see you in that room.

659
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,290
Rest assured.

660
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,140
Rascal!

661
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:29,980
Kwok Wa.

662
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,290
Don't wrongfully accuse me!

663
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,570
I didn't steal the car.

664
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,530
Don't you frame me!

665
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,700
I didn't steal the car.

666
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,050
Rascal, I didn't do it!

667
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:36,660
Hold him down!

668
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,330
I didn't!

669
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,380
I didn't do it!

670
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,570
The police stole the car!

671
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,330
It was the police who stole it,

672
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,770
not me!

673
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,180
Not me!

674
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:47,770
Let go!

675
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:56,490
I'm sorry, ma'am.

676
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,250
I'm sorry, Mr. Chun.

677
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:58,810
Take him away!

678
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,660
I'm really sorry, Mr. Chun.

679
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,460
I hope you are all right.

680
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:08,900
I'm good.

681
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,250
That prisoner seems to know you.

682
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,700
Do you remember

683
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,010
when and where you had seen him?

684
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,420
Do you have any impressions of him?

685
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,620
I remember that day,

686
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,090
I left the house around 10:00 AM.

687
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,050
He seemed to be across

688
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,010
from my house.

689
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:27,460
OK.

690
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,050
I'm really sorry.

691
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,680
I'll take you downstairs.

692
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,330
Yat-wai.

693
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,420
Recently,

694
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,570
our family's car was stolen.

695
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,840
Do you know what happened?

696
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,180
Did my father tell you?

697
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,010
He wouldn't tell me anything, for sure.

698
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,810
But the Transport Department

699
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,900
saw that the car
was registered in my name,

700
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,980
so they informed me the car was found.

701
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,460
Your district has always been very safe.

702
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,380
Why would someone steal our car?

703
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,290
Yat-wai.

704
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,700
If anything happens in the future,

705
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,100
you should tell me, alright?

706
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,940
Don't be like your mother.

707
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,220
Grandma, that's enough.

708
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,770
I'll go for now.

709
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:21,700
Yat-wai?

710
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,810
Why does the boy just now

711
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,660
have so many injuries on his face?

712
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,420
He resisted arrest.

713
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,180
It's just a car theft.

714
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:41,980
Do they have to treat him so hard?

715
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,290
Mr. Chun.

716
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,250
He is not an ordinary boy.

717
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,770
He is from the old town.

718
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,380
Right in last month,

719
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,420
one of my subordinates

720
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,220
was stabbed by someone
from the old town

721
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,490
and is still lying in the hospital.

722
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,700
He drove a stolen car.

723
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,380
No one knows

724
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,420
what weapon he's carrying with him.

725
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,380
If it were you,

726
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,180
will you risk your own life?

727
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,570
We can never show mercy

728
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,940
to criminals.

729
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,050
Please stop.

730
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:21,660
Yat-wai.

731
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:23,490
Yat-wai.

732
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,730
Don't go.

733
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:25,980
There is a police in the car.

734
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:26,940
Don't run.

735
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:29,620
Father.

736
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,940
The police came to the school for me.

737
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:33,860
I've asked.

738
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,380
It's a theft case
which has nothing to do with you.

739
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,420
No need to be afraid.

740
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,010
Just let them arrest me,

741
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,380
so it won't affect you.

742
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,140
Do you think it'll be fine
if you get arrested?

743
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,810
Will Hon Fui-lung let you off?

744
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,900
Will he let me off?

745
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,460
You've grown up.

746
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,700
Weren't you going to call the police?

747
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,330
The police is right behind now.

748
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,490
Just tell her what you want to say.

749
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,010
Tell her.

750
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,050
Just tell her.

751
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,140
Chun Yat-wai.

752
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,660
What did you do
to upset you father so much?

753
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,380
Do you have something to say?

754
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:16,900
It's nothing.

755
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,420
He's grown up,

756
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,980
but I can't figure out
what's on his mind.

757
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,380
Young people are always like that.

758
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:28,490
Get in.

759
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:37,610
Your Honor.

760
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,740
We maintain that my client,

761
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,170
Ma San-po's action

762
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,380
does not constitute car theft,

763
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,300
but rather, he drove a car

764
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,980
without the knowledge
that it had been reported missing

765
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,010
and was thus arrested.

766
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,380
And the defense has reasonable grounds

767
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,300
to suspect the police used excessive
force during the interrogation.

768
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:55,940
Therefore, we

769
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,490
maintain a position of reasonable doubt

770
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:58,740
regarding the validity
of the accusations.

771
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,090
Your Honor,

772
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,050
the defense attorney

773
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,210
raised no objection
to the police investigation

774
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,300
throughout its duration.

775
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,010
Raising this issue deliberately now

776
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,010
appears to divert the court's attention
from the key issues.

777
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,170
Your Honor.

778
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,260
We insist on bail pending trial.

779
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,490
Please transfer my client

780
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,010
to a safe place.

781
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,260
Defense attorney.

782
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,090
Your request will be overruled

783
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,820
because I received

784
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,340
some information

785
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,980
that is not suitable for disclosure
in court for now.

786
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,610
Not suitable for disclosure in court?

787
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:36,650
Your Honor...

788
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,170
Regarding all doubts

789
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,570
raised by the defense,

790
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,260
I contend

791
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,420
that the prosecution

792
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,210
should conduct a seven-day
supplementary investigation,

793
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,530
after which

794
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,050
the trial will reopen.

795
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,050
During these seven days,

796
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,300
Ma San-po

797
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,300
will remain in police custody,

798
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,130
no bail pending trial is allowed.

799
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,580
Po.

800
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,220
Mom.

801
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:07,940
Po, are you alright?

802
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:08,740
I'm fine.

803
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,700
I'm fine, don't worry.

804
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,860
Don't say anything.

805
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,780
You will be fine.

806
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,460
Why will he be detained for seven days?

807
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,570
Didn't you say
he would be home soon?

808
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,300
Ms. Chan.

809
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:25,740
Give me some time.

810
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,010
Please believe me.

811
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:58,260
Madam.

812
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,980
Mr. Chun's car test report.

813
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,570
Why don't you hand it over
directly to the Regional Crime Unit?

814
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,210
Lung doesn't trust them.

815
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,380
So he trusts me?

816
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,610
I trust you.

817
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:05,820
Hello?

818
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:06,820
Mr. Chun.

819
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:07,940
Sorry

820
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:08,690
for disturbing you again.

821
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,380
Ms. Tong, please go ahead.

822
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,610
I'm calling to inform you

823
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,740
that your car
will be temporarily impounded

824
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,610
because the test report

825
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,090
confirmed that your car

826
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,300
was the one that hit
and injured Hon Gong.

827
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,300
Okay.

828
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,380
I will fully cooperate
in the investigation.
