1
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,300
This piece of evidence is important.

2
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,530
I personally brought it over,

3
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,980
so no others can hold it.

4
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,780
If the laboratory result is out,

5
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,130
you can only inform me.

6
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:38,820
Hello.

7
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:40,540
I know

8
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,180
who hit Hon Gong with the car.

9
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,090
Who are you?

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,820
Who are you exactly?

11
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,580
If Hon Fui-lung gets to know

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,450
it was Chi Cheung-wing's men
who injured his son,

13
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,260
this will never stop.

14
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:56,820
It's Chi Cheung-wing's man,

15
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,050
one of the old town.

16
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:11,660
Father.

17
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:13,820
Are you okay?

18
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:58,080
[Justice Is Mine]

19
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,080
[Episode 4]

20
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,660
Alright.

21
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,940
You are all so smart.

22
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,420
Take it and play gacha.

23
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,420
Go ahead.

24
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,220
Go over and play gacha.

25
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,260
You haven't been back for a long time.

26
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,180
Let's talk inside.

27
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,020
Chi.

28
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,820
Ask Pak

29
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,900
to bring two boxes
of roast suckling pig.

30
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,300
Aye.

31
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,540
And chili sauce.

32
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,580
Roger that, Chi.

33
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,700
I remember you like spicy food.

34
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:06,780
Chi, the beer.

35
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,500
Do you know why I asked you here?

36
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,540
I don't know.

37
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,100
Suet came to me last night,

38
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,540
crying so much
that her eyes were swollen.

39
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,100
You should have known

40
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,580
the matter of her son, Ma San-po.

41
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,820
I've heard of it.

42
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,060
Po is the eldest son.

43
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,540
His father died.

44
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,060
He supports the whole family

45
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,620
all by himself.

46
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,260
Go to jail just for stealing a car?

47
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,420
It's a loss no matter what,

48
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,220
right?

49
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,620
Suet told me

50
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,780
that on the night Po was arrested,

51
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,340
someone asked him out.

52
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,980
Do you know who it is?

53
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,100
It's your husband, Cho Wai-yi.

54
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,660
Speaking of him,

55
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,580
he was dismissed by the police

56
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,940
and had offended all these gangsters.

57
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,860
He can't survive either way.

58
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,140
Just by smuggling cigarettes
and home appliances,

59
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,740
can he support the whole family?

60
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,220
Our life is simple.

61
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,700
It is enough to have
an accommodation and food.

62
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,660
Chi, the roast suckling pig.

63
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,620
Don't run around these days.

64
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,060
Stay at home.

65
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,020
Thank you, Chi.

66
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,980
Although you are married to an outsider,

67
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,100
I still want you to be happy.

68
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,900
But those who stay in the old town

69
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,940
is my people.

70
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,660
If anything happens,

71
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,460
I can't ignore it.

72
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,540
Get in.

73
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,940
So you are from the old town?

74
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,140
Come.

75
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,500
Come on.

76
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,260
Over here.

77
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,780
My name is Hung.

78
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,660
Big Fat Bear.

79
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,860
With me here,
no one dares to hurt you.

80
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,980
I've got your back.

81
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,180
Sit.

82
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,820
What's your name?

83
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:50,820
Po.

84
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,620
Po.

85
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,020
Hung.

86
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,340
Why are you in jail?

87
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,100
I did things for Chi.

88
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,260
Why ask so much?

89
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,220
What about you?

90
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,740
They say I stole a car.

91
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,060
Stealing a car is such a small matter.

92
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,580
It is impossible
not to let you go on bail.

93
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,260
Tell me the truth.

94
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:13,940
Ma San-po.

95
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,180
Your attorney is here.

96
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,180
Was Wai at home that night?

97
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:24,980
Yes.

98
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,140
And Po came to him?

99
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,580
Sa.

100
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,740
I know you wouldn't say anything

101
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,420
that are not good for your husband.

102
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,900
But don't force me

103
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,780
to use your children as an excuse.

104
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,940
Do you understand?

105
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,300
What did they talk about?

106
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,820
Do you know Hon Fui-lung?

107
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,780
No.

108
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,460
Everyone knows

109
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,180
Hon Fui-lung and I are incompatible.

110
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,300
Sooner or later, we'll have a battle.

111
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,500
His eldest son
is now lying in the hospital.

112
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,860
The guy who hit him
had already taken off.

113
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,740
Everyone says that old town did it.

114
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,860
So the police

115
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,340
concluded that Po did it.

116
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,460
Hey.

117
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,500
If Hon Fui-lung's son dies,

118
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,940
the charges against Po
will be worse than car theft.

119
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,460
It will be murder.

120
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,420
Your husband

121
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,020
can't get out of this matter.

122
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,020
Po.

123
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,980
Do you want me to help you?

124
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,500
You are my client.

125
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,860
If you want me to continue to help you,

126
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,260
you have to tell your uncle

127
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,060
not to fire me.

128
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,340
I want to see my mother.

129
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,820
You can only see an attorney
for the time being.

130
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,820
If we cooperate,

131
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,660
I can do my best
to help you apply for bail.

132
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,460
Then you can go home
and see your mother.

133
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:32,820
They...

134
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,500
They say in addition to the car theft,

135
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,860
I'm also involved in a traffic accident
that seriously injured someone.

136
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,420
Did they say who you hit?

137
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,340
Where and when?

138
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,620
I didn't hit anyone with the car at all.

139
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,100
According to police records,

140
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,580
the car was stolen

141
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,620
between 10:00 A.M. and 12:00 A.M.

142
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,180
Where were you during that period?

143
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,180
Why did you end up driving a stolen car

144
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,260
and get pulled over by the police?

145
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,740
Do you have any difficulties?

146
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,260
Did someone force you to keep silent?

147
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,460
If you cause serious
bodily injury to others

148
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,020
with a car accident,

149
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,860
you must be sentenced
to more than five years.

150
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,500
If you neither stole the car

151
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,980
nor hit anyone,

152
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,140
where exactly were you during that time?

153
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,620
I'm in the old town.

154
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,780
Has anyone seen you?

155
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,540
Back then,

156
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,940
I was with my friend.

157
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,060
What's his name?

158
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,540
I have to find him first

159
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,660
in order to help you establish an alibi,

160
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,300
so you can go home.

161
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,100
Can I really trust you?

162
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,020
His name is Pak.

163
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,860
We were stealing another car

164
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:18,940
in the old town back then.

165
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,340
A

166
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,980
white Mercedes-Benz
from an older generation.

167
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,220
It is rare to see in the old town.

168
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,420
The police had already
caught someone that night,

169
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,940
but so far,

170
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,780
no news was announced.

171
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,220
Then give them money.

172
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,660
Even if you're willing to offer it,

173
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,300
no one may dare to snitch.

174
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,540
I don't care.

175
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,940
I must know who this person is

176
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,020
and where he hides.

177
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,540
What are you doing?

178
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,420
I'm giving an injection to my patient.

179
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,340
The doctor said to give them
an injection every four hours.

180
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,420
Who are you?

181
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,900
You are not the previous nurse.

182
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,220
The previous nurse took a leave.

183
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,260
I was transferred
from the Northern District.

184
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,700
Actually, you can
ask the head nurse directly

185
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,420
if you have any concerns.

186
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,100
Can I continue the injection?

187
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,020
I heard that they are all gangsters.

188
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,540
But he looks quite handsome.

189
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,260
Turns out his whole family

appointments, too.

Don't be angry.

360

361
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,660
Of course.

362

Hey.

363
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,660
I can't get sick.

Don't deny it.

Take these.

00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,100
What are these?

369
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,500
Do you remember that you told me

370
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,940
the stomach medicine
you are taking now doesn't work?

371
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,580
So I helped you get new medicine.

372
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,620
Take my warning.

373
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,380
If you don't change

374
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,740
your terrifying habits of living,

375
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,300
no medicine will work for you.

376
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:44,700
Oh.

377
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,420
Ms. Tong, you are off work.

378
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,100
Don't always treat me

379
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,260
as your patient

380
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,260
and keep nagging,

381
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,140
okay?

382
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,060
I guess you haven't had anything.

383
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,220
Here.

384
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,060
I made porridge.

385
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,660
The taste doesn't matter.

386
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,220
What matters is

387
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,780
that it's easy to digest
and good for the stomach.

388
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,820
Whatever you made must be delicious.

389
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,660
Sure.

390
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,860
But to tell the truth,

391
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,260
you've been in the Northern District
for only two years,

392
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:10,860
but

393
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,300
you've already
become so long-winded.

394
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,860
Be careful,

395
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,140
or you'd end up alone.

396
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,940
I seem to be long-winded only to you.

397
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,580
But I also feel

398
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,540
that when I get back here
after these two years,

399
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,460
things changed a lot

400
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,140
in the Eastern District.

401
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,940
It's a lot more complicated.

402
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,020
Which department are you in?

403
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,340
ICU,

404
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,540
the Intensive Care Unit.

405
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,380
Stay away

406
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,500
from gangsters

407
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,300
and those from the Hon family.

408
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,540
But I'm a nurse.

409
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:45,940
If I stay away from them,

410
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,140
should I quit my job?

411
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,100
Anyway, just listen to me.

412
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,380
Don't get involved with those people,

413
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,260
okay?

414
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,340
Watch out for yourself.

415
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,580
Got it.

416
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,180
I bought you breakfast.

417
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,700
Did I wake you up?

418
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,620
I was awake the whole night.

419
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,300
Did our daughter cry late at night?

420
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,100
I looked for you all day yesterday.

421
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,020
Why don't you call me back?

422
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,860
I was out at sea, picking up a shipment.

423
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,500
There was no signal.

424
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,660
I went to Chi Cheung-wing.

425
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,260
Why did you go to him?

426
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,060
He asked me to meet him.

427
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,020
He didn't do anything to you, did he?

428
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,220
Is he still pestering you?

429
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,980
You and I have two children already.

430
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,220
But he still refused to give up?

431
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,180
Just quit your groundless thoughts.

432
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,020
Then why did he do that?

433
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,580
It's about Po.

434
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:12,980
What did he say?

435
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,060
Get out!

436
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,380
Get out!

437
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,780
Wai, what's the matter?

438
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,220
Do you even take me as your friend

439
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,380
or brother?

440
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,780
Can you put down the gun first?

441
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,460
Speeding, you said?

442
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,020
Aren't you the same with those rascals?

443
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,340
I did it all for you.

444
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,260
And I have two kids at home!

445
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,020
Should I even risk their lives

446
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,980
just for you?

447
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,980
Listen, I can explain this.

448
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,980
What are you going to explain?

449
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,820
Keep telling lies?

450
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,820
You know that the car hit someone.

451
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,340
You already knew who got hit by it,

452
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,460
but why did you still get me involved?

453
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,140
I didn't mean to get you involved.

454
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,580
OK.

455
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,060
Since you are pointing a gun at me,

456
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,300
just let me continue, will you?

457
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:19,980
Right.

458
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,180
My car hit someone.

459
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,820
That's why I got into so much trouble.

460
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,260
Wai.

461
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,300
I'm sorry.

462
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,820
I lied to you.

463
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,820
Ever since it hit someone,

464
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,540
I've lost count
of how many people I've cheated

465
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,780
and how many lies I've told them.

466
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,980
Because the person
who hit someone with the car

467
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,180
is Chun Yat-wai.

468
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:50,780
And then...

469
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,540
I don't know

470
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,460
why Po ended up like this, either.

471
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,860
If you think I deserve it now,

472
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,660
it's reasonable for you to shoot me.

473
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,260
Do you know who's the person

474
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,660
Yat-wai hit with the car?

475
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,660
Just because I knew it,
I did all these things.

476
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,260
I sentenced Hon Fui-lung to prison.

477
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,420
If my son is also in jail,
what will happen to him?

478
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,260
They would tear him apart.

479
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,060
You also have a son.

480
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,300
What would you do if it were you?

481
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,380
Shoot now,

482
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,420
and two people will die.

483
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,660
You are too ruthless.

484
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,460
I didn't use any force at all.

485
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,180
Does your wife know about this?

486
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,060
Turns out that night, she saw Po

487
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,060
drove the car away.

488
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,100
Then will she

489
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,700
tell Chi Cheung-wing?

490
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,780
She didn't say anything.

491
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,420
What about the future?

492
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,260
You are a father,

493
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,900
and I am also a father.

494
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,740
And I have two children.

495
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,660
Give me some time.

496
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,740
I will definitely think of a way.

497
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,180
I'll never let anything happen
to both of your children.

498
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:03,940
Mr. Chun.

499
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,060
Most of your funds are regular.

500
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,460
If you withdraw it now,

501
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,700
there will be a high processing fee.

502
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,500
It's not cost-effective.

503
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,980
But I really need money.

504
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,020
You have a joint account

505
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,740
with Chun Yat-wai.

506
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,020
This is a demand deposit.

507
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,180
You can withdraw money
without restrictions.

508
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,300
All right.

509
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,100
Just withdraw from this account.

510
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,700
I want cash.

511
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,780
Uncle.

512
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,300
Is your mom at home?

513
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,220
- Mom is inside.
- Mom is inside.

514
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:47,740
Son.

515
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,380
Uncle.

516
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,180
Go and play with your sister.

517
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:49,780
Just go.

518
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,700
Yesterday, you said

519
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,540
you will bail Po.

520
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,260
But you suddenly asked him
to confess his guilt now.

521
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,340
What's going on?

522
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,460
I didn't expect Po
to be so unlucky this time.

523
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,100
He followed Chi Cheung-wing

524
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,820
under the banner of the old town.

525
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,300
Now they're pinning
all the crimes on him.

526
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,780
Whether Po pleads guilty or not,

527
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,420
it will be hard for him
to avoid conviction now.

528
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,060
Then what should we do?

529
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,780
The owner of the car came to me

530
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,660
and said that as long
as Po pleads guilty,

531
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,260
he'll give you some money

532
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,980
which can support your life.

533
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,060
He?

534
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,340
Who is he?

535
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,380
Suet.

536
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,900
For the sake of our family,

537
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,940
don't ask.

538
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,260
I assure you

539
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,780
that you can get the money.

540
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,140
I will take care of you guys

541
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,860
until Po gets released from prison.

542
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,540
But I can't

543
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,580
let Po suffer such a grievance.

544
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,140
To be fair,

545
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,020
it's not the first time

546
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,060
Po steals cars and things.

547
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,860
When he grows up,

548
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,820
he might even help Chi Cheung-wing

549
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,460
smuggle drugs

550
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,580
for money.

551
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,900
In the future, he may

552
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,060
end up in jail as well.

553
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,300
You might as well

554
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,700
take this opportunity of his case

555
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,380
to change your fate.

556
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,220
With money,

557
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,900
you can raise the other three children.

558
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,500
With money,

559
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,220
Po can start over after he's released.

560
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,540
And most importantly,

561
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,740
with money,

562
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,220
you can leave the old town.

563
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,580
You have diabetes.

564
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,420
You need money to see doctors.

565
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,700
If you collapse,

566
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,220
what about those three children?

567
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,780
How is the man

568
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,780
hit by the car?

569
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,300
He's still in the hospital.

570
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,740
It's a common traffic accident.

571
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,740
Then do you know who he is?

572
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,660
No.

573
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,180
Hi.

574
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,060
Mr. Chun.

575
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,220
I heard

576
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,100
Mr. So

577
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,380
is on the shortlist
for Chief Justice as well.

578
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,900
It's a pity

579
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,100
that recently,

580
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,460
he was exposed to a scandal of cheating.

581
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,220
I heard that he wants
to withdraw from the election.

582
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,980
If it's true,

583
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,300
it will be you and me only.

584
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,580
The other day,

585
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,540
I saw the police searching your car.

586
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,140
It seems to be tense.

587
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,260
Is there anything wrong?

588
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,300
That madam

589
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,860
seems to be close to you.

590
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:42,980
She's not sensible enough

591
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,180
to have done that

592
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,500
in this critical period.

593
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,220
People have high expectations

594
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,300
to the character

595
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,940
of the Chief Justice.

596
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,020
I will respect the court's decision.

597
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,300
Sometimes, really,

598
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,980
things become difficult
when one's in a high position.

599
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,380
I think

600
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,500
one should be steady in life.

601
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,060
It's important to know one's place.

602
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,580
That's

603
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,660
a wise choice.

604
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:18,620
Chi.

605
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,580
Suet is here.

606
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:20,660
Chi.

607
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,260
Suet?

608
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,220
Chi.

609
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,060
Please help me.

610
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,580
Please help me and let me meet Po.

611
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,660
They won't let me see him.

612
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,140
He has an attorney, doesn't he?

613
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,420
The attorney can't help it.

614
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,940
What about Wai?

615
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,700
He is Po's uncle.

616
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,300
Can't he help you either?

617
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,660
Chi.

618
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,900
I beg you.

619
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,500
We used to be neighbors.

620
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,620
Please help me,

621
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,380
okay?

622
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:51,860
Chi.

623
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,700
Now Po is detained,

624
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,980
and I'm worried about him.

625
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,300
Please help me, Chi.

626
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:00,980
Chi.

627
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,780
I just can't say no to a woman.

628
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:06,940
Alright.

629
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,620
I have some buddies in prison.

630
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,420
I'll try to help you connect.

631
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,380
By then,

632
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,860
remember to pay them for the effort.

633
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,220
I see.

634
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,940
Thank you, Chi.

635
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,220
Po.

636
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:45,780
Mom.

637
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,260
Po.

638
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,260
- Po.
- Mom.

639
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,340
Mom.

640
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,100
How did you get in here?

641
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,180
I gave them some money

642
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,740
for a ten-minute talk with you.

643
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,020
Mom, where did you get the money?

644
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,060
Mom.

645
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:03,940
Mom?

646
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,540
No worries about money.

647
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,460
But...

648
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:08,820
Mom.

649
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,060
It's okay.

650
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:10,980
Tell me, what's it?

651
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:12,820
Mom.

652
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,740
I want you

653
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,780
to confess guilt.

654
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,940
Just take it as supporting our family.

655
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:27,740
Po.

656
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,300
We have no power.

657
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,820
There is no way we can win them.

658
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,220
It's not confessing guilt,

659
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,540
but yielding to fate, Po.

660
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,940
Your father passed away,

661
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,060
leaving nothing to us.

662
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,660
And I'm sick.

663
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,620
If you get in jail,

664
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,820
how can our family

665
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,100
live on?

666
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,980
But if there's compensation

667
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,300
for you to get in jail,

668
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,740
you can help the family find a way

669
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,740
and hope.

670
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:15,940
See?

671
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,900
Your brother
took the first place in this exam.

672
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,220
The teacher told me

673
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,140
it's very possible for him

674
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,380
to go to a better school.

675
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,180
And the same for your sister.

676
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,420
If we have money,

677
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,580
my diabetes can also be treated.

678
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,820
I can afford insulin then.

679
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,300
I'm really sorry, Po.

680
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,280
[Po has agreed.]

681
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:41,110
[Conference Room, Hokong University]

682
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,900
Now the director
of the education committee

683
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,100
will elaborate

684
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,260
the result of our trial

685
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:45,980
and suggestions.

686
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,860
Ms. Yu Yan

687
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,460
condoned student alcohol consumption
on campus.

688
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,580
She set an extremely negative example,

689
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,020
constituting a violation
of our educational philosophy

690
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,500
of fostering virtue and talent.

691
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,820
Following a convened meeting,
the committee has reached a decision

692
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,740
to recommend the termination

693
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,660
of Ms. Yu Xan's faculty contract.

694
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,220
Mr. Chun,

695
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,580
is our handling

696
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,500
appropriate for you?

697
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,380
Today,

698
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,140
I only attend as a parent.

699
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,540
But I think

700
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,700
first of all,

701
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,300
we can let Ms. Yu explain.

702
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,380
Ms. Yu,

703
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,380
what do you want to say?

704
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,140
I'll repeat it again.

705
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,500
As soon as I saw Chun Yat-wai
drinking on campus,

706
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,900
I went to stop him immediately.

707
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,180
Then did you drink with him?

708
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:20,700
No.

709
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,820
Then let's listen

710
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,820
to the student involved.

711
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,180
She didn't drink.

712
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,500
Only I did.

713
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,780
As a teacher,

714
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,460
you should stop students from drinking.

715
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,380
I snatched his bottle right away.

716
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,220
Didn't I stop him by doing so?

717
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,340
Do you mean I should
knock him unconscious

718
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,340
to stop him?

719
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,540
Can I have a few words?

720
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,060
Mr. Chun, please go ahead.

721
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,420
Actually, I came here this time

722
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,420
to show my gratitude to Ms. Yu.

723
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,060
Because Chun Yat-wai

724
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,660
suffers from severe asthma.

725
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,580
When the incident happened,

726
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,580
if it wasn't for Ms. Yu who arrived,

727
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,940
he could have been in the ICU.

728
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,460
As for how the school will

729
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,660
deal with this matter,

730
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,780
I'll respect your decision.

731
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,900
Mr. Chun, hold on, please.

732
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,420
Ms. Yu.

733
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,140
Wait for me in the car.

734
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,060
Yes?

735
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,860
I think you need to pay attention

736
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,220
to Chun Yat-wai's
psychological condition.

737
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,540
It's normal for young people
to drink and relax.

738
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,940
But he had an asthma attack.

739
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,180
Excuse me.

740
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:31,940
Thank you for your concern.

741
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,260
My client

742
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,940
[Eastern District Police Station]
has stated many times

743
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,620
that he has nothing to do

744
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,860
with the hit-and-run traffic accident.

745
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,420
But without conclusive evidence,

746
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,500
the police

747
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,500
still extended my client's detention

748
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,500
for no reason.

749
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,300
This is completely unreasonable.

750
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,620
It's obviously

751
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,380
an abuse of the judicial process.

752
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,660
My client

753
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,900
is innocent.

754
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,540
Does he deserve
to be treated differentially

755
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,100
just because he comes from the old town?

756
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,340
Have you found anything?

757
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,860
I found the detention center he's in,

758
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,900
but I couldn't find the name.

759
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,740
The police blocked the information.

760
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,380
No matter what,

761
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,180
someone must pay

762
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,980
for what they've done.

763
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,860
No longer than two minutes.

764
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:47,860
Fine.

765
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:50,500
Hello.

766
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,140
It's me.

767
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:52,820
Keung.

768
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,340
What's up?

769
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,820
Deal with someone for me.

770
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,220
I want him to suffer.

771
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,260
Who is it?

772
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,500
Someone from the old town.

773
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,180
No problem.

774
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,860
There won't be a problem, right?

775
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,860
It should be fine.

776
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,860
Let's see if God's on our side.

777
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,540
Just do parking work
with me in two years.

778
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,900
Don't get involved with drugs anymore.

779
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,340
Po.

780
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,060
You look upset.

781
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:05,900
What's wrong?

782
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,860
Your mother came for you?

783
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,060
Smile.

784
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,940
Let me know if you're upset.

785
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,340
It's an unfair world, after all.

786
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,780
Cheer up.

787
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,060
You brat.

788
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:22,700
